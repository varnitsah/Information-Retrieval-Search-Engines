remains                                          notes on luthers table talk 1  i cannot meditate too often too deeply or too devotionally on the personeity of god and his personality in the word greek gío to monogenei and thence on the individuity of the responsible creaturethat it is a perfection which not indeed in my intellect but yet in my habit of feeling i have too much confounded with that complexus of visual images cycles or customs of sensations and fellowtravelling circumstances as the ship to the mariner which make up our empirical self thence to bring myself to apprehend livelily the exceeding mercifulness and love of the act of the son of god in descending to seek after the prodigal children and to house with them in the sty likewise by the relation of my own understanding to the light of reason and the most important of all the truths that have been vouchsafed to me to the will which is the reasonwill in the form of reasoni can form a sufficient gleam of the possibility of the subsistence of the human soul in jesus to the eternal word and how it might perfect itself so as to merit glorification and abiding union with the divinity and how this gave a humanity to our lords righteousness no less than to his sufferings doubtless as god as the absolute alterity of the absolute he could not suffer but that he could not lay aside the absolute and by union with the creaturely become affectible and a second but spiritual adam and so as afterwards to be partaker of the absolute in the absolute even as the absolute had partaken of passion greek tou páschein and infirmity in it that is the finite and fallen creaturethis can be asserted only by one who unconsciously perhaps has accustomed himself to think of god as a thinghaving a necessity of constitution that wills or rather tends and inclines to this or that because it is this or that not as being that which is that which it wills to be such a necessity is truly compulsion nor is it in the least altered in its nature by being assumed to be eternal in virtue of an endless remotion or retrusion of the constituent cause which being manifested by the understanding becomes a foreseen despair of a cause  sunday 11th february 1826   one argument strikes me in favour of the tenet of apostolic succession in the ordination of bishops and presbyters as taught by the church of rome and by the larger part of the earlier divines of the church of england which i have not seen in any of the books on this subject namely that in strict analogy with other parts of christian history the miracle itself contained a check upon the inconvenient consequences necessarily attached to all miracles as miracles narrowing the possible claims to any rights not proveable at the bar of universal reason and experience every man among the sectaries however ignorant may justify himself in scattering stones and fire squibs by an alleged unction of the spirit the miracle becomes perpetual still beginning never ending now on the church doctrine the original miracle provides for the future recurrence to the ordinary and calculable laws of the human understanding and moral sense instead of leaving every man a judge of his own gifts and of his right to act publicly on that judgment the initiative alone is supernatural but all beginning is necessarily miraculous that is hath either no antecedent or one greek hetérou genous which therefore is not its but merely an antecedentor an incausative alien coincident in time as if for instance jacks shout were followed by a flash of lightning which should strike and precipitate the ball on st pauls cathedral this would be a miracle as long as no causative nexus was conceivable between the antecedent the noise of the shout and the consequent the atmospheric discharge   the epistle dedicatory    but this will be your glory and inexpugnable if you cleave in truth   and practice to gods holy service worship and religion that   religion and faith of the lord jesus christ which is pure and   undefiled before god even the father which is to visit the fatherless   and widows in their affliction and to keep yourselves unspotted from   the world    james i 27  few mistranslations unless indeed the word used by the translator of st james meant differently from its present meaning have led astray more than this rendering of greek thraeskeía outward or ceremonial worship cultus divine service by the english religion st james sublimely says what the ceremonies of the law were to morality that morality itself is to the faith in christ that is its outward symbol not the substance itself   chap i p 1 2    that the bible is the word of god said luther the same i prove as   followeth all things that have been and now are in the world also   how it now goeth and standeth in the world the same was written   altogether particularly at the beginning in the first book of moses   concerning the creation and even as god made and created it even so   it was even so it is and even so doth it stand to this present day   and although king alexander the great the kingdom of egypt the   empire of babel the persian grecian and roman monarchs the emperors   julius and augustus most fiercely did rage and swell against this   book utterly to suppress and destroy the same yet notwithstanding   they could prevail nothing they are all gone and vanished but this   book from time to time hath remained and will remain unremoved in   full and ample manner as it was written at the first  a proof worthy of the manly mind of luther and compared with which the grotian pretended demonstrations from grotius himself to paley are mischievous underminings of the faith pleadings fitter for an old bailey thieves counsellor than for a christian divine the true evidence of the bible is the bibleof christianity the living fact of christianity itself as the manifest archeus or predominant of the life of the planet   ib p 4    the art of the school divines said luther with their speculations in   the holy scriptures are merely vain and human cogitations spun out   of their own natural wit and understanding they talk much of the   union of the will and understanding but all is mere fantasy and   fondness the right and true speculation said luther is this   believe in christ do what thou oughtest to do in thy vocation c   this is the only practice in divinity also mystica theologia   dionysii is a mere fable and a lie like to platos fables omnia   sunt non ens et omnia sunt ens all is something and all is   nothing and so he leaveth all hanging in frivolous and idle sort  still however du theure mann gottes mein verehrter luther reason will understanding are words to which real entities correspond and we may in a sound and good sense say that reason is the ray the projected disk or image from the sun of righteousness an echo from the eternal wordthe light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world and that when the will placeth itself in a right line with the reason there ariseth the spirit through which the will of god floweth into and actuates the will of man so that it willeth the things of god and the understanding is enlivened and thenceforward useth the materials supplied to it by the senses symbolically that is with an insight into the true substance thereof   ib p 9    the pope usurpeth and taketh to himself the power to expound and to   construe the scriptures according to his pleasure what he saith must   stand and be spoken as from heaven therefore let us love and   preciously value the divine word that thereby we may be able to   resist the devil and his swarm  as often as i use in prayer the 16th verse of the 71st psalm in our prayerbook version my thoughts especially revert to the subject of the right appreciation of the scriptures and in what sense the bible may be called the word of god and how and under what conditions the unity of the spirit is translucent through the letter which read as the letter merely is the word of this and that pious but fallible and imperfect man alas for the superstition where the words themselves are made to be the spirit o might i live but to utter all my meditations on this most concerning point   ib p 12    bullinger said once in my hearing said luther that he was earnest   against the anabaptists as contemners of gods word and also against   those which attributed too much to the literal word for said he   such do sin against god and his almighty power as the jews did in   naming the ark god but said he whoso holdeth a mean between both   the same is taught what is the right use of the word and sacraments    whereupon said luther i answered him and said bullinger you err   you know neither yourself nor what you hold i mark well your tricks   and fallacies zuinglius and oecolampadius likewise proceeded too far   in the ungodly meaning but when brentius withstood them they then   lessened their opinions alleging they did not reject the literal   word but only condemned certain gross abuses by this your error you   cut in sunder and separate the word and the spirit c  in my present state of mind and with what light i now enjoymay god increase it and cleanse it from the dark mist into the lumen siccum of sincere knowledgei cannot persuade myself that this vehemence of our dear man of god against bullinger zuinglius and oecolampadius on this point could have had other origin than his misconception of what they intended but luther spoke often i like him and love him all the better therefor in his moods and according to the mood was not that a different mood in which he called st jamess epistle a jackstraw poppet and even in this work selects one verse as the best in the whole letterevidently meaning the only verse of any great value besides he accustomed himself to use the term the word in a very wide sense when the narrower would have cramped him when he was on the point of rejecting the apocalypse then the word meant the spirit of the scriptures collectively   ib p 21    i said luther do not hold that children are without faith when   they are baptized for inasmuch as they are brought to christ by his   command and that the church prayeth for them therefore without all   doubt faith is given unto them although with our natural sense and   reason we neither see nor understand it  nay but dear honoured luther is this fair if christ or scripture had said in one place believe and thou mayest be baptized and in another place baptize infants then we might perhaps be allowed to reconcile the two seemingly jarring texts by such words as faith is given to them although c but when no such text as the latter is to be found nor any one instance as a substitute then your conclusion seems arbitrary   ib p 25    this argument said luther concludeth so much as nothing for   although they had been angels from heaven yet that troubleth me   nothing at all we are now dealing about gods word and with the   truth of the gospel that is a matter of far greater weight to have   the same kept and preserved pure and clear therefore we said   luther neither care nor trouble ourselves for and about the   greatness of saint peter and the other apostles or how many and great   miracles they wrought the thing which we strive for is that the   truth of the holy gospel may stand for god regardeth not mens   reputations nor persons  oh that the dear man luther had but told us here what he meant by the term gospel that st paul had seen even st lukes is but a conjecture grounded on a conjectural interpretation of a single text doubly equivocal namely that the luke mentioned was the same with the evangelist luke and that the evangelium signified a book the latter of itself improbable derives its probability from the undoubtedly very strong probability of the former if then not any book much less the four books now called the four gospels were meant by paul but the contents of those books as far as they are veracious and whatever else was known on equal authority at that time though not contained in those books if in short the whole sum of christs acts and discourses be what paul meant by the gospel then the argument is circuitous and returns to the first pointwhat is the gospel shall we believe you and not rather the companions of christ the eye and ear witnesses of his doings and sayings now i should require strong inducements to make me believe that st paul had been guilty of such palpably false logic and i therefore feel myself compelled to infer that by the gospel paul intended the eternal truths known ideally from the beginning and historically realized in the manifestation of the word in christ jesus and that he used the ideal immutable truth as the canon and criterion of the oral traditions for example a greek mathematician standing in the same relation of time and country to euclid as that in which st paul stood to jesus christ might have exclaimed in the same spirit what do you talk to me of this that and the other intimate acquaintance of euclids my object is to convey the sublime system of geometry which he realized and by that must i decide i says st paul have been taught by the spirit of christ a teaching susceptible of no addition and for which no personal anecdotes however reverendly attested can be a substitute but dearest luther was a translator he could not must not see this   ib p 32    that gods word and the christian church is preserved against the   raging of the world    the papists have lost the cause with gods word they are not able to   resist or withstand us    the kings of the earth stand up and   the rulers take counsel together c god will deal well enough with   these angry gentlemen and will give them but small thanks for their   labor in going about to suppress his word and servants he hath sat   in counsel above these five thousand five hundred years hath ruled   and made laws good sirs be not so choleric go further from the   wall lest you knock your pates against it kiss the son lest he be   angry c that is take hold on christ or the devil will take hold   on you c    the second psalm said luther is a proud psalm against those   fellows it begins mild and simply but it endeth stately and   rattling    i have now angered the pope about his images of   idolatry o how the sow raiseth her bristles   the lord saith   ego suscitabo vos in novissimo die and then he will call and say   ho martin luther philip melancthon justus jonas john calvin c   arise come up    well on said luther let us be of good   comfort  a delicious paragraph how our fine preachers would turn up their tomtit beaks and flirt with their tails at it but this is the way in which the man of life the man of power sets the dry bones in motion   chap ii p 37    this is the thanks that god hath for his grace for creating for   redeeming sanctifying nourishing and for preserving us such a   seed fruit and godly child is the world o woe be to it  too true   ib p 54    that out of the best comes the worst    out of the patriarchs and holy fathers came the jews that crucified   christ out of the apostles came judas the traitor out of the city   alexandria where a fair illustrious and famous school was and from   whence proceeded many upright and godly learned men came arius and   origenes  poor origen surely luther was put to it for an instance and had never read the works of that very best of the old fathers and eminently upright and godly learned man   ib    the sparrows are the least birds and yet they are very hurtful and   have the best nourishment  ergo digni sunt omni persecutione poor little philip sparrows luther did not know that they more than earn their good wages by destroying grubs and other small vermin   ib p 61    he that without danger will know god and will speculate of him let   him look first into the manger that is let him begin below and let   him first learn to know the son of the virgin mary born at bethlehem   that lies and sucks in his mothers bosom or let one look upon him   hanging on the cross  but take good heed in any case of high   climbing cogitations to clamber up to heaven without this ladder   namely the lord christ in his humanity   to know god as god greek tòn zaena the living god we must assume his personality otherwise what were it but an ether a gravitation but to assume his personality we must begin with his humanity and this is impossible but in history for man is an historicalnot an eternal being ergo christianity is of necessity historical and not philosophical only   ib p 62    what is that to thee said christ to peter follow thou meme   follow me and not thy questions or cogitations  lord keep us looking to and humbly following thee   chap vi p 103    the philosophers and learned heathen said luther have described god   that he is as a circle the point whereof in the midst is every where   but the circumference which on the outside goeth round about is no   where herewith they would shew that god is all and yet is nothing  what a huge difference the absence of a blank space which is nothing or next to nothing may make the words here should have been printed god is all and yet is no thing for what does thing mean itself that is the ing or inclosure that which is contained within an outline or circumscribed so likewise to think is to inclose to determine confine and define to think an infinite is a contradiction in terms equal to a boundless bound so in german ding denken in latin res reor   chap vii p 113    helvidius alleged the mother of christ was not a virgin so that   according to his wicked allegation christ was born in original sin  o what a tangle of impure whimsies has this notion of an immaculate conception an ebionite tradition as i think brought into the christian church i have sometimes suspected that the apostle john had a particular view to this point in the first half of the first chapter of his gospel not that i suppose our present matthew then in existence or that if john had seen the gospel according to luke the christopædia had been already prefixed to it but the rumor might have been whispered about and as the purport was to give a psilanthropic explanation and solution of the phrases son of god and son of manso saint john met it by the true solution namely the eternal filiation of the word   ib p 120 of christs riding into jerusalem    but i hold said luther that christ himself did not mention that   prophecy of zechariah but rather that the apostles and evangelists   did use it for a witness  worth remembering for the purpose of applying it to the text in which our lord is represented in the first or matthews gospel and by that alone as citing daniel by name it was this text that so sorely but i think very unnecessarily perplexed and gravelled bentley who was too profound a scholar and too acute a critic to admit the genuineness of the whole of that book   ib    the prophets said luther did set speak and preach of the second   coming of christ in manner as we now do  i regret that mr irving should have blended such extravagancies and presumptuous prophesyings with his support and vindication of the millennium and the return of jesus in his corporeal individuality because these have furnished divines in general both churchmen and dissenting with a pretext for treating his doctrine with silent contempt had he followed the example of his own ben ezra and argued temperately and learnedly the controversy must have forced the momentous question on our clergyare christians bound to believe whatever an apostle believedand in the same way and sense i think saint paul himself lived to doubt the solidity of his own literal interpretation of our lords words  the whole passage in which our lord describes his coming is so evidently and so intentionally expressed in the diction and images of the prophets that nothing but the carnal literality common to the jews at that time and most strongly marked in the disciples who were among the least educated of their countrymen could have prevented the symbolic import and character of the words from being seen the whole gospel and the epistles of john are a virtual confutation of this reigning errorand no less is the apocalypse whether written by or under the authority of the evangelist  the unhappy effect which st pauls may i not say incautious language respecting christs return produced on the thessalonians led him to reflect on the subject and he instantly in the second epistle to them qualified the doctrine and never afterwards resumed it but on the contrary in the first epistle to the corinthians c 15 substitutes the doctrine of immortality in a celestial state and a spiritual body on the nature of our lords future epiphany or phenomenal person i am not ashamed to acknowledge that my views approach very nearly to those of emanuel swedenborg   ib p 121    doctor jacob schenck never preacheth out of his book but i do said   luther though not of necessity but i do it for examples sake to   others  as many notes memoranda cues of connection and transition as the preacher may find expedient or serviceable to him well and good but to read in a manuscript book as our clergy now do is not to preach at all preach out of a book if you must but do not read in it or even from it a read sermon of twenty minutes will seem longer to the hearers than a free discourse of an hour   ib    my simple opinion is said luther and i do believe that christ for us   descended into hell to the end he might break and destroy the same   as in psalm xvi and acts ii is shewed and proved  could luther have been ignorant that this clause was not inserted into the apostles creed till the sixth century after christ i believe the original intention of the clause was no more than vere mortuus estin contradiction to the hypothesis of a trance or state of suspended animation   chap vii p 122    when christ said luther forbiddeth to spread abroad or to make known   his works of wonder there he speaketh as being sent from the father   and doth well and right therein in forbidding them to the end that   thereby he might leave us an example not to seek our own praise and   honor in that wherein we do good but we ought to seek only and alone   the honor of god  not satisfactory doubtless the command was in connection with the silence enjoined respecting his messiahship   chap viii p 147    doctor hennage said to luther sir where you say that the holy spirit   is the certainty in the word towards god that is that a man is   certain of his own mind and opinion then it must needs follow that   all sects have the holy ghost for they will needs be most certain of   their doctrine and religion  luther might have answered positive you mean not certain   chap ix p 160    but who hath power to forgive or to detain sins answer the apostles   and all church servants and in case of necessity every christian   christ giveth them not power over money wealth kingdoms c but   over sins and the consciences of human creatures over the power of   the devil and the throat of hell  few passages in the sacred writings have occasioned so much mischief abject slavishness bloated pride tyrannous usurpation bloody persecution with kings even against their will the drudges false souldestroying quiet of conscience as this text john xx 23 misinterpreted it is really a tremendous proof of what the misunderstanding of a few words can do that even luther partook of the delusion this paragraph gives proof but that a delusion it is that the commission given to the seventy whom christ sent out to proclaim and offer the kingdom of god and afterwards to the apostles refers either to the power of making rules and ordinances in the church or otherwise to the gifts of miraculous healing which our lord at that time conferred on them and that per figuram causce pro effecto sins here mean diseases seems to me more than probable at all events the text surely does not mean that the salvation of a repentant and believing christian depends upon the will of a priest in absolution   ib p 161    and again they are able to absolve and make a human creature free and   loose from all his sins if in case he repenteth and believeth in   christ and on the contrary they are able to detain all his sina if   he doth not repent and believeth not in christ  in like manner if he sincerely repent and believe his sins are forgiven whether the minister absolve him or not now if m  5 5 and 5m  5 m  o if he be impenitent and unbelieving his sins are detained no doubt whether the minister do or do not detain them   ib p 163    adam was created of god in such sort righteous as that he became of a   righteous an unrighteous person as paul himself argueth and withall   instructeth himself where he saith the law is not given for a   righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient  this follows from the very definition or idea of righteousnessit is itself the lawgreek pas gàr díkais autonomos   ib    the scripture saith god maketh the ungodly righteous there he   calleth us all one with another despairing and wicked wretches for   what will an ungodly creature not dare to accomplish if he may but   have occasion place and opportunity  that is with a lust within correspondent to the temptation from without  a christians conscience methinks ought to be a janus bifronsa gospelface retrospective and smiling through penitent tears on the sins of the past and a mosesface looking forward in frown and menace frightening the harlot will into a holy abortion of sins conceived but not yet born perchance not yet quickened the fanatic antinomian reverses this for the past he requires all the horrors of remorse and despair till the moment of assurance thenceforward he may do what he likes for he cannot sin   ib p 165    all natural inclinations said luther are either against or without   god therefore none are good we see that no man is so honest as to   marry a wife only thereby to have children to love and to bring them   up in the fear of god  this is a very weak instance if a man had been commanded to marry by god being so formed as that no sensual delight accompanied and refused to do so unless this appetite and gratification were addedthen indeed   chap x p 168 9    ah lord god said luther why should we any way boast of our   freewill as if it were able to do anything in divine and spiritual   matters were they never so small    i confess that mankind hath a   freewill but it is to milk kine to build houses c and no   further for so long as a man sitteth well and in safety and sticketh   in no want so long he thinketh he hath a freewill which is able to   do something but when want and need appeareth that there is neither   to eat nor to drink neither money nor provision where is then the   free will it is utterly lost and cannot stand when it cometh to the   pinch but faith only standeth fast and sure and seeketh christ  luther confounds freewill with efficient power which neither does nor can exist save where the finite will is one with the absolute will that luther was practically on the right side in this famous controversy and that he was driving at the truth i see abundant reason to believe but it is no less evident that he saw it in a mist or rather as a mist with dissolving outline and as he saw the thing as a mist so he ever and anon mistakes a mist for the thing but erasmus and saavedra were equally indistinct and shallow and unsubstantial to boot in fact till the appearance of kants kritiques of the pure and of the practical reason the problem had never been accurately or adequately stated much less solved  26 june 1826   ib p 174    loving friends said luther our doctrine that freewill is dead and   nothing at all is grounded powerfully in holy scripture  it is of vital importance for a theological student to understand clearly the utter diversity of the lutheran which is likewise the calvinistic denial of freewill in the unregenerate and the doctrine of the modern necessitarians and proh pudor of the later calvinists which denies the proper existence of will altogether the former is sound scriptural compatible with the divine justice a new yea a mighty motive to morality and finally the dictate of common sense grounded on common experience the latter the very contrary of all these   chap xii p 187    this is now said luther the first instruction concerning the law   namely that the same must be used to hinder the ungodly from their   wicked and mischievous intentions for the devil who is an abbot and   a prince of this world driveth and allureth people to work all manner   of sin and wickedness for which cause god hath ordained magistrates   elders schoolmasters laws and statutes to the end if they cannot   do more yet at least that they may bind the claws of the devil and   to hinder him from raging and swelling so powerfully in those which   are his according to his will and pleasure    and said luther although thou hadst not committed this or that sin   yet nevertheless thou art an ungodly creature c but what is done   cannot he undone he that hath stolen let him henceforward steal no   more    secondly we use the law spiritually which is done in this manner   that it maketh the transgressions greater as saint paul saith that   is that it may reveal and discover to people their sins blindness   misery and ungodly doings wherein they were conceived and born   namely that they are ignorant of god and are his enemies and   therefore have justly deserved death hell gods judgments his   everlasting wrath and indignation saint paul said luther   expoundeth such spiritual offices and works of the law with many words    rom vii  nothing can be more sound or more philosophic than the contents of these two paragraphs they afford a sufficient answer to the pretence of the romanists and arminians that by the law st paul meant only the ceremonial law   ib p 189    and if moses had not cashiered and put himself out of his office and   had not taken it away with these words where he saith the lord thy   god will raise up unto thee another prophet out of thy brethren him   shall thou hear deut xviii who then at any time would or could   have believed the gospel and forsaken moses  if i could be persuaded that this passage deut xviii 1519 primarily referred to christ and that christ not joshua and his successors was the prophet here promised i must either become a unitarian psilanthrophist and join priestley and belshamor abandon to the jews their own messiah as yet to come and cling to the religion of john and paul without further reference to moses than to lycurgus solon and numa all of whom in their different spheres no less prepared the way for the coming of the lord the desire of the nations   ib p 190    it is therefore most evident said luther that the law can but only   help us to know our sins and to make us afraid of death now sins and   death are such things as belong to the world and which are therein  both in paul and luther names which i can never separatenot indeed peculiar to these for it is the same in the psalms ezekiel and throughout the scriptures but which i feel most in paul and luther there is one fearful blank the wisdom or necessity of which i do not doubt yet cannot help groping and straining after like one that stares in the dark and this is death the law makes us afraid of death what is deathan unhappy life who does not feel the insufficiency of this answer what analogy does immortal suffering bear to the only death which is known to us  since i wrote the above god has i humbly trust given me a clearer light as to the true nature of the death so often mentioned in the scriptures   ib    it is said luther a very hard matter yea an impossible thing for   thy human strength whosoever thou art without gods assistance that   at such a time when moses setteth upon thee with his law and   fearfully affrighteth thee accuseth and condemneth thee threateneth   thee with gods wrath and death thou shouldest as then be of such a   mind namely as if no law nor sin had ever been at any timei say   it is in a manner a thing impossible that a human creature should   carry himself in such a sort when he is and feeleth himself assaulted   with trials and temptations and when the conscience hath to do with   god as then to think no otherwise than that from everlasting nothing   hath been but only and alone christ altogether grace and deliverance  yea verily amen and amen for this short heroic paragraph contains the sum and substance the heighth and the depth of all true philosophy most assuredly right difficult it is for us while we are yet in the narrow chamber of death with our faces to the dusky falsifying lookingglass that covers the scant endside of the blind passage from floor to ceilingright difficult for us so wedged between its walls that we cannot turn round nor have other escape possible but by walking backward to understand that all we behold or have any memory of having ever beholden yea our very selves as seen by us are but shadows and when the forms that we loved vanish impossible not to feel as if they were real   ib p 197    nothing that is good proceedeth out of the works of the law except   grace be present for what we are forced to do the same goeth not   from the heart neither is acceptable  a law supposes a lawgiver and implies an actuator and executor and consequently rewards and punishments publicly announced and distinctly assigned to the deeds enjoined or forbidden and correlatively in the subjects of the law there are supposed first assurance of the being the power the veracity and seeingness of the lawgiver in whom i here comprise the legislative judicial and executive functions and secondly selfinterest desire hope and fear now from this view it is evident that the deeds or works of the law are themselves null and dead deriving their whole significance from their attachment or alligation to the rewards and punishments even as this diversely shaped and ink colored paper has its value wholly from the words or meanings which have been arbitrarily connected therewith or as a ladder or flight of stairs of a provisionloft or treasury if the architect or master of the house had chosen to place the storeroom or treasury on the ground floor the ladder or steps would have been useless the life is divided between the rewards and punishments on the one hand and the hope and fear on the other namely the active life or excitancy belongs to the former the passive life or excitability to the latter call the former the afficients the latter the affections the deeds being merely the signs or impresses of the former as the seal on the latter as the wax equally evident is it that the affections are wholly formed by the deeds which are themselves but the lifeless unsubstantial shapes of the actual forms formæ formantes namely the rewards and punishments now contrast with this the process of the gospel there the affections are formed in the first instance not by any reference to works or deeds but by an unmerited rescue from death liberation from slavish taskwork by faith gratitude love and affectionate contemplation of the exceeding goodness and loveliness of the saviour redeemer benefactor from the affections flow the deeds or rather the affections overflow in the deeds and the rewards are but a continuance and continued increase of the free grace in the state of the soul and in the growth and gradual perfecting of that state which are themselves gifts of the same free grace and one with the rewards for in the kingdom of christ which is the realm of love and intercommunity the joy and grace of each regenerated spirit becomes double and thereby augments the joys and the graces of the others and the joys and graces of all unite in eachchrist the head and by his spirit the bond or unitive copula of all being the spiritual sun whose entire image is reflected in every individual of the myriads of dewdrops while under the law the all was but an aggregate of subjects each striving after a reward for himself not as included in and resulting from the statebut as the stipulated wages of the taskwork as a loaf of bread may be the pay or bounty promised for the hewing of wood or the breaking of stones   ib    he said luther that will dispute with the devil c  queries  i abstractedly from and independently of all sensible substances and     the bodies wills faculties and affections of men has the devil     or would the devil have a personal selfsubsistence does he or     can he exist as a conscious individual agent or person should the     answer to this query be in the negative then  ii do there exist finite and personal beings whether with composite     and decomponible bodies that is embodied or with simple and     indecomponible bodies which is all that can be meant by     disembodied as applied to finite creatures so eminently wicked or     wicked and mischievous in so peculiar a kind as to constitute a     distinct genus of beings under the name of devils  iii is this second hypothesis compatible with the acts and functions     attributed to the devil in scripture o to have had these three     questions put by melancthon to luther and to have heard his reply   ib p 200    if said luther god should give unto us a strong and an unwavering   faith then we should he proud yea also we should at last contemn   him again if he should give us the right knowledge of the law then   we should be dismayed and fainthearted we should not know which way   to wind ourselves  the main reason is because in this instance the change in the relation constitutes the difference of the things a considered as acting ab extra on the selfish fears and desires of men is the law the same a acting ab intra as a new nature infused by grace as the mind of christ prompting to all obedience is the gospel yet what luther says is likewise very true could we reduce the great spiritual truths or ideas of our faith to comprehensible conceptions or for the thing itself is impossible fancy we had done so we should inevitably be proud vain asses   ib p 203    and as to know his works and actions is not yet rightly to know the   gospel for thereby we know not as yet that he hath overcome sin   death and the devil even so likewise it is not as yet to know the   gospel when we know such doctrine and commandments but when the   voice soundeth which saith christ is thine own with life with   doctrine with works death resurrection and with all that he hath   doth and may do  most true   ib p 205    the ancient fathers said distingue tempora et concordabis   scripturas distinguish the times then may we easily reconcile the   scriptures together  yea and not only so but we shall reconcile truths that seem to repeal this or that passage of scripture with the scriptures for christ is with his church even to the end   ib    i verily believe said luther it the abolition of the law vexed to   the heart the beloved st paul himself before his conversion  how dearly martin luther loved st paul how dearly would st paul have loved martin luther and how impossible that either should not have done so   ib    in this case touching the distinguishing the law from the gospel we   must utterly expel all human and natural wisdom reason and   understanding  all reason is above nature therefore by reason in luther or rather in his translator you must understand the reasoning facultythat is the logical intellect or the intellectual understanding for the understanding is in all respects a medial and mediate faculty and has therefore two extremities or poles the sensual in which form it is st pauls greek phrónaema sarkòs and the intellectual pole or the hemisphere as it were turned towards the reason now the reason lux idealis seu spiritualis shines down into the understanding which recognizes the light id est lumen a luce spirituali quasi alienigenum aliquid which it can only comprehend or describe to itself by attributes opposite to its own essential properties now these latter being contingency and for though the immediate objects of the understanding are genera et species still they are particular genera et species particularity it distinguishes the formal light lumen not the substantial light lux of reason by the attributes of the necessary and the universal and by irradiation of this lumen or shine the understanding becomes a conclusive or logical faculty as such it is greek lógos anthrôpinos   ib 206    when satan saith in thy heart god will not pardon thy sins nor be   gracious unto thee i pray said luther how wilt thou then as a poor   sinner raise up and comfort thyself especially when other signs of   gods wrath besides do beat upon thee as sickness poverty c and   that thy heart beginneth to preach and say behold here thou livest   in sickness thou art poor and forsaken of every one c  oh how true how affectingly true is this and when too satan the tempter becomes satan the accuser saying in thy heartthis sickness is the consequence of sin or sinful infirmity and thou hast brought thyself into a fearful dilemma thou canst not hope for salvation as long as thou continuest in any sinful practice and yet thou canst not abandon thy daily dose of this or that poison without suicide for the sin of thy soul has become the necessity of thy body daily tormenting thee without yielding thee any the least pleasurable sensation but goading thee on by terror without hope under such evidence of gods wrath how canst thou expect to be saved well may the heart cry out who shall deliver me from the body of this deathfrom this death that lives and tyrannizes in my body but the gospel answersthere is a redemption from the body promised only cling to christ call on him continually with all thy heart and all thy soul to give thee strength and be strong in thy weakness and what christ doth not see good to relieve thee from suffer in hope it may be better for thee to be kept humble and in selfabasement the thorn in the flesh may remain and yet the grace of god through christ prove sufficient for thee only cling to christ and do thy best in all love and welldoing gird thyself up to improve and use aright what remains free in thee and if thou doest ought aright say and thankfully believe that christ hath done it for thee o what a miserable despairing wretch should i become if i believed the doctrines of bishop jeremy taylor in his treatise on repentance or those i heard preached by dr if i gave up the faith that the life of christ would precipitate the remaining dregs of sin in the crisis of death and that i shall rise in purer capacity of christ blind to be irradiated by his light empty to be possessed by his fullness naked of merit to be clothed with his righteousness   ib p 207    the nobility the gentry citizens and farmers c are now become so   haughty and ungodly that they regard no ministers nor preachers and   said luther if we were not holpen somewhat by great princes and   persons we could not long subsist therefore isaiah saith well   and kings shall be their nurses c  corpulent nurses too often that overlay the babe distempered nurses that convey poison in their milk   chap xiii p 208    philip melancthon said to luther the opinion of st austin of   justification as it seemeth was more pertinent fit and convenient   when he disputed not than it was when he used to speak and dispute   for thus he saith we ought to censure and hold that we are justified   by faith that is by our regeneration or by being made new creatures   now if it be so then we are not justified only by faith but by all   the gifts and virtues of god given unto us now what is your opinion   sir do you hold that a man is justified by this regeneration as is   st austins opinion    luther answered and said i hold this and am certain that the true   meaning of the gospel and of the apostle is that we are justified   before god gratis for nothing only by gods mere mercy wherewith   and by reason whereof he imputeth righteousness unto us in christ  true but is it more than a dispute about words is not the regeneration likewise gratis only by gods mere mercy we according to the necessity of our imperfect understandings must divide and distinguish but surely justification and sanctification are one act of god and only different perspectives of redemption by and through and for christ they are one and the same plant justification the root sanctification the flower and may i not venture to add transubstantiation into christ the celestial fruit   ib p 21011 melancthons sixth reply    sir you say paul was justified that is was received to everlasting   life only for mercys sake against which i say if the piecemeal   or partial cause namely our obedience followeth not then we are not   saved according to these words woe is me if i preach not the   gospel 1 cor ix  luthers answer    no piecing or partial cause said luther approacheth thereupto for   faith is powerful continually without ceasing otherwise it is no   faith therefore what the works are or of what value the same they   are through the honor and power of faith which undeniably is the sun   or sunbeam of this shining  this is indeed a difficult question and one i am disposed to think which can receive its solution only by the idea or the act and fact of justification by faith selfreflected but humanly considered this position of luthers provokes the mind to ask is there no receptivity of faith considered as a free gift of god prerequisite in the individual does faith commence by generating the receptivity of itself if so there is no difference either in kind or in degree between the receivers and the rejectors of the word at the moment preceeding this reception or rejection and a stone is a subject as capable of faith as a man how can obedience exist where disobedience was not possible surely two or three texts from st paul detached from the total organismus of his reasoning ought not to outweigh the plain fact that the contrary position is implied in or is an immediate consequent of our lords own invitations and assurances every where a something is attributed to the will 2   chap xiii p 211    to conclude a faithful person is a new creature a new tree   therefore all these speeches which in the law are usual belong not   to this case as to say a faithful person must do good works   neither were it rightly spoken to say the sun shall shine a good   tree shall bring forth good fruit c for the sun shall not shine   but it doth shine by nature unbidden it is thereunto created  this important paragraph is obscure by the translators ignorance of the true import of the german soll which does not answer to our shall but rather to our ought that is should do this or thatis under an obligation to do it   ib p 213    and i my loving brentius to the end i may better understand this   case do use to think in this manner namely as if in my heart were   no quality or virtue at all which is called faith and love as the   sophists do speak and dream thereof but i set all on christ and   say my formalis justitia that is my sure my constant and   complete righteousness in which is no want nor failing but is as   before god it ought to be is christ my lord and saviour  aye this this is indeed to the purpose in this doctrine my soul can find rest i hope to be saved by faith not by my faith but by the faith of christ in me   ib p 214    the scripture nameth the faithful a people of gods saints but here   one may say the sins which daily we commit do offend and anger god   how then can we be holy    answer a mothers love to her child is much stronger than are the   excrements and scurf thereof even so gods love towards us is far   stronger than our filthiness and uncleanness    yea one may say again we sin without ceasing and where sin is   there the holy spirit is not therefore we are not holy because the   holy spirit is not in us who maketh holy    answer john xvi 14 now where christ is there is the holy   spirit the text saith plainly the holy ghost shall glorify me c   now christ is in the faithful although they have and feel sins do   confess the same and with sorrow of heart do complain thereover   therefore sins do not separate christ from those that believe  all in this page is true and necessary to be preached but o what need is there of holy prudence to preach it aright that is at right times to the right ears now this is when the doctrine is necessary and thence comfortable but where it is not necessary but only very comfortable in such cases it would be a narcotic poison killing the soul by infusing a stupor or counterfeit peace of conscience where there are no sinkings of selfabasement no griping sense of sin and worthlessness but perhaps the contrary reckless confidence and selfvaluing for good qualities supposed an overbalance for the sinsthere it is not necessary in short these are not the truths that can be preached greek eukaírôs akaírôs in season and out of season in declining life or at any time in the hour of sincere humiliation these truths may be applied in reference to past sins collectively but a christian must not a true however infirm christian will not cannot administer them to himself immediately after sinning least of all immediately before we ought fervently to pray thusmost holy and most merciful god by the grace of thy holy spirit make these promises profitable to me to preserve me from despairing of thy forgiveness through christ my saviour but o save me from presumptuously perverting them into a pillow for a stupified conscience give me grace so to contrast my sin with thy transcendant goodness and longsuffering love as to hate it with an unfeigned hatred for its own exceeding sinfulness   ib p 21920    faith is and consisteth in a persons understanding but hope   consisteth in the will   faith inditeth distinguisheth and   teacheth and it is the knowledge and acknowledgment   faith   fighteth against error and heresies it proveth censureth and judgeth   the spirits and doctrines   faith in divinity is the wisdom and   providence and belongeth to the doctrine   faith is the   dialectica for it is altogether wit and wisdom  luther in his postills discourseth far better and more genially of faith than in these paragraphs unfortunately the germans have but one word for faith and beliefglaube and what luther here says is spoken of belief of faith he speaks in the next article but one   ib p 226    that regeneration only maketh gods children    the article of our justification before god said luther is as it   useth to be with a son which is born an heir of all his fathers   goods and cometh not thereunto by deserts  i will here record my experience ever when i meet with the doctrine of regeneration and faith and free grace simply announcedso it isthen i believe my heart leaps forth to welcome it but as soon as an explanation nation or reason is added such explanations namely and reasonings as i have any where met with then my heart leaps back again recoils and i exclaim nay nay but not so  25th of september 1819   ib p 227    doctor carlestad said luther argueth thus true it is that faith   justifieth but faith is a work of the first commandment therefore it   justifieth as a work moreover all that the law commandeth the same   is a work of the law now faith is commanded therefore faith is a   work of the law again what god will have the same is commanded god   will have faith therefore faith is commanded    st paul said luther speaketh in such sort of the law that he   separateth it from the promise which is far another thing than the   law the law is terrestrial but the promise is celestial    god giveth the law to the end we may thereby be roused up and made   pliant for the commandments do go and proceed against the proud and   haughty which contemn gods gifts now a gift or present cannot be a   commandment    therefore we must answer according to this rule verba sunt   accipienda secundum subjectam materiam   st paul calleth that the   work of the law which is done and acted through the knowledge of the   law by a constrained will without the holy spirit so that the same is   a work of the law which the law earnestly requireth and strictly will   have done it is not a voluntary work but a forced work of the rod  and wherein did carlestad and luther differ not at all or essentially and irreconcilably according as the feeling of carlestad was if he meant the particular deed the latter if the total act the agent included then the former   chap xiv p 230    the love towards the neighbour said luther must be like a pure   chaste love between bride and bridegroom where all faults are   connived at covered and borne with and only the virtues regarded  in how many little escapes and cornerholes does the sensibility the fineness that of which refinement is but a counterfeit at best but a reflex the geniality of nature appear in this son of thunder o for a luther in the present age why charles 3 with the very handcuffs of his prejudices he would knock out the brains nay that is impossible but he would split the skulls of our cristogalli translate the word as you likefrench christians or coxcombs   ib p 2312    let witzell know said luther that davids wars and battles which   he fought were more pleasing to god than the fastings and prayings of   the best of the honestest and of the holiest monks and friars much   more than the works of our new ridiculous and superstitious friars  a cordial rich and juicy speech such as shaped itself into and lived anew in the gustavus adolphuses   chap xv p 2334    god most certainly heareth them that pray in faith and granteth when   and how he pleaseth and knoweth most profitable for them we must   also know that when our prayers tend to the sanctifying of his name   and to the increase and honor of his kingdom also that we pray   according to his will then most certainly he heareth but when we   pray contrary to these points then we are not heard for god doth   nothing against his name his kingdom and his will  then saith the understanding greek tò phrónaema sarkòs what doth prayer effect if aprayer  b and a  prayer  b prayer  o the attempt to answer this argument by admitting its invalidity relatively to god but asserting the efficacy of prayer relatively to the prayer or precant himself is merely staving off the objection a single step for this effect on the devout soul is produced by an act of god the true answer is prayer is an idea and ens spirituale out of the cognizance of the understanding  the spiritual mind receives the answer in the contemplation of the idea life as deitas diffusa we can set the life in efficient motion but not contrary to the form or type the errors and false theories of great men sometimes perhaps most often arise out of true ideas falsified by degenerating into conceptions or the mind excited to action by an inworking idea the understanding works in the same direction according to its kind and produces a counterfeit in which the mind rests  this i believe to be the case with the scheme of emanation in plotinus god is made a first and consequently a comparative intensity and matter the last the whole thence finite and thence its conceivability but we must admit a gradation of intensities in reality   chap xvi p 247    when governors and rulers are enemies to gods word then our duty is   to depart to sell and forsake all we have to fly from one place to   another as christ commandeth we must make and prepare no uproars nor   tumults by reason of the gospel but we must suffer all things  right but then it must be the lawful rulers those in whom the sovereign or supreme power is lodged by the known laws and constitution of the country where the laws and constitutional liberties of the nation are trampled on the subjects do not lose and are not in conscience bound to forego their right of resistance because they are christians or because it happens to be a matter of religion in which their rights are violated and this was luthers opinion whether if a popish czar shall act as our james ii acted the russian greekists would be justified in doing with him what the english protestants justifiably did with regard to james is a knot which i shall not attempt to cut though i guess the russians would by cutting their czars throat   ib    but no man will do this except he be so sure of his doctrine and   religion as that although i myself should play the fool and should   recant and deny this my doctrine and religion which god forbid he   notwithstanding therefore would not yield but say if luther or an   angel from heaven should teach otherwise let him be accursed  well and nobly said thou rare black swan this this is the church where this is found there is the church of christ though but twenty in the whole of the congregation and were twenty such in two hundred different places the church would be entire in each without this no church   ib p 248    and he sent for one of his chiefest privy councillors named lord   john von minkwitz and said unto him you have heard my father say   running with him at tilt that to sit upright on horseback maketh a   good tilter if therefore it be good and laudable in temporal tilting   to sit upright how much more is it now praiseworthy in gods cause to   sit to stand and to go uprightly and just  princely so shakspeare would have made a prince elector talk the metaphor is so grandly in character   chap xvii p 249    signa sunt subinde facta minora res autem et facta subinde   creverunt  a valuable remark as the substance waxed that is became more evident the ceremonial sign waned till at length in the eucharist the signum united itself with the significatum and became consubstantial the ceremonial sign namely the eating the bread and drinking the wine became a symbol that is a solemn instance and exemplification of the class of mysterious acts which we are or as christians should be performing daily and hourly in every social duty and recreation this is indeed to recreate the man in and by christ sublimely did the fathers call the eucharist the extension of the incarnation only i should have preferred the perpetuation and application of the incarnation   ib    a bare writing without a seal is of no force  metaphors are sorry logic especially metaphors from human and those too conventional usages to the ordinances of eternal wisdom   ib p 250    luther said no a christian is wholly and altogether sanctified     we must take sure hold on baptism by faith as then we shall be yea   already are sanctified in this sort david nameth himself holy  a deep thought strong meat for men it must not be offered for milk   chap xxi p 276    then i will declare him openly to the church and in this manner i   will say loving friends i declare unto you how that n n hath   been admonished first by myself in private afterwards also by two   chaplains thirdly by two aldermen and churchwardens and those of   the assembly yet notwithstanding he will not desist from his sinful   kind of life wherefore i earnestly desire you to assist and aid me   to kneel down with me and let us pray against him and deliver him   over to the devil  luther did not mean that this should be done all at once but that a day should be appointed for the congregation to meet for joint consultation and according to the resolutions passed to choose and commission such and such persons to wait on the offender and to exhort persuade and threaten him in the name of the congregation then if after due time allowed this proved fruitless to kneel down with the minister c surely were it only feasible nothing could be more desirable but alas it is not compatible with a church national the congregations of which are therefore not gathered nor elected or with a church established by law for law and discipline are mutually destructive of each other being the same as involuntary and voluntary penance   chap xxii p 290    wicliffe and huss opposed and assaulted the manner of life and   conversation in popedom but i chiefly do oppose and resist their   doctrine i affirm roundly and plainly that they teach not aright   thereto am i called i take the goose by the neck and set the knife   to the throat when i can maintain that the popes doctrine is false   which i have proved and maintained then i will easily prove and   maintain that their manner of life is evil  this is a remark of deep insight verum vere lutheranum   ib p 291    ambition and pride said luther are the rankest poison in the church   when they are possessed by preachers zuinglius thereby was misled   who did what pleased himself    he wrote ye honorable and good   princes must pardon me in that i give you not your titles for the   glass windows are as well illustrious as ye  one might fancy in the visionofmirza style that all the angry contemptuous haughty expressions of good and zealous men gallant staffofficers in the army of christ formed a rick of straw and stubble which at the last day is to be divided into more or fewer haycocks according to the number of kind and unfeignedly humble and charitable thoughts and speeches that had intervened and that these were placed in a pile leapfrog fashion in the narrow road to the gate of paradise and burst into flame as the zeal of the individual approachedso that he must leap over and through them now i cannot help thinking that this dear man of god heroic luther will find more opportunities of showing his agility and reach the gate in a greater sweat and with more blisters a parte post than his brother hero zuinglius i guess that the comments of the latter on the prophets will be found almost sterile in these tigerlilies and brimstone flowers of polemic rhetoric compared with the controversy of the former with our henry viii his replies to the popes bulls and the like  by the by the joke of the glass windows is lost in the translation the german for illustrious is durchlauchtig that is transparent or translucent   ib    when we leave to god his name his kingdom and will then will he also   give unto us our daily bread and will remit our sins and deliver us   from the devil and all evil only his honor he will have to himself  a brief but most excellent comment on the lords prayer   ib p 297    there was never any that understood the old testament so well as st   paul except only john the baptist  i cannot conjecture what luther had in his mind when he made this exception   chap xxvii p 335    i could wish said luther that the princes and states of the empire   would make an assembly and hold a council and a union both in   doctrine and ceremonies so that every one might not break in and run   on with such insolency and presumption according to his own brains as   already is begun whereby many good hearts are offended  strange heart of man would luther have given up the doctrine of justification by faith alone had the majority of the council decided in favor of the arminian scheme if not by what right could he expect oecolampadius or zuinglius to recant their convictions respecting the eucharist or the baptists theirs on infant baptism to the same authority in fact the wish expressed in this passage must be considered as a mere flying thought shot out by the mood and feeling of the moment a sort of conversational flyingfish that dropped as soon as the moisture of the fins had evaporated the paragraph in p 336 of what councils ought to order should be considered luthers genuine opinion   ib p 337    the council of nice held after the apostles time said luther was   the very best and purest but soon after in the time of the emperor   constantine it was weakened by the arians  what arius himself meant i do not know what the modern arians teach i utterly condemn but that the great council of ariminum was either arian or heretical i could never discover or descry any essential difference between its decisions and the nicene though i seem to find a serious difference of the pseudoathanasian creed from both if there be a difference between the councils of nicea and ariminum it perhaps consists in thisthat the nicene was the more anxious to assert the equal divinity in the filial subordination the ariminian to maintain the filial subordination in the equal divinity in both there are three selfsubsistent and only one selforiginatedwhich is the substance of the idea of the trinity as faithfully worded as is compatible with the necessary inadequacy of words to the expression of ideas that is spiritual truths that can only be spiritually discerned 4  18th august 1826   chap xxviii p 347    gods word a lord of all lords  luther every where identifies the living word of god with the written word and rages against bullinger who contended that the latter is the word of god only as far as and for whom it is the vehicle of the former to this luther replies my voice the vehicle of my words does not cease to be my voice because it is ignorantly or maliciously misunderstood yea might bullinger have rejoined the instance were applicable and the argument valid if we were previously assured that all and every part of the old and new testament is the voice of the divine word but except by the spirit whence are we to ascertain this not from the books themselves for not one of them makes the pretension for itself and the two or three texts which seem to assert it refer only to the law and the prophets and no where enumerate the books that were given by inspiration and how obscure the history of the formation of the canon and how great the difference of opinion respecting its different parts what scholar is ignorant   chap xxix p 349    patres quamquam sæpe errant tamen venerandi propter testimonium   fidei  although i learn from all this chapter that luther was no great patrician indeed he was better employed yet i am nearly if not wholly of his mind respecting the works of the fathers those which appear to me of any great value are valuable chiefly for those articles of christian faith which are as it were ante christum jesum namely the trinity and the primal incarnation spoken of by john i 10 but in the main i should perhaps go even farther than luther for i cannot conceive any thing more likely than that a young man of strong and active intellect who has no fears or suffers no fears of worldly prudence to cry halt to him in his career of consequential logic and who has been innutritus et juratus in the grotiopaleyan scheme of christian evidence and who has been taught by the men and books which he has been bred up to regard as authority to consider all inward experiences as fanatical delusionsi say i can scarcely conceive such a young man to make a serious study of the fathers of the first four or five centuries without becoming either a romanist or a deist let him only read petavius and the different patristic and ecclesiastico historical tracts of semler and have no better philosophy than that of locke no better theology than that of arminius and bishop jeremy taylor and i should tremble for his belief yet why tremble for a belief which is the very antipode of faith better for such a man to precipitate himself on to the utmost goal for then perhaps he may in the repose of intellectual activity feel the nothingness of his prize or the wretchedness of it and then perhaps the inward yearning after a religion may make him askhave i not mistaken the road at the outset am i sure that the reformers luther and the rest collectively were fanatics   ib p 351    take no care what ye shall eat as though that commandment did not   hinder the carping and caring for the daily bread  for caring read anxiety sit tibi curæ non autem solicitudini panis quotidianus   ib p 351    even so it was with ambrose he wrote indeed well and purely was more   serious in writing than austin who was amiable and mild      fulgentius is

mr j hookham frere speak highly of fulgentius   ib p 352    for the fathers were but men and to speak the truth their reputes   and authorities did undervalue and suppress the books and writings of   the sacred apostles of christ  we doubtless find in the writings of the fathers of the second century and still more strongly in those of the third passages concerning the scriptures that seem to say the same as we protestants now do but then we find the very same phrases used of writings not apostolic or with no other difference than what the greater name of the authors would naturally produce just as a platonist would speak of speusippuss books were they extant compared with those of later teachers of platonismhe was platos nephewhad seen platowas his appointed successor c but in inspiration the early christians as far as i can judge made no generic difference let lardner say what he will can he disprove that it was declared heretical by the church in the second century to believe the written words of a dead apostle in opposition to the words of a living bishop seeing that the same spirit which guided the apostles dwells in and guides the bishops of the church this at least is certain that the later the age of the writer the stronger the expression of comparative superiority of the scriptures the earlier on the other hand the more we hear of the symbolum the regula fidei the creed   chap xxxii p 362    the history of the prophet jonas is so great that it is almost   incredible yea it soundeth more strange than any of the poets   fables and said luther if it stood not in the bible i should take   it for a lie  it is quite wonderful that luther who could see so plainly that the book of judith was an allegoric poem should have been blind to the book of jonas being an apologue in which jonah means the israelitish nation   ib p 364    for they entered into the garden about the hour at noon day and   having appetites to eat she took delight in the

form of ordination in which a series of candidates made their prayers and profession in the open temple before they went to the several synagogues in the country   ib    but said luther i say he did well and right thereon for the office   of a magistrate is to punish the guilty and wicked malefactors he   made a vow indeed not to punish him but that is to be understood   so long as david lived  o luther luther ask your own heart if this is not jesuit morality   chap xxxiii v 367    i believe said luther the words of our christian belief were in such   sort ordained by the apostles who were together and made this sweet   symbolum so briefly and comfortable  it is difficult not to regret that luther had so superficial a knowledge of ecclesiastical antiquities for example his belief in this fable of the creed having been a picnic contribution of the twelve apostles each giving a sentence whereas nothing is more certain than that it was the gradual product of three or four centuries   chap xxxiv p 369    an angel said luther is a spiritual creature created by god without   a body for the service of christendom especially in the office of the   church  what did luther mean by a body for to me the word seemeth capable of two senses universal and specialfirst a form indicating to a b c c the existence and finiteness of some one other being demonstrative as hic and disjunctive as hic et non ille and in this sense god alone can be without body secondly that which is not merely hic distinctive but divisive yea a product divisible from the producent as a snake from its skin a precipitate and death of living power and in this sense the body is proper to mortality and to be denied of spirits made perfect as well as of the spirits that never fell from perfection and perhaps of those who fell below mortality namely the devils  but i am inclined to hold that the devil has no one body nay no body of his own but ceaselessly usurps or counterfeits bodies for he is an everlasting liar yea the lie which is the colored shadow of the substance that intercepts the truth   ib p 370    the devils are in woods in waters in wildernesses and in dark pooly   places ready to hurt and prejudice people c    the angels like a flea     the devil is a bore   no matter for that quoth stc     i love him the better therefore  yes heroic swan i love thee even when thou gabbiest like a goose for thy geese helped to save the capitol   ib p 371    i do verily believe said luther that the day of judgment draweth   near and that the angels prepare themselves for the fight and combat   and that within the space of a few hundred years they will strike down   both turk and pope into the bottomless pit of hell  yea two or three more such angels as thyself martin luther and thy prediction would be or perhaps would now have been accomplished   chap xxxv p 388    cogitations of the understanding do produce no melancholy but the   cogitations of the will cause sadness as when one is grieved at a   thing or when one doth sigh and complain there are melancholy and   sad cogitations but the understanding is not melancholy  even in luthers lowest imbecilities what gleams of vigorous good sense had he understood the nature and symptoms of indigestion together with the detail of subjective seeing and hearing and the existence of midstates of the brain between sleeping and waking luther would have been a greater philosopher but would he have been so great a hero i doubt it praised be god whose mercy is over all his works who bringeth good out of evil and manifesteth his wisdom even in the follies of his servants his strength in their weakness   ib p 389    whoso prayeth a psalm shall be made thoroughly warm  expertus credo  19th aug 1826  i have learnt to interpret for myself the imprecating verses of the psalms of my inward and spiritual enemies the old adam and all his corrupt menials and thus i am no longer as i used to be stopped or scandalized by such passages as vindictive and antichristian   ib    the devil said luther oftentimes objected and argued against me the   whole cause which through gods grace i lead he objecteth also   against christ but better it were that the temple brake in pieces   than that christ should therein remain obscure and hid  sublime   ib    in job are two chapters concerning behemoth the whale that by   reason of him no man is in safety   these are colored words and   figures whereby the devil is signified and showed  a slight mistake of brother martins the behemoth of job is beyond a doubt neither whale nor devil but i think the hippopotamus who is indeed as ugly as the devil and will occasionally play the devil among the ricegrounds but though in this respect a devil of a fellow yet on the whole he is too honest a monster to be a fellow of devils vindiciæ behemoticæ   chap xxxvi p 390    of witchcraft  it often presses on my mind as a weighty argument in proof of at least a negative inspiration an especial restraining grace in the composition of the canonical books that though the writers individually did the greater number at least most probably believe in the objective reality of witchcraft yet no such direct assertions as these of luthers which would with the vast majority of christians have raised it into an article of faith are to be found in either testament that the ob and oboth of moses are no authorities for this absurd superstition has been unanswerably shewn by webster 5   chap xxxvii p 398    to conclude said luther i never yet knew a troubled and perplexed   man that was right in his own wits  a sound observation of great practical utility edward irving should be aware of this in dealing with consciencetroubled but in fact fancyvexed women   ib    it was not a thorn in the flesh touching the unchaste love he bore   towards tecla as the papists dream  i should like to know how high this strange legend can be traced the other tradition that st paul was subject to epileptic fits has a less legendary character the phrase thorn in the flesh is scarcely reconcilable with luthers hypothesis otherwise than as doubts of the objectivity of his vision and of his after revelations may have been consequences of the disease whatever that might be   ib p 399    our lord god doth like a printer who setteth the letters backwards   we see and feel well his setting but we shall see the print yonder in   the life to come  a beautiful simile add that even in this world the lives especially the autobiographies of eminent servants of christ are like the lookingglass or mirror which reversing the types renders them legible to us   ib p 403    indignus sum sed dignus fuicreari a deo c although i am   unworthy yet nevertheless i have been worthy in that i am   created

so full of stains     what delight or hope remains   ib p 404    the chiefest physic for that disease but very hard and difficult it   is to be done is that they firmly hold such cogitations not to be   theirs but that most sure and certain they come of the devil  more and more i understand the immense difference between the faitharticle of the devil greek tou ponaeroù and the superstitious fancy

the   honor of christ and the gospel that they would be enemies to erasmus   roterodamus for he is a devaster of religion do but read only his   dialogue de peregrinatione where you will see how he derideth and   flouteth the whole religion and at last concludeth out of single   abominations that he rejecteth religion c  religion here means the vows and habits of the religious or those bound to a particular lifethe monks friars nuns in short the regulars in contradistinction from the laity and the secular clergy   ib p 432    erasmus can do nothing but cavil and flout he cannot confute if   said luther i were a papist so could i easily overcome and beat   him for although he flouteth the pope with his ceremonies yet he   neither hath confuted nor overcome him no enemy is beaten nor   overcome with mocking jeering and flouting  most true but it is an excellent pioneer and an excellent corps de reserve cavalry for pursuit and for clearing the field of battle and in the first use luther was greatly obliged to erasmus but such utter unlikes cannot but end in dislikes and so it proved between erasmus and luther erasmus might the protestants say wished no good to the church of rome and still less to our party it was with him rot her and dam us   chap xlviii p 442    davids example is full of offences that so holy a man chosen of   god should fall into such great abominable sins and blasphemies   when as before he was very fortunate and happy of whom all the   bordering kingdoms were afraid for god was with him  if any part of the old testament be typical the whole life and character of david from his birth to his death are eminently so and accordingly the history of david and his psalms which form a most interesting part of his history occupies as large a portion of the old testament as all the others the type is twofoldnow of the messiah now of the church and of the church in all its relations persecuted victorious backsliding penitent nb i do not find david charged with any vices though with heavy crimes so it is with the church vices destroy its essence   ib    the same was a strange kind of offence said luther that the world   was offended at him who raised the dead who made the blind to see   and the deaf to hear c  our lord alluded to the verse that immediately follows and completes his quotations from isaiah 6 i jehovah will come and do this that he implicitly declared himself the jehovah the wordthis was the offence   chap xlix p 443    god wills may one say that we should serve him freewillingly but he   that serveth god out of fear of punishment of hell or out of a hope   and love of recompence the same serveth and honoreth god not freely   therefore such a one serveth god not uprightly nor truly    answer this argument said luther is stoical c  a truly wise paragraph pity it was not expounded god will accept our imperfections where their face is turned toward him on the road to the glorious liberty of the gospel   chap l p 446    it is the highest grace and gift of god to have an honest a   godfearing housewifely consort c but god thrusteth many into the   state of matrimony before they be aware and rightly bethink   themselves    the state of matrimony said luther is the chiefest state in the   world after religion c  alas alas this is the misery of it that so many wed and so few are christianly married but even in this the analogy of matrimony to the religion of christ holds good for even such is the proportion of nominal to actual christiansall christened how few baptized but in true matrimony it is beautiful to consider how peculiarly the marriage state harmonizes with the doctrine of justification by free grace through faith alone the little quarrels the imperfections on both sides the occasional frailties yield to the one thoughtthere is love at the bottom if sickness or other sorer calamity visit me how would the love then blaze forth the faults are there but they are not imprinted the prickles the acrid rind the bitterness or sourness are transformed into the ripe fruit and the foreknowledge of this gives the name and virtue of the ripe fruit to the fruit yet green on the bough   ib p 447    the causers and founders of matrimony are chiefly gods commandments   c it is a state instituted by god himself visited by christ in   person and presented with a glorious present for god said it is   not good that the man should be alone therefore the wife should be a   help to the husband to the end that human generations may be   increased and children nurtured to gods honour and to the profit of   people and countries also to keep our bodies in sanctification  add and in mutual reverence our spirits in a state of love and tenderness and our imaginations pure and tranquil  in a word matrimony not only preserveth human generations so that the same remain continually but it preserveth the generations human   ib p 450    in the synod at leipzig the lawyers concluded that secret contractors   should be punished with banishment and be disinherited whereupon   said luther i sent them word that i would not allow thereof it were   too gross a proceeding c but nevertheless i hold it fitting that   those which in such sort do secretly contract themselves ought   sharply to be reproved yea also in some measure severely punished  what a sweet union of prudence and kind nature scold them sharply and perhaps let them smart a while for their indiscretion and disobedience and then kiss and make it up remembering that young folks will be young folks and that love has its own law and logic   chap lix p 481    the presumption and boldness of the sophists and schooldivines is a   very ungodly thing which some of the fathers also approved of and   extolled namely of spiritual significations in the holy scripture   whereby she is pitifully tattered and torn in pieces it is an apish   work in such sort to juggle with holy scripture it is no otherwise   than if i should discourse of physic in this manner the fever is a   sickness rhubarb is the physic the fever signified the sins  rhubarb is jesus christ c    who seeth not here said luther that such significations are mere   juggling tricks even so and after the same manner are they deceived   that say children ought to be baptized again because they had not   faith  for the life of me i cannot find the even so in this sentence the watchman cries halfpast three oclock even so and after the same manner the great cham of tartary has a carbuncle on his nose   chap lx p 483    george in the greek tongue is called a builder that buildeth   countries and people with justice and righteousness c  a mistake for a tiller or boor from bauer bauen the latter hath two senses to build and to bring into cultivation   chap lxx p 503    i am now advertised said luther that a new astrologer is risen who   presumeth to prove that the earth moveth and goeth about not the   firmament the sun and moon nor the stars like as when one who   sitteth in a coach or in a ship and is moved thinketh he sitteth   still and resteth but the earth and the trees go run and move   themselves therefore thus it goeth when we give up ourselves to our   own foolish fancies and conceits this fool will turn the whole art of   astronomy upsidedown but the scripture sheweth and teacheth him   another lesson when joshua commanded the sun to stand still and not   the earth  there is a similar but still more intolerant and contemptuous anathema of the copernican system in sir thomas brown almost two centuries later than luther  though the problem is of no difficult solution for reflecting minds yet for the reading many it would be a serviceable work to bring together and exemplify the causes of the extreme and universal credulity that characterizes sundry periods of history for example from ad 1400 to ad 1650 and credulity involves lying and delusionfor by a seeming paradox liars are always credulous though credulous persons are not always liars although they most often are  it would be worth while to make a collection of the judgments of eminent men in their generation respecting the copernican or pythagorean scheme one writer i forget the name inveighs against it as popery and a popish stratagem to reconcile the minds of men to transubstantiation and the mass for if we may contradict the evidence of our senses in a matter of natural philosophy a fortiori or much more may we be expected to do so in a matter of faith  in my noetic or doctrine and discipline of ideas  logice organoni purpose to select some four five or more instances of the sad effects of the absence of ideas in the use of words and in the understanding of truths in the different departments of life for example the word body in connection with resurrectionmen cand the last instances will please god be the sad effects on the whole system of christian divinity i must remember asgills book 7  religion necessarily as to its main and proper doctrines consists of ideas that is spiritual truths that can only be spiritually discerned and to the expression of which words are necessarily inadequate and must be used by accommodation hence the absolute indispensability of a christian life with its conflicts and inward experiences which alone can make a man to answer to an opponent who charges one doctrine as contradictory to anotheryes it is a contradiction in terms but nevertheless so it is and both are true nay parts of the same truthbut alas besides other evils there is thisthat the gospel is preached in fragments and what the hearer can recollect of the sum total of these is to be his christian knowledge and belief this is a grievous error first labour to enlighten the hearer as to the essence of the christian dispensation the grounding and pervading idea and then set it forth in its manifold perspective its various stages and modes of manifestation in this as in almost all other qualities of a preacher of christ luther after paul and john is the great master none saw more clearly than he that the same proposition which addressed to a christian in his first awakening out of the death of sin was a most wholesome nay a necessary truth would be a most condemnable antinomian falsehood if addressed to a secure christian boasting and trusting in his faithyes in his own faith instead of the faith of christ communicated to him  i cannot utter how dear and precious to me are the contents of pages 197199 to line 17 of this work more particularly the

me so much by this way that he   vouchsafed me the favor to give me quiet prayer and sometimes it came   so far as to arrive at union though i understood neither the one nor   the other nor how much they both deserve to be prized but i believe   it would have been a great deal of happiness for me to have understood   them true it is that this union rested with me for so short a time   that perhaps it might arrive to be but as of an ave maria yet i   remained with so very great effects thereof that with not being then   so much as twenty years old methought i found the whole world under   my feet    dreams the soul herself forsaking   fearful raptures childlike mirth   silent adorations making   a blessed shadow of this earth   ib chap v p 24    i received also the blessed sacrament with many tears though yet in   my opinion they were not shed with that sense and grief for only my   having offended god which might have served to save my soul if the   error into which i was brought by them who told me that some things   were not mortal sins which afterward i saw plainly that they were   might not somewhat bestead me  methinks that without doubt my   soul might have run a hazard of not being saved if i had died then  can we wonder that some poor hypochondriasts and epileptics have believed themselves possessed by or rather to be the devil himself and so spoke in this imagined character when this poor afflicted spotless innocent could be so pierced through with fanatic preconceptions as to talk in this manner of her mortal sins and their probable eternal punishmentand this too under the most fervent sense of gods love and mercy   ib p 43    true it is that i am both the most weak and the most wicked of any   living   what is the meaning of these words that occur so often in the works of great saints do they believe them literally or is it a specific suspension of the comparing power and the memory vouchsafed them as a gift of gracea gift of telling a lie without breach of veracitya gift of humility indemnifying pride   ib chap viii p 44    i have not without cause been considering and reflecting upon this   life of mine so long for i discern well enough that nobody will have   gust to look upon a thing so very wicked  again can this first sentence be other than madness or a lie for observe the question is not whether teresa was or was not positively very wicked but whether according to her own scale of virtue she was most and very wicked comparatively see post chap x p 578  that relatively to the command be ye perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and before the eye of his own pure reason the best of men may deem himself mere folly and imperfection i can easily conceive but this is not the case in question it is here a comparison of one man with all others of whom he has known or heardergo a matter of experience and in this sense it is impossible without loss of memory and judgment on the one hand or of veracity and simplicity on the other besides of what use is it to draw off our conscience from the relation between ourselves and the perfect ideal appointed for our imitation to the vain comparison of one individual self with other men will their sins lessen mine though they were greater does not every man stand or fall to his own maker according to his own being   ib p 45    i see not what one thing there is of so many as are to be found in the   whole world wherein there is need of a greater courage than to treat   of committing treason against a king and to know that he knows it   well and yet never to go out of his presence for howsoever it be   very true that we are always in the presence of god yet methinks that   they who converse with him in prayer are in his presence after a more   particular manner for they are seeing then that he sees them whereas   others may perhaps remain some days in his presence yet without   remembering that he looks upon them  a very pretty and sweet remark truth in new feminine beauty  in fine  how incomparably educated was teresa for a mystic saint a mother of transports and fusions of spirit  1 a woman  2 of rank and reared delicately  3 a spanish lady  4 with very pious parents and sisters  5 accustomed in early childhood to read with most believing heart all the legends of saints martyrs spanish martyrs who fought against the moors  6 in the habit of privately without the knowledge of the superstitious father reading books of chivalry to her mother and then all night to herself  7 then her spanish sweethearting doubtless in the true oroondates styleand with perfect innocence as far as appears and this giving of audience to a dying swain through a grated window on having received a lovers messages of flames and despair with her aversion at fifteen or sixteen years of age to shut herself up for ever in a strict nunnery appear to have been those mortal sins of which she accuses herself added perhaps to a few warm fancies of earthly love  8 a frame of exquisite sensibility by nature rendered more so by a burning fever which no doubt had some effect upon her brain as she was from that time subject to frequent fainting fits and deliquia  9 frightened at her uncles by reading to him dantes books of hell and judgment she confesses that she at length resolved on nunhood because she thought it could not be much worse than purgatoryand that purgatory here was a cheap expiation for hell for ever  10 combine these and i have proceeded no further than the eleventh page of her life and think how impossible it was but that such a creature so innocent and of an imagination so heated and so well peopled should often mistake the first not painful and in such a frame often pleasurable approaches to deliquium for divine raptures and join the instincts of nature acting in the body of a mind unconscious of them in the keenly sensitive body of a mind so loving and so innocent and what remains to be solved which the stupidity of most and the roguery of a few would not simply explain  11 one source it is almost criminal to have forgotten and which p 12 of the first part brought back to my recollection i mean the effectsso supersensual that they may easily and most venially pass for supernatural so very glorious to human nature that though in truth they are humanity itself in the contradistinguishing sense of that awful word it is yet no wonder that conscious of the sore weaknesses united in one person with this one nobler nature we attribute them to a divinity out of us a mistake of the sensuous imagination in its misapplication of space and place rather than a misnomer of the thing itself for it is verily greek ho theòs en haemin ho oikeios theós the effects i mean of the moral force after conquest the state of the whole being after the victorious struggle in which the will has preserved its perfect freedom by a vehement energy of perfect obedience to the pure or practical reason or conscience thence flows in upon and fills the soul that peace which passeth understanding a state affronted and degraded by the name of pleasure injured and misrepresented even by that of happiness the very corner stone of that morality which cannot even in thought be distinguished from religion and which seems to mean religion as long as the instinctive craving dim and dark though it may be of the moral sense after this unknown state known only by the bitterness where it is not shall remain in human nature under all forms of positive or philosophic religion it has developed itself too glorious an attribute of man to be confined to any name or sect but which it is but truth and historical fact to say is more especially fostered and favoured by christianity and its frequent appearance even under the most selfish and unchristian forms of christianity is a stronger evidence of the divinity of that religion than all the miracles of brahma and veeshnou could afford even though they were supported with tenfold the judicial evidence of the gospel miracles 2    footnote 1 the works of the holy mother st teresa of jesus foundress of the reformation of the discalced

here i must add a passage concerning which i am in doubt whether it   reflected more on the sincerity or on the understanding of the   english ambassador the breach between the pope and the republic was   brought very near a crisis c  these pages contain a weak and unhandsome attack on wotton who doubtless had discovered that the presentation of the premonition previously to the reconciliation as publicly completed but after it had been privately agreed on between the court of rome and the senate of venice would embarrass the latter whereas delivered as it was it shewed the kings and his ministers zeal for protestantism and yet supplied the venetians with an answer not disrespectful to the king besides what is there in wottons whole life a man so disinterested and who retired from all his embassies so poor to justify the remotest suspicion of his insincerity what can this word mean less or other than that sir h w was either a cryptpapist or had received a bribe from the romish party horrid accusationsburnet was notoriously rash and credulous but i remember no other instance in which his zeal for the reformation joined with his credulity has misled him into so gross a calumny it is not to be believed that bedell gave any authority to such an aspersion of his old and faithful friend and patron further than that he had related the fact and that he and the minister differed in opinion as to the prudence of the measure recommended how laxly too the story is narrated the exact date of the recommendation by father paul and the divines should have been giventhen the date of the public annunciation of the reconciliation between the pope and venetian republic and lastly the day on which wotton did present the bookfor even this burnet leaves uncertain   p 26    it is true he never returned and changed his religion himself but his   son came from spain into ireland when bedell was promoted to the   bishopric of kilmore there and told him that his father commanded   him to thank him for the pains he was at in writing it he said it   was almost always lying open before him and that he had heard him   say he was resolved to save one and it seems he instructed his son   in the true religion for he declared himself a protestant on his   coming over  southey has given me a bad character of this son of the unhappy convert to the romish church he became it seems a spy on the roman catholics availing himself of his fathers character among them a crime which would indeed render his testimony null and more than null it would be a presumption of the contrary it is clear from his letters to bedell that the convert was a very weak man i owe to him however a complete confirmation of my old persuasion concerning bishop hall whom from my first perusal of his works i have always considered as one of the blots alas there are too many of the biography of the church of england a selfconceited coarseminded persecuting vulgar priest and by way of anticlimax one of the first corrupters of and epigrammatizers of our english prose style it is not true that sir thomas brown was the prototype of dr johnson who imitated him only as far as sir t b resembles the majority of his predecessors that is in the pedantic preference of latin derivations to saxon words of the very same force in the balance and construction of his periods dr johnson has followed hall as any intelligent reader will discover by an attentive comparison   p 158    yea will some man say but that which marreth all is the opinion of   merit and satisfaction indeed that is the school doctrine but the   conscience enlightened to know itself will easily act that part of   the publican who smote his breast and said god be merciful to me a   sinner  alas so far from this being the case with ninety nine out of one hundred in spain italy sicily and roman catholic germany it is the gospel tenets that are the true school doctrine that is confined to books and closets of the learned among them   p 161    and the like may be conceived here since especially the idolatry   practised under the obedience of mystical babylon is rather in false   and willworship of the true god and rather commended as profitable   than enjoined as absolutely necessary and the corruptions there   maintained are rather in a superfluous addition than retraction in any   thing necessary to salvation  this good mans charity jarring with his love and tender recollections of father paul fulgentio and the venetian divines has led him to a far far too palliative statement of roman idolatry not what the pope has yet ventured to thunder forth from his antisinai but what he and his satellites the regulars enforce to the preclusion of all true worship in the actual practice lifelong of an immense majority in spain italy bavaria austria c cthis must determine the point what they are themselvesnot what they would persuade protestants is their essentials or faiththis is the main thing   p 164    i answer under correction of better judgments they have the ministry   of reconciliation by the communion which is given at their ordination   being the same which our saviour left in his churchwhose sins ye   remit they are remitted whose sins ye retain they are retained  could bishop bedell believe that the mere will of a priest could have any effect on the everlasting weal or woe of a christian even to the immediate disciples and apostles could the text if indeed it have reference to sins in our sense at all mean more than thiswhenever you discover by the spirit of knowledge which i will send unto you repentance and faith you shall declare remission of sins and the sins shall be remittedand where the contrary exists your declaration of exclusion from bliss shall be fulfilled did christ say that true repentance and actual faith would not save a soul unless the priests verbal remission was superadded   in fine  if it were in my power i would have this book printed in a convenient form and distributed through every house at least through every village and parish throughout the kingdom a volume of thought and of moral feelings the offspring of thought crowd upon me as i review the different parts of this admirable mans life and creed only compare his conduct to james wadsworth probably some ancestral relative of my honoured friend william wordsworth for the same name in yorkshire from whence his father came is pronounced wadsworth with that of the far far too highly rated bishop hall his letter to hall tenderly blaming his halls bitterness to an old friend mistaken and then his letter to that friend defending hall what a picture of goodness i confess in all ecclesiastical history i have read of no man so spotless though of hundreds in which the biographers have painted them as masters of perfection but the moral tact soon feels the truth    footnote 1 in one of the volumes of this work used by the editor for ascertaining the references the following note is written by a former owner    october 12 1788 begged of the most blessed virgin mary to take my   salvation on herself and obtain it for saint hyacinthes sake to   whom she has promised to grant any thing or never to refuse any thing   begged for his sake  it would be very interesting to know how far the feeling expressed in this artless effusion coexisted with a faith in the atonement and mediation of the one lord jesus christed                                               notes on baxters life of himself  1820 1  among the grounds for recommending the perusal of our elder writers hookertaylorbaxterin short almost any of the folios composed from edward vi to charles ii i note  1 the overcoming the habit of deriving your whole pleasure passively from the book itself which can only be effected by excitement of curiosity or of some passion force yourself to reflect on what you read paragraph by paragraph and in a short time you will derive your pleasure an ample portion of it at least from the activity of your own mind all else is picture sunshine  2 the conquest of party and sectarian prejudices when you have on the same table before you the works of a hammond and a baxter and reflect how many and momentous their points of agreement how few and almost childish the differences which estranged and irritated these good men let us but imagine what their blessed spirits now feel at the retrospect of their earthly frailties and can we do other than strive to feel as they now feel not as they once felt so will it be with the disputes between good men of the present day and if you have no other reason to doubt your opponents goodness than the point in dispute think of baxter and hammond of milton and taylor and let it be no reason at all  3 it will secure you from the idolatry of the present times and fashions and create the noblest kind of imaginative power in your soul that of living in past ages wholly devoid of which power a man can neither anticipate the future nor even live a truly human life a life of reason in the present  4 in this particular work we may derive a most instructive lesson that in certain points as of religion in relation to law the medio tutissimus ibis is inapplicable there is no medium possible and all the attempts as those of baxter though no more required than i believe in god through christ prove only the mildness of the proposers temper but as a rule would be equal to nothing at least exclude only the two or three in a century that make it a matter of religion to declare themselves atheists or else be just as fruitful a rule for a persecutor as the most complete set of articles that could be framed by a spanish inquisition  for to believe must mean to believe arightand god must mean the true godand christ the christ in the sense and with the attributes understood by christians who are truly christians an established church with a liturgy is a sufficient solution of the problem de jure magistratus articles of faith are in this point of view superfluous for is it not too absurd for a man to hesitate at subscribing his name to doctrines which yet in the more awful duty of prayer and profession he dares affirm before his maker they are therefore in this sense merely superfluousnot worth reenacting had they ever been done away withnot worth removing now that they exist  5 the characteristic contradistinction between the speculative reasoners of the age before the revolution and those since is this the former cultivated metaphysics without or neglecting empirical psychology the latter cultivate a mechanical psychology to the neglect and contempt of metaphysics both therefore are almost equidistant from pure philosophy hence the belief in ghosts witches sensible replies to prayer and the like in baxter and in a hundred others see also luthers table talk  6 the earlier part of this volume is interesting as materials for medical history the state of medical science in the reign of charles i was almost incredibly low  the saddest error of the theologians of this age is greek hos émoige dokei the disposition to urge the histories of the miraculous actions and incidents in and by which christ attested his messiahship to the jewish eyewitnesses in fulfilment of prophecies which the jewish church had previously understood and interpreted as marks of the messiah before they have shewn what and how excellent the religion itself is including the miracles as for us an harmonious part of the internal or selfevidence of the religion alas and even when our divines do proceed to the religion itself as to a something which no man could be expected to receive except by a compulsion of the senses which by force of logic only is propagated from the eye witnesses to the readers of the narratives in 1820which logic namely that the evidence of a miracle is not diminished by lapse of ages though this includes loss of documents and the like which logic i say whether it be legitimate or not god forbid that the truth of christianity should depend on the decisioneven when our divines do proceed to the religion itself on what do they chiefly dwell on the doctrines peculiar to the religion no these on the contrary are either evaded or explained away into metaphors or resigned in despair to the next world where faith is to be swallowed up in certainty  but the worst product of this epidemic error is the fashion of either denying or undervaluing the evidence of a future state and the survival of individual consciousness derived from the conscience and the holy instinct of the whole human race dreadful is thisfor the main force of the reasoning by which this scepticism is vindicated consists in reducing all legitimate conviction to objective proof whereas in the very essence of religion and even of morality the evidence and the preparation for its reception must be subjectiveblessed are they that have not seen and yet believe and dreadful it appears to me especially who in the impossibility of not looking forward to consciousness after the dissolution of the body corpus phoenomenon have through life found it next to divine grace the strongest and indeed only efficient support against the still recurring temptation of adopting nay wishing the truth of spinozas notion that the survival of consciousness is the highest prize and consequence of the highest virtue and that of all below this mark the lot after death is selfoblivion and the cessation of individual being indeed how a separatist or one of any other sect of calvinists who confines redemption to the comparatively small number of the elect can reject this opinion and yet not run mad at the horrid thought of an innumerable multitude of imperishable selfconscious spirits everlastingly excluded from god is to me inconceivable  deeply am i persuaded of luthers position that no man can worthily estimate or feel in the depth of his being the incarnation and crucifixion of the son of god who is a stranger to the terror of immortality as ingenerate in man while it is yet unquelled by the faith in god as the almighty father   book i part i p 2    but though my conscience would trouble me when i sinned yet divers   sins i was addicted to and oft committed against my conscience which   for the warning of others i will confess here to my shame    1 i was much addicted when i feared correction to lie that i might   scape    2 i was much addicted to the excessive gluttonous eating of apples   and pears c    3 to this end and to concur with naughty boys that gloried in evil   i have oft gone into other mens orchards and stolen their fruit   when i had enough at home c  there is a childlike simplicity in this account of his sins of his childhood which is very pleasing   ib p 5 6    and the use that god made of books above ministers to the benefit of   my soul made me somewhat excessively in love with good books so that   i thought i had never enough but scraped up as great a treasure of   them as i could    it made the world seem to me as a carcase that   had neither life nor loveliness and it destroyed those ambitious   desires after literate fame which were the sin of my childhood      and for the mathematics i was an utter stranger to them and never   could find in my heart to divert any studies that way but in order to   the knowledge of divinity my inclination was most to logic and   metaphysics with that part of physics which treateth of the soul   contenting myself at first with a slighter study of the rest and   there had my labour and delight  what a picture of myself   ib p 22    in the storm of this temptation i questioned awhile whether i were   indeed a christian or an infidel and whether faith could consist with   such doubts as i was conscious of  one of the instances of the evils arising from the equivoque between faith and intellectual satisfaction or insight the root of faith is in the will faith is an oak that may be a pollard and yet live   ib    the being and attributes of god were so clear to me that he was to my   intellect what the sun is to my eye by which i see itself and all   things  even so with mebut whether god was existentially as well as essentially intelligent this was for a long time a sore combat between the speculative and the moral man   ib p 23    mere deism which is the most plausible competitor with christianity   is so turned out of almost all the whole world as if nature made its   own confession that without a mediator it cannot come to god  excellent   ib    all these assistances were at hand before i came to the immediate   evidences of credibility in the sacred oracles themselves  this is as it should be that is the evidence a priori securing the rational probability and then the historical proofs of its reality pity that baxters chapters in the saints rest should have been one and the earliest occasion of the inversion of this process the fruit of which is the grotiopaleyan religion or minimum of faith the maxim being quanto minus tanto melius   ib p 24    and once all the ignorant rout were raging mad against me for   preaching the doctrine of original sin to them and telling them that   infants before regeneration had so much guilt and corruption as made   them loathsome in the eyes of god  no wonderbecause the babe would perish without the mothers milk is it therefore loathsome to the mother surely the little ones that christ embraced had not been baptized and yet of such is the kingdom of heaven   ib p 25    some thought that the king should not at all be displeased and   provoked and that they were not bound to do any other justice or   attempt any other reformation but what they could procure the king to   be willing to and these said when you have displeased and provoked   him to the utmost he will be your king still    the more you   offend him the less you can trust him and when mutual confidence is   gone a war is beginning    and if you conquer him what the   better are you he will still be king you can but force him to an   agreement and how quickly will he have power and advantage to violate   that which he is forced to and to be avenged on you all for the   displeasure you have done him he is ignorant of the advantages of a   king that cannot foresee this  this paragraph goes to make out a case in justification of the regicides which baxter would have found it difficult to answer certainly a more complete exposure of the inconsistency of baxters own party cannot be for observe that in case of an agreement with charles all those classes which afterwards formed the main strength of the parliament and ultimately decided the contest in its favour would have been politically inert with little influence and no actual poweri mean the yeomanry and the citizens of london while a vast majority of the nobles and landed gentry who sooner or later must have become the majority in parliament went over to the king at once add to these the whole systematized force of the high church clergy and all the rude ignorant vulgar in high and low life who detested every attempt at moral reformand it is obvious that the king could not want opportunities to retract and undo all that he had conceded under compulsion but that neither the will was wanting nor his conscience at all in the way his own advocate clarendon and others have supplied damning proofs   ib p 27    and though parliaments may draw up bills for repealing laws yet hath   the king his negative voice and without his consent they cannot do   it which though they acknowledge yet did they too easily admit of   petitions against the episcopacy and liturgy and connived at all the   clamors and papers which were against them  how so if they admitted the kings right to deny they must admit the subjects right to entreat   ib    had they endeavoured the ejection of laychancellors and the reducing   of the dioceses to a narrower compass or the setting up of a   subordinate discipline and only the correcting and reforming of the   liturgy perhaps it might have been borne more patiently  did baxter find it so himselfand when too he had the formal and recorded promise of charles ii for it   ib    but when the same men ussher williams morton c saw that greater   things were aimed at and episcopacy itself in danger or their   grandeur and riches at least most of them turned against the   parliament  this and in this place is unworthy of baxter even he good man could not wholly escape the jaundice of party   ib p 34    they said to thisthat as all the courts of justice do execute their   sentences in the kings name and this by his own law and therefore   by his authority so much more might his parliament do  a very sound argument is here disguised in a false analogy an inapplicable precedent and a sophistical form courts of justice administer the total of the supreme power retrospectively involved in the name of the most dignified part but here a part as a part acts as the whole where the whole is absolutely requisitethat is in passing laws and again as b and c usurp a power belonging to a by the determination of a b and c the only valid argument is that charles had by acts of his own ceased to be a lawful king   ib p 40    and that the authority and person of the king were inviolable out of   the reach of just accusation judgment or execution by law as having   no superior and so no judge  but according to grotius a king waging war against the lawful copartners of the summa potestas ceases to be their king and if conquered forfeits to them his former share and surely if charles had been victor he would have taken the parliaments share to himself if it had been the parliament and not a mere faction with the army that tried and beheaded charles i do not see how any one could doubt the lawfulness of the act except upon very technical grounds   ib p 41    for if once legislation the chief act of government be denied to any   part of government at all and affirmed to belong to the people as   such who are no governors all government will hereby be overthrown  here baxter falls short of the subject and does not see the full consequents of his own prior most judicious positions legislation in its high and most proper sense belongs to god only a people declares that such and such they hold to be laws that is gods will   ib p 47    in cornwall sir richard grenvill having taken many soldiers of the   earl of essexs army sentenced about a dozen to be hanged when they   had hanged two or three the rope broke which should have hanged the   next and they sent for new ropes so oft to hang him and all of them   still broke that they durst go no further but saved all the rest  the soldiers doubtless contrived this from the aversion natural to englishmen of killing an enemy in cold blood and because they foresaw that there would be tit for tat   ib p 59  it is easy to see from baxters own account that his party ruined their own cause and that of the kingdom by their tenets concerning the right and duty of the civil magistrate to use the sword against such as were not of the same religion with themselves   ib p 62    they seem not to me to have answered satisfactorily to the main   argument fetched from the apostles own government with which saravia   had inclined me to some episcopacy before though miracles and   infallibility were apostolical temporary privileges yet church   government is an ordinary thing to be continued and therefore as the   apostles had successors as they were preachers i see not but that   they must have successors as church governors  was not peters sentence against ananias an act of church government therefore though church government is an ordinary thing in some form or other it does not follow that one particular form is an ordinary thing for the time being the apostles as heads of the church did what they thought best but whatever was binding on the church universal and in all times they delivered as commands from christ now no other command was delivered but that all things should conduce to order and edification   ib p 66    and therefore how they could refuse to receive the king till he   consented to take the covenant i know not unless the taking of the   covenant had been a condition on which he was to receive his crown by   the laws or fundamental constitutions of the kingdom which none   pretendeth nor know i by what power they can add anything to the   coronation oath or covenant which by his ancestors was to be taken   without his own consent  and pray how and by whom were the coronation oaths first imposed the scottish nation in 1650 had the same right to make a bargain with the claimant of their throne as their ancestors had it is strange that baxter should not have seen that his objections would apply to our magna charta so he talks of the fundamental constitutions just as if these had been aboriginal or rather sans origin and not as indeed they were extorted and bargained for by the people but throughout it is plain that baxter repeated but never appropriated the distinction between the king as the executive power and as the individual functionary what obligation lay on the scottish parliament and church to consult the man charles stuarts personal likes and dislikes the oath was to be taken by him as their king doubtless he equally disliked the whole protestant interest and if the tories and church of england jacobites of a later day had recalled james ii would baxter have thought them culpable for imposing on him an oath to preserve the protestant church of england and to inflict severe penalties on his own churchfellows   ib p 71    and some men thought it a very hard question whether they should   rather wish the continuance of a usurper that will do good or the   restoration of a rightful governor whose followers will do hurt  and who shall dare unconditionally condemn those who judged the former to be the better alternative especially those who did not adopt baxters notion of a jus divinum personal and hereditary in the individual whose father had broken the compact on which the claim rested   ib p 75    one mrs dyer a chief person of the sect did first bring forth a   monster which had the parts of almost all sorts of living creatures   some parts like man but most ugly and misplaced and some like   beasts birds and fishes having horns fins and claws and at the   birth of it the bed shook and the women present fell a vomiting and   were fain to go forth of the room  this babe of mrs dyers is no bad emblem of richard baxters own credulity it is almost an argument on his side that nothing he believed is more strange and inexplicable than his own belief of them   ib p 76    the third sect were the ranters these also made it their business as   the former to set up the light of nature under the name of christ in   men and to dishonour and cry down the church c  but why does baxter every where assert the identity of the new light with the light of nature or what does he mean exclusively by the latter the source must be the same in all lights as far as it is light   ib p 77    and that was the fourth sect the quakers who were but the ranters   turned from horrid profaneness and blasphemy to a life of extreme   austerity on the other side  observe the but   ib    their doctrine is to be seen in jacob behmens books by him that hath   nothing else to do than to bestow a great deal of time to understand   him that was not willing to be easily understood and to know that his   bombasted words do signify nothing more than before was easily known   by common familiar terms  this is not in all its parts true it is true that the first principles of behmen are to be found in the writings of the neoplatonists after plotinus and but mixed with gross impieties in paracelsusbut it is not true that they are easily known and still less so that they are communicable in common familiar terms but least of all is it true that there is nothing original in behmen   ib    the chiefest of these in england are dr pordage and his family  it is curious that lessing in the review which he nicolai and mendelssohn conducted under the form of letters to a wounded officer joins the name of pordage with that of behmen was pordages work translated into german   ib p 79    also the socinians made some increase by the ministry of one mr   biddle sometimes schoolmaster in gloucester who wrote against the   godhead of the holy ghost and afterwards of christ whose followers   inclined much to mere deism  for the socinians till biddle retained much of the christian religion for example redemption by the cross and the omnipresence of christ as to this planet even as the romanists with their saints luthers obstinate adherence to the ubiquity of the body of christ and his or rather its real presence in and with the bread was a sad furtherance to the advocates of popish idolatry and hierolatry   ib p 80    many a time have i been brought very low and received the sentence of   death in myself when my poor honest praying neighbours have met   and upon their fasting and earnest prayers i have been recovered once   when i had continued weak three weeks and was unable to go abroad   the very day that they prayed for me being good friday i recovered   and was able to preach and administer the sacrament the next lords   day and was better after it c  strange that the common manuals of school logic should not have secured baxter from the repeated blunder of cum hoc ergo propter hoc but still more strange that his piety should not have revolted against degrading prayer into medical quackery  before the revolution of 1688 metaphysics ruled without experimental psychology and in these curious paragraphs of baxter we see the effect since the revolution experimental psychology without metaphysics has in like manner prevailed and we now feel the result in like manner from plotinus to proclus that is from a d 250 to a d 450 philosophy was set up as a substitute for religion during the dark ages religion superseded philosophy and the consequences are equally instructive the great maxim of legislation intellectual or political is subordinate not exclude nature in her ascent leaves nothing behind but at each step subordinates and glorifiesmass crystal organ sensation sentience reflection   ib p 82    another time as i sat in my study the weight of my greatest folio   books brake down three or four of the highest shelves when i sat   close under them and they fell down every side me and not one of   them hit me save one upon the arm whereas the place the weight the   greatness of the books was such and my head just under them that it   was a wonder they had not beaten out my brains c  greek méga biblíon méga kakón   ib p 84   for all the pains that my infirmities ever brought upon me were never half so grievous an affliction to me as the unavoidable loss of my time which they occasioned i could not bear through the weakness of my stomach to rise before seven oclock in the morning c  alas in how many respects does my lot resemble baxters but how much less have my bodily evils been and yet how very much greater an impediment have i suffered them to be but verily baxters labours seem miracles of supporting grace ought i not therefore to retract the note p 80 i waver   ib p 87    for my part i bless god who gave me even under a usurper whom i   opposed such liberty and advantage to preach his gospel with success   which i cannot have under a king to whom i have sworn and performed   true subjection and obedience yea which no age since the gospel came   into this land did before possess as far as i can learn from history   sure i am that when it became a matter of reputation and honour to be   godly it abundantly furthered the successes of the ministry yea and   i shall add this much more for the sake of posterity that as much as   i have said and written against licentiousness in religion and for   the magistrates power in it and though i think that land most happy   whose rulers use their authority for christ as well as for the civil   peace yet in comparison of the rest of the world i shall think that   land happy that hath but bare liberty to be as good as they are   willing to be and if countenance and maintenance be but added to   liberty and tolerated errors and sects be but forced to keep the   peace and not to oppose the substantials of christianity i shall not   hereafter much fear such toleration nor despair that truth will bear   down adversaries  what a valuable and citable paragraph likewise it is a happy instance of the force of a cherished prejudice in an honest mindpractically yielding to the truth but yet with a speculative though i still think c   ib p 128    among truths certain in themselves all are not equally certain unto   me and even of the mysteries of the gospel i must needs say with mr   richard hooker that whatever some may pretend the subjective   certainty cannot go beyond the objective evidence    therefore i   do more of late than ever discern the necessity of a methodical   procedure in maintaining the doctrine of christianity    my   certainty that i am a man is before my certainty that there is a god      my certainty that there is a god is greater than my certainty   that he requireth love and holiness of his creature c  there is a confusion in this paragraph which asks more than a marginal note to disentangle briefly the process of acquirement is confounded with the order of the truths when acquired a tinder spark gives light to an argands lamp is it therefore more luminous   ib p 129    and when i have studied hard to understand some abstruse admired book   as de scientia dei de providentia circa malum de decretis de   prædeterminatione de libertate creaturæ c i have but attained the   knowledge of human imperfection and to see that the author is but a   man as well as i  on these points i have come to a resting place let such articles as are either to be recognized as facts for example sin or evil having its origination in a will and the reality of a responsible and in whatever sense freedom is presupposed in responsibility of a free will in manor acknowledged as laws for example the unconditional bindingness of the practical reasonor to be freely affirmed as necessary through their moral interest their indispensableness to our spiritual humanity for example the personeity holiness and moral government and providence of godlet these be vindicated from absurdity from selfcontradiction and contradiction to the pure reason and restored to simple incomprehensibility he who seeks for more knows not what he is talking of he who will not seek even this is either indifferent to the truth of what he professes to believe or he mistakes a general determination not to disbelieve for a positive and especial faith which is only our faith as far as we can assign a reason for it o how impossible it is to move an inch to the right or the left in any point of spiritual and moral concernment without seeing the damage caused by the confusion of reason with the understanding   ib p 181    my soul is much more afflicted with the thoughts of the miserable   world and more drawn out in desire of their conversion than   heretofore i was wont to look but little further than england in my   prayers as not considering the state of the rest of the worldor if   i prayed for the conversion of the jews that was almost all but now   as i better understand the care of the world and the method of the   lords prayer so there is nothing in the world that lieth so heavy   upon my heart as the thought of the miserable nations of the earth  i dare not not condemn myself for the languid or dormant state of my feelings respecting the mohammedan and heathen nations yet know not in what degree to condemn the less culpable grounds of this languor are first my utter ignorance of gods purposes with respect to the heathens and second the strong conviction i have that the conversion of a single province of christendom to true practical christianity would do more toward the conversion of heathendom than an army of missionaries romanism and despotic government in the larger part of christendom and the prevalence of epicurean principles in the remainderthese do indeed lie heavy on my heart   ib p 135    therefore i confess i give but halting credit to most histories that   are written not only against the albigenses and waldenses but   against most of the ancient heretics who have left us none of their   own writings in which they speak for themselves and i heartily   lament that the historical writings of the ancient schismatics and   heretics as they were called perished and that partiality suffered   them not to survive that we might have had more light in the church   affairs of those times and been better able to judge between the   fathers and them  it is greatly to the credit of baxter that he has here anticipated those merits which so long after gave deserved celebrity to the name and writings of beausobre and lardner and still more recently in this respect of eichhorn paulus and other neologists   ib p 136    and therefore having myself now written this history of myself   notwithstanding my protestation that i have not in anything wilfully   gone against the truth i expect no more credit from the reader than   the selfevidencing light of the matter with concurrent rational   advantages from persons and things and other witnesses shall   constrain him to  i may not unfrequently doubt baxters memory or even his competence in consequence of his particular modes of thinking but i could almost as soon doubt the gospel verity as his veracity   book i part ii p139  the following book of this work is interesting and most instructive as an instance of syncretism and its epicurean clinamen even when it has been undertaken from the purest and most laudable motives and from impulses the most christian and yet its utter failure in its object that of tending to a common centre the experience of eighteen centuries seems to prove that there is no practicable medium between a church comprehensive which is the only meaning of a catholic church visible in which a in the north or east is allowed to advance officially no doctrine different from what is allowed to b in the south or westand a coexistence of independent churches in none of which any further unity is required but that between the minister and his congregation while this again is secured by the election and continuance of the former depending wholly on the will of the latter  perhaps the best state possible though not the best possible state is where both are found the one established by maintenance the other by permission in short that which we now enjoy in such a state no minister of the former can have a right to complain for it was at his own option to have taken the latter et volenti nulla fit injuria for an individual to demand the freedom of the independent single church when he receives £500 a year for submitting to the necessary restrictions of the church general is impudence and mammonolatry to boot   ib p 141    they the erastians misunderstood and injured their brethren   supposing and affirming them to claim as from god a coercive power   over the bodies or purses of men and so setting up imperium in   imperio whereas all temperate christians at least except papists   confess that the church hath no power of force but only to manage   gods word unto mens consciences  but are not the receivers as bad as the thief is it not a poor evasion to sayit is true i send you to a dungeon there to rot because you do not think as i do concerning some point of faithbut this only as a civil officer as a divine i only tenderly entreat and persuade you can there be fouler hypocrisy in the spanish inquisition than this   ib p 142    that hereby they the diocesan party altered the ancient species of   presbyters to whose office the spiritual government of their proper   folks as truly belonged as the power of preaching and worshiping god   did  i could never rightly understand this objection of richard baxters what power not possessed by the rector of a parish would he have wished a parochial bishop to have exerted what could have been given by the legislature to the latter which might not be given to the former in short baxters plan seems to do away archbishopsgreek koinoì epískopoibut for the rest to name our present rectors and vicars bishops i cannot see what is gained by his plan the true difficulty is that church discipline is attached to an establishment by this worlds law not to the form itself established and his objections from paragraph 5 to paragraph 10 relate to particular abuses not to episcopacy itself   ib p 143    but above all i disliked that most of them the independents made the   people by majority of votes to be church governors in   excommunications absolutions c which christ hath made an act of   office and so they governed their governors and themselves  is not this the case with the houses of legislature the members taken individually are subjects collectively governors   ib p 177    the extraordinary gifts of the apostles and the privilege of being   eye and ear witnesses to christ were abilities which they had for the   infallible discharge of their function but they were not the ground   of their power and authority to govern the church    potestas   clavium was committed to them only not to the seventy  i wish for a proof that all the apostles had any extraordinary gifts which none of the lxx had nay as an episcopalian of the church of england i hold it an unsafe and imprudent concession tending to weaken the governing right of the bishops but i fear that as the law and right of patronage in england now are the question had better not be stirred lest it should be found that the true power of the keys is not as with the papists in hands to which it is doubtful whether christ committed them exclusively but in hands to which it is certain that christ did not commit them at all   ib p 179    it followeth not a mere bishop may have a multitude of churches   because an archbishop may who hath many bishops under him  what then does baxter quarrel about that our bishops take a humbler title than they have a right to claimthat being in fact archbishops they are for the most part content to be styled as one of the brethren   ib p 185    i say again no church no christ for no body no head and if no   christ then there is no christ now  baxter here forgets his own mystical regenerated church if he mean this it is nothing to the argument in question if not then he must assert the monstrous absurdity of no unregenerate church no christ   ib p 188    or if they would not yield to this at all we might have communion   with them as christians without acknowledging them for pastors  observe the inconsistency of baxter no pastor no church no church no christ and yet he will receive them as christians much to his honor as a christian but not much to his credit as a logician   ib p 189    we are agreed that as some discovery of consent on both parts the   pastors and people is necessary to the being of the members of a   political particular church so that the most express declaration of   that consent is the most plain and satisfactory dealing and most   obliging and likest to attain the ends  in our churches especially in good livings there is such an overflowing fullness of consent on the part of the pastor as supplies that of the people altogether nay to nullify their declared dissent   ib p 194    by the establishment of what is contained in these twelve propositions   or articles following the churches in these nations may have a holy   communion peace and concord without any wrong to the consciences or   liberties of presbyterians congregational episcopal or any other   christians  painfully instructive are these proposals from so wise and peaceable a divine as baxter how mighty must be the force of an old prejudice when so generally acute a logician was blinded by it to such palpable inconsistencies on what ground of right could a magistrate inflict a penalty whereby to compel a man to hear what he might believe dangerous to his soul on which the right of burning the refractory individual might not be defended as well   ib p 198    to which ends   i think that this is all that should be required of   any church or member ordinarily to be professed in general i do   believe all that is contained in the sacred canonical scriptures and   particularly i believe all explicitly contained in the ancient creed   c  to a man of sense but unstudied in the context of human nature and from having confined his reading to the writers of the present and the last generation unused to live in former ages it must seem strange that baxter should not have seen that this test is either all or nothing and the creed is it certain that the so called apostles creed was more than the mere catechism of the catechumens was it the baptismal creed of the eastern or western church especially the former the only test really necessary in my opinion is an established liturgy   ib p 201    as reverend bishop ussher hath manifested that the western creed now   called the apostles wanting two or three clauses that now are in it   was not only before the nicene creed but of much further antiquity   that no beginning of it below the apostles days can be found  remove these two or three clauses and doubtless the substance of the remainder must have been little short of the apostolic age but so is one at least of the writings of clement the great question is was this the baptismal symbol the regula fidei which it was forbidden to put in writingor was it not the christian a b c of the catechumeni previously to their baptismal initiation into the higher mysteries to the strong meat which was not for babes 2   ib p 203    not so much for my own sake as others lest it should offend the   parliament and open the mouths of our adversaries that we cannot   ourselves agree in fundamentals and lest it prove an occasion for   others to sue for a universal toleration  that this apprehension so constantly haunted so powerfully actuated even the mild and really tolerant baxter is a strong proof of my old opinionthat the dogma of the right and duty of the civil magistrate to restrain and punish religious avowals by him deemed heretical universal among the presbyterians and parliamentary churchmen joined with the persecuting spirit of the presbyterianswas the main cause of cromwells despair and consequent unfaithfulness concerning a parliamentary commonwealth   ib p 222    i tried when i was last with you to revive your reason by proposing   to you the infallibility of the common senses of all the world and i   could not prevail though you had nothing to answer that was not   against common sense and it is impossible any thing controverted can   be brought nearer you or made plainer than to be brought to your eyes   and taste and feeling and not yours only but all mens else sense   goes before faith faith is no faith but upon supposition of sense and   understanding if therefore common sense be fallible faith must needs   be so  this is one of those twoedged arguments which not indeed began but began to be fashionable just before and after the restoration i was half converted to transubstantiation by tillotsons common senses against it seeing clearly that the same grounds totidem verbis et syllabis would serve the socinian against all the mysteries of christianity if the roman catholics had pretended that the phenomenal bread and wine were changed into the phenomenal flesh and blood this objection would have been legitimate and irresistible but as it is it is mere sensual babble the whole of popery lies in the assumption of a church as a numerical unit infallible in the highest degree inasmuch as both which is scripture and what scripture teaches is infallible by derivation only from an infallible decision of the church fairly undermine or blow up this and all the remaining peculiar tenets of romanism fall with it or stand by their own right as opinions of individual doctors  an antagonist of a complex bad systema system however notwithstandingand such is poperyshould take heed above all things not to disperse himself let him keep to the sticking place but the majority of our protestant polemics seem to have taken for granted that they could not attack romanism in too many places or on too many pointsforgetting that in some they will be less strong than in others and that if in any one or two they are repelled from the assault the feeling of this will extend itself over the whole besides what is the use of alleging thirteen reasons for a witnesss not appearing in court when the first is that the man had died since his subpoena it is as if a party employed to root up a tree were to set one or two at that work while others were hacking the branches and others sawing the trunk at different heights from the ground  n b the point of attack suggested above in disputes with the romanists is of special expediency in the present day because a number of pious and reasonable roman catholics are not aware of the dependency of their other tenets on this of the infallibility of their church decisions as they call them but are themselves shaken and disposed to explain it away this once fixed the scriptures rise uppermost and the man is already a protestant rather a genuine catholic though his opinions should remain nearer to the roman than the reformed church   ib    but methinks yet i should have hope of reviving your charity you   cannot be a papist indeed but you must believe that out of their   church that is out of the popes dominions there is no salvation   and consequently no justification and charity or saving grace and is   it possible you can so easily believe your religious father to be in   hell your prudent pious mother to be void of the love of god and in   a state of damnation c  this argument ad affectum is beautifully and forcibly stated but yet defective by the omission of the pointnot for unbelief or misbelief of any article of faith but simply for not being a member of this particular part of the church of christ for it is possible that a christian might agree in all the articles of faith with the roman doctors against those of the reformation and yet if he did not acknowledge the pope as christs vicar and held salvation possible in any other church he is himself excluded from salvation without this great distinction lady ann lindsey might have replied to baxterso might a pagan orator have said to a convert from paganism in the first ages of christianity so indeed the advocates of the old religion did argue what can you bear to believe that numa camillus fabricius the scipios the catos that cicero seneca that titus and the antonini are in the flames of hell the accursed objects of the divine hatred now whatever you dare hope of these as heathens we dare hope of you as heretics   ib p 224    but this is not the worst you consequently anathematize all papists   by your sentence for heresies by your own sentence cut off men from   heaven but popery is a bundle of heresies therefore it cuts off men   from heaven the minor i prove c  this introduction of syllogistic form in a letter to a young lady is whimsically characteristic   ib p 225    you say the scripture admits of no private interpretation but you   abuse yourself and the text with a false interpretation of it in these   words an interpretation is called private either as to the subject   person or as to the interpreter you take the text to speak of the   latter when the context plainly sheweth you that it speaks of the   former the apostle directing them to understand the prophecies of the   old testament gives them this cautionthat none of these scriptures   that are spoken of christ the public person must be interpreted as   spoken of david or other private person only of whom they were   mentioned but as types of christ c  it is strange that this sound and irrefragable argument has not been enforced by the church divines in their controversies with the modern unitarians as capp belsham and others who refer all the prophetic texts of the old testament to historical personages of their time exclusively of all double sense   ib p 226    as to what you say of apostles still placed in the churchwhen any   shew us an immediate mission by their communion and by miracles   tongues and a spirit of revelation and infallibility prove   themselves apostles we shall believe them  this is another of those twoedged arguments which baxter and jeremy taylor imported from grotius and which have since become the universal fashion among protestants i fear however that it will do us more hurt by exposing a weak part to the learned infidels than service in our combat with the romanists i venture to assert most unequivocally that the new testament contains not the least proof of the linguipotence of the apostles but the clearest proofs of the contrary and i doubt whether we have even as decisive a victory over the romanists in our middletonian farmerian and douglasian dispute concerning the miracles of the first two centuries and their assumed contrast in genere with those of the apostles and the apostolic age as we have in most other of our protestant controversies  nb these opinions of middleton and his more cautious followers are no part of our real church doctrine this passion for law court evidence began with grotius   ib p 246    we conceived there needs no more to be said for justifying the   imposition of the ceremonies by law established than what is contained   in the beginningof this section inasmuch as lawful authority   hath already determined the ceremonies in question to be decent and   orderly and to serve to edification and consequently to be agreeable   to the general rules of the word  to a selfconvinced and disinterested lover of the church of england it gives an indescribable horror to observe the frequency with which the prelatic party after the restoration appeal to the laws as of equal authority with the express words of scriptureas if the laws by them appealed to were other than the vindictive determinations of their own furious partizansas if the same appeals might not have been made by bonner and gardiner under philip and mary why should i speak of the inhuman sophism that because it is silly in my neighbour to break his egg at the broad end when the squire and the vicar have declared their predilection for the narrow end therefore it is right for the squire and the vicar to hang and quarter him for his sillinessfor it comes to that   ib p 248    to you it is indifferent before your imposition and therefore you may   without any regret of your own consciences forbear the imposition or   persuade the law makers to forbear it but to many of those that   dissent from you they are sinful c  but what is all this good worthy baxter but saying and unsaying if they are not indifferent why did you previously concede them to be such in short nothing can be more pitiably weak than the conduct of the presbyterian party from the first capture of charles i common sense required either a bold denial that the church had power in ceremonies more than in doctrines or that the parliament was the church since it is the parliament that enacts all these thingsor if they admitted the authority lawful and the ceremonies only in their mind inexpedient good god can selfwill more plainly put on the cracked mask of tender conscience than by refusal of obedience what intolerable presumption to disqualify as ungodly and reduce to null the majority of the country who preferred the liturgy in order to force the long winded vanities of bustling godorators on those who would fain hear prayers not spouting   ib p 249    the great controversies between the hypocrite and the true christian   whether we should be serious in the practice of the religion which we   commonly profess hath troubled england more than any othernone   being more hated and divided as puritans than those that will make   religion their business c  had not the governors had bitter proofs that there are other and more cruel vices than swearing and careless livingand that these were predominant chiefly among such as made their religion their business   ib    and whereas you speak of opening a gap to sectaries for private   conventicles and the evil consequents to the state we only desire   you to avoid also the cherishing of ignorance and profaneness and   suppress all sectaries and spare not in a way that will not   suppress the means of knowledge and godliness  the present company that is our own dear selves always excepted   ib p 250    otherwise the poor undone churches of christ will no more believe you   in such professions than we believed that those men intended the   kings just power and greatness who took away his life  or who like baxter joined the armies that were showering cannon balls and bullets around his inviolable person whenever by reading the prelatical writings and histories i have had an over dose of antiprelatism in my feelings i then correct it by dipping into the works of the presbyterians and their fellows and so bring myself to more charitable thoughts respecting the prelatists and fully subscribe to miltons assertion that presbyter was but old priest writ large   ib p 254    the apocryphal matter of your lessons in tobit judith bel and the   dragon c is scarce agreeable to the word of god  does not jude refer to an apocryphal book   ib    our experience unresistibly convinceth us that a continued prayer doth   more to help most of the people and carry on their desires than   turning almost every petition into a distinct prayer and making   prefaces and conclusions to be near half the prayers  this now is the very point i most admire in our excellent liturgy to any particular petition offered to the omniscient there may be a sinking of faith a sense of its superfluity but to the lifting up of the soul to the invisible and there fixing it on his attributes there can be no scruple   ib p 257    the not abating of the impositions is the carting off of many hundreds   of your brethren out of the ministry and of many thousand christians   out of your communion but the abating of the impositions will so   offend you as to silence or excommunicate none of you at all for   example we think it a sin to subscribe or swear canonical obedience   or use the transient image of the cross in baptism and therefore   these must cast us out c  as long as independent single churches or voluntarily synodical were forbidden and punishable by penal law this argument remained irrefragable the imposition of such trifles under such fearful threats was the very bitterness of spiritual pride and vindictivenessafter the law passed by which things became as they now are it was a mere question of expediency for the national church to determine in relation to its own comparative interests if the church chose unluckily the injury has been to itself alone  it seems strange that such men as baxter should not see that the use of the ring the surplice and the like are indifferent according to his own confession yea mere trifles in comparison with the peace of the church but that it is no trifle that men should refuse obedience to lawful authority in matters indifferent and prefer the sin of schism to offending their taste and fancy the church did not upon the whole contend for a trifle nor for an indifferent matter but for a principle on which all order in society must depend still this is true only provided the church enacts no ordinances that are not necessary or at least plainly conducive to order or generally to the ends for which it is a church besides the point which the king had required them to consider was not what ordinances it was right to obey but what it was expedient to enact or not to enact   ib p 269    that the pastors of the respective parishes may be allowed not only   publicly to preach but personally to catechize or otherwise instruct   the several families admitting none to the lords table that have not   personally owned their baptismal covenant by a credible profession of   faith and obedience and to admonish and exhort the scandalous in   order to their repentance to hear the witnesses and the accused   party and to appoint fit times and places for these things and to   deny such persons the communion of the church in the holy eucharist   that remain impenitent or that wilfully refuse to come to their   pastors to be instructed or to answer such probable accusations and   to continue such exclusion of them till they have made a credible   profession of repentance and then to receive them again to the   communion of the churchprovided there be place for due appeals to   superior power  suppose only such men pastors as are now most improperly whether as boast or as sneer called evangelical what an insufferable tyranny would this introduce who would not rather live in algiers this alone would make this minute history of the ecclesiastic factions invaluable that it must convince all sober lovers of independence and moral selfgovernment how dearly we ought to prize our present church establishment with all its faults   ib p 272    therefore we humbly crave that your majesty will here declare that it   is your majestys pleasure that none be punished or troubled for not   using the book of common prayer till it be effectually reformed by   divines of both persuasions equally deputed thereunto  the dispensing power of the crown not only acknowledged but earnestly invoked cruel as the conduct of laud and that of sheldon to the dissentients was yet gods justice stands clear towards them for they demanded that from others which they themselves would not grant they were to be allowed at their own fancies to denounce the ring in marriage and yet impowered to endungeon through the magistrate the honest and peaceable quaker for rejecting the outward ceremony of water in baptism as seducing men to take it as a substitute for the spiritual realitythough the quakers no less than themselves appealed to scripture authoritythe baptists own contrast of christs with the water baptism   ib p 273    we are sure that kneeling in any adoration at all in any worship on   any lords day in the year or any week day between easter and   pentecost was not only disused but forbidden by general councils   cand therefore that kneeling in the act of receiving is a novelty   contrary to the decrees and practice of the church for many hundred   years after the apostles  was not this because kneeling was the agreed sign of sorrow and personal contrition which was not to be introduced into the public worship on the great day and the solemn seasons of the churchs joy and thanksgiving if so baxters appeal to this usage is a gross sophism a mere pun   ib p 308    baxters exceptions to the common prayer book    1 order requireth that we begin with reverent prayer to god for his      acceptance and assistance which is not done  enunciation of gods invitations and promises in gods own words as in the common prayer book much better    2 that the creed and decalogue containing the faith in which we      profess to assemble for gods worship and the law which we have      broken by our sins should go before the confession and absolution      or at least before the praises of the church which they do not  might have deserved consideration if the people or the larger number consisted of uninstructed catechumeni or mere candidates for churchmembership but the object being not the first teaching of the creed and decalogue but the lively reimpressing of the same it is much better as it is    3 the confession omitteth not only original sin but all actual sin      as specified by the particular commandments violated and almost      all the aggravations of those sins whereas confession being      the expression of repentance should be more particular as      repentance itself should be  grounded on one of the grand errors of the whole dissenting party namely the confusion of public common prayer praise and instruction with domestic and even with private devotion our confession is a perfect model for christian communities    4 when we have craved help for gods prayers before we come to them      we abruptly put in the petition for speedy deliveranceo god      make speed to save us o lord make haste to help us without any      intimation of the danger that we desire deliverance from and      without any other petition conjoined    5 it is disorderly in the manner to sing the scripture in a plain      tune after the manner of reading    6 the lord be with you and with thy spirit being petitions      for divine assistance come in abruptly in the midst or near the      end of morning prayer and let us pray is adjoined when we      were before in prayer  mouselike squeak and nibble    7 lord have mercy upon us christ have mercy upon us lord have      mercy upon us seemeth an affected tautology without any special      cause or order here and the lords prayer is annexed that was      before recited and yet the next words are again but a repetition      of the aforesaid oft repeated general o lord shew thy mercy upon      us  still worse the spirit in which this and similar complaints originated has turned the prayers of dissenting ministers into irreverent preachments forgetting that tautology in words and thoughts implies no tautology in the music of the heart to which the words are as it were set and that it is the heart that lifts itself up to god our words and thoughts are but parts of the enginery which remains with ourselves and logic the rustling dry leaves of the lifeless reflex faculty does not merit even the name of a pulley or lever of devotion    8 the prayer for the king o lord save the king is without any      order put between the foresaid petition and another general request      only for audience and mercifully hear us when we call upon      thee  a trifle but just    9 the second collect is intituled for peace and hath not a word      in it of petition for peace but only for defence in assaults of      enemies and that we may not fear their power and the prefaces      in knowledge of whom standeth c and whose service c      have no more evident respect to a petition for peace than to any      other and the prayer itself comes in disorderly while many      prayers or petitions are omitted which according both to the      method of the lords prayer and the nature of the things should      go before    10 the third collect intituled for grace is disorderly c       and thus the main parts of prayer according to the rule of the       lords prayer and our common necessities are omitted  not wholly unfounded but the objection proceeds on an arbitrary and i think false assumption that the lords prayer was universally prescriptive in form and arrangement    12 the litany  omitteth very many particulars  and it is       exceeding disorderly following no just rules of method having       begged pardon of our sins and deprecated vengeance it proceedeth       to evil in general and some few sins in particular and thence to       a more particular enumeration of judgments and thence to a       recitation of the parts of that work of our redemption and thence       to the deprecation of judgments again and thence to prayers for       the king and magistrates and then for all nations and then for       love and obedience c  the very points here objected to as faults i should have selected as excellencies for do not the duties and temptations occur in real life even so intermingled the imperfection of thought much more of language so singly successive allows no better representation of the close neighbourhood nay the coinherence of duty in duty desire in desire every want of the heart pointing godward is a chili agon that touches at a thousand points from these remarks i except the last paragraph of s 12    as to the prayer for bishops and curates and the position of the   general thanksgiving c  which are defects so palpable and so easily removed that nothing but antipathy to the objectors could have retained them    13 the like defectiveness and disorder is in the communion collects   for the day there is no more reason why it should be appropriate   to that day than another or rather be a common petition for all days   c  i do not see how these supposed improprieties for want of appropriateness to the day could be avoided without risk of the far greater evil of too great appropriation to particular saints and days as in popery i am so far a puritan that i think nothing would have been lost if christmas day and good friday had been the only week days made holy days and easter the only lords day especially distinguished i should also have added whitsunday but that it has become unmeaning since our clergy have as i grieve to think become generally arminian and interpreting the descent of the spirit as the gift of miracles and of miraculous infallibility by inspiration have rendered it of course of little or no application to christians at present yet how can arminians pray our church prayers collectively on any day answer see a boa constrictor with an ox or deer what they do swallow proves so astounding a dilatability of gullet that it would be unconscionable strictness to complain of the horns antlers or other indigestible nonessentials being suffered to rot off at the confines greek hérkos hodóntôn but to write seriously on so serious a subject it is mournful to reflect that the influence of the systematic theology then in fashion with the antiprelatic divines whether episcopalians or presbyterians had quenched all fineness of mind all flow of heart all grandeur of imagination in them while the victorious party the prelatic arminians enriched as they were with all learning and highly gifted with taste and judgment had emptied revelation of all the doctrines that can properly be said to have been revealed and thus equally caused the extinction of the imagination and quenched the life in the light by withholding the appropriate fuel and the supporters of the sacred flame so that between both parties our transcendant liturgy remains like an ancient greek temple a monumental proof of the architectural genius of an age long departed when there were giants in the land   ib p 337    as i was proceeding bishop morley interrupted me according to his   manner with vehemency crying out   the bishop interrupted me again     i attempted to speak and still he interrupted me   bishop   morley went on talking louder than i c  the bishops appear to have behaved insolently enough safe in their knowledge of charless inclinations they laughed in their sleeves at his commission their best answer would have been to have pressed the antiimpositionists with their utter forgetfulness of the possible nay very probable differences of opinion between the ministers and their congregations a vain minister might disgust a sober congregation with his extempore prayers or his open contempt of their kneeling at the sacrament and the like yet by what right if he acts only as an individual and then what an endless source of disputes and preferences of this minister or of that   ib p 341    the paper offered by bishop cosins    1 that the question may be put to the managers of the division      whether there be anything in the doctrine or discipline or the      common prayer or ceremonies contrary to the word of god and if      they can make any such appear let them be satisfied    2 if not let them propose what they desire in point of expediency      and acknowledge it to be no more  this was proposed doubtless by one of your sensible men it is so plain so plausible shallow nihili nauci pili floccical why the very phrase contrary to the word of god would take a month to define and neither party agree at last one party says  the church has power from gods word to order all matters of order so as shall appear to them to conduce to decency and edification but ceremonies respect the orderly performance of divine service ergo the church has power to ordain ceremonies but the cross in baptizing is a ceremony ergo the church has power to prescribe the crossing in baptism what is rightfully ordered cannot be rightfully withstoodbut the crossing c is rightfully orderedergo the crossing cannot be rightfully omitted  to this how easily would the other party reply  1 that a small number of bishops could not be called the church  2 that no one church had power or pretence from gods word to prescribe    concerning mere matters of outward decency and convenience to other    churches or assemblies of christian people  3 that the blending an unnecessary and suspicious if not    superstitious motion of the hand with a necessary and essential act    doth in no wise respect order or propriety  lastly that to forbid a man to obey a direct command of god because he will not join with it an admitted mere tradition of men is contrary to common sense no less than to gods word expressly and by breach of charity which is the great end and purpose of gods word besides might not the pope and his shavelings have made the same proposition to the reformers in the reign of edward vi in respect to the greater part of the idle superfluities which were rejected by the reformers only as idle and superfluous and for that reason contrary to the spirit of the gospel though few if any were in the direct teeth of a positive prohibition above all an honest policy dictates that the end in view being fully determined as here for instance the preclusion of disturbance and indecorum in christian assemblies every addition to means already adequate to the securing of that end tends to frustrate the end and is therefore evidently excluded from the prerogatives of the church however that word may be interpreted inasmuch as its power is confined to such ceremonies and regulations as conduce to order and general edification in short it grieves me to think that the heads of the most apostolical church in christendom should have insisted on three or four trifles the abolition of which could have given offence to none but such as from the baleful superstition that alone could attach importance to them effectually it was charity to offendwhen all the rest of baxters objections might have been answered so triumphantly   ib p 343    answer to the foresaid paper    8 that none may be a preacher that dare not subscribe that there is   nothing in the common prayer book the book of ordination and the 39   articles that is contrary to the word of god  i think this might have been left out as well as the other two articles mentioned by baxter for as by the words contrary to the word of god in cosinss paper it was not meant to declare the common prayer book free from all error the sense must have been that there is not anything in it in such a way or degree contrary to gods word as to oblige us to assign sin to those who have overlooked it or who think the same compatible with gods word or who though individually disapproving the particular thing yet regard that acquiescence as an allowed sacrifice of individual opinion to modesty charity and zeal for the peace of the church for observe that this eighth instance is additional to and therefore not inclusive of the preceding seven otherwise it must have been placed as the first or rather as the whole the seven following being motives and instances in support and explanation of the point   ib p 368  let me mediate here between baxter and the bishops baxter had taken for granted that the king had a right to promise a revision of the liturgy canons and regiment of the church and that the bishops ought to have met him and his friends as diplomatists on even ground the bishops could not with discretion openly avow all they meant and it would be bigotry to deny that the spirit of compromise had no indwelling in their feelings or intents but nevertheless it is true that they thought more in the spirit of the english constitution than baxter and his friendsthis thought they is the law of the land quam nolumus mutari and it must be the king with and by the advice of his parliament that can authorize any part of his subjects to take the question of its repeal into consideration under other circumstances a king might bring the bishops and the heads of the romish party together to plot against the law of the land no we would have no other secret committees but of parliamentary appointment we are but so many individuals it is in the legislature that the congregations the party most interested in this cause meet collectively by their representativeslastly let it not be overlooked that the root of the bitterness was common to both partiesnamely the conviction of the vital importance of uniformityand this admitted surely an undoubted majority in favor of what is already law must decide whose uniformity it is to be   ib p 368    we must needs believe that when your majesty took our consent to a   liturgy to be a foundation that would infer our concord you meant not   that we should have no concord but by consenting to this liturgy   without any considerable alteration  this is forcible reasoning but which the bishops could fairly leave for the king to answerthe contract tacit or expressed being between him and the antiprelatic presbyteroepiscopalian party to which neither the bishops nor the legislature had acceded or assented if baxter and calamy were so little imbued with the spirit of the constitution as to consider charles ii as the breath of their nostrils and this dread sovereign breath in its passage gave a snort or a snuffle or having led them to expect a snuffle surprised them with a snort let the reproach be shared between the breaths fetid conscience and the nostrils nasoductility the traitors to the liberty of their country who were swarming and intriguing for favor at breda when they should have been at their post in parliament or in the lobby preparing terms and conditionshad all the ministers that were afterwards ejected and the presbyterian party generally exerted themselves heart and soul with monks soldiers and in collecting those whom monk had displaced and instead of carrying on treasons against the government de facto by mendicant negociations with charles had taken open measures to confer the sceptre on him as the scotch didwhose stern and truly loyal conduct has been most unjustly condemnedthe schism in the church might have been prevented and the revolution of 1688 superseded  nb in the above i speak of the bishops as men interested in a litigated estate god forbid i should seek to justify them as christians   ib p 369    quære whether in the 20th article these words are not   insertedhabet ecclesia auctoritatem in controversiis fidei  strange that the evident antithesis between power in respect of ceremonies and authority in points of faith should have been overlooked   ib    some have published that there is a proper sacrifice in the lords   supper to exhibit christs death in the postfact as there was a   sacrifice to prefigure it in the old law in the antefact and   therefore that we have a true altar and not only metaphorically so   called  doubtless a gross error yet pardonable for to errors nearly as gross it was opposed   ib    some have maintained that the lords day is kept merely by   ecclesiastical constitution and that the day is changeable  where shall we find the proof of the contraryat least if the position had been worded thus the moral and spiritual obligation of keeping the lords day is grounded on its manifest necessity and the evidence of its benignant effects in connection with those conditions of the world of which even in christianized countries there is no reason to expect a change and is therefore commanded by implication in the new testament so clearly and by so immediate a consequence as to be no less binding on the conscience than an explicit command a having lawful authority expressly commands me to go to london from bristol there is at present but one safe road this therefore is commanded by a and would be so even though a had spoken of another road which at that time was open   ib p 370    some have broached out of socinus a most uncomfortable and desperate   doctrine that late repentance that is upon the last bed of   sickness is unfruitful at least to reconcile the penitent to god  this no doubt refers to jeremy taylors work on repentance and is but too faithful a description of its character   ib p 373    a little after the king was beheaded mr atkins met this priest in   london and going into a tavern with him said to him in his familiar   way what business have you here i warrant you come about some   roguery or other whereupon the priest told it him as a great secret   that there were thirty of them here in london who by instructions   from cardinal mazarine did take care of such affairs and had sat in   council and debated the question whether the king should be put to   death or notand that it was carried in the affirmative and there   were but two voices for the negative which was his own and anothers   and that for his part he could not concur with them as foreseeing   what misery this would bring upon his country mr atkins stood to   the truth of this but thought it a violation of the laws of   friendship to name the man  richard baxter was too thoroughly good for any experience to make him worldly wise else how could he have been simple enough to suppose that mazarine would leave such a question to be voted pro and con and decided by thirty emissaries in london and how could he have reconciled mazarines having any share in charless death with his own masterly account pp 98 99 100 even cromwell though he might have prevented could not have effected the sentence the regicidal judges were not his creatures consult the life of colonel hutchinson upon this   ib p 374    since this dr peter moulin hath in his answer to philanax   anglicus declared that he is ready to prove when authority will   call him to it that the kings death and the change of the   government was first proposed both to the sorbonne and to the pope   with his conclave and consented to and concluded for by both  the pope in his conclave had about the same influence in charless fate as the popes eye in a leg of mutton the letter intercepted by cromwell was charless deathwarrant charles knew his power and cromwell and ireton knew it likewise and knew that it was the power of a man who was within a yards length of a talisman only not within an arms length but which in that state of the public mind could he but have once grasped it would have enabled him to blow up presbyterian and independent both if ever a lawless act was defensible on the principle of selfpreservation the murder of charles might be defended i suspect that the fatal delay in the publication of the icon basilike is susceptible of no other satisfactory explanation in short it is absurd to burthen this act on cromwell and his party in any special sense the guilt if guilt it was was consummated at the gates of hull that is the first moment that charles was treated as an individual man against man whatever right hampden had to defend his life against the king in battle cromwell and ireton had in yet more imminent danger against the kings plotting miltons reasoning on this point is unanswerable and what a wretched hand does baxter make of it   ib p 375    but if the laws of the land appoint the nobles as next the king to   assist him in doing right and withhold him from doing wrong then be   they licensed by mans law and so not prohibited by gods to   interpose themselves for the safety of equity and innocency and by   all lawful and needful means to procure the prince to be reformed but   in no case deprived where the sceptre is inherited so far bishop   bilson  excellent o by all means preserve for him the benefit of his rightful heirloom the regal sceptre only lay it about his shoulders till he promises to handle it as he ought but what if he breaks his promise and your head or what if he will not promise how much honester would it be to say that extreme cases are ipso nomine not generalizable therefore not the subjects of a law which is the conclusion per genus singuli in genere inclusi every extreme case must be judged by and for itself under all the peculiar circumstances now as these are not foreknowable the case itself cannot be predeterminable harmodius and aristogiton did not justify brutus and cassius but neither do brutus and cassius criminate harmodius and aristogiton the rule applies till an extreme case occurs and how can this be proved i answer the only proof is success and good event for these afford the best presumption first of the extremity and secondly of its remediable naturethe two elements of its justification to every individual it is forbidden he who attempts it therefore must do so on the presumption that the will of the nation is in his will whether he is mad or in his senses the event can alone determine   ib p 398    the governing power and obligation over the flock is essential to the   office of a pastor or presbyter as instituted by christ  there is greek hôs émoige dokei one flaw in baxters plea for his presbyterian form of church government that he uses a metaphor which inasmuch as it is but a metaphor agrees with the thing meant in some points only as if it were commensurate in toto and virtually identical thus the presbyter is a shepherd as far as the watchfulness tenderness and care are to be the same in both but it does not follow that the presbyter has the same sole power and exclusive right of guidance and for this reasonthat his flock are not sheep but men not of a natural generic or even constant inferiority of judgment but christians coheirs of the promises and therein of the gifts of the holy spirit and of the interpretation of the holy scriptures how then can they be excluded from a share in church government the words of christ if they may be transferred from their immediate application to the jewish synagogue suppose the contraryand that highest act of government the election of the officers and ministers of the church was confessedly exercised by the congregations including the presbyters and archpresbyter or bishop in the primitive church the question therefore isis a national church established by law compatible with christianity if so as baxter held the representatives king lords and commons are or may be representatives of the whole people as christians as well as civil subjectsand their voice will then be the voice of the church which every individual as an individual themselves as individuals and a fortiori the officers and administrators appointed by them are bound to obey at the risk of excommunication against which there would be no appeal but to the heavenly cæsar the lord and head of the universal church but whether as the accredited representatives and plenipotentiaries of the national church they can avail themselves of their conjoint but distinct character as temporal legislators to superadd corporal or civil penalties to the spiritual sentence in points peculiar to christianity as heretical opinions church ceremonies and the like thus destroying discipline even as wood is destroyed by combination with firethis is a new and difficult question which yet baxter and the presbyterian divines and the puritans of that age in general not only answered affirmatively but most zealously not to say furiously affirmed with anathemas to the assertors of the negative and spiritual threats to the magistrates neglecting to interpose the temporal sword in this respect the present dissenters have the advantage over their earlier predecessors but on the other hand they utterly evacuate the scriptural commands against schism take away all sense and significance from the article respecting the catholic church and in consequence degrade the discipline itself into mere clubregulations or the bylaws of different lodgesthat very discipline the capability of exercising which in its own specific nature without superinduction of a destructive and transmutual opposite is the fairest and firmest support of their cause  20th october 1829   ib p 401    that sententially it must be done by the pastor or governor of that   particular church which the person is to be admitted into or cast   out of  this most arbitrary appropriation of the words of christ and of the apostles john and paul by the clergy to themselves exclusively is the greek prôton pseudos the fatal error which has practically excluded church discipline from among protestants in all free countries that it is retained and an efficient power among the quakers and only in that sect who act collectively as a churchwho not only have no proper clergy but will not allow a division of majority and minority nor a temporary presidentseems to supply an unanswerable confirmation of this my assertion and a strong presumption for the validity of my argument the wesleyan methodists have i know a discipline and the power is in their consistorya general conclave of priests cardinal since the death of pope wesley but what divisions and secessions this has given rise to what discontents and heartburnings it still occasions in their labouring inferior ministers and in the classes is no less notorious and may authorize a belief that as the sect increases it will be less and less effective nay that it has decreased and after all what is it compared with the discipline of the quakersbaxters inconsistency on this subject would be inexplicable did we not know his zealotry against harrington the deists and the mysticsso that like an electrified pithball he is for ever attracted towards their tenets concerning the pretended perfecting of spiritual sentences by the civil magistrate but he touches only to fly off again toleration dainty word for soulmurder god grant that my eye may never see a toleration he exclaims in his book against harringtons oceana   ib p 405    as for the democratical conceit of them that say that the parliament   hath their governing power as they are the peoples representatives   and so have the members of the convocation though those represented   have no governing power themselves it is so palpably   selfcontradicting that i need not confute it  selfcontradicting according to baxters sense of the words represent and govern but every rational adult has a governing power namely that of governing himself   ib p 412    that though a subject ought to take an oath in the sense of his rulers   who impose it as far as he can understand it yet a man that taketh   an oath from a robber to save his life is not always bound to take it   in the imposers sense if he take it not against the proper sense of   the words  this is a point on which i have never been able to satisfy myselfthe only safe conclusion i have been able to draw being the folly mischief and immorality of all oaths but judicial onesand those no farther excepted than as they are means of securing a deliberate consciousness of the presence of the omniscient judge the inclination of my mind is at this moment to the principle that an oath may deepen the guilt of an act sinful in itself but cannot be detached from the act it being understood that a perfectly voluntary and selfimposed oath is itself a sin the man who compels me to take an oath by putting a pistol to my ear has in my mind clearly forfeited all his right to be treated as a moral agent nay it seems to be a sin to act so as to induce him to suppose himself such contingent consequences must be excluded but would i am persuaded weigh in favour of annulling on principle an oath sinfully extorted but i hate casuistry so utterly that i could not without great violence to my feelings put the case in all its bearings for exampleit is sinful to enlarge the power of wicked agents but to allow them to have the power of binding the conscience of those whom they have injured is to enlarge the power c again no oath can bind to the perpetration of a sin but to transfer a sum of money from its rightful owner to a villain is a sin c and twenty other such but the robber may kill the next man possibly but still more probably many who would be robbers if they could obtain their ends without murder would resist the temptation if no extenuations of guilt were contemplatedand one murder is more effective in rousing the public mind to preventive measures and by the horror it strikes is made more directly preventive of the tendency than fifty civil robberies by contract   ib p 435    that the minister be not bound to read the liturgy himself if   another by whomsoever be procured to do it so be it he preach not   against it  wonderful that so good and wise a man as baxter should not have seen that in this the church would have given up the best perhaps the only efficient preservative of her faith but for our blessed and truly apostolic and scriptural liturgy our churches pews would long ago have been filled by arians and socinians as too many of their desks and pulpits already are   part iii p 59    as also to make us take such a poor suffering as this for a sign of   true grace instead of faith hope love mortification and a   heavenly mind and that the loss of one grain of love was worse than a   long imprisonment  here baxter confounds his own particular case which very many would have coveted with the sufferings of other prisoners on the same scoresufferings nominally the same but with few if any of baxters almost flattering supports   ib p 60    it would trouble the reader for me to reckon up the many diseases and   dangers for these ten years past in or from which god hath delivered   me though it be my duty not to forget to be thankful seven months   together i was lame with a strange pain in one foot twice delivered   from a bloody flux a spurious cataract in my eye with incessant webs   and networks before it hath continued these eight years    so   that i have rarely one hours or quarter of an hours ease yet   through gods mercy i was never one hour melancholy c  the power of the soul by its own act of will is i admit great for any one occasion or for a definite time yea it is marvellous but of such exertions and such an even frame of spirit as baxters were under such unremitting and almost unheardof bodily derangements and pains as his and during so long a life 1 do not believe a human soul capable unless substantiated and successively potentiated by an especial divine grace   ib p 65    the reasons why i make no larger a profession necessary than the creed   and scriptures are because if we depart from this old sufficient   catholic rule we narrow the church and depart from the old   catholicism  why then any creed this is the difficulty if you put the creed as in fact and not by courtesy apostolic and on a parity with scripture having namely its authority in itself and a direct inspiration of the framers inspired ad id tempus et ad eam rem on what ground is this to be done without admitting the binding power of tradition in the very sense of the term in which the church of rome uses it and the protestant churches reject it that it is the sum total made by apostolic contributions each apostle casting as into a helmet a several article as his greek symbolon is the tradition and this is holden as a mere legendary tale by the great majority of learned divines that it is simply the creed of the western church is affirmed by many protestant divines and some of these divines of our church its comparative simplicity these divines explain by the freedom from heresies enjoyed by the western church when the eastern church had been long troubled therewith others again and not unplausibly contend that it was the creed of the catechumens preparatory to the baptismal profession of faith which other was a fuller comment on the union of the father the son and the holy ghost into whose name or power they were baptised that the apostles creed received additions after the apostolic age seems almost certain not to mention the perplexing circumstance that so many of the latin fathers who give almost the words of the apostolic creed declare it forbidden absolutely to write or by any material form to transmit the canon fidei or symbolum or regula fidei the creed greek kat hexocháen by analogy of which the question whether such a book was scripture or not was to be tried with such doubts how can the apostles creed be preferred to the nicene by a consistent member of the reformed catholic church   ib p 67    they think while you the independents seem to be for a stricter   discipline than others that your way or usual practice tendeth to   extirpate godliness out of the land by taking a very few that can   talk more than the rest and making them the church c  had baxter had as judicious advisers among his theological as he had among his legal friends and had he allowed them equal influence with him he would not i suspect have written this irritating and too egometical paragraph but baxter would have disbelieved a prophet who had foretold that almost the whole orthodoxy of the nonconformists would he retained and preserved by the independent congregations in england after the presbyterian had almost without exception become first arian then socinian and finally unitarian that is the demisemiquaver of christianity arminianism being taken for the semibreve   ib p 69    after this i waited on him dr john owen at london again and he   came once to me to my lodgings when i was in town near him and he   told me that he received my chiding letter and perceived that i   suspected his reality in the business but he was so hearty in it that   i should see that he really meant as he spoke concluding in these   words you shall see it and my practice shall reproach your   diffidence    about a month after i went to him again and he had   done nothing but was still hearty for the work and to be short i   thus waited on him time after time till my papers had been near a   year and a quarter in his hand and then i advised him to return them   to me which he did with these words i am still a wellwisher to   those mathematicswithout any other words about them or ever   giving me any more exception against them and this was the issue of   my third attempt for union with the independents  dr owen was a man of no ordinary intellect it would be interesting to have his conduct in this point seemingly so strange in some measure explained the words those mathematics look like an innuendo that baxters scheme of union by which all the parties opposed to the prelatic church were to form a rival church was like the mathematics true indeed but true only in the idea that is abstracted from the subject matter still there appears a very chilling want of openheartedness on the part of owen produced perhaps by the somewhat overly and certainly most ungracious resentments of baxter it was odd at least to propose concord in the tone and on the alleged ground of an old grudge   ib    i have been twentysix years convinced that dichotomizing will not do   it but that the divine trinity in unity hath expressed itself in the   whole frame of nature and morality    but he mr george lawson   had not hit on the true method of the vestigia trinitatis c  among baxters philosophical merits we ought not to overlook that the substitution of trichotomy for the old and still general plan of dichotomy in the method and disposition of logic which forms so prominent and substantial an excellence in kants critique of the pure reason of the judgment and the rest of his works belongs originally to richard baxter a century before kantand this not as a hint but as a fully evolved and systematically applied principle nay more than thisbaxter grounded it on an absolute idea presupposed in all intelligential acts whereas kant takes it only as a fact in which he seems to anticipate or suspect some yet deeper truth latent and hereafter to be discovered  on recollection however i am disposed to consider this alone as baxters peculiar claim i have not indeed any distinct memory of giordano brunos logice venatrix veritatis but doubtless the principle of trichotomy is necessarily involved in the polar logic which again is the same with the pythagorean tetractys that is the eternal fountain or source of nature and this being sacred to contemplations of identity and prior in order of thought to all division is so far from interfering with trichotomy as the universal form of division more correctly of distinctive distribution in logic that it implies it prothesis being by the very term anterior to thesis can be no part of it thus in                           prothesis                thesis              antithesis                          synthesis  we have the tetrad indeed in the intellectual and intuitive contemplation but a triad in discursive arrangement and a triunity in result 3   ib p 144  seeing the great difficulties that lie in the way of increasing charities so as to meet the increase of population or even so as to follow it and the manifold desirableness of parish churches with the material dignity that in a right state of christian order would attach to them as compared with meetinghouses chapels and the likeall more or less privati juris i have often felt disposed to wish that the large majestic church central to each given parish might have been appropriated to public prayer to the mysteries of baptism and the lords supper and to the quasi sacramenta marriage penance confirmation ordination and to the continued reading aloud or occasional chanting of the scriptures during the intervals of the different services which ought to be so often performed as to suffice successively for the whole population and that on the other hand the chapels and the like should be entirely devoted to teaching and expounding   ib p 153    and i proved to him that christianity was proved true many years   before any of the new testament was written and that so it may be   still proved by one that doubted of some words of the scripture and   therefore the true order is to try the truth of the christian   religion first and the perfect verity of the scriptures afterwards  with more than dominican virulence did goeze head pastor of the lutheran church at hamburg assail the celebrated lessing for making and supporting the same position as the pious baxter here advances  this controversy with goeze was in 1778 nearly a hundred years after baxters writing this   ib p 155    and within a few days mr barnett riding the circuit was cast by his   horse and died in the very fall and sir john medlicote and his   brother a few weeks after lay both dead in his house together  this interpreting of accidents and coincidences into judgments is a breach of charity and humility only not universal among all sects and parties of this period and common to the best and gentlest men in all we should not therefore bring it in charge against any one in particular but what excuse shall be made for the revival of this presumptuous encroachment on the divine prerogative in our days   ib p 180    near this time my book called a key for catholics was to be   reprinted in the preface to the first impression i had mentioned with   praise the earl of lauderdale    i thought best to prefix an   epistle to the duke in which i said not a word of him but truth      but the indignation that men had against the duke made some blame   me as keeping up the reputation of one whom multitudes thought very   ill of whereas i owned none of his faults and did nothing that i   could well avoid for the aforesaid reasons long after this he   professed his kindness to me and told me i should never want while he   was able and humbly entreated me to accept twenty guineas from him   which i did  this would be a curious proof of the slow and imperfect intercourse of communication between scotland and london if baxter had not been particularly informed of lauderdales horrible cruelties to the scotch covenantersand if baxter did know them he surely ran into a greater inconsistency to avoid the appearance of a less and the twenty guineas they must have smelt i should think of more than the earthly brimstone that might naturally enough have been expected in gold or silver from his palm i would as soon have plucked an ingot from the cleft of the devils hoof    greek taut élegon períthumos egô gàr mísei en ísô laudérdalon échô   kaì kerkokerônucha satan   ib p 181    about that time i had finished a book called catholic thoughts in   which i undertake to prove that besides things unrevealed known to   none and ambiguous words there is no considerable difference between   the arminians and calvinists except some very tolerable difference in   the point of perseverance  what arminians what calvinistsit is possible that the guarded language and positions of arminius himself may be interpreted into a very tolerable compatibility with the principles of the milder calvinists such as archbishop leighton that true father of the church of christ but i more than doubt the possibility of even approximating the principles of bishop jeremy taylor to the fundamental doctrines of leighton much more to those of cartwright twiss or owen   ib p 186    bishop barlow told my friend that got my papers for him that he could   hear of nothing that we judged to be sin but mere inconveniences   when as above seventeen years ago we publicly endeavoured to prove   the sinfulness even of many of the old impositions  clearly an undeterminable controversy inasmuch as there is no centradefinition possible of sin and inconvenience in religion while the exact point at which an inconvenience becoming intolerable passes into sin must depend on the state and the degree of light of the individual consciences to which it appears or becomes intolerable besides a thing may not be only indifferent in itself but may be declared such by scripture and on this indifference the scripture may have rested a prohibition to christians to judge each other on the point if yet a pope or archbishop should force this on the consciences of others for example to eat or not to eat animal food would he not sin in so doing and does scripture permit me to subscribe to an ordinance made in direct contempt of a command of scripture  if it were saidin all matters indifferent and so not sinful you must comply with lawful authoritymust i not reply but you have yourself removed the indifferency by your injunction look in popish countries for the hideous consequences of the unnatural doctrinethat the priest may go to hell for sinfully commanding and his parishioners go with him for not obeying that command   ib p 191    about this time died my dear friend mr thomas gouge of whose life   you may see a little in mr clarks last book of livesa wonder of   sincere industry in works of charity it would make a volume to recite   at large the charity he used to his poor parishioners at sepulchres   before he was ejected and silenced for nonconformity c  i cannot express how much it grieves me that our clergy should still think it fit and expedient to defend the measures of the high churchmen from laud to sheldon and to speak of the ejected ministers calamy baxter gouge howe and others as schismatics factionists fanatics or phariseesthus to flatter some halfdozen dead bishops wantonly depriving our present church of the authority of perhaps the largest collective number of learned and zealous discreet and holy ministers that one age and one church was ever blest with and whose authority in every considerable point is in favor of our church and against the present dissenters from it and this seems the more impolitic when it must be clear to every student of the history of these times that the unmanly cruelties inflicted on baxter and others were as bishops ward stillingfleet and others saw at the time part of the popish scheme of the cabal to trick the bishops and dignified clergy into rendering themselves and the established church odious to the public by laws the execution of which the king the duke arlington and the popish priests directed towards the very last man that the bishops themselves the great majority at least would have molested   appendix ii p 37    if i can prove that it hath been the universal practice of the church   in nudum apertum caput manus imponere doth it follow that this is   essential and the contrary null  how likewise can it be proved that the imposition of hands in ordination did not stand on the same ground as the imposition of hands in sickness that is the miraculous gifts of the first preachers of the gospel all protestants admit that the church retained several forms so originated after the cessation of the originating powers which were the substance of these forms   ib    if you think not only imposition to be essential but also that   nothing else is essential or that all are true ministers that are   ordained by a lawful bishop per manuum impositionem then do you   egregiously tibi ipsi imponere  baxter like most scholastic logicians had a sneaking affection for puns the cause isthe necessity of attending to the primary sense of words that is the visual image or general relation expressed and which remains common to all the after senses however widely or even incongruously differing from each other in other respects for the same reason schoolmasters are commonly punsters i have indorsed your bill sir said a pedagogue to a merchant meaning he had flogged his son williammy old master the rev james bowyer the hercules furens of the phlogistic sect but else an incomparable teacherused to translate nihil in intellectu quod non prius in sensufirst reciting the latin words and observing that they were the fundamental article of the peripatetic schoolyou must flog a boy before you can make him understandor you must lay it in at the tail before you can get it into the head   ib p 45    then that the will must follow the practical intellect whether right   or wrongthat is no precept but the nature of the soul in its   acting because that the will is potentia cæca non nata ad   intelligendum sed ad volendum vel nolendum intellectum  this is the main fault in baxters metaphysics that he so often substantiates distinctions into dividuous selfsubsistents as herefor a will not intelligent is no will   appendix iii p 55    and for many ages no other ordinarily baptised but infants if christ   had no church then where was his wisdom his love and his power   what was become of the glory of his redemption and his catholic   church that was to continue to the end  but the antipoedobaptists would deny any such consequences as applicable to them who are to act according to the circumstances in which god who ordains his successive manifestations in due correspondence with other lights and states of things has placed them he does not exclude from the church of christ say they those whom we do not accept into the communion of our particular society any more than the house of lords excludes commoners from being members of parliament and we do this becausewe think that such promiscuous admission would prolong an error which would be deadly to us though not to you who interpret the scriptures otherwise   in fine  there are two senses in which the words church of england may be usedfirst with reference to the idea of the church as an estate of this christian realm protesting against the papal usurpation comprising first the interests of a permanent learned class that is the clergysecondly those of the proper that is the infirm poor from age or sicknessand thirdly the adequate proportional instruction of all in all classes by public prayer recitation of the scriptures by expounding preaching catechizing and schooling and last not least by the example and influence of a pastor and a schoolmaster placed as a germ of civilization and cultivation in every parish throughout the land to this idea the reformed church of england with its marriable and married clergy would have approximated if the revenues of the church as they existed at the death of henry vii had been rightly transferred by his successortransferred i mean from reservoirs which had by degeneracy on the one hand and progressive improvement on the other fallen into ruin and in which those revenues had stagnated into contagion or uselessnesstransferred from what had become public evils to their original and inherent purpose of public benefits instead of being sacrilegiously alienated by a transfer to private proprietors that this was impracticable is historically true but no less true is it philosophically that this impracticability arising wholly from moral causes namely the loose manners and corrupt principles of a great majority in all classes during the dynasty of the tudors does not prevent this wholesale sacrilege from deserving the character of the first and deadliest wound inflicted on the constitution of the kingdom which term in the body politic as in bodies natural expresses not only what is and has been evolved but likewise whatever is potentially contained in the seminal principle of the particular body and which would in its due time have appeared but for emasculation in its infancy this however is the first sense of the words church of england 4  the second is the church of england as now by law established and by practice of the law actually existing that in the first sense it is the object of my admiration and the earthly ne plus ultra of my religious aspirations it were superfluous to say but i may be allowed to express my conviction that on our recurring to the same ends and objects the restoration of a national and circulating property in counterpoise of individual possession disposable and heritable though in other forms and by other means perhaps the decline or progress of this country depends in the second sense of the words i can sincerely profess that i love and honour the church of england comparatively beyond any other church established or unestablished now existing in christendom and it is wholly in consequence of this deliberate and most affectionate filial preference that i have read this work and calamys historical writings with so deep and so melancholy an interest and i dare avow that i cannot but regard as an ignorant bigot every man who especially since the publicity and authentication of the contents of the stuart papers memoirs and life of james ii c can place the far later furious high church compilations and stories of walker and others in competition with the veracity and general verity of baxter and calamy or can forget that the great body of nonconformists to whom these great and good men belonged were not dissenters from the established church willingly but an orthodox and numerous portion of the church omitting then the wound received by religion generally under henry viii and the shameless secularizations clandestinely effected during the reigns of elizabeth and the first james i am disposed to consider the three following as the grand evil epochs of our present church first the introduction and afterpredominance of latitudinarianism under the name of arminianism and the spirit of a conjoint romanism and socinianism at the latter half or towards the close of the reign of james i in the persons of montague laud and their confederates second the ejection of the two thousand ministers after the restoration with the other violences in which the churchmen made themselves the dupes of charles james the jesuits and the french court see the stuart papers passim it was this that gave consistence and enduring strength to schism in this country prevented the pacation of ireland and prepared for the separation of america at a far too early period for the true interest of either country third the surrender by the clergy of the right of taxing themselves and the jacobitical follies that combined with the former to put it in the power of the whig party to deprive the church of her convocationa bitter disgrace and wrong to which most unhappily the people were rendered indifferent by the increasing contrast of the sermons of the clergy with the articles and homilies of the church itselfbut a wrong nevertheless which already has avenged and will sooner or later be seen to avenge itself on the state and the governing classes that continue this boast of a shortsighted policy the same policy which in our own days would have funded the property of the church and by converting the clergy into salaried dependents on the government pro tempore have deprived the establishment of its fairest honor that of being neither enslaved to the court nor to the congregations the same policy alas which even now pays and patronizes a board of agriculture to undermine all landed property by a succession of false shallow and inflammatory libels against tithes  these are my weighed sentiments and fervently desiring as i do the perpetuity and prosperity of the established church zealous for its rights and dignity preferring its forms believing its articles of faith and holding its book of common prayer and its translation of the scriptures among my highest privileges as a christian and an englishman i trust that i may both entertain and avow these sentiments without forfeiting any part of my claim to the name of a faithful member of the church of england  june 1820   n b as to warburtons alliance of the church and state i object to the title alliance and to the matter and mode of the reasoning but the interdependence of the church and the state appears to me a truth of the highest practical importance let but the temporal powers protect the subjects in their just rights as subjects merely and i do not know of any one point in which the church has the right or the necessity to call in the temporal power as its ally for any purpose exclusively ecclesiastic the right of a firm to dissolve its partnership with any one partner breach of contract having been proved and publicly to announce the same is common to all men as social beings  i spoke above of romanism but call it if you like laudism or lambethism in temporalities and ceremonials and of socinianism in doctrine that is a retaining of the word but a rejecting or interpreting away of the sense and substance of the scriptural mysteries this spirit has not indeed manifested itself in the article of the trinity since waterland gave the deathblow to arianism and so left no alternative to the clergy but the actual divinity or mere humanity of our lord and the latter would be too impudent an avowal for a public reader of our church liturgy but in the articles of original sin the necessity of regeneration the necessity of redemption in order to the possibility of regeneration of justification by faith and of prevenient and auxiliary graceall i can say with sincerity is that our orthodoxy seems so far in an improving state that i can hope for the time when churchmen will use the term arminianism to express a habit of belief opposed not to calvinism or the works of calvin but to the articles of our own church and to the doctrine in which all the first reformers agreed  notethat by latitudinarianism i do not mean the particular tenets of the divines so called such as dr h more cudworth and their compeers relative to toleration comprehension and the general belief that in the greater number of points then most controverted the pious of all parties were far more nearly of the same mind than their own imperfections and the imperfection of language allowed them to see i mean the disposition to explain away the articles of the church on the pretext of their inconsistency with right reasonwhen in fact it was only an incongruity with a wrong understanding the faculty which st paul calls greek phrónaema sarkòs the rules of which having been all abstracted from objects of sense finite in time and space are logically applicable to objects of the sense alone this i have elsewhere called the spirit of socinianism which may work in many whose tenets are antisocinian  law isconclusio per regulam generis singulorum in genere isto inclusorum now the extremes et inclusa are contradictory terms therefore extreme cases are not capable subjects of law a priori but must proceed on knowledge of the past and anticipation of the future and the fulfilment of the anticipation is the proof because the only possible determination of the accuracy of the knowledge in other words the agents may be condemned or honored according to their intentions and the apparent source of their motives so we honor brutus but the extreme case itself is tried by the event    footnote 1 relliquiæ baxterianæ or mr richard baxters narrative of the most memorable passages of his

something more than humanthis it is when mr elwyn made this assertion i took it as the hyperbole of affection but now i subscribe to it seriously and bless the hour that introduced me to the knowledge of the evangelical apostolical archbishop leighton  april 1814   next to the inspired scripturesyea and as the vibration of that once struck hour remaining on the air stands leightons commentary on the 1st epistle of st peter   comment vol i p 2   their redemption and salvation by christ jesus that inheritance of   immortality bought by his blood for them and the evidence and   stability of their right and title to it  by the blood of christ i mean this i contemplate the christ  1as christus agens the jehovah christ the word  2as christus patiens the god incarnate  in the former he is relative ad intellectum humanum lux lucifica sol intelligibilis relative ad existentiam humanam anima animans calor fovens in the latter he is vita vivificans principium spiritualis id est veræ reproductionis in vitam veram now this principle or vis vitæ vitam vivificans considered in forma passiva assimilationem patiens at the same time that it excites the soul to the vital act of assimilatingthis is the blood of christ really present through faith to and actually partaken by the faithful of this the body is the continual product that is a good lifethe merits of christ acting on the soul redemptive   ib pp 1315    of their sanctification elect unto obedience c  that the doctrines asserted in this and the two or three following pages cannot be denied or explained away without removing as the modern unitarians or as the arminians unsettling and undermining the foundations of the faith i am fully convinced and equally so that nothing is gained by the change the very same logical consequences being deducible from the tenets of the church arminiansscarcely more so indeed from those which they still hold in common with luther zuinglius calvin knox and cranmer and the other fathers of the reformation in england and which are therefore most unfairly entitled calvinismthan from those which they have attempted to substitute in their place nay the shock given to the moral sense by these consequences is to my feelings aggravated in the arminian doctrine by the thin yet dishonest disguise meantime the consequences appear to me in point of logic legitimately concluded from the terms of the premisses what shall we say then where lies the fault in the original doctrines expressed in the premisses god forbid in the particular deductions logically considered but these we have found legitimate where then i answer in deducing any consequences by such a process and according to such rules the rules are alien and inapplicable the process presumptuous yea preposterous the error greek to prôton pseudos lies in the false assumption of a logical deducibility at all in this instance  firstbecause the terms from which the conclusion must be drawntermini in majore præmissi a quibus scientialiter et scientifice demonstrandum erat are accommodations and not scientificthat is proper and adequate not per idem but per quam maxime simile or rather quam maxime dissimile  secondlybecause the truths in question are transcendant and have their evidence if any in the ideas themselves and for the reason and do not and cannot derive it from the conceptions of the understanding which cannot comprehend the truths but is to be comprehended in and by them john i 5  lastly and chieflybecause these truths as they do not originate in the intellective faculty of man so neither are they addressed primarily to our intellect but are substantiated for us by their correspondence to the wants cravings and interests of the moral being for which they were given and without which they would be devoid of all meaningvox et præterea nihil the only conclusions therefore that can be drawn from them must be such as are implied in the origin and purpose of their revelation and the legitimacy of all conclusions must be tried by their consistency with those moral interests those spiritual necessities which are the proper final cause of the truths and of our faith therein for some of the faithful these truths have i doubt not an evidence of reason but for the whole household of faith their certainty is in their working now it is this by which in all cases we know and determine existence in the first instance that which works in us or on us exists for us the shapes and forms that follow the working as its results or products whether the shapes cognizable by sense or the forms distinguished by the intellect are after all but the particularizations of this working its proper names as it were as john james peter in respect of human nature they are all derived from the relations in which finite beings stand to each other and are therefore heterogeneous and except by accommodation devoid of meaning and purpose when applied to the working in and by which god makes his existence known to us and we may presume to say especially exists for the soul in whom he thus works on these grounds therefore i hold the doctrines of original sin the redemption therefrom by the cross of christ and change of heart as the consequent without adopting the additions to the doctrines inferred by one set of divines the modern calvinists or acknowledging the consequences burdened on the doctrines by their antagonists nor is this my faith fairly liable to any inconvenience if only it be remembered that it is a spiritual working of which i speak and a spiritual knowledgenot through the medium of image the seeking after which is superstition nor yet by any sensation the watching for which is enthusiasm and the conceit of its presence fanatical distemperature do the will of the father and ye shall know it  we must distinguish the life and the soul though there is a certain sense in which the life may be called the soul that is the life is the soul of the body but the soul is the life of the man and christ is the life of the soul now the spirit of man the spirit subsistent is deeper than both not only deeper than the body and its life but deeper than the soul and the spirit descendent and supersistent is higher than both in the regenerated man the height and the depth become onethe spirit communeth with the spiritand the soul is the interens or ens intermedium between the life and the spiritthe participium not as a compound however but as a medium indifferensin the same sense in which heat may be designated as the indifference between light and gravity and what is the reasonthe spirit in its presence to the understanding abstractedly from its presence in the willnay in many during the negation of the latter the spirit present to man but not appropriated by him is the reason of manthe reason in the process of its identification with the will is the spirit   ib pp 634    can we deny that it is unbelief of those things that causeth this   neglect and forgetting of them the discourse the tongue of men and   angels cannot beget divine belief of the happiness to come only he   that gives it gives faith likewise to apprehend it and lay hold upon   it and upon our believing to be filled with joy in the hopes of it   most true most true   ib p 68    in spiritual trials that are the sharpest and most fiery of all when   the furnace is within a man when god doth not only shut up his   lovingkindness from its feeling but seems to shut it up in hot   displeasure when he writes bitter things against it yet then to   depend upon him and wait for his salvation this is not only a true   but a strong and very refined faith indeed and the more he smites   the more to cleave to him    though i saw as it were his hand   lifted up to destroy me yet from that same hand would i expect   salvation  bless god o my soul for this sweet and strong comforter it is the honey in the lion   ib p 75    this natural men may discourse of and that very knowingly and give a   kind of natural credit to it as to a history that may be true but   firmly to believe that there is divine truth in all these things and   to have a persuasion of it stronger than of the very things we see   with our eyes such an assent as this is the peculiar work of the   spirit of god and is certainly saving faith  lord i believe help thou my unbelief my reason acquiesces and i believe enough to fear o grant me the belief that brings sweet hope   ib p 76    faith   causes the soul to find all that is spoken of him in the   word and his beauty there represented to be abundantly true makes   it really taste of his sweetness and by that possesses the heart more   strongly with his love persuading it of the truth of those things   not by reasons and arguments but by an inexpressible kind of   evidence that they only know that have it  either this is true or religion is not religion that is it adds nothing to our human reason non religat grant it grant it me o lord   ib pp 1045    this sweet stream of their doctrine did as the rivers make its own   banks fertile and pleasant as it ran by and flowed still forward to   after ages and by the confluence of more such prophecies grew greater   as it went till it fell in with the main current of the gospel in the   new testament both acted and preached by the great prophet himself   whom they foretold to come and recorded by his apostles and   evangelists and thus united into one river clear as crystal this   doctrine of salvation in the scriptures hath still refreshed the city   of god his church under the gospel and still shall do so till it   empty itself into the ocean of eternity  in the whole course of my studies i do not remember to have read so beautiful an allegory as this so various and detailed and yet so just and natural   ib p 121    there is a truth in it that all sin arises from some kind of   ignorance    for were the true visage of sin seen at a full light   undressed and unpainted it were impossible while it so appeared   that any one soul could be in love with it but would rather flee from   it as hideous and abominable  this is the only defect shall i say no but the only omission i have felt in this divine writerfor him we understand by feeling experimentallythat he doth not notice the horrible tyranny of habit what the archbishop says is most true of beginners in sin but this is the foretaste of hell to see and loathe the deformity of the wedded vice and yet still to embrace and nourish it   ib p 122    he calls those times wherein christ was unknown to them the times of   their ignorance though the stars shine never so bright and the moon   with them in its full yet they do not altogether make it day still   it is night till the sun appear  how beautiful and yet how simple and as it were unconscious of its own beauty   ib p 124    you were running to destruction in the way of sin and there was a   voice together with the gospel preaching to your ear that spake into   your heart and called you back from that path of death to the way of   holiness which is the only way of life he hath severed you from the   mass of the profane world and picked you out to be jewels for   himself  o how divine surely nothing less than the spirit of christ could have inspired such thoughts in such language other divinesdonne and jeremy taylor for instancehave converted their worldly gifts and applied them to holy ends but here the gifts themselves seem unearthly   ib p 138    as in religion so in the course and practice of mens lives the   stream of sin runs from one age to another and every age makes it   greater adding somewhat to what it receives as rivers grow in their   course by the accession of brooks that fall into them and every man   when he is born falls like a drop into this main current of   corruption and so is carried down it and this by reason of its   strength and his own nature which willingly dissolves into it and   runs along with it  in this single period we have religion the spiritphilosophy the souland poetry the body and drapery unitedplato glorified by st paul and yet coming as unostentatiously as any speech from an innocent girl of fifteen   ib p 158    the chief point of obedience is believing the proper obedience to   truth is to give credit to it  this is not quite so perspicuous and singlesensed as archbishop leightons sentences in general are this effect is occasioned by the omission of the word this or divine or the truth in christ for truth in the ordinary and scientific sense is received by a spontaneous rather than chosen by a voluntary act and the apprehension of the same belief supposes a position of congruity rather than an act of obedience far otherwise is it with the truth that is the object of christian faith and it is this truth of which leighton is speaking belief indeed is a living part of this faith but only as long as it is a living part in other words belief is implied in faith but faith is not necessarily implied in belief the devils believe   ib p 166    hence learn that true conversion is not so slight a work as we   commonly account it it is not the outward change of some bad customs   which gains the name of a reformed man in the ordinary dialect it is   new birth and being and elsewhere called a new creation though it   be but a change in qualities yet it is such a one and the qualities   so far distant from what they before were c  i dare not affirm that this is erroneously said but it is one of the comparatively few passages that are of service as reminding me that it is not the scripture that i am reading not the qualities merely but the root of the qualities is transcreated how else could it be a birtha creation   ib p 170    this natural life is compared even by natural men to the vainest   things and scarce find they things light enough to express it vain   and as it is here called grass so they compare the generations of men   to the leaves of trees    man that is born of a woman is of few   days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut   down job xiv 1 2 psalm xc 12 xxxix 4  it is the fashion to decry scholastic distinctions as useless subtleties or mere phantomsentia logica vel etiam verbalia solum and yet in order to secure a safe and christian interpretation to these and numerous other passages of like phrase and import in the old testament it is of highest concernment that we should distinguish the personeity or spirit as the source and principle of personality from the person itself as the particular product at any one period and as that which cannot be evolved or sustained but by the coagency of the system and circumstances in which the individuals are placed in this latter sense it is that man is used in the psalms in job and elsewhereand the term made synonymous with flesh that which constitutes the spirit in man both for others and itself is the real man and to this the elements and elementary powers contribute its bulk greek tò videri et tangi wholly and its phenomenal form in part both as coefficients and as conditions now as these are under a law of vanity and incessant changegreek tà màe ónta all aèi ginómenaso must all be to the production and continuance of which they are indispensable on this hangs the doctrine of the resurrection of the body as an essential part of the doctrine of immortalityon this the scriptural and only true and philosophical sense of the soul psyche or life as resulting from the continual assurgency of the spirit through the bodyand on this the begetting of a new life a regenerate soul by the descent of the divine spirit on the spirit of man when the spirit by sanctification is fitted for an incorruptible body then shall it be raised into a world of incorruption and a celestial body shall burgeon forth thereto the germ of which had been implanted by the redeeming and creative word in this world truly hath it been said of the electthey fall asleep in earth but awake in heaven so st paul expressly teaches and as the passage 1 cor xv 3554 was written for the express purpose of rectifying the notions of the converts concerning the resurrection all other passages in the new testament must be interpreted in harmony with it but john likewisedescribing the same great event as subsequent to and contradistinguished from the partial or millennary resurrectionwhich whether we are to understand the apostle symbolically or literally is to take place in the present worldbeholds a new earth and a new heaven as antecedent to or coincident with the appearance of the new jerusalemthat is the state of glory and the resurrection to life everlasting the old earth and its heaven had passed away from the face of him on the throne at the moment that it gave up the dead rev xxxxi   ib pp 1745    but the word of the lord endureth for ever    and with respect to those learned men that apply the text to god i   remember not that this abiding for ever is used to express gods   eternity in himself  no nor is it here used for that purpose but yet i cannot doubt but that either the word greek ho lógos en archae or the divine promises in and through the incarnate word with the gracious influences proceeding from him are here meantand not the written greek rháemata or scriptures   ib p 194    if any ones head or tongue should grow apace and all the rest stand   at a stay it would certainly make him a monster and they are no   other that are knowing and discovering christians and grow daily in   that but not at all in holiness of heart and life which is the   proper growth of the children of god  father in heaven have mercy on me christ lamb of god have mercy on me save me lord or i perish alas i am perishing   ib p 200    a wellfurnished table may please a man while he hath health and   appetite but offer it to him in the height of a fever how unpleasant   it would be then though never so richly decked it is then not only   useless but hateful to him but the kindness and love of god is then   as seasonable and refreshing to him as in health and possibly more  to the regeneratebut to the conscious sinner a source of terrors insupportable   ib p 211    these things hold likewise in the other stones of this building   chosen before time all that should be of this building are   foreordained in gods purpose all written in that book beforehand   and then in due time they are chosen by actual calling according to   that purpose hewed out and severed by gods own hand from the quarry   of corrupt naturedead stones in themselves as the rest but made   living by his bringing them to christ and so made truly precious   and accounted precious by him that hath made them so  though this is not only true but a most important truth it would yet have been well to have obviated the apparent carnal consequences   ib p 216    all sacrifice is not taken away but it is changed from the offering   of those things formerly in use to spiritual sacrifices now these   are every way preferable they are easier and cheaper to us and yet   more precious and acceptable to god  still understandto the regenerate to others they are not only not easy and cheap but unpurchaseable and impossible too o god have mercy upon me   ib p 229    though i be beset on all hands be accused by the law and mine own   conscience and by satan and have nothing to answer for myself yet   here i will stay for i am sure in him there is salvation and no   where else  here i will stay but alas the poor sinner has forfeited the powers of willing miserable wishing is all he can command o the dreadful injury of an irreligious education to be taught our prayers and the awful truths of religion in the same tone in which we are taught the latin grammarand too often inspiring the same sensations of weariness and disgust   vol ii p 242    and thus are reproaches mentioned amongst the sufferings of christ in   the gospel and not as the least the railings and mockings that were   darted at him and fixed to the cross are mentioned more than the   very nails that fixed him and heb xii 2 the shame of the   cross though he was above it and despised it yet that shame added   much to the burden of it  i understand leighton thus that though our lord felt it not as shame nor was wounded by the revilings of the people in the way of any correspondent resentment or sting which yet we may be without blame yet he suffered from the same as sin and as an addition to the guilt of his persecutors which could not but aggravate the burden which he had taken on himself as being sin in its most devilish form   ib p 293    this therefore is mainly to be studied that the seat of humility be   the heart although it will be seen in the carriage yet as little as   it can    and this i would recommend as a safe way ever let thy   thoughts concerning thyself be below what thou utterest and what thou   seest needful or fitting to say to thy own abasement be not only   content which most are not to be taken at thy word and believed to   be such by them that hear thee but be desirous of it and let that be   the end of thy speech to persuade them and gain it of them that   they really take thee for as worthless a man as thou dost express   thyself  alas this is a most delicate and difficult subject and the safest way and the only safe general rule is the silence that accompanies the inward act of looking at the contrast in all that is of our own doing and impulse so may praises be made their own antidote   vol iii p 20 serm i    they shall see god what this is we cannot tell you nor can you   conceive it but walk heavenwards in purity and long to be there   where you shall know what it means for you shall know him as he is  we say now i see the full meaning force and beauty of a passagewe see them through the words is not christ the wordthe substantial consubstantial word greek ho ôn eis tòn kólpon tou patrósnot as our words arbitrary nor even as the words of nature phenomenal merely if even through the words a powerful and perspicuous authoras in the next to inspired commentary of archbishop leightonfor whom god be praisedi identify myself with the excellent writer and his thoughts become my thoughts what must not the blessing be to be thus identified first with the filial word and then with the father in and through him   ib p 63 serm v    in this elementary world light being as we hear the first visible   all things are seen by it and it by itself thus is christ among   spiritual things in the elect world of his church all things are   made manifest by the light says the apostle eph v 13 speaking   of christ as the following verse doth evidently testify it is in his   word that he shines and makes it a directing and convincing light to   discover all things that concern his church and himself to be known   by its own brightness how impertinent then is that question so much   tossed by the romish church how know you the scriptures say they   to be the word of god without the testimony of the church i would   ask one of them again how they can know that it is daylight except   some light a candle to let them see it they are little versed in   scripture that know not that it is frequently called light and they   are senseless that know not that light is seen and known by itself   if our gospel be hid says the apostle it is hid to them that   perish the god of this world having blinded their minds against the   light of the glorious gospel no wonder if such stand in need of a   testimony a blind man knows not that it is light at noonday but by   report but to those that have eyes light is seen by itself  on the true test of the scriptures oh were it not for my manifold infirmities whereby i am so all unlike the whiterobed leighton i could almost conceit that my soul had been an emanation from his so many and so remarkable are the coincidences and these in parts of his works that i could not have seenand so uniform the congruity of the whole as i read i seem to myself to be only thinking my own thoughts over again now in the same and now in a different order   ib p 68    the author of the epistle to the hebrews calls him christ greek   apaúgasma the brightness of his fathers glory and the character   of his person i 3 and under these expressions lies that   remarkable mystery of the sons eternal relation to the father which   is rather humbly to be adored than boldly to be explained either by   gods perfect understanding of his own essence or by any other   notion  certainly not by a transfer of a notion and this too a notion of a faculty itself but notional and limitary to the supreme reality but there are ideas which are of higher origin than the notions of the understanding and by the irradiation of which the understanding itself becomes a human understanding of such veritates verificæ leighton himself in other words speaks often surely there must have been an intelligible propriety in the terms logos word begotten before all creationan adequate idea or icon or the evangelists and apostolic penmen would not have adopted them they did not invent the terms but took them and used them as they were taken and applied by philo and both the greek and oriental sages nay the precise and orthodox yet frequent use of these terms by philo and by the jewish authors of that traditionalæ wisdomdegraded in after times but which in its purest parts existed long before the christian ærais the strongest extrinsic argument against the arians socinians and unitarians in proof that st john must have meant to deceive his readers if he did not use them in the known and received sense to a materialist indeed or to those who deny all knowledges not resolvable into notices from the five senses these terms as applied to spiritual beings must appear inexplicable or senseless but so must spirit to me why do i say to me to bull to waterland to gregory nazianzen basil athanasius augustine the terms word and generation have appeared admirably yea most awfully pregnant and appropriatebut still as the language of those who know that they are placed with their backs to substancesand which therefore they can name only from the correspondent shadowsyet not god forbid as if the substances were the same as the shadowswhich yet leighton supposed in this his censurefor if he did not he then censures himself and a number of his most beautiful passages these and two or three other sentencesslips of human infirmityare useful in reminding me that leightons works are not inspired scripture   postscript  on a second consideration of this passage and a revisal of my marginal animadversionyet how dare i apply such a word to a passage written by a minister of christ so clearly under the especial light of the divine grace as was archbishop leightoni am inclined to think that leighton confined his censure to the attempts to explain the trinityand this by notionsand not to the assertion of the adorable acts implied in the terms both of the evangelists and apostles and of the church before as well as after christs ascension nor to the assent of the pure reason to the truths and more than assent to the affirmation of the ideas   ib p 73  this fifth sermon excellent in parts is yet on the whole the least excellent of leightons worksand breathes less of either his own character as a man or the character of his religious philosophy the style too is in many places below leightons ordinary stylein some places even turbid operose and catechresticfor exampleto trample on smilings with one foot and on frownings with the other   ib p 77 serm vi  leighton i presume was acquainted with the hebrew language but he does not appear to have studied it much his observation on the heart as used in the old testament shews that he did not know that the ancient hebrews supposed the heart to be the seat of intellect and therefore used it exactly as we use the head   ib p 104 serm vii  this seventh sermon is admirable throughout leighton throughout o what a contrast might be presented by publishing some discourse of some court divine south for instance preached under the same state of affairs and printing the two in columns   ib p 107 serm viii    in all love three things are necessary some goodness in the object   either true and real or apparent and seeming to be so for the soul   be it ever so evil can affect nothing but which it takes in some way   to be good  this assertion in these words has been so often made from platos times to ours that even wise men repeat it without perhaps much examination whether it be not equivocalor rather i suspect true only in that sense in which it would amount to nothingnothing to the purpose at least this is to be regrettedfor it is a mischievous equivoque to make good a synonyme of pleasant or even the genus of which pleasure is a species it is a grievous mistake to say that bad men seek pleasure because it is good no like children they call it good because it is pleasant even the useful must derive its meaning from the good not vice versa   postscript  the lines in p 107 noted by me are one of a myriad instances to prove how rash it is to quote single sentences or assertions from the correctest writers without collating them with the known system or express convictions of the author it would be easy to cite fifty passages from archbishop leightons works in direct contradiction to the sentence in questionwhich he had learnt in the schools when a lad and afterwards had heard and met with so often that he was not aware that he had never sifted its real purport this eighth sermon is another most admirable discourse   ib serm ix p 12    the reasonable creature it is true hath more liberty in its actions   freely choosing one thing and rejecting another yet it cannot be   denied that in acting of that liberty their choice and refusal   a follow the sway of their nature and condition  a i would fain substitute for follow the words are most often determined and always affected by i do not deny that the will follows the nature but then the nature itself is a will   ib    as the angels and glorified souls their nature being perfectly holy   and unalterably such they cannot sin they can delight in nothing   but obeying and praising that god in the enjoyment of whom their   happiness consisteth  if angels be other than spirits made perfect or as leighton writes glorified soulsthe unalterable by nature seems to me rashly asserted   ib    the mind greek phrónaema some render it the prudence or wisdom of   the flesh here you have it the carnal mind but the word signifies   indeed an act of the mind rather than either the faculty itself or   the habit of prudence in it so as it discovers what is the frame of   both those  i doubt greek phrónaema signifies an act and so far i agree with leighton but greek phrónaema sarkòs is the flesh that is the natural man in the act or habitude of mindingbut those acts taken collectively are the facultythe understanding  how often have i found reason to regret that leighton had not clearly made out to himself the diversity of reason and the understanding   ib serm xv p 196    a narrow enthralled heart fettered with the love of lower things and   cleaving to some particular sins or but some one and that secret   may keep foot a while in the way of gods commandments in some steps   of them but it must give up quickly is not able to run on to the end   of the goal  one of the blessed privileges of the spiritual man and such leighton was is a piercing insight into the diseases of which he himself is clear greek eléaeson kyrie   ib serm xvi p 204    know you not that the redeemed of christ and he are one they live one   life christ lives in them and if any man hath not the spirit of   christ he is none of his as the apostle declares in this chapter   so then this we are plainly to tell you and consider it you that   will not let go your sins to lay hold on christ have as yet no share   in him    but on the other side the truth is that when souls are once set upon   this search they commonly wind the notion too high and subtilize too   much in the dispute and so entangle and perplex themselves and drive   themselves further off from that comfort that they are seeking after   such measures and marks they set to themselves for their rule and   standard and unless they find those without all controversy in   themselves they will not believe that they have an interest in   christ and this blessed and safe estate in him    to such i would only say are you in a willing league with any known   sin c  an admirable antidote for such as too sober and sincere to pass off feverous sensations for spiritualities have been perplexed by wesleys assertionsthat a certainty of having been elected is an indispensable mark of election whitfields ultracalvinism is gospel gentleness and pauline sobriety compared with wesleys arminianism in the outset of his career but the main and most noticeable difference between leighton and the modern methodists is to be found in the uniform selfishness of the latter not do you wish to love god do you love your neighbour do you think o how dear and lovely must christ bebutare you certain that christ has saved you that he died for youyouyou yourself on to the end of the chapter this is wesleys doctrine   lecture ix vol iv p 96    for that this was his fixed purpose lucretius not only vows but also   boasts of it and loads him epicurus with illadvised praises for   endeavouring through the whole course of his philosophy to free the   minds of men from all the bonds and ties of religion  but surely in this passage religio must be rendered superstition the most effectual means for the removal of which epicurus supposed himself to have found in the exclusion of the gods many and lords many from their imagined agency in all the phænomena of nature and the events of history substituting for these the belief in fixed laws having in themselves their evidence and necessity on this account in this passage at least lucretius praises his master   ib p 105    they always seemed to me to act a very ridiculous part who contend   that the effect of the divine decree is absolutely irreconcilable with   human liberty because the natural and necessary liberty of a rational   creature is to act or choose from a rational motive or spontaneously   and of purpose but who sees not that on the supposition of the most   absolute decree this liberty is not taken away but rather   established and confirmed for the decree is that such an one shall   make choice of or do some particular thing freely and whoever   pretends to deny that whatever is done or chosen whether good or   indifferent is so done or chosen or at least may be so espouses   an absurdity  i fear i fear that this is a sophism not worthy of archbishop leighton it seems to me tantamount to sayingi force that man to do so or so without my forcing him but however that may be the following sentences are more precious than diamonds they are divine   ib lect xi p 113    for that this world compounded of so many and such heterogeneous   parts should proceed by way of natural and necessary emanation from   that one first present and most simple nature nobody i imagine   could believe or in the least suspect    but if he produced all   these things freely   how much more consistent is it to believe   that this was done in time than to imagine it was from eternity  it is inconceivable how any thing can be created in time and production is incompatible with interspace   ib lect xv p 152    the platonists divide the world into two the sensible and   intellectual world    according to this hypothesis those parables   and metaphors which are often taken from natural things to illustrate   such as are divine will not be similitudes taken entirely at   pleasure but are often in a great measure founded in nature and   the things themselves  i have asserted the same thing and more fully shown wherein the difference consists of symbolic and metaphorical in my first lay sermon and the substantial correspondence of the genuine platonic doctrine and logic with those of lord bacon in my essays on method in the friend 2   ib lect xix p 201    even the philosophers give their testimony to this truth and their   sentiments on the subject are not altogether to be rejected for they   almost unanimously are agreed that felicity so far as it can be   enjoyed in this life consists solely or at least principally in   virtue but as to their assertion that this virtue is perfect in a   perfect life it is rather expressing what were to be wished than   describing things as they are  and why are the philosophers to be judged according to a different rule on what ground can it be asserted that the stoics believed in the actual existence of their godlike perfection in any individual or that they meant more than thisto no man can the name of the wise be given in its absolute sense who is not perfect even as his father in heaven is perfect   ib lect xxi p 225    in like manner if we suppose god to be the first of all beings we   must unavoidably therefrom conclude his unity as to the ineffable   trinity subsisting in this unity a mystery discovered only by the   sacred scriptures especially in the new testament where it is more   clearly revealed than in the old let others boldly pry into it if   they please while we receive it with our humble faith and think it   sufficient for us to admire and adore  but surely it having been revealed to us we may venture to saythat a positive unity so far from excluding implies plurality and that the godhead is a fulness greek plaeroma   ib lect xxiv p 245    ask yourselves therefore what you would be at and with what   dispositions you come to this most sacred table  in an age of colloquial idioms when to write in a loose slang had become a mark of loyalty this is the only lestrange vulgarism i have met with in leighton   ib exhortation to the students p 252    study to acquire such a philosophy as is not barren and babbling but   solid and true not such a one as floats upon the surface of endless   verbal controversies but one that enters into the nature of things   for he spoke good sense that said the philosophy of the greeks was a   mere jargon and noise of words  if so then so is all philosophy for what system is there the elements and outlines of which are not to be found in the greek schools here leighton followed too incautiously the fathers    footnote 1 works of leighton 4 vols 8vo london 1819 ed   footnote 2 statesmans manual p 230 2nd edit friend iii 3d edit ed                                               notes on sherlocks vindication of the doctrine of the trinity 1   sect i p 3    some new philosophers will tell you that the notion of a spirit or an   immaterial substance is a contradiction for by substance they   understand nothing but matter and then an immaterial substance is   immaterial matter that is matter and no matter which is a   contradiction but yet this does not prove an immaterial substance to   be a contradiction unless they could first prove that there is no   substance but matter and that they cannot conceive any other   substance but matter does not prove that there is no other  certainly not but if not only they but dr sherlock himself and all mankind are incapable of attaching any sense to the term substance but that of matterthen for us it would be a contradiction or a groundless assertion thus by substance i do not mean the only notion we can attach to the word but a somewhat i know not what may for aught i know not be contradictory to spirit why should we use the equivocal word substance after all but an ens logicum instead of the definite term selfsubsistent we are equally conscious of mind and of that which we call body and the only possible philosophical questions are these three  1 are they coordinate as agent and reagent  2 or is the one subordinate to the other as effect to cause and which is the cause or ground which the effect or product  3 or are they coordinate but not interdependent that is per harmonium præstabilitam   ib p 4    now so far as we understand the nature of any being we can certainly   tell what is contrary and contradictious to its nature as that   accidents should subsist without their subject c  that accidents should subsist rather exist without a subject may be a contradiction but not that they exist without this or that subject the words their subject are a petitio principii   ib    these and such like are the manifest absurdities and contradictions of   transubstantiation and we know that they are so because we know the   nature of a body c  indeed were i either romanist or unitarian i should desire no better than the admission of body having an esse not in the percipi and really subsisting greek autò tò chraema as the supporter of its accidents at all events the romanist declaring the accidents to be those ordinarily impressed on the senses greek tà phaínomena kaì aísthaeta by bread and wine does at the same time declare the flesh and blood not to be the greek phaínomena kaì aísthaeta so called but the greek noúmena kaì autà tà chráemata there is therefore no contradiction in the terms however reasonless the doctrine may be and however unnecessary the interpretation on which it is pretended i confess had i been in luthers place i would not have rested so much of my quarrel with the papists on this point nor can i agree with our arminian divines in their ridicule of transubstantiation the most rational doctrine is perhaps for some purposes at least the rem credimus modum nescimus next to that the doctrine of the sacramentaries that it is signum sub rei nomine as when we call a portrait of caius caius but of all the remainder impanation consubstantiation and the like i confess that i should prefer the transubstantiation of the pontifical doctors   ib p 6    the proof of this comes to this one point that we may have sufficient   evidence of the being of a thing whose nature we cannot conceive and   comprehend he who will not own this contradicts the sense and   experience of mankind and he who confesses this and yet rejects the   belief of that which he has good evidence for merely because he   cannot conceive it is a very absurd and senseless infidel  here again though a zealous believer of the truth asserted i must object to the bishops logic none but the weakest men have objected to the triunity merely because the modus is above their comprehension for so is the influence of thought on muscular motion so is life itself so in short is every first truth of necessity for to comprehend a thing is to know its antecedent and consequent but they affirm that it is against their reason besides there seems an equivocation in the use of comprehend and conceive in the same meaning when a man tells me that his will can lift his arm i conceive his meaning though i do not comprehend the fact i understand him but the socinians saywe do not understand you we cannot attach to the word god more than three possible meanings either  1 a person or selfconscious being  2 or a thing  3 or a quality property or attribute  if you take the first then you admit the contradiction if either of the latter two you have not three persons and one god but three persons having equal shares in one thing or three with the same attributes that is three gods sherlock does not meet this  let me repeat the difficulty if possible more clearly the argument of the philosophic unitarians as wissowatius who mistaken as they were are not to be confounded with their degenerate successors the priestleyans and belshamites may be thus expressed by the term god we can only conceive you to suppose one or other of three meanings  1 either you understand by it a person in the common sense of an intelligent or selfconscious beingor  2 a thing with its qualities and propertiesor  3 certain powers and attributes comprised under the word nature  if we suppose the first the contradiction is manifest and you yourselves admit it and therefore forbid us so to interpret your words for if by god you mean person then three persons and one god would be the same as three persons and one person if we take the second as your meaning as an infinite thing is an absurdity we have three finite gods like jupiter neptune and pluto who shared the universe between them if the latter we have three persons with the same attributes and if a person with infinite attributes be what we mean by god then we have either three gods or involve the contradiction above mentioned it is unphilosophic by admission of all philosophers they add to multiply causes beyond the necessity now if there are three persons of infinite and the same attributes dismiss two and you lose nothing but a numerical phantom  the answer to this must commence by a denial of the premisses in toto and this both bull and waterland have done most successfully but i very much doubt whether sherlock on his principles could have evaded the unitarian logic in fact it is scarcely possible to acquit him altogether of a quasitritheism   sect ii p 13    for like as we are compelled by the christian verity to acknowledge   every person by himself to be god and lord  that is by especial revelation    so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say there are three   gods or three lords  that is by the religion contained in and given in accompaniment with the universal reason the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world   ib p 14    this creed athanasian does not pretend to explain how there are   three persons each of which is god and yet but one god of which   more hereafter but only asserts the thing that thus it is and thus   it must be if we believe a trinity in unity which should make all   men who would be thought neither arians nor socinians more cautious   how they express the least dislike of the athanasian creed which must   either argue that they condemn it before they understand it or that   they have some secret dislike to the doctrine of the trinity  the dislike commonly felt is not of the doctrine of the trinity but of the positive anathematic assertion of the everlasting perdition of all and of each who doubt the samean assertion deduced from scripture only by a train of captious consequences and equivocations thus a i honour and admire caius for his great learning b the knowledge of the sanscrit is an important article in caiuss learning a i have been often in his company and have found no reason for believing this b o then you deny his learning are envious and caiuss enemy a god forbid i love and admire him i know him for a transcendant linguist in the hebrew greek latin and modern european languagesand with or without the sanscrit i look up to him and rely on his erudition in all cases in which i am concerned and it is this perfect trust this unfeigned respect that is the appointed criterion of caiuss friends and disciples and not their full acquaintance with each and all particulars of his superiority thus without christ or in any other power but that of christ and subjectively of faith in christ no man can be saved but does it follow that no man can have christian faith who is ignorant or erroneous as to any one point of christian theology will a soul be condemned to everlasting perdition for want of logical acumen in the perception of consequencesif he verily embrace christ as his redeemer and unfeignedly feel in himself the necessity of redemption he implicitly holds the divinity of christ whatever from want or defect of logic may be his notion explicite   ib p 18    but the whole three persons are coeternal and coequal and yet   this we must acknowledge to be true if we acknowledge all three   persons to be eternal for in eternity there can be no afore or   after other  it must however be considered as a serious defect in a creed if excluding subordination without mentioning any particular form it gives no hint of any other form in which it admits it the only minus admitted by the athanasian creed is the inferiority of christs humanity to the divinity generally but both scripture and the nicene creed teach a subordination of the son to the father independent of the incarnation of the son now this is not inserted and therefore the denial in the assertion none is greater or less than another is universal and a plain contradiction of christ speaking of himself as the coeternal son my father is greater than i speaking of himself as the coeternal son i sayfor how superfluous would it have been a truism how unworthy of our lord to have said in effect that a creature is less than god and after all creeds assuredly are not to be imposed ad libituma new creed or at least a new form and choice of articles and expressions at the pleasure of individuals now where is the authority of the athanasian creed in what consists its necessity if it be the same as the nicene why not be content with the nicene if it differs how dare we retain both 2 if the athanasian does not say more or different but only differs by omission of a necessary article then to impose it is as absurd as to force a mutilated copy on one who has already the perfect original lastly it is not enough that an abstract contains nothing which may not by a chain of consequences be deduced from the books of the evangelists and apostles in order for it to be a creed for the whole christian church for a creed is or ought to be a syllepsis of those primary fundamental truths that are as it were the startingpost from which the christian must commence his progression the fullgrown christian needs no other creed than the scriptures themselves highly valuable is the nicene creed but it has its chief value as an historical document proving that the same texts in scripture received the same interpretation while the greek was a living language as now   sect iii p 23    if what he says is true he that errs in a question of faith after   having used reasonable diligence to be rightly informed is in no   fault at all how comes an atheist or an infidel a turk or a jew   to be in any fault does our author think that no atheist or infidel   no unbelieving jew or heathen ever used reasonable diligence to be   rightly informed    if you say he confines this to such points as   have always been controverted in the churches of god i desire to know   a reason why he thus confines it for does not his reason equally   extend to the christian faith itself as to those points which have   been controverted in christian churches  and the notary might ask in his turn do you believe that the christians either of the greek or of the western church will be damned according as the truth may be respecting the procession of the holy ghost or that either the sacramentary or the lutheran or again the consubstantiationist or the transubstantiationist if not why do you stop here whence this sudden palsy in the limbs of your charity again does this eternal damnation of the individual depend on the supposed importance of the article denied or on the moral state of the individual on the inward source of this denial and lastly who authorized either you or the pseudoathanasius to interpret catholic faith by belief arising out of the apparent predominance of the grounds for over those against the truth of the positions asserted much more by belief as a mere passive acquiescence of the understanding were all damned who died during the period when totus fere mundus factus est arianus as one of the fathers admits alas alas how long will it be ere christians take the plain middle road between intolerance and indifference by adopting the literal sense and scriptural import of heresy that is wilful error or belief originating in some perversion of the will and of heretics for such there are nay even orthodox heretics that is men wilfully unconscious of their own wilfulness in their limpetlike adhesion to a favourite tenet   ib p 26    all christians must confess that there is no other name given under   heaven whereby men can be saved but only the name of christ  now this is a most awful question on which depends whether christ was more than socrates for to bring god from heaven to reproclaim the ten commandments is too too ridiculous need i say i incline to sherlock but yet i cannot give to faith the meaning he does though i give it all and more than all the power but if that name as power saved the jewish church before they knew the name as name how much more now if only the will be not guiltily averse any miracle does in kind as truly bring god from heaven as the incarnation which the socinians wholly forget as in other points they receive without scruple what they have learned without examination and then transfer to the first article which they do look into all the difficulties that belong equally to the former as the simonidean doubts concerning god to the trinity and the like   ib p 27  the eclectic neoplatonists sallustius and others justified their polytheism on much the same pretext as is in fact involved in the language of this page greek polloì mèn en dè mia theótaeti this indeed seems to me decisive in favour of waterlands scheme against this of sherlocksnamely that in the latter we find no sufficient reason why in the nature of things this intermutual consciousness might not be possessed by thirty instead of three it seems a strange confounding greek hetéron genéôn to answer true but the latter only happens to be the factjust as if we were speaking of the number of persons in the privy council   ib p 28    notes by keeping this faith whole and undefiled must be meant   that a man should believe and profess it without adding to it or   taking from it    first for adding what if an honest plain man   because he is a christian and a protestant should think it necessary   to add this article to the athanasian creedi believe the holy   scriptures of the old and new testament to be a divine infallible and   complete rule both for faith and manners i hope no protestant would   think a man damned for such addition and if so then this creed of   athanasius is at least an unnecessary rule of faith    answer that is to say it is an addition to the catholic faith to   own the scriptures to be the rule of faith as if it were an addition   to the laws of england to own the original records of them in the   tower  this notary manages his cause most weakly and sherlock fibs him like a scientific pugilist but he himself exposes weak parts as in p 27 the objection to the athanasian creed urged by better men than the notary yea by divines not less orthodox than sherlock himself is this not that this creed adds to the scriptures but that it adds to the original symbolum fidei the regula the canon by which according to the greater number of the antenicene fathers the books of the new testament were themselves tried and determined to be scripture now this symbolum was to bring together all that must be believed even by the babes in faith or to what purpose was it made now say they the nicene creed is really nothing more than a verbal explication of the common creed but the clause in the athanasian which faith c however fairly deduced from scripture is not contained in the creed or selection of certain articles of faith from the scriptures or not at least from those preachings and narrations of which the new testament scriptures are the repository might not a papist plead equally in support of the creed of pope pius the new articles are deduced from scripture that is in our opinion and that most expressly in our lords several and solemn addresses to st peter so again sherlocks answer to this paragraph from the notes is evasivefor it is very possible nay it is and has been the case that a man may believe in the facts and doctrines contained in the new testament and yet not believe the holy scripture to be either divine infallible or complete   sect iv p 50    we know not what the substance of an infinite mind is nor how such   substances as have no parts or extension can touch each other or be   thus externally united but we know the unity of a mind or spirit   reaches as far as its selfconsciousness does for that is one spirit   which knows and feels itself and its own thoughts and motions and if   we mean this by circumincession three persons thus intimate to   each other are numerically one  the question still returns have these three infinite minds at once selfconscious and conscious of each others consciousness always the very same thoughts if so this mutual consciousness is unmeaning or derivative and the three do not cease to be three because they are three sames if not then there is tritheism evidently   ib p 64    st paul tells us 1 cor ii 10 that the spirit searcheth all   things yea the deep things of god so that the holy spirit knows all   that is in god even his most deep and secret counsels which is an   argument that he is very intimate with him but this is not all it is   the manner of knowing which must prove this consciousness of which i   speak and that the apostle adds in the next verse that the spirit of   god knows all that is in god just as the spirit of a man knows all   that is in man that is not by external revelation or communication   of this knowledge but by selfconsciousness by an internal   sensation which is owing to an essential unity for what man knoweth   the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so   the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god  it would be interesting if it were feasible to point out the epoch at which the text mode of arguing in polemic controversy became predominant i mean by single texts without any modification by the context i suspect that it commenced or rather that it first became the fashion under the dort or systematic theologians and during the so called quinquarticular controversy this quotation from st paul is a striking instancefor st paul is speaking of the holy spirit of which true spiritual christians are partakers and by which or in which those christians are enabled to search all things even the deep things of god no person is here spoken of but reference is made to the philosophic principle that can only act immediately that is interpenetratively as two globules of quicksilver and coadunatively now perceiving and knowing were considered as immediate acts relatively to the objects perceived and knownergo the principium sciendi must be one that is homogeneous or consubstantial with the principium essendi quoad objectum cognitum in order therefore for a man to understand or even to know of god he must have a godlike spirit communicated to him wherewith as with an inward eye which is both eye and light he sees the spiritual truths now i have no objection to his calling this spirit a person if only the term person be so understood as to permit of its being partaken of by all spiritual creatures as light and the power of vision are partaken of by all seeing ones but it is too evident that sherlock supposes the father as father to possess a spirit that is an intellective faculty by which he knows the spirit that is the third coequal person and that this spirit the person has a spirit that is an intellective faculty by which he knows the father and the logos in like manner relatively to both so too the father has a logos with which he distinguishes the logosand the logos has a logos and so on that is to say there are three several though not severed triune gods each being the same position three times realiter positum as three guineas from the same mint supposing them to differ no more than they appear to us to differbut whether a difference wholly and exclusively numerical is a conceivable notion except under the predicament of space and time whether it be not absurd to affirm it where interspace and interval cannot be affirmed without absurditythis is the question or rather it is no question   ib p 68    nor do we divide the substance but unite these three persons in one   numerical essence for we know nothing of the unity of the mind but   selfconsciousness as i showed before and therefore as the   selfconsciousness of every person to itself makes them distinct   persons so the mutual consciousness of all three divine persons to   each other makes them all but one infinite god as far as   consciousness reaches so far the unity of a spirit extends for we   know no other unity of a mind or spirit but consciousness  but this contradicts the preceding paragraph in which the father is selfconscious that he is the father and not the son and the son that he is not the father and that the father is not he now how can the sons being conscious that the father is conscious that he is not the son constitute a numerical unity and wherein can such a consciousness as that attributed to the son differ from absolute certainty is not god conscious of every thought of manand would sherlock allow me to deduce the unity of the divine consciousness with the human sherlocks is doubtless a very plain and intelligible account of three gods in the most absolute intimacy with each other so that they are all as one but by no means of three persons that are one god i do not wonder that waterland and the other followers of bull were alarmed   ib p 72    even among men it is only knowledge that is power human power and   human knowledge as that signifies a knowledge how to do anything are   commensurate whatever human skill extends to human power can effect   nay every man can do what he knows how to do if he has proper   instruments and materials to do it with  this proves that perfect knowledge supposes perfect power and that they are one and the same if he have proper instrumentsdoes not this show that the means are supposed copresent with the knowledge not the same with it   ib    for it is nothing but thought which moves our bodies and all the   members of them which are the immediate instruments of all human   force and power excepting mechanical motions which do not depend upon   our wills such as the motion of the heart the circulation of the   blood the concoction of our meat and the like all voluntary motions   are not only directed but caused by thought and so indeed it must be   or there could be no motion in the world for matter cannot move   itself and therefore some mind must be the first mover which makes   it very plain that infinite truth and wisdom is infinite and almighty   power  even this though not illconceived is inaccurately expressed   ib p 81    there is no contradiction that three infinite minds should be   absolutely perfect in wisdom goodness justice and power for these   are perfections which may be in more than one as three men may all   know the same things and be equally just and good but three such   minds cannot be absolutely perfect without being mutually conscious to   each other as they are to themselves  will any man in his senses affirm that my knowledge is increased by saying all three times following is it not mere repetition in time if the son has thoughts which the father as the father could not have but for his interpenetration of the sons consciousness then i can understand it but then these are not three absolutes but three modes of perfection constituting one absolute and by what right sherlock could call the one father more than the other i cannot see   ib p 88    and yet if we consider these three divine persons as containing each   other in themselves and essentially one by a mutual consciousness   this pretended contradiction vanishes for then the father is the one   true god because the father has the son and the holy spirit in   himself and the son may he called the one true god because the son   has the father and the holy ghost in himself c  nay this is to my understanding three gods and sherlock seems to have brought in the material phantom of a thing or substance   ib p 97    but if these three distinct persons are not separated but essentially   united unto one each of them may be god and all three but one god   for if these three personseach of whom greek monadikôs as it is   in the creed singly by himself not separately from the other divine   persons is god and lord are essentially united into one there can   be but one god and one lord and how each of these persons is god and   all of them but one god by their mutual consciousness i have already   explained  that isif the three persons are not threeso might the arian answer unless sherlock had shown the difference of separate and distinct relatively to mind for what other separation can be conceived in mind but distinction distinction may be joined with imperfection as ignorance or forgetfulness and so it is in menand if this be called separation by a metaphor from bodies then the conclusion would be that in the supreme mind there is distinction without imperfection and then the question is whence comes plurality of persons can it be conceived other than as the result of imperfection that is finiteness   ib p 98    thus each divine person is god and all of them but the same one god   as i explained it before  o no asserted it   ib p 989    this one supreme god is father son and holy ghost a trinity in   unity three persons and one god now father son and holy ghost   with all their divine attributes and perfections excepting their   personal properties which the schools call the modi subsistendi   that one is the father the other the son and the other the holy   ghost which cannot be communicated to each other are whole and   entire in each person by a mutual consciousness each feels the other   persons in himself all their essential wisdom power goodness   justice as he feels himself and this makes them essentially one as   i have proved at large   will not the arian object you admit the modus subsistendi to be a divine perfection and you affirm that it is incommunicable does it not follow therefore that there are perfections which the allperfect does not possess this would not apply to bishop bull or waterland   sect v p 102    st austin in his sixth book of the trinity takes notice of a common   argument used by the orthodox fathers against the arians to prove the   coeternity of the son with the father that if the son be the wisdom   and power of god as st paul teaches 1 cor i and god was never   without his wisdom and power the son must he coeternal with the   father    but this acute father discovers a great inconvenience in   this argument for it forces us to say that the father is not wise   but by that wisdom which he begot not being himself wisdom as the   father and then we must consider whether the son himself as he is   god of god and light of light may be said to be wisdom of wisdom if   god the father be not wisdom but only begets wisdom  the proper answer to augustine is that the son and holy ghost are necessary and essential not contingent and that his argument has a still greater inconvenience as shewn in note p 98   ib pp 110113    but what makes st gregory dispute thus nicely and oppose the common   and ordinary forms of speech did he in good earnest believe that   there is but one man in the world no no he acknowledged as many men   as we do a great multitude who had the same human nature and that   every one who had a human nature was an individual man distinguished   and divided from all other individuals of the same nature what makes   him so zealous then against saying that peter james and john are   three men only this that he says man is the name of nature and   therefore to say there are three men is the same as to say there are   three human natures of a different kind for if there are three human   natures they must differ from each other or they cannot be three   and so you deny peter james and john to be greek homooúsioi or   of the same nature and for the same reason we must say that though   the father be god the son god and the holy ghost god yet there are   not three gods but greek mía theótaes one godhead and divinity  sherlock struggles in vain in my opinion at least to clear these fathers of egregious logomachy whatever may have been the soundness of their faith spite of the quibbles by which they endeavoured to evince its rationality the very change of the terms is suspicious yes we might say three gods it would be answered as we say and ought to say three men for man and humanity greek ánthropôs and greek ánthrôpótaes are not the same termsso if the father be god the son god and the holy ghost god there would be three gods though not greek treis theótaetesthat is three godheads   ib p 11516    gregory nyssen tells us that greek theòs is greek theatàes and   greek éphoros the inspector and governor of the world that is it   is a name of energy operation and power and if this virtue energy   and operation be the very same in all the persons of the trinity   father son and holy ghost then they are but one god but one power   and energy    the father does nothing by himself nor the son by   himself nor the holy ghost by himself but the whole energy and   operation of the deity relating to creatures begins with the father   passes to the son and from father and son to the holy spirit the   holy spirit does not act anything separately there are not three   distinct operations as there are three persons greek allà mìa tìs   gínetai agathou bouláematos kínaesis kaì diakósmaesisbut one   motion and disposition of the good will which passes through the   whole trinity from father to son and to the holy ghost and this is   done greek achrónos kaì adiarétôs without any distance of time or   propagating the motion from one to the other but by one thought as   it is in one numerical mind and spirit and therefore though they are   three persons they are but one numerical power and energy  but this is either tritheism or sabellianism it is hard to say which either the greek boúlaema subsists in the son and in the holy ghost and not merely passes through them and then there would be three numerical greek bouláemata as well as three numerical persons ergo greek treis theoì àe theataí according to gregory nyssens shallow and disprovable etymology which would be tritheism or greek hén ti gínetai boúlaema and then the son and holy ghost are but terms of relation which is sabellianism but in fact this gregory and the others were tritheists in the mode of their conception though they did not wish to be so and refused even to believe themselves such  gregory nyssen cyril of alexandria maximus and damascen were charged with a kind of tritheism by petavius and dr cudworth who according to sherlock have mistaken their meaning see pp 1069 of this vindication   ib p 117    for i leave any man to judge whether this greek mía kínaesis   bouláematos this one single motion of will which is in the same   instant in father son and holy ghost can signify anything else but   a mutual consciousness which makes them numerically one and as   intimate to each other as every man is to himself as i have already   explained it  is not god conscious to all my thoughts though i am not conscious of gods would sherlock endure that i should infer ergo god is numerically one with me though i am not numerically one with god i have never seen but greatly wish to see waterlands controversial tracts against sherlock again according to sherlocks conception it would seem to follow that we ought to make a triad of triads or an ennead  1 fathersonholy ghost 2 sonfatherholy ghost 3 holy ghostsonfather  else there is an x in the father which is not in the son a y in the son which is not in the father and a z in the holy ghost which is in neither that is each by himself is not total god   ib p 120    but however he might be mistaken in his philosophy he was not in his   divinity for he asserts a numerical unity of the divine nature not a   mere specific unity which is nothing but a logical notion nor a   collective unity which is nothing but a company who are naturally   many but a true subsisting numerical unity of nature and if the   difficulty of explaining this and his zeal to defend it forced him   upon some unintelligible niceties to prove that the same numerical   human nature too is but one in all men it is hard to charge him with   teaching that there are three independent and coordinate gods   because we think he has not proved that peter james and john are   but one man this will make very foul work with the fathers if we   charge them with all those erroneous conceits about the trinity which   we can fancy in their inconvenient ways of explaining that venerable   mystery especially when they compare that mysterious unity with any   natural unions  so that after all this obscuration of the obscure sherlock ends by fairly throwing up his briefs and yet calls out not guilty victoria and what is this but to say these fathers did indeed involve tritheism in their mode of defending the tripersonality but they were not tritheiststhough it would be far more accurate to say that they were tritheists but not so as to make any practical breach of the unityas if for instance peter james and john had three silver tickets by shewing one of which either or all three would have the same thing as if they had shewn all three tickets and vice versa all three tickets could produce no more than each one each corresponding to the whole   ib    i am sure st gregory was so far from suspecting that he should be   charged with tritheism upon this account that he fences against   another charge of mixing and confounding the hypostases or persons   by denying any difference or diversity of nature greek hôs ek tou   màe déchesthai tàen katà physin diaphoràn míxin tina tôn hypostáseôn   kaì anakúklaesin kataskeúzonta which argues that he thought he had   so fully asserted the unity of the divine essence that some might   suspect he had left but one person as well as one nature in god  this is just what i have said p 116 whether sabellianism or tritheism i observed is hard to determine extremes meet   ib p 121    secondly to this homoousiotes the fathers added a numerical unity   of the divine essence this petavius has proved at large by numerous   testimonies even from those very fathers whom he before accused for   making god only collectively one as three men are one man such as   gregory nyssen st cyril maximus damascen which is a   demonstration that however he might mistake their explication of   it from the unity of human nature they were far enough from   tritheism or one collective god  this is most uncandid sherlock even to be consistent with his own confession § 1 p 120 ought to have said however he might mistake their intention in consequence of their inconvenient and unphilosophical explication which mistake in fact consisted in taking them at their word   ib    petavius greatly commends boethiuss explication of this mystery   which is the very same he had before condemned in gregory nyssen and   those other fathersthat father son and holy ghost are one god   not three gods hujus conjunctionis ratio est indifferentia that   is such a sameness of nature as admits of no difference or variety   or an exact homoousiotes as he explains it   those make a   difference who augment and diminish as the arians do who   distinguish the trinity into different natures as well as persons of   different worth and excellency and thus divide and multiply the   trinity into a plurality of gods principium enim pluralitatis   alteritas est præter alteritatem enim nec pluralitas quid sit   intelligi potest  then if so what becomes of the persons have the persons attributes distinct from their natureor does not their common nature constitute their common attributes principium enim c   ib p 124    that the fathers universally acknowledged that the operation of the   whole trinity ad extra is but one petavius has proved beyond all   contradiction and hence they conclude the unity of the divine nature   and essence for every nature has a virtue and energy of its own for   nature is a principle of action and if the energy and operation be   but one there can be but one nature and if there be two distinct and   divided operations if either of them can act alone without the other   there must be two divided natures  then it was not the son but the whole trinity that was crucified for surely this was an operation ad extra   ib p 126    but to do st austin right though he do not name this consciousness   yet he explains this trinity in unity by examples of mutual   consciousness i named one of his similitudes before of the unity of   our understanding memory and will which are all conscious to each   other that we remember what we understand and will we understand   what we remember and will and what we will we remember and   understand and therefore all these three faculties do penetrate and   comprehend each other  which the man is selfconscious alike when he remembers wills and understands but in what sense is the generic term memory conscious to the generic word will this is mere nonsense are memory understanding and volition personsselfsubsistents if not what are they to the purpose who doubts that jehovah is consciously powerful consciously wise consciously good and that it is the same jehovah who in being omnipotent is good and wise in being wise omnipotent and good in being good is wise and omnipotent but what has all this to do with a distinction of persons instead of one triunity we might have a milleunity the fact is that sherlock and for aught i know gregory nyssen had not the clear idea of the trinity positively but only a negative arianism   ib p 127    he proceeds to shew that this unity is without all manner of confusion   and mixture   for the mind that loves is in the love    and   the knowledge of the mind which knows and loves itself is in the   mind and in its love because it loves itself knowing and knows   itself loving and thus also two are in each for the mind which knows   and loves itself with its knowledge is in love and with its love is   in knowledge  then why do we make tripersonality in unity peculiar to god  the doctrine of the trinity the foundation of all rational theology no less than the precondition and ground of the rational possibility of the christian faith that is the incarnation and redemption rests securely on the positionthat in man omni actioni præit sua propria passio deus autem est actus purissimus sine ulla potentialitate as the tune produced between the breeze and eolian harp is not a selfsubsistent so neither memory nor understanding nor even love in man for he is a passive as well as active being he is a patible agent but in god this is not so whatever is necessarily of him god of god light of light is necessarily all act therefore necessarily selfsubsistent though not necessarily selforiginated this then is the true mystery because the true unique that the son of god has origination without passion that is without ceasing to be a pure act while a created entity is as far as it is merely creaturely and distinguishable from the creator a mere passio or recipient this unicity we strive not to express for that is impossible but to designate by the nearest though inadequate analogybegotten   ib p 133    as for the holy ghost whose nature is represented to be love i do   not indeed find in scripture that it is any where said that the holy   ghost is that mutual love wherewith father and son love each other   but this we know that there is a mutual love between father and son   the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his   handsjohn iii 35 and the father loveth the son and sheweth him   all things that himself doethjohn v 20 and our saviour himself   tells us i love the fatherjohn xiv 31 and i shewed before   that love is a distinct act and therefore in god must be a person   for there are no accidents nor faculties in god  this most important nay fundamental truth so familiar to the elder philosophy and so strongly and distinctly enunciated by philo judæus the senior and contemporary of the evangelists is to our modern divines darkness and a sound   sect vi pp 1478    yes youll say that there should be three persons each of which is   god and yet but one god is a contradiction but what principle of   natural reason does it contradict  surely never did argument vertiginate more i had just acceded to sherlocks exposition of the trinity as the supreme being his reflex act of selfconsciousness and his love all forming one supreme mind and now he tells me that each is the whole supreme mind and denies that three each per se the whole god are not the same as three gods i grant that division and separation are terms inapplicable yet surely three distinct though undivided gods are three gods that the father son and holy ghost are the one true god i fully believe but not sherlocks exposition of the doctrine nay i think it would have been far better to have worded the mystery thusthe father together with his son and spirit is the one true god  each per se god this is the greek prôton méga pseudos of sherlocks scheme each of the three is whole god because neither is or can be per se the father himself being a se but not per se   ib p 149    for it is demonstrable that if there be three persons and one god   each person must be god and yet there cannot be three distinct gods   but one for if each person be not god all three cannot be god   unless the godhead have persons in it which are not god  three persons having the same nature are three personsand if to possess without limitation the divine nature as opposed to the human is what we mean by god why then three such persons are three gods and will bethought so till gregory nyssen can persuade us that john james and peter each possessing the human nature are not three men john is a man james is a man and peter is a man but they are not three men but one man   ib p 150    i affirm that natural reason is not the rule and measure of   expounding scripture no more than it is of expounding any other   writing the true and only way to interpret any writing even the   scriptures themselves is to examine the use and propriety of words   and phrases the connexion scope and design of the text its   allusion to ancient customs and usages or disputes for there is no   other good reason to be given for any exposition but that the words   signify so and the circumstances of the place and the apparent scope   of the writer require it  this and the following paragraph are excellent o si sic omnia   ib p 153    reconcile men to the doctrine of the trinity and the scripture is   plain without any farther comment this i have now endeavoured and i   believe our adversaries will talk more sparingly of absurdities and   contradictions for the future and they will lose the best argument   they have against the orthodox expositions of scripture  good doctor you sadly overrated both your own powers and the docility of your adversaries if so clear a head and so zealous a trinitarian as dr waterland could not digest your exposition or acquit it of tritheism little hope is there of finding the unitarians more persuadable   ib p 154    though christ be god himself yet if there be three persons in the   godhead the equality and sameness of nature does not destroy the   subordination of persons a son is equal to his father by nature but   inferior to him as his son if the father as i have explained it be   original mind and wisdom the son a personal subsisting but reflex   image of his fathers wisdom though their eternal wisdom be equal and   the same yet the original is superior to the image the father to the   son  but why we men deem it so because the image is but a shadow and not equal to the original but if it were the same in all perfections how could that which is exactly the same be less again god is all beingconsequently there can nothing be added to the idea except what implies a negation or diminution of it if one and the same being is equal to the father as touching his godhead but inferior as man then it is  mx which is not   m but of two men i may say that they are equal to each other a   couragewisdom b   wisdomcourage both wise and courageous but a inferior in wisdom b in courage but god is allperfect   ib p 156    so born before all creatures as greek prôtótokos also signifies   that by him were all things created    all things were created by him and for him and he is before all   things which is the explication of greek pôrtótokos pásaes   ktíseos begotten before the whole creation and therefore no part   of the creation himself  this is quite right our version should here be corrected greek prôto or greek prótaton is here an intense comparativeinfinitely before   ib p 159    that he being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal   with god cphil ii 8 9  i should be inclined to adopt an interpretation of the unusual phrase greek hárpagmon somewhat different both from the socinian and the church versionwho being in the form of god did not think equality with god a thing to be seized with violence but made c   ib p 160    is a mere creature a fit lieutenant or representative of god in   personal or prerogative acts of government and power must not every   being be represented by one of his own kind a man by a man an angel   by an angel in such acts as are proper to their natures and must not   god then be represented by one who is god is any creature capable of   the government of the world does not this require infinite wisdom and   infinite power and can god communicate infinite wisdom and infinite   power to a creature or a finite nature that is can a creature be   made a true and essential god  this is sound reasoning it is to be regretted that sherlock had not confined himself to logical comments on the scripture instead of attempting metaphysical solutions   ib pp 1613  i find little or nothing to object to in this exposition from pp 161163 inclusively of phil ii 8 9 and yet i seem to feel as if a something that should have been prefixed and to which all these considerations would have been excellent seconds were missing to explain the cross by the necessity of sacrificial blood and the sacrificial blood as a type and antedelegate or presubstitute of the cross is too like an argumentum in circulo   ib p 164    and though christ be the eternal son of god and the natural lord and   heir of all things yet god hath in this highly exalted him and   given him a name which is above every name that at or in greek   en the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven   cphil ii 9 10 11  never was a sublime passage more debased than by this rendering of greek en by at instead of inat the phenomenon instead of in the noumenon for such is the force of nomen name in this and similar passages namely in vera et substantiali potestate jesu that is greek en lógô kaì dià lógou the true noumenon or ens intelligibile of christ to bow at hearing the cognomen may become a universal but it is still only a nonessential consequence of the former but the debasement of the idea is not the worst evil of this false renderingit has afforded the pretext and authority for unchristian intolerance   ib p 168    the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment to the   sonjohn v 22 should the father judge the world he must judge   as the maker and sovereign of the world by the strict rules of   righteousness and justice and then how could any sinner be saved  why is mercy incompatible with righteousness how then can the son be righteous    but he has committed judgment to the son as a mediatory king who   judges by the equity and chancery of the gospel  this article required exposition incomparably more than the simple doctrine of the trinity plain and evident simplici intuitu and rendered obscure only by diverting the mental vision by terms drawn from matter and multitude in the trinity all the hows may and should be answered by look just as a wise tutor would do in stating the fact of a double or treble motion as of a ball rolling north ward on the deck of a ship sailing south while the earth is turning from west to east and in like manner that is per intuitum intellectualem must all the mysteries of faith be contemplatedthey are intelligible per se not discursively and per analogiam for the truths are unique and may have shadows and types but no analogies at this moment i have no intuition no intellectual diagram of this article of the commission of all judgment to the son and therefore a multitude of plausible objections present themselves which i cannot solvenor do i expect to solve them till by faith i see the thing itselfis not mercy an attribute of the deity as deity and not exclusively of the person of the son and is not the authorizing another to judge by equity and mercy the same as judging so ourselves if the father can do the former why not the latter   ib p 171    and therefore now it is given him to have life in himself as the   father hath life in himself as the original fountain of all life by   whom the son himself lives all life is derived from god either by   eternal generation or procession or creation and thus christ hath   life in himself also to the new creation he is the fountain of life   he quickeneth whom he will  the truths which hitherto had been metaphysical then began to be historical the eternal was to be manifested in time hence christ came with signs and wonders that is the absolute or the anterior to cause and effect manifested itself as a phenomenon in time but with the predicates of eternityand this is the only possible definition of a miracle in re ipsa and not merely ad hominem or ad ignorantiam   ib p 177    his next argument consists in applying such things to the divinity of   our saviour as belong to his humanity that he increased in wisdom   cthat he knows not the day of judgmentwhich he evidently   speaks of himself as man as all the ancient fathers confess in st   mark it is said but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no   not the angels that are in heaven neither the son but the father   st matthew does not mention the son of that day and hour knoweth no   man not the angels of heaven but my father only  how much more politic as well as ingenuous it had been to have acknowledged the difficulty of this text so far from its being evident the evidence would be on the arian side were it not that so many express texts determine us to the contrary   ib    which shows that the son in st matthew is included in the greek   oudeìs none or no man and therefore concerns him only as a man for   the father includes the whole trinity and therefore includes the   son who seeth whatever his father doth  this is an argumentum in circulo and petitio rei sub lite why is he called the son in antithesis to the father if it meant no not the christ except in his character of the coeternal son included in the father if it concerned him only as a man why is he placed after the angels why called the son simply instead of the son of man or the messiah   ib    greek oudeìs is not greek oudeìs anthrôpôn but no one as in   john i 18 no one hath seen god at any time that is he is by   essence invisible  this most difficult text i have not seen explained satisfactorily i have thought that the greek ággeloi must here be taken in the primary sense of the word namely as messengers or missionary prophets of this day knoweth no one not the messengers or revealers of gods purposes now in heaven no not the son the greatest of prophetsthat is he in that character promised to declare all that in that character it was given to him to know   ib p 186    when st paul calls the father the one god he expressly opposes it to   the many gods of the heathens for though there be that are called   gods c but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all   things and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by   him where the one god and one lord and mediator is opposed to   the many gods and many lords or mediators which were worshipped by the   heathens  but surely the one lord is as much distinguished from the one god as both are contradistinguished from the gods many and lords many of the heathens besides the father is not the term used in that age in distinction from the gods that are no gods but greek ho epì pántôn theós   ib p 222    the word was with god that is it was not yet in the world or not   yet made flesh but with godjohn i 1 so that to be with god   signifies nothing but not to be in the world   the word was with god    grotius does say that this was opposed to the words being made   flesh and appearing in the world but he was far enough from thinking   that these words have only a negative sense    for he tells us   what the positive sense is that with god is greek parà tô patrí   with the father   and explains it by what wisdom says prov vii   30 then i was by him c which he does not think a prosopopoeia   but spoken of a subsisting person  but even this is scarcely tenable even as greek had this been st johns meaning surely he would have said greek en theô not greek pròs tòn theón in the nearest proximity that is not confusion but it is strange that sherlock should not have seen that grotius had a hankering toward socinianism but like a shy cock and a man of the world was always ready to unsay what he had said    footnote 1 a vindication of the doctrine of the holy and ever blessed trinity and the incarnation of the son of god occasioned by the brief notes on the creed of st athanasius and the brief history of the unitarians or socinians and containing an answer to both by wm sherlock london 8vo 1690   footnote 2 the third general council that at ephesus in 431 decreed    that it should not be lawful for any man to publish or compose   another faith or creed than that which was defined by the nicene   council  ed                                               notes on waterlands vindication of christs divinity 1   in initio  it would be no easy matter to find a tolerably competent individual who more venerates the writings of waterland than i do and long have done but still in how many pages do i not see reason to regret that the total idea of the 431of the adorable tetractys eternally selfmanifested in the triad father son and spiritwas never in its cloudless unity present to him hence both he and bishop bull too often treat it as a peculiarity of positive religion which is to be cleared of all contradiction to reason and then thus negatively qualified to be actually received by an act of the mere will sit pro ratione voluntas now on the other hand i affirm that the article of the trinity is religion is reason and its universal formula and that there neither is nor can be any religion any reason but what is or is an expansion of the truth of the trinity in short that all other pretended religions pagan or pseudochristian for example sabellian arian socinian are in themselves atheism though god forbid that i should call or even think the men so denominated atheists i affirm a heresy often but never dare denounce the holder a heretic  on this ground only can it be made comprehensible how any honest and commonly intelligent man can withstand the proofs and sound logic of bull and waterland that they failed in the first place to present the idea itself of the great doctrine which they so ably advocated take my self stc as a humble instance i was never so befooled as to think that the author of the fourth gospel or that st paul ever taught the priestleyan psilanthropism or that unitarianisn presumptuously nay absurdly so called was the doctrine of the new testament generally but during the sixteen months of my aberration from the catholic faith i presumed that the tenets of the divinity of christ the redemption and the like were irrational and that what was contradictory to reason could not have been revealed by the supreme reason as soon as i discovered that these doctrines were not only consistent with reason but themselves very reason i returned at once to the literal interpretation of the scriptures and to the faith  as to dr samuel clarke the fact is every generation has its one or more overrated men clarke was such in the reign of george i dr johnson eminently so in that of george iii lord byron being the star now in the ascendant  in every religious and moral use of the word god taken absolutely that is not as a god or the god but as god a relativity a distinction in kind ab omni quod non est deus is so essentially implied that it is a matter of perfect indifference whether we assert a world without god or make god the world the one is as truly atheism as the other in fact for all moral and practical purposes they are the same position differently expressed for whether i say god is the world or the world is god the inevitable conclusion the sense and import is that there is no other god than the world that is there is no other meaning to the term god whatever you may mean by or choose to believe of the world that and that alone you mean by and believe of god now i very much question whether in any other sense atheism that is speculative atheism is possible for even in the lucretian the coarsest and crudest scheme of the epicurean doctrine a hylozism a potential life is clearly implied as also in the celebrated lene clinamen becoming actual desperadoes articulating breath into a blasphemy of nonsense to which they themselves attach no connected meaning and the wickedness of which is alone intelligible there may be but a la place or a la grand would and with justice resent and repel the imputation of a belief in chance or of a denial of law order and selfbalancing life and power in the world their error is that they make them the proper and underived attributes of the world it follows then that pantheism is equivalent to atheism and that there is no other atheism actually existing or speculatively conceivable but pantheism now i hold it demonstrable that a consistent socinianism following its own consequences must come to pantheism and in ungodding the saviour must deify cats and dogs fleas and frogs there is there can be no medium between the catholic faith of trinal unity and atheism disguised in the selfcontradicting term pantheismfor every thing god and no god are identical positions   query i p 1    the word was godjohn i 1 i am the lord and there is none   else there is no god besides meis xiv 5 c  in all these texts the was or is ought to be rendered positively or objectively and not as a mere connective the word is god and saith i am the lord there is no god besides me the supreme being deitas objectiva the father saith i am in that i amdeitas subjectiva   ib p 2    whether all other beings besides the one supreme god be not excluded   by the texts of isaiah to which many more might be added and   consequently whether christ can be god at all unless he be the same   with the supreme god    the sum of your answer to this query is that the texts cited from   isaiah are spoken of one person only the person of the father c  o most unhappy mistranslation of hypostasis by person the word is properly the only person   ib p 3    now upon your hypothesis we must add that even the son of god   himself however divine he may be thought is really no god at all in   any just and proper sense he is no more than a nominal god and   stands excluded with the rest all worship of him and reliance upon   him will be idolatry as much as the worship of angels or men or of   the gods of the heathen would be god the father he is god and he   only and him only shall thou serve this i take to be a clear   consequence from your principles and unavoidable  waterlands argument is absolutely unanswerable by a worshipper of christ the modern ultrasocinian cuts the knot   query ii p 43    and therefore he might as justly bear the style and title of lord   god god of abraham c while he acted in that capacity as he did   that of mediator messiah son of the father c after that he   condescended to act in another and to discover his personal relation  and why then did not dr waterlandwhy did not his great predecessor in this glorious controversy bishop bullcontend for a revisal of our established version of the bible but especially of the new testament either the unanimous belief and testimony of the first five or six centuries grounded on the reiterated declarations of john and paul and the writer of the epistle to the hebrews were erroneous or at best doubtfuland then why not wipe them off why these references to themor else they were as i believe and both bull and waterland believed the very truth and then why continue the translation of the hebrew into english at secondhand through the medium of the septuagint have we not adopted the hebrew word jehovah is not the greek kyrios or lord of the lxx a greek substitute in countless instances for the hebrew jehovah why not then restore the original word and in the old testament religiously render jehovah by jehovah and every text of the new testament referring to the old by the hebrew word in the text referred to had this been done socinianism would have been scarcely possible in england  why was not this donei will tell you why because that great truth in which are contained all treasures of all possible knowledge was still opaque even to bull and waterlandbecause the idea itselfthat idea idearum the one substrative truth which is the form manner and involvent of all truthswas never present to either of them in its entireness unity and transparency they most ably vindicated the doctrine of the trinity negatively against the charge of positive irrationality with equal ability they shewed the contradictions nay the absurdities involved in the rejection of the same by a professed christian they demonstrated the utterly unscriptural and contrascriptural nature of arianism and sabellianism

implies beginning and what is   more cannot  it would be difficult to disprove the contrary generation with a beginning is not generation but creation hence we may see how necessary it is that in all important controversies we should predefine the terms negatively that is exclude and preclude all that is not meant by them and then the positive meaning that is what is meant by them will be the easy resultthe postdefinition which is at once the real definition and impletion the circumference and the area   ib p 2278    it is a usual thing with many moralists may account for it when   they meet with a difficulty which they cannot readily answer   immediately to conclude that the doctrine is false and to run   directly into the opposite persuasionnot considering that they may   meet with much more weighty objections there than before or that they   may have reason sufficient to maintain and believe many things in   philosophy and divinity though they cannot answer every question   which may be started or every difficulty which may be raised against   them  o if bull and waterland had been first philosophers and then divines instead of being first manacled or say articled clerks of a guildif the clear free intuition of the truth had led them to the article and not the article to the defence of it as not having been proved to be falsehow different would have been the result now we feel only the inconsistency of arianism not the truth of the doctrine attacked arianism is confuted and in such a manner that i will not reject the catholic faith upon the arians grounds it may i allow be still true but that it is true because the arians have hitherto failed to prove its falsehood is no logical conclusion the unitarian may have better luck or if he fail the deist   query xvi p 234    but gods thoughts are not our thoughts  that is as i would interpret the textthe ideas in and by which god reveals himself to man are not the same with and are not to be judged by the conceptions which the human understanding generalizes from the notices of the senses common to man and to irrational animals dogs elephants beavers and the like endowed with the same senses therefore i regard this paragraph p 2234 as a specimen of admirable special pleading ad hominem in the court of eristic logic but i condemn it as a wilful resignation or temporary selfdeposition of the reason i will not suppose what my reason declares to be no position at all and therefore an impossible subposition   ib p 235    let us keep to the terms we began with lest by the changing of words   we make a change of ideas and alter the very state of the question  this misuse or rather this omniumgatherum expansion and consequent extenuation of the word idea and ideas may be regarded as a calamity inflicted by mr locke on the reigns of william iii queen anne and the first two georges   ib p 237    sacrifice was one instance of worship required under the law and it   is saidhe that sacrificeth unto any god save unto the lord only   he shall be utterly destroyed exod xxii 20 now suppose any   person considering with himself that only absolute and sovereign   sacrifice was appropriated to god by this law should have gone and   sacrificed to other gods and have been convicted of it before the   judges the apology he must have made for it i suppose must have run   thus gentlemen though i have sacrificed to other gods yet i hope   youll observe that i did it not absolutely i meant not any absolute   or supreme sacrifice which is all that the law forbids but relative   and inferior only i regulated my intentions with all imaginable care   and my esteem with the most critical exactness i considered the other   gods whom i sacrificed to as inferior only and infinitely so   reserving all sovereign sacrifice to the supreme god of israel this   or the like apology must i presume have brought off the criminal   with some applause for his acuteness if your principles be true   either you must allow this or you must be content to say that not   only absolute supreme sacrifice if there be any sense in that   phrase but all sacrifice was by the law appropriate to god only c   c  how was it possible for an arian to answer this but it was impossible and arianism was extinguished by waterland but in order to the increase of socinianism and this i doubt not waterland foresaw he was too wise a man to suppose that the exposure of the folly and falsehood of one form of infidelism would cure or prevent infidelity enough that he made it more barefacedi might say barebreeched for modern unitarianism is verily the sansculotterie of religion   ib p 239    you imagine that acts of religious worship are to derive their   signification and quality from the intention and meaning of the   worshippers whereas the very reverse of it is the truth  truly excellent let the church of england praise god for her saintsa more glorious kalendar than rome can show   ib p 251    the sum then of the case is this if the son could be included as   being uncreated and very god as creator sustainer preserver of all   things and one with the father then he might be worshipped upon   their the antenicene fathers principles but otherwise could not  every where in this invaluable writer i have to regret the absence of all distinct idea of the i am as the proper attribute of the father and hence the ignorance of the proper jehovaism of the son and hence that while we worship the son together with the father we nevertheless pray to the father only through the son   query xvii    and we may never be able perfectly to comprehend the relations of the   three persons ad intra amongst themselves the ineffable order and   economy of the everblessed coeternal trinity  comprehend no for how can any spiritual truth be comprehended who can comprehend his own will or his own personeity that is his iship ichheit or his own mind that is his person or his own life but we can distinctly apprehend them in strictness the idea god like all other ideas rightly so called and as contradistinguished from conception is not so properly above as alien from comprehension it is like smelling a sound   query xviii p 269    from what hath been observed it may appear sufficiently that the   divine greek lógos was our king and our god long before that he   had the same claim and title to religious worship that the father   himself hadonly not so distinctly revealed  here i differ toto orbe from waterland and say with luther and zinzendorf that before the baptism of john the logos alone had been distinctly revealed and that first in christ he declared himself a son namely the coeternal onlybegotten son and thus revealed the father indeed the want of the idea of the 13 could alone have prevented waterland from inferring this from his own query ii and the texts cited by him pp 2838 the father cannot be revealed except in and through the son his eternal exegesis the contrary position is an absurdity the supreme will indeed the absolute good knoweth himself as the father but the act of selfaffirmation the i am in that i am is not a manifestation ad extra not an exegesis   ib p 274    this point being settled i might allow you that in some sense   distinct worship commenced with the distinct title of son or redeemer   that is our blessed lord was then first worshipped or commanded to   be worshipped by us under that distinct title or character having   before had no other title or character peculiar and proper to himself   but only what was common to the father and him too  rather shall i say that the son and the spirit the word and the wisdom were alone worshipped because alone revealed under the law see proverbs i ii  the passage quoted from bishop bull is very plausible and very eloquent but only cum multis granis salis sumend   query xix p 279    that the father whose honour had been sufficiently secured under the   jewish dispensation and could not but be so under the christian also   c  here again this contradiction of waterland to his own principles is continually recurringyea and in one place he involves the very tritheism of which he was so victorious an antagonist namely that the father is jehovah the son jehovah and the spirit jehovahthus making jehovah either a mere synonyme of godwhereas he himself rightly renders it  greek ho Ôn which st john every where and st paul no less makes the peculiar name of the son greek monogenàes uhiòs ho ôn eis tòn kólpon tou patrós or he affirms the same absurdity as if had said the father is the son and the son is the son and the holy ghost is the son and yet there are not three sons but one son n b greek ho òn is the verbal noun of greek hos esti not of greek egô eimí it is strange how little use has been made of that profound and most pregnant text john i 18   query xx p 302    the greek homooúsion itself might have been spared at least out of   the creeds had not a fraudulent abuse of good words brought matters   to that pass that the catholic faith was in danger of being lost even   under catholic language  most assuredly the very disputable rendering of greek homoousion

the doctors insinuating from the 300 texts which style the father   god absolutely or the one god that the son is not strictly and   essentially god not one god with the father is a strained and remote   inference of his own  waterland has weakened his argument by seeming to admit that in all these 300 texts the father distinctive is meant   ib p 31617    the simplicity of god is another mystery   when we come to inquire   whether all extension or all plurality diversity composition of   substance and accident and the like be consistent with it then it   is we discover how confused and inadequate our ideas are   to this   head belongs that perplexing question beset with difficulties on all   sides whether the divine substance be extended or no  surely the far larger part of these assumed difficulties rests on a misapplication either of the senses to the sense or of the sense to the understanding or of the understanding to the reasonin short on an asking for images where only theorems can be or requiring theorems for thoughts that is conceptions or notions or lastly conceptions for ideas   query xxiii p 351    but taking advantage of the ambiguity of the word hypostasis   sometimes used to signify substance and sometimes person you   contrive a fallacy  and why did not waterland lift up his voice against this mischievous abuse of the term hypostasis and the perversion of its latin rendering substantia as being equivalent to greek ousía why greek ousía should not have been rendered by essentia i cannot conceive est seems a contraction of esset and ens of essens greek ôn ousa ousía  essens essentis essentia   ib p 354    let me desire you not to give so great a loose to your fancy in divine   things you seem to consider every thing under the notion of extension   and sensible images  very true the whole delusion of the antitrinitarians arises out of this that they apply the property of imaginable matterin which a is that is can only be imagined by exclusion of b as the universal predicate of all substantial being   ib p 357    and our english unitarians   have been still refining upon the   socinian scheme   and have brought it still nearer to sabellianism  the sabellian and the unitarian seem to differ only in thisthat what the sabellian calls union with the unitarian calls full inspiration by the divinity   ib p 359    it is obvious at first sight that the true arian or semiarian   scheme which you would be thought to come up to at least can never   tolerably support itself without taking in the catholic principle of a   human soul to join with the word  here comes one of the consequences of the cartesian dualism as if greek sàrx the living body could be or exist without a soul or a human living body without a human soul greek sàrx is not greek for carrion nor greek sôma for carcase   query xxiv p 371    necessary existence is an essential character and belongs equally to   father and son  subsistent in themselves are

particular in all that respects hebrew learning and the new testament references to the old testament is shown in this so early fantastic misinterpretation grounded on the fact of our lords reminding and as it were giving out aloud to john and mary the twentysecond psalm the prediction of his present sufferings and after glory but the entire passage in tertullian though no proof of his arianism is full of proofs of his want of insight into the true sense of the scripture texts indeed without detracting from the inestimable services of the fathers from tertullian to augustine respecting the fundamental article of the christian faith yet commencing from the fifth century i dare claim for the reformed church of england the honorable name of greek archaspistàes of trinitarianism and the foremost rank among the churches roman or protestant the learned romanist divines themselves admit this and make a merit of the reluctance with which they nevertheless admit it in respect of bishop bull 2   ib p 421    it seems to me that if there be not reasons of conscience obliging a   good man to speak out there are always reasons of prudence which   should make a wise man hold his tongue  true and as happily expressed to this however the honest antitrinitarian must come at last well well i admit that john and paul thought differently but this remains my opinion   query xxvii p 427    greek ton alaethinòn kaì óntôs ónta theòn tòn tou christou patéra  athanas cont gent    the just and literal rendering of the passage is this the true god   who in reality is such namely the father of

from greek ho ônthe ens omnis entitatis etiam suæ that is the i am the father in distinction from the ens supremum the son it cannot however be denied that in changing the formula of the tetractys into the trias by merging the prothesis in the thesis the identity in the ipseity the christian fathers subjected their exposition to many inconveniences   ib p 432    greek ouch ho poiaetàes tôn

person one who was god of abraham isaac and jacob and was not the   father and therefore there were two divine persons  at all events it was a very incautious expression on the part of justin though his meaning was doubtless that which waterland gives the same most improper or at best most inconvenient because equivocal phrase has been as i think interpolated into our apostles creed   ib p 436

como los puntos que por la mayor parte trató en ellas son sobre los   misterios capitales de nuestra santa fé conviene á saber sobre el   misterio de la trinidad y sobre el de la divinidad de cristo en los   cuales su pseudaiglesia anglicana no se desvia de la catolica en   verdad que los manejó con tanto nervio y con tanta delicadeza que   los teologos ortodojos mas escolastizados como si dijéramos   electrizados hacen grande estimacion de dichas obras y aun en los   dos tratados que escribió acerca de la justification que es punto mas   resvaladizo en los principios que abrazó no se separó de los   teologos catolicos pero en algunas consecuencias que infirio ya dió   bastantemente á entender la mala leche que habia mamado  fray gerundio ii 7 ed                                               notes on waterlands importance of the doctrine of the holy trinity1   chap i p 18    it is the property of the divine being to be unsearchable and if he   were not so he would not be divine must we therefore reject the most   certain truths concerning the deity only because they are   incomprehensible c  it is strange that so sound so admirable a logician as waterland should have thought unsearchable and incomprehensible synonymous or at least equivalent termsand this though st paul hath made it the privilege of the fullgrown christian to search out the deep things of god himself   chap iv p 111    the delivering over unto satan seems to have been a form of   excommunication declaring the person reduced to the state of a   heathen and in the apostolical age it was accompanied with   supernatural or miraculous effects upon the bodies of the persons so   delivered  unless the passage acts v 111 be an authority i must doubt the truth of this assertion as tending to destroy the essential spirituality of christian motives and in my judgment as irreconcilable with our lords declaration that his kingdom was not of this world let me be once convinced that st paul with the elders of an apostolic church knowingly and intentionally appended a palsy or a consumption to the sentence of excommunication and i shall be obliged to reconsider my old opinion as to the antichristian principle of the romish inquisition   ib p 114    a man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition   reject knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth being   condemned of himselftit iii 10 11  this text would be among my minor arguments for doubting the paulinity of the epistle to titus it seems to me to breathe the spirit of a later age and a more established church power   ib    not every one that mistakes in judgment though in matters of great   importance in points fundamental but he that openly espouses such   fundamental error   dr whitby adds to the definition the   espousing it out of disgust pride envy or some worldly principle   and against his conscience  whitby went too far waterland not far enough every schismatic is not necessarily a heretic but every heretic is virtually a schismatic as to the meaning of greek autokatákritos waterland surely makes too much of a very plain matter what was the sentence passed on a heretic a public declaration that he was no longer a member ofthat is of one faith withthe church this the man himself after two public notices admits and involves in the very act of persisting however confident as to the truth of the doctrine he has set up he cannot after two public admonitions be ignorant that it is a doctrine contrary to the articles of his communion with the church that has admitted him and in regard of his alienation from that communion he is necessarily greek autokatákritosthough in his pride of heart he might say with the man of old and i banish you   ib p 123   as soon as the miraculous gifts or gift of discerning spirits   ceased  no one point in the new testament perplexes me so much as these so called miraculous gifts i feel a moral repugnance to the reduction of them to natural and acquired talents ennobled and made energic by the life and convergency of faithand yet on no other scheme can i reconcile them with the idea of christianity or the particular supposed with the general known facts but thank god it is a question which does not in the least degree affect our faith or practice i mean if god permit to go through the middletonian controversy as soon as i can procure the loan of the books or have health enough to become a reader in the british museum   ib p 126    and what if after all spiritual censures for of such only i am   speaking should happen to fall upon such a person he may be in some   measure hurt in his reputation by it and that is all and possibly   hereupon his errors before invincible through ignorance may be   removed by wholesome instruction and admonition and so he is   befriended in it c  waterland is quite in the right so farbut the penal laws the temporal inflictionswould he have called for the repeal of these milton saw this subject with a mastering eyesaw that the awful power of excommunication was degraded and weakened even to impotence by any the least connection with the law of the state   ib p 127    who are hereby forbidden to receive such heretics into their houses   or to pay them so much as common civilities this precept of the   apostle may he further illustrated by his own practice recorded by   irenaeus who had the information at secondhand from polycarp a   disciple of st johns that st john once meeting with cerinthus at   the bath retired instantly without bathing for fear lest the bath   should fall by reason of cerinthus being there the enemy to truth  psha the bidding him god speedgreek légôn autô chaírein2 john 11 is a spirituality not a mere civility if st john knew or suspected that cerinthus had a cutaneous disease there would have been some sense in the refusal or rather as i correct myself some probability of truth in this gossip of irenaeus   ib p 128    they corrupted the faith of christ and in effect subverted the   gospel that was enough to render them detestable in the eyes of all   men who sincerely loved and valued sound faith  o no no not them error quidem non tamen homo errans abominandus or to pun a little abhominandus be bold in denouncing the heresy but slow and timorous in denouncing the erring brother as a heretic the unmistakable passions of a factionary and a schismatic the ostentatious display the ambition and dishonest arts of a sectfounder must be superinduced on the false doctrine before the heresy makes the man a heretic   ib p 129    the doctrine of the nicolaitans  were the nicolaitans a sect properly so called the word is the greek rendering of the children of balaam that is men of grossly immoral and disorderly lives   ib p 130    for if he who shall break one of the least moral commandments and   shall teach men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven   mat v 19 it must be a very dangerous experiment c  a sad misinterpretation of our lords words which from the context most evidently had no reference to any moral that is universal commandment as such but to the national institutions of the jewish state as long as that state should be in existence that is to say until the heaven or the government and the earth or the people or the governed as one corpus politicum or nation had passed away till that timewhich was fulfilled under titus and more thoroughly under hadrianno jew was relieved from his duties as a citizen and subject by his having become a christian the text together with the command implied in the miracle of the tributemoney in the fishs mouth might be fairly and powerfully adduced against the quakers in respect of their refusal to pay their tithes or whatever tax they please to consider as having an unchristian destination but are they excluded from the kingdom of heaven that is the christian church nobut they must be regarded as weak and injudicious members of it   chap v p 140    accordingly it may be observed how the unbelievers caress and   compliment those complying gentlemen who meet them half way while   they are perpetually inveighing against the stiff divines as they   call them whom they can make no advantage of  lessing an honest and frankhearted infidel expresses the same sentiment as long as a german protestant divine keeps himself stiff and stedfast to the augsburg confession to the full creed of melancthon he is impregnable and may bid defiance to sceptic and philosopher but let him quit the citadel and the cossacs are upon him   ib p 187    and therefore it is infallibly certain as mr chillingworth well   argues with respect to christianity in general that we ought firmly   to believe it because wisdom and reason require that we should   believe those things which are by many degrees more credible and   probable than the contrary  yes where there are but two positions one of which must be true when a is presented to my mind with probability5 and b with probability15 i must think that b is three times more probable than a and yet it is very possible that a c may be found which will supersede both   chap vi p 230    the creed of jerusalem preserved by cyril the most ancient perhaps   of any now extant is very express for the divinity of god the son   in these words and in our lord jesus christ the only begotten son   of god true god begotten of the father before all ages by whom all   things were made   greek kaì eis henà kyrion iaesoun christòn   tòn uhiòn tou theou

jerusalem so far removed from the influence of the pythagoreoplatonic sects of paganism as the most important and convincing mere fact of evidence in the trinitarian controversy   ib p 233    true son of the father invisible of invisible c  how is this reconcilable with john i 18no one hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him or with the express image asserted above invisible i suppose must be taken in the narrowest sense that is to bodily eyes but then the one invisible would not mean the same as the other   ib p 236    symbola certe ecclesiæ ex ipso ecclesiæ sensu non ex hæreticorum   cerebello exponenda suntbull judic eccl v  the truth of a creed must be tried by the holy scriptures but the sense of the creed by the known sentiments and inferred intention of its compilers   ib p 238    the very name of father applied in the creed to the first person   intimates the relation he bears to a son c  no doubt but the most probable solution of the apparent want of distinctness of explication on this article in my humble judgment isthat the socalled apostles creed was at first the preparatory confession of the catechumens the admissionticket as it were symbolum ad baptismum at the gate of the church and gradually augmented as heresies started up the latest of these seems to have consisted in the doubt respecting the entire death of jesus on the cross as distinguished from suspended animation hence in the fifth or sixth century the clauseand he descended into hades was insertedthat is the indissoluble principle of the man jesus was separated from and left the dissoluble and subsisted apart in scheol or the abode of separated soulsbut really meaning no more than vere mortuus est jesus was taken from the cross dead in the very same sense in which the baptist was dead after his beheading  nevertheless well adapted as this creed was to its purposes i cannot but regret the high place and precedence which by means of its title and the fable to which that title gave rise it has usurped it has as it appears to me indirectly favoured arianism and socinianism   ib p 250    that st john wrote his gospel with a view to confute cerinthus among   other false teachers is attested first by irenæus who was a   disciple of polycarp and who flourished within less than a century of   st johns time  i have little trust and no faith in the gossip and hearsayanecdotes of the early fathers irenæus not excepted within less than a century of st johns time alas a century in the paucity of writers and of men of education in the age succeeding the apostolic must be reckoned more than equal to five centuries since the use of printing suppose however the truth of the irenæan traditionthat the creed of cerinthus was what irenæus states it to have been and that john at the instance of the asiatic bishops wrote his gospel as an antidote to the cerinthian heresydoes there not thence arise in his utter silence an almost overwhelming argument against the apostolicity of the christopædia both that prefixed to luke and that concorporated with matthew   ib p 257    in him was life and the life was the light of men the same word   was life the greek logos and zôáe both one there was no occasion   therefore for subtilly distinguishing the word and life into two sons   as some did  i will not deny the possibility of this interpretation it may benay it isfairly deducible from the words of the great evangelist but i cannot help thinking that taken as the primary intention it degrades this most divine chapter which unites in itself the three characters of sublime profound and pregnant and alloys its universality by a mixture of time and accident   ib    and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness cometh not upon   it so i render the verse conformable to the rendering of the same   greek verb greek katalambánô by our translators in another place   of this same gospel the apostle as i conceive in this 5th verse of   his 1st chapter alludes to the prevailing error of the gentiles c  o sad sad how must the philosopher have been eclipsed by the shadow of antiquarian erudition in order that a mind like waterlands could have sacrificed the profound universal import of comprehend to an allusion to a worthless dream of heretical nonsense the mushroom of the day had waterland ever thought of the relation of his own understanding to his reason but alas the identification of these two diversitiesof how many errors has it been ground and occasion   ib p 259    and the word was made fleshbecame personally united with the man   jesus and dwelt among usresided constantly in the human nature   so assumed  waterland himself did but dimly see the awful import of greek egéneto sàrxthe mystery of the alien groundand the truth that as the ground such must be the life he caused himself to become flesh and therein assumed a mortal life into his own person and unity in order himself to transubstantiate the corruptible into the incorruptible  waterlands anxiety to show the antiheretical force of st johns gospel and epistles has caused him to overlook their catholicitytheir applicability to all countries and all timestheir truth independently of all temporary accidents and errorswhich catholicity alone it is that constitutes their claim to canonicity that is to be canonical inspired writings   ib p 266    hereupon therefore the apostle in defence of christs real humanity   says this is he that came by water and blood  water and blood that is serum and crassamentum mean simply blood the blood of the animal or carnal life which saith moses is the life hence flesh is often taken as and indeed is a form of the bloodblood formed or organized thus blood often includes flesh and flesh includes blood flesh and blood is equivalent to blood in its twofold form or rather as formed and formless water and blood has therefore two meanings in st john

hath taken it into his head c   ib p 268    the apostle having said that the spirit is truth or essential truth   which was giving him a title common to god the father and to christ   c  is it clear that the distinct hypostasis of the holy spirit in the same sense as the onlybegotten son is hypostatically distinguished from the father was a truth that formed an immediate object or intention of st john that it is a truth implied in and fairly deducible from many texts both in his gospel and epistles i do not indeed i cannot doubtbut only whether this article of our faith he was commissioned to declare explicitly  it grieves me to think that such giant archaspistæ of the catholic faith as bull and waterland should have clung to the intruded gloss 1 john v 7 which in the opulence and continuity of the evidences as displayed by their own masterminds would have been superfluous had it not been worse than superfluous that is senseless in itself and interruptive of the profound sense of the apostle   ib p 272    he is come come in the flesh and not merely to reside for a time or   occasionally and to fly off again but to abide and dwell with man   clothed with humanity  incautiously worded at best compare our lords own declaration to his disciples that he had dwelt a brief while with or among them in order to dwell in them permanently   ib p 286    it is very observable that the ebionites rejected three of the   gospels receiving only st matthews or what they called so and   that curtailed they rejected likewise all st pauls writings   reproaching him as an apostate how unlikely is it that justin should   own such reprobates as those were for fellowchristians  i dare avow my beliefor rather i dare not withhold my avowalthat both bull and waterland are here hunting on the trail of an old blunder or figment concocted by the gross ignorance of the gentile christians and their fathers in all that respected hebrew literature and the palestine christians i persist in the belief that though a refuse of the persecuted and from neglect degenerating jewchristians may have sunk into the mean and carnal notions of their unconverted brethren respecting the messiah no proper sect of ebionites ever existed but those to whom st paul travelled with the contributions of the churches nor any such man as ebion unless indeed it was st barnabas who in his humility may have so named himself while soliciting relief for the distressed palestine christiansi am barnabas the beggar but i will go further and confess my belief that the socalled ebionites of the first and second centuries who rejected the christopædia and whose gospel commenced with the baptism by john were orthodox apostolic christians who received christ as the lord that is as jehovah manifested in the flesh as to their rejection of the other gospels and of pauls writings i might askcould they read them but the whole notion seems to rest on an anachronical misconception of the evangelia every great mother church at first had its own gospel   ib p 288    to say nothing here of the truer reading men of your nation there   is no consequence in the argument the ebionites were christians in a   large sense men of christian profession nominal christians as   justin allowed the worst of heretics to be and this is all he could   mean by allowing the ebionites to be christians  i agree with bull in holding greek apò tou hymetérou génous the most probable reading in the passage cited from justin and am by no means convinced that the celebrated passage in josephus is an interpolation but i do not believe that such men as are here described ever professed themselves christians or were or could have been baptized   ib p 292    le clerc would appear to doubt whether the persons pointed to in   justin really denied christs divine nature or no it is as plain as   possible that they did  le clerc is no favourite of mine and waterland is a prime favourite nevertheless in

that the   ancients in the best and purest times either knew nothing of them   or if they did condemned them  as excellent means of raising a presumption in the mind of the falsehood of arianism and

these pages against barbeyrac is below his great powers and characteristic vigour of judgment it is enough that they the fathers of the first three centuries were the lights of their age and worthy of all reverence for their good gifts but it appears to me impossible to deny their credulity their ignorance with one or two exceptions in the interpretation of the old testament or their hardihood in asserting the truth of whatever they thought it for the interest of the church and for the good of souls to have believed as true a whale swallowed jonah but a believer in all the assertions and

influence our judgment as to the possibility of the objective   ib p 67    the bishop then gave him the living of pettigo in a wild part of the   county of donegal having made many removals on purpose

told me many   illiterate boys put over his head and highly preferred in the church   without having served a cure  though i have heard of one or two exceptions stated in proof that nepotism is not yet extinct among our prelates yet it is impossible to compare the present condition of the church and the disposal of its dignities and emoluments with the facts recorded in this life without an honest exultation   ib p 106    he once declared to me that he would resign his living if the   athanasian creed were removed from the prayer book and i am sure he   would have done so  surely there was more zeal than wisdom in this declaration does the athanasian or rather the pseudoathanasian creed differ from the nicene or not if not it must be dispensable at least if not superfluous if it does differ which of the two am i to followthe profession of an anonymous individual or the solemn decision of upwards of three hundred bishops convened from all parts of the christian world   vol i p 177180  no problem more difficult or of more delicate treatment than the criteria of miracles yet none on which young divines are fonder of displaying their gifts nor is this the worst their charity too often goes to wreck from the error of identifying the faith in christ with the arguments by which they think it is to be supported but surely if two believers meet at the same goal of faith it is a very secondary question whether they travelled thither by the same road of argument in this and other passages of skelton i recognize and reverence a vigorous and robust intellect but i complain of a turbidness in his reasoning a huddle in his sequence and here and there a semblance of arguing in a circlefrom the miracle to the doctrine and from the doctrine to the miracle add to this a too little advertency to the distinction between the evidence of a miracle for a an eyewitness and for b for whom it is the relation of a miracle by an asserted eyewitness and again between b and x y z for whom it is a fact of history the result of my own meditations is that the evidence of the gospel taken as a total is as great for the christians of the nineteenth century as for those of the apostolic age i should not be startled if i were told it was greater but it does not follow that this equally holds good of each component part an evidence of the most cogent clearness unknown to the primitive christians may compensate for the evanescence of some evidence which they enjoyed evidences comparatively dim have waxed into noonday splendour and the comparative wane of others once effulgent is more than indemnified by the synopsis greek tou pántos which we enjoy and by the standing miracle of a christendom commensurate and almost synonymous with the civilized world i make this remark for the purpose of warning the divinity student against the disposition to overstrain particular proofs or rest the credibility of the gospel too exclusively on some one favourite point i confess that i cannot peruse page 179 without fancying that i am reading some romish doctors work dated from a community where miracles are the ordinary news of the day  p s by the by the rev philip skelton is of the true irish breed that is a brave fellow but a bit of a bully arrah by st pathrick but i shall make cold mutton of you misther arian   ib p 182    if in this he appears to deal fairly by us proving such things as   admit of it by reason and such as do not by the authority of his   miracles c  are we likely to have miracles performed or pretended before our eyes if not what may all this mean if skelton takes for granted the veracity of the evangelists and the precise verity of the gospels the truth and genuineness of the miracles is includedand if not what does he prove the exact accordance of the miracles related with the ideal of a true miracle in the reason does indeed furnish an argument for the probable truth of the relation but this does not seem to be skeltons intention   ib p 185    but to remedy this evil as far as the nature of the thing will   permit a genuine record of the true religion must be kept up that   its articles may not be in danger of total corruption in such a sink   of opinions  anything rather than seek a remedy in that which scripture itself declares the only one alas these bewilderments the romanists urge have taken place especially through and by the misuse of the scriptures whatever god has given we ought to think necessarythe scriptures the church the spirit why disjoin them   ib p 186    now a perpetual miracle considered as the evidence of any thing is   nonsense because were it at first ever so apparently contrary to the   known course of nature it must in time be taken for the natural   effect of some unknown cause as all physical phænomena if far   enough traced always are and consequently must fall into a level as   to a capacity of proving any thing with the most ordinary appearances   of nature which though all of them miracles as to the primary cause   of their production can never be applied to the proof of an   inspiration because ordinary and common  i doubt this though i have no doubt that it would be pernicious the yearly blossoming of aarons rod is against skelton who confounds single facts with classes of phænomena and he draws his conclusion from an arbitrary and as seems to me senseless definition of a miracle   ib p 214 end of discourse ii  skelton appears to have confounded two errors very different in kind and in magnitudethat of the infidel against whom his arguments are with few exceptions irrefragable and that of the christian who sincerely believing the law the prophecies the miracles and the doctrines all in short which in the scriptures themselves is declared to have been revealed does not attribute the same immediate divinity to all and every part of the remainder it would doubtless be more christianlike to substitute the views expressed in the next discourse iii but still the latter error is not as the former   ib p 234    but why should not the conclusion be given up since it is possible   christ may have had two natures in him so as to have been less than   the father in respect to the one and equal to him in respect to the   other  i understand these words my father is greater than i of the divinityand of the filial subordination which does not in the least encroach on the equality necessary to the unity of father son and spirit bishop bull does the same see too skeltons own remarks in discourse v p 265   ib p 251    this was necessary because their law was ordained by angels  now this is an instance of what i cannot help regarding as a superstitious excess of reverence for single texts we know that long before the epistle to the hebrews was written the alexandrian church which by its intercourse with greek philosophers chiefly platonists had become ashamed of the humanities of the hebrew scriptures in defiance of those scriptures had pretended that it was not the supreme being who gave the law in person to moses but some of his angels the author of the epistle to the hebrews arguing ad homines avails himself of this in order to prove that on their own grounds the mosaic was of dignity inferior to the christian dispensation to get rid of this nodifficulty in a single verse or two in the epistles skelton throws an insurmountable difficulty on the whole mosaic history   ib p 265    therefore he saith i as a man can of myself do nothing  even of this text i do not see the necessity of skeltons parenthesis as a man nay it appears to me i confess to turn a sublime and most instructive truth into a truism but if not as the son of god therefore a fortiori not as the son of man and more especially as such in all that refers to the redemption of mankind   ib p 267    to this glory christ as god was entitled from all eternity but did   not acquire a right to it as man till he had paid the purchase by his   blood  i too hold this for a most important truth but yet could wish it to have been somewhat differently expressed as thusbut did not acquire it as man till the means had been provided and perfected by his blood   ib p 268    if christ in one place john xiv 28 says my father is greater   than i he must be understood of his relation to the father as his   son born of a woman  i do not see the necessity of this does not christ say my father and i will come and we will dwell in you nay i dare confidently affirm that in no one passage of st johns gospel is our lord declared in any special sense the son of the first person of the trinity in reference to his birth from a woman and remember it is from st johns gospel that the words are cited so too the answer to philip ought to be interpreted by ch i 18 of the same gospel   ib p 276  i confess i do not agree with skeltons interpretation of any of these texts entirely because i hold the nicene faith and revere the doctrine of the trinity as the fundamental article of christianity i apply to christ as the second person almost all the texts which skelton explains of his humanity at all events 1 consider the firstborn of every creature as a false version of the words which as the argument and following verse prove should be rendered begotten before or rather superlatively before all that was created or made for by him they were made   ib    of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which   are in heaven neither the son but the father  i cannot explain myself here but i have long thought that our saviour meant in these words greek ainíttein tàen théotaeta ahutouand that like the problem proposed by him to the scribes they were intended to prepare the minds of the disciples for this awful mysterygreek ei màe ho patáerunless or if not as the father knows it while in st matthew the equivalent sense is given by the omission of the greek oud ho uhíos and its inclusion in the father as the father knoweth me so know i the father  it would have been against the general rule of scripture prophecies and the intention of the revelation in christ that the first christians should have been so influenced in their measures and particular actions as they could not but have been by a particular foreknowledge of the express and precise time at which jerusalem was to be destroyed to reconcile them to this uncertainty our lord first teaches them to consider this destruction the close of one great epoch or greek aiôn as the type of the final close of the whole world of time that is of all temporal things and then reasons with them thuswonder not that i should leave you ignorant of the former when even the highest order of heavenly intelligences know not the latter greek oud ho uhíos ei màe ho patáer nor should i myself but that the father knows it all whose will is essentially known to me as the eternal son but even to me it is not revealably communicated such seems to me the true sense of this controverted passage in mark and that it is borne out by many parallel texts in st john and that the correspondent text in matthew which omits the greek oud ho huíos conveys the same sense in equivalent terms the word greek emou including the son in the greek patàer mónos for to his onlybegotten son before all time the father showeth all things   ib p 279    but whether we can reconcile these words to our belief of christs   prescience and divinity or not matters little to the debate about   his divinity itself since we can so fully prove it by innumerable   passages of scripture too direct express and positive to be   balanced by one obscure passage from whence the arian is to draw the   consequence himself which may possibly be wrong  very good   ib p 280    we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an   understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him   that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and   eternal lifel john v 20 the whole connection evidently shows the   words to be spoken of christ  that the words comprehend christ is most evident all that can be fairly concluded from 1 cor viii 6 is thisthat the apostles paul and john speak of the father as including and comprehending the son and the holy ghost as his word and his spirit but of these as inferring or supposing the father not comprehending him whenever therefore respecting the godhead itself containing both deity and dominion the term god is distinctively used it is applied to the father and lord to the son   ib p 281    but farther it is objected that christ cannot be god since god   calls him his servant more than once particularly isaiah xlii 1  the prophets often speak of the antitype or person typified in language appropriate to and suggested by the type itself so perhaps in this passage if as i suppose hezekiah was the type immediately present to isaiahs imagination however skeltons answer is quite sufficient   ib p 287    hence it appears that in the passage objected 1 cor xv 24 c   christ is spoken of purely as that man whom god had highly exalted   and to whom he had given a name which is above every name that at the   name of jesus every knee should bow phil ii 9 10  i must confess that this exposition does not quite satisfy me i cannot help thinking that something more and deeper was meant by the apostle and this must be sought for in the mystery of the trinity itself in which mystery all treasures of knowledge are hidden   ib p 318    hence perhaps may be best explained what st peter says in the   second epistle after pleading a miracle we have also a more sure   word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed  i believe that st peter neither said it nor meant this but that greek bebaióteron follows the prophetic word we have also the word of prophecy more firmthat is we have in addition to the evidence of the miracles themselves this further confirmation that they are the fulfilment of known prophecies   ib p 327    agreeable to these passages of the prophet st peter tells us acts   x 38 god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and   power  i have often to complain that too little attention is paid by commentators to the history and particular period in which certain speeches were delivered or words written could st peter with propriety have introduced the truth to a prejudiced audience with its deepest mysteries must he not have begun with the most evident facts   ib disc viii    the doctrine of the holy trinity vindicated  were i a clergyman the paragraphs from p 366 to p 370 both inclusive of this discourse should form the conclusion of my sermon on trinity sundaywhether i preached at st jamess or in a country village   ib pp 374378  as a reason why we should doubt our own judgment it is quite fair to remind the objector that the same difficulty occurs in the scheme of gods ordinary providence but that a difficulty in a supposed article of revealed truth is solved by the occurrence of the same or of an equivalent difficulty in the common course of human affairsthis i find it hard to conceive how was the religious as distinguished from the moral sense first awakened what made the human soul feel the necessity of a faith in god but the apparent incongruity of certain dispensations in this world with the idea of god with the law written in the heart is not the reconciling of these facts or phænomena with the divine attributes one of the purposes of a revealed religion but even this is not a full statement of the defect complained of in this solution a difficulty which may be only apparent like that other of the prosperity of the wicked is solved by the declaration of its reality a difficulty grounded on the fact of temporal and outward privations and sufferings is solved by being infinitely increased that is by the assertion of the same principle on the determination of our inward and everlasting weal and woe that there is nothing in the christian faith or in the canonical scriptures when rightly interpreted that requires such an argument or sanctions the recourse to it i believe myself to have proved in the aids to reflection for observe that to solve has a scientific and again a religious sense and that in the latter a difficulty is satisfactorily solved as soon as its insolvibility for the human mind is proved and accounted for   ib disc xiv pp 500502    christianity proved by miracles  i cannot see and never could the purpose or cui bono of this reasoning to whom is it addressed to a man who denies a god or that god can reveal his will to mankind if such a man be not below talking to he must first be convinced of his miserable blindness respecting these truths for these are clearly presupposed in every proof of miracles generally  again does he admit the authenticity of the gospels and the veracity of the evangelists does he credit the facts there related and as related if not these points must be proved for these are clearly presupposed in all reasoning on the particular miracles of the christian dispensation if he does can he deny that many acts of christ were wonderfulthat reanimating a dead body in which putrefaction had already commencedand feeding four thousand men with a few loaves and fishes so that the fragments left greatly exceeded the original total quantitywere wonderful events should such a man compos mentis exist which i more than doubt what could a wise man do but stareand leave him christ wrought many wonderful works implying admirable power and directed to the most merciful and beneficent ends and these acts were such signs of his divine mission as rendered inattention or obstinate averseness to the truths and doctrines which he promulgated inexcusable and indeed on any hypothesis but that of immoral dispositions and prejudices utterly inconceivable in what respect i pray can this statement be strengthened by any reasoning about the nature and distinctive essence of miracles in abstracto what purpose can be answered by any pretended definition of a miracle if i met with a disputatious wordcatcher or logomachist who sought to justify his unbelief on this ground i should not hesitate to saynever mind whether it is a miracle or no call it what you willbut do you believe the fact do you believe that christ did by force of his will and word multiply instantaneously twelve loaves and a few small fishes into sufficient food for a hungering multitude of four thousand men and women when i meet with or from credible authority hear of a man who believes this fact and yet thinks it no sign of christs mission when i can even conceive of a man in his right senses who believing all the facts and events related in the new testament and as there related does yet remain a deist i may think it time to enter into a disquisition respecting the right definition of a miracle and meantime i humbly trust that believing with my whole heart and soul in the wonderful works of our lord and saviour jesus christ i shall not forfeit my title of christian though i should not subscribe to this or that divines right definition of his idea of a miracle which word is with me no idea at all but a general term the common surname as it were of the wonderful works wrought by the messengers of god to man in the patriarchal mosaic and christian dispensations  it is to these notions and general definitions far more than to the facts themselves that the arguments of infidels apply and from which they derive their plausibility nor is this all the infidel imitates the divine and adopts the same mode of arguing namely by this substantiation of mere general or collective terms for instance humes argument stated by the by before he was born and far more forcibly by dr south who places it in the mouth of thomas 2reduce it to the particular facts in question and its whole speciousness vanishes i am speaking of the particular facts and actions of the gospel of those and those only now that i should be deceived or the eyewitnesses have been deceived under all the circumstances of those miracles with all antecedents accompaniments and consequents is quite as contrary to that is unparalleled in my experience as the return to life of a dead man  so again in the second paragraph of page 502 3 the position is true or false according to the definition of a miracle in the narrower sense of the term miraclethat is a consequent presented to the outward senses without an adequate antecedent ejusdem generisit is not only false but detractory from the christian religion it is a main nay an indispensable evidence but it is not the only no nor if comparison be at all allowable the highest and most efficient unless indeed the term evidence is itself confined to grounds of conviction offered to the senses but then the position is a mere truism  there is yet another way of reasoning which i utterly dislike namely by putting imaginary cases of imaginary miracles as paley has done if a dozen different individuals all men of known sense and integrity should each independently of the other pledge their everlasting weal on the truth that they saw a man beheaded and quartered and that on a certain persons prayer or bidding the quarters reunited and then a new head grew on and from out of the stump of the neck and should the man himself assure you of the same shew you the junctures and identify himself to you by some indelible mark with which you had been previously acquaintedcould you withstand this evidence what could a judicious man reply butwhen such an event takes place i will tell you but what has this to do with the reasons for our belief in the truth of the written records of the old and new testament why do you fly off from the facts to a gigantic fictionwhen the possibility of the if with respect to a much less startling narration is the point in dispute between us  such and so peculiar and to an honest mind so unmistakeable is the character of veracity and simplicity on the very countenance as it were of the gospel that every remove of the inquirers attention from the facts themselves is a remove of his conversion it is your business to keep him from wandering not to set him the example  never surely was there a more unequal writer than skeltonin the discourses on the trinity the compeer of bull and waterland and yet the writer of these pages 500501 natural magic a stroke of art for example converting the nile into blood and then his definition of a miracle suspension of the laws of nature suspensionlawsnature bless me a chapter would be required for the explanation of each several word of this definition and little less than omniscience for its application in any one instance an effect presented to the senses without any adequate antecedent ejusdem generis is a miracle in the philosophic sense thus the corporeal ponderable hand and arm raised with no other known causative antecedent but a thought a pure act of an immaterial essentially invisible imponderable will is a miracle for a reflecting mind add the words præter experientiam and we have the definition of a miracle in the popular practical and appropriated sense   vol iii  that all our thoughts and views respecting our faith should be consistent with each other and with the attributes of god is most highly desirable but when the great diversities of mens understandings and the unavoidable influence of circumstances on the mind are considered we may hope from the divine mercy that the agreement in the result will suffice and that he who sincerely and efficiently believes that christ left the glory which he had with the father before all worlds to become man and die for our salvationthat by him we may and by him alone we can be savedwill be held a true believerwhether he interprets the words sacrifice purchase bargain satisfaction of the creditor by full payment of the debt and the like as proper and literal expressions of the redeeming act and the cause of our salvation as skelton seems to have doneor as i do as figurative language truly designating the effects and consequences of this adorable act and process   ib p 393    but were the prospect of a better parish in case of greater   diligence set before him by his bishop on the music of such a   promise like one bit by a tarantula we should probably soon see   him in motion and serving god o shameful for the sake of mammon   as if his torpid body had been animated anew by a returning soul  without any highflying in christian morality i cannot keep shrinking from the wish here expressed at all events i cannot sympathize with or participate in the expectation of an infinite advancement from men so motived   ib p 394    yet excommunication the inherent discipline of the church which it   exercised under persecution which it is still permitted to exercise   under the present establishment  rarely i suspect without exposing the clergyman to the risk of an action for damages or some abuse there are few subjects that more need investigation yet require more vigour and soundness of judgment to be rightly handled than this of christian discipline in a church established by law it is indeed a most difficult and delicate problem and supplied baxter with a most plausible and to me the only perplexing of his numerous objections to our ecclesiastical constitution on the other hand i saw clearly that he was requiring an impossibility and that his argument carried on to its proper consequences concluded against all church establishment not more against the national church of which he complained than the one of his own clipping and shaping which he would have substituted consequently every proof and i saw many and satisfactory proofs of the moral and political necessity of an established church was at the same time a pledge that a deeper insight would detect some flaw in the reasoning of the disciplinarians for if a be right and requisite b which is incompatible with a cannot be rightly required and this it was that first led me to the distinction between the ecclesia and an enclesia concerning which see my essay on establishment and dissent in which i have met the objection to my position that christian discipline is incompatible with a church established by law from the fact of the discipline of the church of scotland 4 who denies that it is in the power of a legislature to punish certain offences by ignominy and to make the clergy magistrates in reference to these the question is whether it is wise or expedient which it may be or rather may have been in scotland and the contrary in england wise or unwise this is not discipline not christian discipline enforced only by spiritual motives enacted by spiritual authority and submitted to for conscience sake   ib p 446    be this as it may the foreknowledge and the decree were both eternal   here now it is a clear point that the moral actions of all accountable   agents were with certainty foreknown and their doom unalterably   fixed long before any one of them existed  strange that so great a man as skelton should first affirm eternity of both yet in the next sentence talk of long before these reflections 5 are excellent but here skelton offends against his own canons i should feel no reluctance moral or speculative in accepting the apparent necessity of both propositions as a sufficient reason for believing both and the transcendancy of the subject as a sufficient solution of their apparent incompatibility but yet i think that another view of the subject not less congruous with universal reason and more agreeable to the light of reason in the human understanding might be defended without detracting from any perfection of the divine being nay i think that skelton needed but one step more to have seen it   ib p 478   in fine  to what purpose were these reflections taken as a whole written i cannot answer to dissuade men from reasoning on a subject beyond our faculties then why all this reasoning   vol iv p 28 deism revealed     shepherd were you ever at constantinople sir

of what is told us by the           historians concerning that memorable transaction    dech not the least    shep pray is it either selfevident or demonstrable to you at           this time and place that there is any such city as           constantinople or that there ever was such a man as cæsar    dech by no means    shep and you have all you know concerning the being of either the           city or the man merely from the report of others who had it           from others and so on through many links of tradition    dech i have    shep you see then that there are certain cases in which the           evidence of things not seen nor either sensibly or           demonstrably perceived can justly challenge so entire an           assent that he who should pretend to refuse it in the fullest           measure of acquiescence would be deservedly esteemed the most           stupid or perverse of mankind  that there is a sophism here every one must feel in the very fact of being nonplusd without being convinced the sophism consists in the instance being haud ejusdem generis greek élegchos metabáseôs eis állo génos and what the allogeneity is between the assurance of the being of madrid or constantinople and the belief of the fact of the resurrection of christ i have shown elsewhere the universal belief of the tyrannicidium of julius cæsar is doubtless a fairer instance but the whole mode of argument is unsound and unsatisfying why run off from the fact in question or the class at least to which it belongs the victory can be but accidentala victory obtained by the unguarded logic or want of logical foresight of the antagonist who needs only narrow his positions to narrations of facts and events in our judgment of which we are not aided by the analogy of previous and succeeding experience to deprive you of the opportunity of skirmishing thus on no mans land but this is skeltons ruling passion sometimes his strengthtoo often his weakness he must force the reader to believe or rather he has an antagonist a wilful infidel or heretic always and exclusively before his imagination or if he thinks of the reader at all it is as of a partizan enjoying every hard thump and smashing fister he gives the adversary whom skelton hates too cordially to endure to obtain any thing from him with his own liking no it must be against his will and in spite of it no thanks to himthe dog could not help himself how much more effectual would he have found it to have commenced by placing himself in a state of sympathy with the supposed sceptic or unbelieverto have stated to him his own feelings and the real grounds on which they restedto have shown himself the difference between the historical facts which the sceptic takes for granted and believes spontaneously as it wereand those which are to be the subject of discussion and this brings the question at once to the proof and here after all lies the strength of skeltons reasoning which would have worked far more powerfully had it come first and single and with the whole attention directed towards it   ib p 35    templeton surely the resurrection of christ or any other man                cannot be a thing impossible with god it is neither                above his power nor when employed for a sufficient                purpose inconsistent with his majesty wisdom and                goodness  this is the ever open and vulnerable part of deism the deist as a deist believes implicite at least so many and stupendous miracles as to render his disbelief of lesser miracles simply because they are miraculous gross inconsistencies to have the battle fairly fought out spinoza or a bhuddist or a burmese gymnosoph should be challenged then i am deeply persuaded would the truth appear in full evidence that no christ no godand conversely if the father then the son i can never too often repeat that revealed religion is a pleonasm religion is revelation and revelation the only religion   ib p 37    shep those believers whose faith is to rely on the truth of the           christian history rest their assent on a written report made           by eyewitnesses which report the various churches and sects           jealous of one another took care to preserve genuine and           uncorrupted at least in all material points and all the           religious writers in every age since have amply attested  a divine of the present day who shall undertake the demonstration of the truth of christianity by external evidences or historically must not content himself with assuming or asserting this he must either prove it or prove that such proof is not necessary i myself should be quite satisfied if i proved the former position in respect to the fourth gospel and showed that the evidence of the other three was equivalent to a record by an eyewitness which would not be at all inconsistent with my contending at the same time for the authenticity of the first gospel or rather for the catholic interpretation of the titlewords greek katà matthaion as the more probable opinion which a sound divine will neither abandon nor overload neither place it in the foundation nor on the other hand suffer it to be extruded from the wall believe me there is great very great danger in these broad unqualified assertions that skelton deals in even though the balance of evidence should be on his side yet the inquirer will be unfavourably affected by the numerous doubts and difficulties which an acquaintance with the more modern works of biblical criticism will pour upon him and for which his mind is wholly unprepared to meet with a far weaker evidence than we had taken it for granted we were to find gives the same shake to the mind that missing a stair gives to the body   ib p 243    temp you mr dechaine seem to forget that god is just and you           mr shepherd that he is merciful    dech i insist that as god is merciful he will forgive    shep and i insist that as he is just he will punish    temp pray mr dechaine are you able upon the deistical scheme to           rid yourself of this difficulty    dech i see no difficulty in it at all god gives us laws only for           our good and will never suffer those laws to become a snare           to us and the occasion of our eternal misery  here is the cardo the man of sense asserts that it is necessary for the good of all that a code of laws should exist while yet it is impossible that all should at all times be obeyed by each person but what is impossible cannot be required nevertheless it may be required that no iota of any one of these laws should be wilfully and deliberately transgressed nor is there any one for the transgression of which the transgressor must not hold himself punishable and yet says our man of sense what may not be said of any one point or any one moment cannot be denied of the collective agency of a whole life or any considerable section of it here we find ourselves constrained by our best feelings to praise or condemn to reward or punish according as a great predominance of acts of obedience or disobedience and a continued love of the better or the lusting after the worst manifests the maxim regula maxima the radical will and proper character of the individual so parents judge of their children so schoolmasters of their scholars so friends of friends and even so will god judge his creatures if we are to trust in our common sense or believe the repeated declarations in the old testament and now i should be glad to hear any satisfactory sensible reply to this or any answer that does not fly higher than sense can follow and pierce into the thick clouds of decried metaphysics for no fair reply can be imagined but one which would find the root of the moral evil the true greek ponaerón in this very impossibility   ib p 249    cunningham but how does all this discourse about sacrifices and the                 natural light show that your faith does not ascribe                 injustice to god in putting an innocent person to death                 for the transgressions of the guilty    shep was christ innocent    cunn he was without sin    shep and he was put to death by the appointment and           predetermination of god    cunn the jews put him to death    shep do not evade the question was he not the lamb slain from the           foundation of the world was he not so delivered by the           determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god that the jews           having taken him by wicked hands crucified and slew him    cunn and what then    shep nothing but that you are to answer as well as i for saying           that god predetermined the death of this only innocent person  i am less pleased with this volume than with any of the preceding ask your own heart and conscience whether for instance they are satisfied with this defence duri per durius or whether frightening a modest query into silence by perverting it into an accusation of the almighty by virtue of a conclusion borrowed from the calvinistic theory of predestination is not more in the spirit of jobs comforters than becomes a minister of the apostolic church of england and ireland such arguments are but edgetools at the safest but more often they may rather be likened to the twoedged blade of parysatiss knife the one of which was poisoned leave them to calvin or those who dare appropriate calvins words that gods absolute will is the only rule of his justicethus dividing the divine attributes yet calvin himself distinguishes the hidden from the revealed god even as the greek fathers distinguished the greek thélaema theou the absolute ground of all being from the greek boulàe tou theou as the cause and disposing providence of all existence  but i disapprove of the plan and spirit of this work deism revealed the coldhearted worldlyminded cunning deist or the coarse sensual infidel is of all men the least likely to be converted and the conscientious inquiring though misled and perplexed sceptic will throw aside a book at once as not applicable to his case which treats every doubt as a crime and supposes that there is no doubt at all possible but in a bad heart and from wicked wishes compare this with st pauls language concerning the jews  so again pp 225 c of this volume do not the plainest intuitions of our moral and rational being confirm the positions here attributed to the deist dechaine are they not the same by which melancthon decalvinized at least deaugustinized the heroic lutherthose which constitute one of the only two essential differences between the augsburg confession and the calvinistic articles of faith and can anything be more flittery and specialpleading than skeltons objections and again p 507 and that prayer which he tindal is reported to have used a little before his death if there is a god i desire he may have mercy on mewas it christianlike to publish and circulate a blind reportso improbable and disgusting as to demand the strongest and most unsuspicious testimony for its reception   ib p 268    shep pray mr dechaine if a person whom you knew to be an honest           and clearsighted man should solemnly assure you he saw a           dead man restored to life what would you think of his           testimony    dech as i could not possibly have as strong an assurance of his           honesty clearsightedness and penetration as of the great           improbability of the fact i should not believe him    shep well it is true he might be deceived himself or intend to           impose on you but in case ten such persons should all at           different times confirm the same report how would this           affect you  there is one inconvenience not to say danger in this argument of mr shepherds namely that of its not standing in the same force when it comes to be repeated in the particular miraculous facts in support of which it is adduced   ib p 281    no other ancient book can be so well proved to have been the work of   the author it is now ascribed to as every book of the new testament   can be proved to have been written by him whose name it hath all along   borne  this is true to the full extent that the defence of the divinity of our religion needs or perhaps permits and i see no advantage gained by asserting more i must lose all power of distinction before i can affirm that the genuineness of the first gospelthat in its present form it was written by matthew or is a literal translation of a gospel written by himrests on as strong external evidence as lukes or on as strong internal evidence as st johns sufficient that the evidence greatly preponderates in its favor    footnote 1 the complete works of the late rev philip skelton

did not deny that to be gods own son was to be equal   with the father nor did they allege that such an equality would   destroy the divine unity a thought of this kind never seems to have   occurred to their minds  in so truly excellent a book as this is i regret that this position should rest on an assertion the equality of christ would not indeed destroy the unity of god the father considered as one person but unless we presume the jews in question acquainted with the great truth of the triunity we must admit that it would be considered as implying ditheism now that some among the jews had made very near approaches though blended with errors to the doctrine taught in john c i we can prove from the writings of philoand the socinians can never prove that these jews did not know at least of the doctrine of their schools concerning the onlybegotten wordgreek lógos monogenáesnot as an attribute much less as an abstraction or personificationbut as a distinct hypostasis greek symphysikáeand hence it might be shown that their offence was that the carpenters son the galilean should call himself the greek theòs phanerós this might have been rendered more than probable by the concluding sentence of christs answer to the disciples of johnand blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me luke vii 23 which appears to have no adequate or even tolerable meaning unless in reference to the passage in isaiah lxi 1 2 prophesying that jehovah himself would come among them and do the things which our saviour states himself to have done thus too i regret that the answer of our lord john x 3436 being one of the imagined strongholds of the socinians should not have been more fully cleared up i doubt not that fullers is a true interpretation and that no other is consistent with our lords various other declarations but the words in and by themselves admit a more plausible misinterpretation than is elsewhere the case of socinian displanations in short i think both passages would have been better deferred to a further part of the work  let me add that a mighty and comparatively new argument against the socinians may be most unanswerably deduced from this reply of our lords even were it considered as a mere argumentum ad homines namely that it was not his messiahship that so offended the jews but his sonship otherwise our saviours language would have neither force motive or object even were i no more than the messiah in your meanest conceptions of that character yet after what i have done before your eyes nothing but malignant hearts could have prevented you from adopting a milder interpretation of my words when in your own scriptures there exists a precedent that so much more than merely justifies me and this i believe to be the meaning of the words as intended to be understood by the jews in question though doubtless fullers sense exists implicite no candid person would ever call it an evasion to prove the injustice and malignity of an accuser even from his own groundsyou charge me falsely but even were your charge true namely that i am a mere man and yet call myself the son of god still it would not follow that i have been guilty of blasphemy but as understood by the modern unicists it would verily verily be an evasive ambiguity most unworthy of christian belief concerning his saviour common charity would have demanded of him to have saidi am a mere man i do not pretend to be more but i used the words in analogy to the words ye are as gods and i have a right to do so for though a mere man i am the great prophet and messenger which moses promised you   letter v p 72    if dr priestley had formed his estimate of human virtue by that great   standard which requires love to god with all the heart soul mind   and strength and our neighbour as ourselvesinstead of representing   men by nature as having more virtue than vicehe must have   acknowledged with the scripture that the whole world lieth in   wickednessthat every thought and imagination of their heart is only   evil continuallyand that there is none of them that doeth good no   not one  to this the unicists would answer that by the whole world is meant all the worldlymindedno matter in how direct opposition to half a score other texts one text at a time sufficient for the day is the evil thereofand in this way they go on pulling out hair by hair from the horses tail say rather dreaming that they do so and then conclude with a shout that the horse never had a tail for why this hair is not a tail nor that nor the third and so on to the very last and how can all do what none of all doesridiculous as this is it is a fair image of socinian logic thank god their plucking out is a mere fancyand the sole miserable reality is the bare rump which they call their religionbut that is the apes own growth   ib p 77    first that all punishments are designed for the good of the whole   and less or corrective punishments for the good of the offender is   admitted   god never inflicts punishment for the sake of punishing  this is not greek hôs émoige dokei sufficiently guarded that all punishments work for the good of the whole and that the good of the whole is included in gods design i admit but that this is the sole cause and the sole justification of divine punishment i cannot i dare not concedebecause i should thus deny the essential evil of guilt and its inherent incompatibility with the presence of a being of infinite holiness now exclusion from god implies the sum and utmost of punishment and this would follow from the very essence of guilt and holiness independently of example consequence or circumstance   letter vi p 90    the systems compared as to their tendency to promote morality in   general  i have hitherto made no objection to no remark on any one part of this letter for i object to the wholenot as calvinism butas what calvin would have recoiled from how was it that so good and shrewd a man as andrew fuller should not have seen that the difference between a calvinist and a priestleyan materialistnecessitarian consists in thisthe former not only believes a will but that it is equivalent to the ego ipse to the actual self in every moral agent though he believes that in human nature it is an enslaved because a corrupt will in denying free will to the unregenerated he no more denies will than in asserting the poor negroes in the west indies to be slaves i deny them to be men now the latter the priestleyan uses the word willnot for any real distinct correspondent power butfor the mere result and aggregate of fibres motions and sensations in short it is a mere generic term with him just as when we say the main current in a river  now by not adverting to this and alas misled by jonathan edwardss book fuller has hidden from himself and his readers the damnable nature of the doctrinenot of necessity for that in its highest sense is identical with perfect freedom they are definitions each of the other butof extraneous compulsion o even this is not adequate to the monstrosity of the thought a denial of all agencyor an assertion of a world of agents that never act but are always acted upon and yet without any one being that actsthis is the hybrid of death and sin which throughout this letter is treated so amicably another fearful mistake and which is the ground of the former lies in conceding to the materialist explicite et implicite that the greek noúmenon the intelligibile the ipseitas super sensibilis of guilt is in time and of time and consequently a mechanism of cause and effectin other words in confounding the greek phainómena tà rhéonta tà màe óntôs óntaall which belong to time and cannot be even thought of except as effects necessarily predetermined by the precedent causes themselves in their turn effects of other causeswith the transsensual ground or actual power  after such admissions no other possible defence can be made for calvinism or any other ism than the wretched recrimination why yours dr priestley is just as badyea and no wonderfor in essentials both are the same but there was no reason for fullers meddling with the subject at allmetaphysically i mean   ib p 95    if the unconditionality of election render it unfriendly to virtue it   must be upon the supposition of that view of things which attributes   more to god and less to man having such ascendancy which is the   very reverse of what dr priestley elsewhere teaches and that in the   same performance  but in both systems as fuller has erroneously stated his own man is annihilated there is neither more nor less it is all god all all are but deus infinite modificatusin brief both systems are not spinosism for no other reason than that the logic and logical consequency of 10 fullers  10 x 10 dr priestleys piled on each other would not reach the calf of spinozas leg both systems of necessity lead to spinosism nay to all the horrible consequences attributed to it by spinozas enemies o why did andrew fuller quit the high vantage ground of notorious facts plain durable common sense and express scripture to delve in the dark in order to countermine mines under a spot on which he had no business to have wall tent temple or even standingground    footnote 1 the calvinistic and socinian systems examined and compared as to their moral

mean no other works than those before mentioned are not philos works full of crowded with platonic and pythagorean philosophy eusebius knew from his works that he was a great platonic scholar but that he was greater than any other man of his age he could only learn from report or history that virgil is a great poet i know from his poems but that he was the greatest of the augustan age i must learn from quinctilian and others   ib p 35  philo and the author of the wisdom of solomonor rather perhaps authors for the first ten chapters form a complete work of themselveswere both cabalisticoplatonizing jews of alexandria as far as being such they must agree so far they do agree and as widely as such men could differ do they differ not only the style of the wisdom of solomon is generically different from philosso much so that i should deem it a free translation from a hebrew originalbut also in all the minutiæ of traditional history and dogma it contradicts philo philo attributes the creation of man to angels and they infused the evil principle through their own imperfections in the book of wisdom god created man spotless and the devil tempting him occasioned the fall so the whole account of the plagues of egypt differs as widely as possible even to absolute contradiction the origin of idolatry is explained altogether differently by philo and by the book of wisdom in short so unsupported is the tradition that many have supposed an elder philo as the author that the second and third chapters allude to christ is a groundless hypothesis the just man is called the son of god jehovah greek pais kyriónbut christs specific title which was deemed blasphemous by the jews was ben elohim greek uhiòs tou theouand the fancy that philo was a christian in heart but dared not openly profess himself such is too absurd why no traces in his latest work or those of his middle age why not the least variation in his religious or philosophical creeds in his latter works written long after the resurrection from those composed by him before or a few years after christs birth some of philos earlier works must have been written when our lord was in his infancy or at least boyhood  in short just take all those passages of philo which most closely resemble others in the wisdom of solomon and contain the same or nearly the same thoughts and write them in opposite columns and no doubt will remain that philo was not the composer of the book of wisdom philo subtle and with long involved periods knit together by logical connectives the book of wisdom sententious full of parallelisms assertory and hebraistic throughout it was either composed by a man who tried to hebraize the greek or if a translator by one who tried to greecise the hebraisms of his originalnot to disguise or hide thembut only so as to prevent them from repelling or misleading the greek reader the different use of the greek particles in the wisdom of solomon and in the works of philo is sufficient to confute the hypothesis of philo being the author as little could it have been written by a christian for it could not have been a christian of palestine from the overflowing alexandrine platonismnor a christian at all for it contradicts the doctrine of the resurrection of the body and in no wise connects any redemptory or sacrificial virtue with the death of his just mandenies original sin in the christian sense and explains the vice and virtue of mankind by the actions of the souls of men in a state of preexistence no signs or miracles are referred to in the account of the just man and that it was intended as a generalization is evident from the change of the singular into the plural number in the third chapter  the result is in my judgment that this book was composed by an unknown jew of alexandria either sometime before or at the same time with christ i do not think st pauls parallel passages amount to any proof of quotation or allusionthey contain the common doctrine of the spiritualized judaism in the cabalaand yet the work could scarcely have been written long before christ or it would certainly have been quoted or mentioned by philo and most probably by josephus and this too is an answer to the splendid and wellsupported hypothesis of its being a translation from a chaldaic original composed by jerubbabel the variations of the syriac translationwhich are so easily explained by translating the passage into the chaldaic when the cause of the mistake in the greek or of the variation in the syriac is seen at onceare certainly startling but they are too free and how could the fathers jerome for example remain ignorant of the existence of this chaldaic original my own opinion is as i said before that the book was written in greek by an alexandrian jew who had formed his style on that of the lxx and was led still further to an imitation of the old testament manner by the nature of his fiction and as a dramatic propriety and yet deviated from it partly on account of the very remoteness of his platonic conceptions from the simplicity and poverty of the hebrew and partly because of the wordy rhetoric epidemic in alexandria and that it was written before the death if not the birth of christ i am induced to believe because i do not think it probable that a book composed by a jew who had confessed christ after the resurrection would so soon have been received by the christians and so early placed in the very next rank to works of full inspiration  taken therefore as a work ante or at least extra christum it is most valuable as ascertaining the opinions of the learned jews on many subjects and the general belief concerning immortality and a day of judgment on this ground whitaker might have erected a most formidable battery that would have played on the very camp and battlearray of the socinians that is of those who consider christ only as a teacher of important truths  in referring to the cabala i am not ignorant of the date of the oldest rabbinical writings which contain or refer to this philosophy but i coincide with eichorn and very many before eichorn that the foundations of the cabala were laid and well known long before christ though not all the fanciful superstructure i am persuaded that new light might be thrown on the apocalypse by a careful study of the book sohar and of whatever else there may be of that kind the introduction i 4 is clearly cabalathe greek ho ôn kaì ho aen kaì ho erchómenos 3 and the seven spirits  10 sephiroth constituting together the adam kadmon the second adam of st paul the incarnate one in the messiah  were it not for the silence of philo and josephus which i am unable to explain if the wisdom of solomon was written so long before christ i might perhaps incline to believe it composed shortly after if not during the persecution of the jews in egypt under ptolemy philopator this hypothesis would give a particular point to the bitter exposure of idolatry to the comparison between the sufferings of the jews and those of idolatrous nations to the long rehearsal and rhetorical declaration of the plagues of egypt and to the reward of the just man after a death of martyrdom and would besides help to explain the putting together of the first ten chapters and the fragment contained in the remaining chapters they were works written at the same time and by the same author nay i do not think it absurd to suppose that the chapters after the tenth were annexed by the writer himself as a long explanatory appendix or possibly if they were once a separate work these nine concluding chapters were parts of a book composed during the persecution in egypt the introduction and termination of which being personal and of local application were afterwards omitted or expunged in order not to give offence to the other egyptiansperhaps to spare the shame of such jews as had apostatized through fear and in general not to revive heartburnings in modern language i should call these chapters in their present state a note on c x 1519  on a reperusal of this book i rather believe that these latter chapters never formed part of any other work but were composed as a sort of long explanatory postscript with particular bearing on certain existing circumstances to which this part of the jewish history was especially applicable nay i begin to find the silence of philo and josephus less inexplicable and to imagine that i discover the solution of this problem in the very title of the book no one expects to find any but works of authenticity enumerated in these writers but to this a work calling itself the wisdom of solomon both being a fiction and never meant to pass for anything else could make no pretensions to have approximated it to the holy books of the nation would have injured the dignity of the jewish canon and brought suspicion on the genuine works of solomon while it would have exposed to a charge of forgery a composition which was in itself only an innocent dramatic monologue n b this hypothesis possesses all the advantages and involves none of the absurdity of that which would attribute the ecclesiasticus to the infamous jason the high priest more than one commentator i find has suspected that the wisdom of solomon and the second book of maccabees were by the same author i think this nothing   ib p 36    philo throws out a number of declarations that shew his own and the   jewish belief in a secondary sort of god a god subordinate in origin   to the father of all yet most intimately united with him and sharing   his most unquestionable honours  the belief of the alexandrian jews who had acquired greek philosophy no doubtbut of the palestine jews   ib 2 p 48    st john also is witnessed by a heathen amelius and by one who put   him down for a barbarian to have represented the logos as the maker   of all things as with god and as god and st john is   attested to have declared this not even as shaded over but on the   contrary as placed in full view  stranger still whitaker could scarcely have read the greek amelius says that these truths if stripped of their allegorical dress greek metapephrasména ek taes tou barbárou theologías would be plainthat is that john in an allegory as of one particular man had shadowed out the creation of all things by the logos and the after union of the logos with human naturethat is with all men that this is his meaning consult plotinus   ib 9 p 107    seest thou not adds philo in the same spirit of subtilizing being   into power and dividing the logos into two  who that had even rested but in the porch of the alexandrian philosophy would not rather say of substantiating powers and attributes into being what is the whole system from philo to plotinus and thence to proclus inclusively but one fanciful process of hypostasizing logical conceptions and generic terms in proclus it is logolatry run mad   chap iii 1 p 1312    such would be the evidence for that divinity to accompany the book of   wisdom if we considered it to be as old as solomon or only as the   son of sirach but i consider it to be much later than either and   actually a work of philos   the language is very similar to   philos flowing lively and happy  how is it possible to have read the short hebraistic sentences of the book of wisdom and the long involved periods that characterize the style of all philos known writings and yet attribute both to one writer but indeed i know no instance of assertions made so audaciously or of passages misrepresented and even mistranslated so grossly as in this work of whitaker his system is absolute naked tritheism   ib    the righteous man is shadowed out by the author with a plain reference   to our saviour himself let us lie in wait for the righteous c  how then could philo have remained a jew   ib 2 p 195    in all effects that are voluntary the cause must be prior to the   effect as the father is to the son in human generation but in all   that are necessary the effect must be coeval with the cause as the   stream is with the fountain and light with the sun had the sun been   eternal in its duration light would have been coeternal with it  a just remark but it cuts two ways for these necessary effects are not really but only logically different or distinct from the causethe rays of the sun are only the sun diffused and the whole rests on the sensitive form of material space take away the notion of material space and the whole distinction perishes   chap iv 1 p 266    justin accordingly sets himself to shew that in the beginning before   all creatures god generated a certain rational power out of himself  is it not monstrous that the jews having according to whitaker fully believed a trinity one and all but half a century or less before trypho justin should never refer to this general faith never reproach trypho with the present opposition to it as a heresy from their own forefathers even those who rejected christ or rather jesus as christbut nonot a single objection ever strikes mr whitaker or appears worthy of an answer the stupidest become authenticthe most fantastic abstractions of the alexandrine dreamers substantial realities i confess this book has satisfied me how little erudition will gain a man nowadays the reputation of vast learning if it be only accompanied with dash and insolence it seems to me impossible that whitaker can have written well on the subject of mary queen of scots his powers of judgment being apparently so abject for instance he says that the grossest moral improbability is swept away by positive evidenceas if positive evidence that is the belief i am to yield to a or b were not itself grounded on moral probabilities upon my word whitaker would have been a choice judge for charles ii and titus oates   ib p 267    justin therefore proceeds to demonstrate it the preexistence of   christ asserting joshua to have given only a temporary inheritance   to the jews c  a precious beginning of a precious demonstration it is well for me that my faith in the trinity is already well grounded by the scriptures by bishop bull and the best parts of plotinus or this man would certainly have made me either a socinian or a deist   ib 2 p 270    the general mode of commencing and concluding the epistles of st   paul is a prayer of supplication for the parties to whom they were   addressed in which he says grace to you and peace from god our   father andfrom whom besidesthe lord jesus christ in which   our saviour is at times invoked alone as the grace of our lord jesus   christ be with you all and is even invoked the first at times as   the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the   communion of the holy ghost be with you all shews us plainly c  invoked surely a pious wish is not an invocation may good angels attend you is no invocation or worship of angels the essence of religions adoration consists in the attributing by an act of prayer or praise a necessary presence to an objectwhich not being distinguishable if the object be sensuously present we may safely define adoration as an acknowledgement of the actual and necessary presence of an intelligent being not present to our senses may lucky stars shoot influence on you would be a very foolish superstition but to say in earnest o ye stars i pray to you shoot influences on me would be idolatry christ was visually present to stephen his invocation therefore was not perforce an act of religious adoration an acknowledgment of christs deity    footnote 1 the origin of arianism disclosed by john whitaker bd london 1791                                               notes on oxlee on

contemporary of alfred and from scotus to the rev john oxlee in 1815 not unfrequentdelusion of mistaking pantheism disguised in a fancy dress of pious phrases for a more spiritual and philosophic form of christian faith nay stranger stillto imagine with scotus and mr oxlee that in a scheme which more directly than even the grosser species of atheism precludes all moral responsibility and subverts all essential difference of right and wrong they have found the means of proving and explaining the christian doctrines of the trinity and incarnation that is the great and only sufficient antidotes of the right faith against this insidious poison for pantheismtrick it up as you willis but a painted atheism a mask of perverted scriptures may hide its ugly face but cannot change a single feature   introduction p 4    in the infancy of the christian church and immediately after the   general dispersion which necessarily followed the sacking of jerusalem   and bither the greek and latin fathers had the fairest opportunity of   disputing with the jews and of evincing the truth of the gospel   dispensation but unfortunately for the success of so noble a design   they were totally ignorant of the hebrew scriptures and so wanted in   every argument that stamp of authority which was equally necessary to   sanction the principles of christianity and to command the respect of   their jewish antagonists for the confirmation of this remark i may   appeal to the fathers themselves but especially to barnabas justin   and irenæus who in their several attempts at hebrew learning betray   such portentous signs of ignorance and stupidity that we are covered   with shame at the sight of their criticisms  mr oxlee would be delighted in reading jacob rhenferds disquisition on the ebionites and other supposed heretics among the jewish christians and i cannot help thinking that rhenferd who has so ably anticipated mr oxlee on this point and in jortins best manner displayed the gross ignorance of the gentile fathers in all matters relating to hebrew learning and the ludicrous yet mischievous results thereof has formed a juster though very much lower opinion of these fathers with a few exceptions than mr oxlee i confess that till the light of the twofoldness of the christian church dawned on my mind the study of the history and literature of the church during the first three or four centuries infected me with a spirit of doubt and disgust which required a frequent recurrence to the writings of john and paul to preserve me whole in the faith   prop i ch i p 16    the truth of the doctrine is vehemently insisted on in a variety of   places by the great r moses ben maimon who founds upon it the unity   of the godhead and ranks it among the fundamental articles of the   jewish religion thus in his celebrated letter to the jews of   marseilles he observes c  but what is obtained by quotations from maimonides more than from alexander hales or any other schoolman of the same age the metaphysics of the learned jew are derived from the same source namely aristotle and his object was the same as that of the christian schoolmen namely to systematize the religion he professed on the form and in the principles of the aristotelian philosophy  by the by it is a serious defect in mr oxlees work that he does not give the age of the writers whom he cites he cannot have expected all his readers to be as learned as himself   ib ch iii p 26  mr oxlee seems too much inclined to identify the rabbinical interpretations of scripture texts with their true sense when in reality the rabbis themselves not seldom used those interpretations as a convenient and popular mode of conveying their own philosophic opinions neither have i been able to admire the logic so general among the divines of both churches according to which if one two or perhaps three sentences in any one of the canonical books appear to declare a given doctrine all assertions of a different character must have been meant to be taken metaphorically   ib p 267    the prophet isaiah too clearly inculcates the spirituality of the   godhead in the following declaration but egypt is man and not god   and their horses flesh and not spirit c xxxi 3    in the   former member the prophet declares that egypt was man and not god   and then in terms of strict opposition enforces the sentiment by   adding that their cavalry was flesh and not spirit which is just as   if he had said but egypt which has horses in war is only a man   that is flesh and not god who is spirit  assuredly this is a false interpretation and utterly unpoetical it is even doubtful whether hebrew unable to transliterate txt ed ruach in this place means spirit in contradistinction to matter at all and not rather air or wind at all events the poetic decorum the proportion and the antithetic parallelism demand a somewhat as much below god as the horse is below man the opposition of flesh and spirit in the gospel of st john who thought in hebrew though he wrote in greek favours our common versionflesh and not spirit but the place in which this passage stands namely in one of the first forty chapters of isaiah and therefore written long before the captivity together with the majestic simplicity characteristic of isaiahs name gives perhaps a greater probability to the other egypt is man and not god and her horses flesh and not wind if mr oxlee renders the fourth verse of psalm civhe maketh spirits his messengers for our versionhe maketh his angels spiritsis without a violent inversion senseless this is a case in point for the use of the word spirits in the sense of incorporeal beings mr oxlee will hardly i apprehend attribute the opinion of some later rabbis that god alone and exclusively is a spirit to the sacred writers easy as it would be to quote a score of texts in proof of the contrary i however cannot doubt that the true rendering of the abovementioned verse in the psalms ishe maketh the winds his angels or messengers and the lightnings his ministrant servants  as to mr oxlees abstract intelligences i cannot but think abstract for pure and even pure intelligences for incorporeal a lax use of terms with regard to the point in question the truth seems to be this the ancient hebrews certainly distinguished the principle or ground of life understanding and will from ponderable visible matter the former they considered and called spirit and believed it to be an emission from the almighty father of spirits the latter they called body and in this sense they doubtless believed in the existence of incorporeal beings but that they had any notion of immaterial beings in the sense of des cartes is contrary to all we know of them and of every other people in the same degree of cultivation air fire light express the degrees of ascending refinement in the infancy of thought the life soul mind are supposed to be airanima animus that is greek ánemos spiritus greek pneuma in the childhood they are fire mens ignea ignicula and god himself greek pur noeròn pur aeízôon lastly in the youth of thought they are refined into light and that light is capable of subsisting in a latent state the experience of the stricken flint of lightning from the clouds and the like served to prove or at least it supplied a popular answer to the objectionif the soul be light why is it not visible that the purest light is invisible to our gross sense and that visible light is a compound of light and shadow were answers of a later and more refined period observe however that the hebrew legislator precluded all unfit applications of the materializing fancy by forbidding the people to imagine at all concerning god for the ear alone to the exclusion of all other bodily sense was he to be designated that is by the name all else was for the mindby power truth wisdom holiness mercy   prop ii ch ii p 36  i fear i must surrender my hope that mr oxlee was an exception to the rule that the study of rabbinical literature either finds a man whimmy or makes him so if neither the demands of poetic taste nor the peculiar character of oracles were of avail yet morality and piety might seem enough to convince any one that this vision of micaiah 2 chron c xviii 18 c was the poetic form the veil of the prophets meaning and a most sublime meaning it was mr oxlee should recollect that the forms and personages of visions are all and always symbolical   ib pp 3940    it will not avail us much however to have established their   incorporeity or spirituality if what r moses affirms be true      this impious paradox   swayed however by the authority of so   great a man even r david kimchi has dilapsed into the same error   c  to what purpose then are the crude metaphysics of these later rabbis brought forward differing as they do in no other respect from the theological dicta of the schoolmen but that they are written in a sort of hebrew i am far from denying that an interpreter of the scriptures may derive important aids from the jewish commentators aben ezra about 1150 especially was a truly great man but of this i am certain that he only will be benefited who can look down upon their works whilst studying themthat is he must thoroughly understand their weaknesses superstitions and rabid appetite for the marvellous and the monstrous and then read them as an enlightened chemist of the present day would read the writings of the old alchemists or as a linnæus might peruse the works of pliny and aldrovandus if he can do this wellif not he will line his skull with cobwebs   ib pp 40 41    but how i would ask is this position to be defended surely not by   contradicting almost every part of the inspired volumes in which such   frequent mention occurs of different and distinct angels appearing to   the patriarchs and prophets sometimes in groups and sometimes in   limited numbers   it is indeed so wholly repugnant to the general   tenor of the sacred writings and so abhorrent from the piety of both   jew and christian that the learned author himself either forgetting   what he had before advanced or else postponing his philosophy to his   religion has absolutely maintained the contrary in his explication of   the cherubim c  i am so far from agreeing with mr oxlee on these points that i not only doubt whether before the captivity any fair proof of the existence of angels in the present sense can be produced from the inspired scripturesbut think also that a strong argument for the divinity of christ and for his presence to the patriarchs and under the law rests on the contrary namely that the seraphim were images no less symbolical than the cherubim surely it is not presuming too much of a clergyman of the church of england to expect that he would measure the importance of a theological tenet by its bearings on our moral and spiritual duties by its practical tendencies what is it to us whether angels are the spirits of just men made perfect or a distinct class of moral and rational creatures augustine has well and wisely observed that reason recognizes only three essential kindsgod man beast try as long as you will you can never make an angel anything but a man with wings on his shoulders   ib ch iii p 58    but this deficiency in the mosaic account of the creation is amply   supplied by early tradition which inculcates not only that the angels   were created but that they were created either on the second day   according to r jochanan or on the fifth according to r chanania  inspired scripture amply supplied by the talmudic and rabbinical traditionsthis from a clergyman of the church of england  i am i confess greatly disappointed i had expected i scarce know why to have had some light thrown on the existence of the cabala in its present form from ezekiel to paul and john but mr oxlee takes it as he finds it and gravely ascribes this patchwork of corrupt platonism or plotinism with chaldean persian and judaic fables and fancies to the jewish doctors as an original profound and pious philosophy in its fountainhead the indispensable requisite not only to a profitable but even to a safe study of the cabala is a familiar knowledge of the docimastic philosophy that is a philosophy which has for its object the trial and testing of the weights and measures themselves the first principles definitions postulates axioms of logic and metaphysics but this is in no other way possible but by our enumeration of the mental faculties and an investigation of the constitution function limits and applicability ad quas res of each the application to this subject of the rules and forms of the understanding or discursive logic or even of the intuitions of the reason itself if reason be assumed as the first and highest has pantheism for its necessary result but this the cabalists did and consequently the cabalistic theosophy is pantheistic and pantheism in whatever drapery of pious phrases disguised is where it forms the whole of a system atheism and precludes moral responsibility and the essential difference of right and wrong one of the two contradistinctions of the hebrew revelation is the doctrine of positive creation this if not the only is the easiest and surest criterion between the idea of god and the notion of a mens agitans molem but this the cabalists evaded by their double meaning of the term nothing namely as nought  0 and as no thing and by their use of the term as designating god thus in words and to the ear they taught that the world was made out of nothing but in fact they meant and inculcated that the world was god himself expanded it is not therefore half a dozen passages respecting the first three proprietates2 in the sephiroth that will lead a wise man to expect the true doctrine of the trinity in the cabalistic scheme for he knows that the scholastic value the theological necessity of this doctrine consists in its exhibiting an idea of god which rescues our faith from both extremes cabalopantheism and anthropomorphism it is i say to prevent the necessity of the cabalistic inferences that the full and distinct developement of the doctrine of the trinity becomes necessary in every scheme of dogmatic theology if the first three proprietates are god so are the next seven and so are all ten god according to the cabalists is all in each and one in all i do not say that there is not a great deal of truth in this but i say that it is not as the cabalists represent it the whole truth spinoza himself describes his own philosophy as in substance the same with that of the ancient hebrew doctors the cabalistsonly unswathed from the biblical dress   ib p 61    similar to this is the declaration of r moses ben maimon for that   influence which flows from the deity to the actual production of   abstract intelligences flows also from the intelligences to their   production from each other in succession c  how much trouble would mr oxlee have saved himself had he in sober earnest asked his own mind what he meant by emanation and whether he could attach any intelligible meaning to the term at all as applied to spirit   ib p 65    thus having by variety of proofs demonstrated the fecundity of the   godhead in that all spiritualities of whatever gradation have   originated essentially and substantially from it like streams from   their fountain i avail myself of this as another sound argument that   in the sameness of the divine essence subsists a plurality of persons  a plurality with a vengeance why this is the very scoff of a late unitarian writeronly that he inverts the order mr oxlee proves ten trillions of trillions in the deity in order to deduce a fortiori the rationality of three the unitarian from the three pretends to deduce the equal rationality of as many thousands   ib p 66    so if without detriment to piety great things may be compared with   small i would contend that every intelligency descending by way of   emanation or impartition from the godhead must needs be a personality   of that godhead from which it has descended only so vastly unequal   to it in personal perfection that it can form no part of its proper   existency  is not this to all intents and purposes ascribing partibility to god indeed it is the necessary consequence of the emanation schemeunequalaye various wicked personalities of the godheadhow

through the whole of this pamphlet the rock on which and the quarry out of which the whole reasoning is builtan error therefore which will not indeed destroy its efficacy as a greek mísaetron or antiphiltre to inflame the scorn of the enemies of methodism but which must utterly incapacitate it for the better purpose of convincing the consciences or allaying the fanaticism of the methodists themselves this is the uniform and gross misstatement of the one great point in dispute by which the methodists are represented as holding the compatibility of an impure life with a saving faith whereas they only assert that the works of righteousness are the consequence not the price of redemption a gift included in the great gift of salvationand therefore not of merit but of imputation through the free love of the saviour   part i p 49    it is enough it seems that all the disorderly classes of mankind   prompted as they are by their worst passions to trample on the public   welfare should know that they are what every one else is convinced   they are the pests of society and the evil is remedied they are not   to be exhorted to honesty sobriety or the observance of any laws

recommendation to do his utmost towards his own cure and then to come   to him to finish it as it is in the minister of the gospel to   propose to the sinner to do his best by way of healing the disease   of the souland then to come to the lord jesus to perfect his   recovery the only previous qualification is to know our misery   and the remedy is prepared see dr hawkers works vol vi p 117

promise as to his reformation than the repetition of the ten commandments with paraphrases on the samebut why not both the barrister is at least as wrong in the undervaluing of the one as the pseudoevangelists in the exclusion of the other   ib p 51    whatever these new evangelists may teach to the contrary the present   state of public morals and of public happiness would assume a very

schemes   of depredation  that is if these thieves had a different willnot a mere wish however anxiousfor this wish the libertine doubtless has as described in p 50but an effective will well and who doubts this the point in dispute is as to the means of producing this reformation in the will which whatever the barrister may think christ at least thought so difficult as to speak of it not once or twice but uniformly as little less than miraculous as tantamount to a recreation this barrister may be likened to an ignorant but wellmeaning galenist who writing against some infamous quack who lived by puffing and vending pills of mercurial sublimate for all cases of a certain description should have no stronger argument than to extol sarsaparilla and lignum vitæ or senna in contempt of all mercurial preparations   ib p 56    not for the revenues of an archbishop would he exhort them to a duty   unknown in scripture of adding their five talents to the five they   have received c  all this is mere calumny and wilful misstatement of the tenets of wesley who never doubted that we are bound to improve our talents or on the other hand that we are equally bound having done so to be equally thankful to the giver of all things for the power and the will by which we improved the talents as for the original capital which is the object of the improvement the question is not whether christ will say well done thou good and faithful servant cbut whether the servant is to say it of himself now christ has delivered as positive a precept against our doing this as the promise can be that he will impute it to us if we do not impute it to our own merits   ib p 60    the complaints of the profligacy of servants of every class and of   the depravity of the times are in every bodys

their moral duties   to despise and insult those by whom they are taught  all this is no better than infamous slander unless the barrister can prove that these depraved servants and thieves are

is it not the meaning of the preacher did any methodist ever teach that salvation may be attained without sanctification this barrister for ever forgets that the whole point in dispute is not concerning the possibility of an immoral christian being saved which the methodist would deny as strenuously as himself and perhaps give an austerer sense to the word immoral but whether morality or as the methodists would call it sanctification be the price which we pay for the purchase of our salvation with our own money or a part of the same free gift god knows i am no advocate for methodism

mahometan   a   papist    it is only the religion of jesus christ that runs counter   to all the rest by affirmingthat we are saved and called with a   holy calling not according to our works but according to the   fathers own purpose and grace which was not sold to us on certain   conditions to be fulfilled by ourselves but was given us in christ   before the world began topladys works sermon on james ii 18  si sic omnia all this is just and forcible and surely nothing can be easier than to confute the methodist by shewing that his very nodoing when he comes to explain it is not only an act a work but even a very severe and perseverant energy of the will he is therefore to be arraigned of nonsense and abuse of words rather than of immoral doctrines   ib p 84    the sacred volume of holy writ declares that true pure religion   and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the   fatherless and widow in their affliction and to keep himself   unspotted from the world james i 27  this is now at least whatever might have been the meaning of the word religion in the time of the translators a false version st james is speaking of persons eminently zealous in those public or private acts of worship which we call divine service greek thraeskeía it should be rendered true worship c the passage is a fine burst of rhetoric and not a mere truism just as when we saya cheerful heart is a perpetual thanksgiving and a state of love and resignation the truest utterance of the lords prayer st james opposes christianity to the outward signs and ceremonial observances of the jewish and pagan religions but these are the only sure signs these are the most significant ceremonial observances by which your christianity is to be made knownto visit the fatherless c true religion does not consist quoad essentiam in these acts but in that habitual state of the whole moral being which manifests itself by these actsand which acts are to the religion of christ that which ablutions sacrifices and templegoing were to the mosaic religion namely its genuine greek thraeskeía that which was the religion of moses is the ceremonial or cult of the religion of christ moses commanded all good works even those stated by st james as the means of temporal felicity and this was the mosaic religion and to these he added a multitude of symbolical observances and these formed the mosaic cult cultus religionis greek thraeskeía christ commands holiness out of perfect love that is christian religion and adds to this no other ceremony or symbol than a pure life and active beneficence which says st james are the true cult 2   ib p 86    there is no one whose writings are better calculated to do good than   those of paley by inculcating the essential duties of common life   and the sound truths of practical christianity  indeed paleys whole system is reducible to this one preceptobey god and benefit your neighbour because you love yourself above all christ has

abused by superstitious or mystic enthusiasts   ib p 94    eventually the whole direction of the popular mind in the affairs of   religion will be gained into the hands of a set of ignorant fanatics

  composed in the far greater part of bigotted coarse illiterate and   lowbred enthusiasts men who have abandoned their lawful callings in   which by industry they might have been useful members of society to   take upon themselves concerns the most sacred with which nothing but   their vanity and their ignorance could have excited them to meddle  it is not the buffoonery of the reverend joker of the edinburgh review not the convulsed grin of mortification which sprawling prostrate in the dirt from the whiff and wind of the masterly disquisition in the quarterly review the itinerant preacher would pass oft for the broad grin of triumph no nor even the overvalued distinction of miracles which will prevent him from seeing and shewing the equal applicability of all this to the

this to the galilean sect and yetvicisti o galilæe   ib p 95    they never fail to refer to the proud pharisee whom they term   selfrighteous and thus having greatly misrepresented his   character they proceed to declaim on the arrogance of founding any   expectation of reward from the performance of our moral   dutieswhereas the plain truth is that the pharisee was not   righteous but merely arrogated to himself that character he had   neglected all the moral duties of life  who told the barrister this not the gospel i am sure  the evangelical has only to translate these sentences into the true statement of his opinions in order to baffle this angry and impotent attack the selfrighteousness of all who expect to claim salvation on the plea of their own personal merit pay to a b at sightvalue received by meto messrs stone and co bankers heavengate it is a short step from this to the popish pay to a b or order once assume merits and i defy you to keep out supererogation and the old monte di pietà   ib p 97    and from thence occasion is taken to defame all those who strive to   prepare themselves during this their state of trial for that   judgment which they must undergo at that day when they will receive   either reward or punishment according as they shall be found to have   merited the one or deserved the other  can the barrister have read the new testament or does he know it only by quotations   ib    a swarm of new evangelists who are every where teaching the people   that no reliance is to be placed on holiness of life as a ground of   future acceptance  i am weary of repeating that this is false it is only denied that mere acts not proceeding from faith are or can be holiness as surely would the methodist say as the holy ghost proceeds from the son so surely does sanctification from redemption and not vice versamuch less from selfsanctifiedness that ostrich with its head in the sand and the plucked rump of its merits staring on the divine greek Átae venatrix   ib p 102    he that doeth righteousness is righteous since then it is plain   that each must himself be righteous if he be so at all what do   they mean who thus inveigh against selfrighteousness since christ   himself declares there is no other  here again the whole dispute lies in the word himself in the outward and visible sense both parties agree but the methodist calls it the will in us given by grace the barrister calls it our own will or we ourselves but why does not the barrister reserve a part of his wrath for dr priestley according to whom a villain has superior claims on the divine justice as an innocent martyr to the grand machinery of providencefor dr priestley who turns the whole dictionary of human nature into verbs impersonal with a perpetual subauditur of deus for their common nominative casewhich said deus however is but another automaton selfworked indeed but yet worked not properly working for he admits no more freedom or will to god than to man the lutheran leaves the free will whining with a broken back in the ditch and dr priestley puts the poor animal out of his miserybut seriously is it fair or even decent to appeal to the legislature against the methodists for holding the doctrine of the atonement do we not pray by act of parliament twenty times every sunday through the only merits of jesus christ is it not the very nose which of flesh or wax this very legislature insists on as an indispensable qualification for every christian face is not the lack thereof a felonious deformity yea the grimmest feature of the lues confirmata of statute heresy what says the reverend critic to this will he not rise in wrath against the barristerhe the pamphagus of homilitic liturgic and articular orthodoxythe garagantua whose ravenous maw leaves not a single word syllable letter no not one iota unswallowed if we are to believe his own recent and voluntary manifesto 3 what says he to this barrister and his hints to the legislature   ib p 105    if the new faith be the only true one let us embrace it but let not   those who vend these new articles expect that we should choose them   with our eyes shut  let any man read the homilies of the church of england and if he does not call this either blunt impudence or blank ignorance i will plead guilty to both new articles would to heaven some of them at least were why wesley himself was scandalized at luthers commentary on the epistle to the galatians and cried off from the moravians the strictest lutherans on that account   ib p 114    the catalogue of authors which this rev gentleman has pleased to   specify and recommend begins with homer hesiod the argonautics   Æschylus sophocles euripides pindar theognis herodotus   thucydides xenophon polybius diodorus siculus    this   catalogue says he might be considerably extended but i study   brevity it is only necessary for me to add that the recommendation of   these books is not to be considered as expressive of my approbation of   every particular sentiment they contain it would indeed be grievous   injustice if this writers reputation should be injured by the   occasional unsoundness of opinion in writers whom it is more than   probable he may never have read and for whose sentiments he ought no   more to be made answerable than the compiler of lackingtons   catalogue from which it is not unlikely that his own was abridged  very good   ib p 11516    these highstrained pretenders to godliness who deny the power of the   sinner to help himself take good care always to attribute his saving   change to the blessed effect of some sermon preached by some one or   other of their evangelical fraternity they always hold themselves   up to the multitude as the instruments producing all those marvellous   conversions which they relate no instance is recorded in their   saints calendar of any sinner resolving in consequence of a   reflective and serious perusal of the scriptures to lead a new life   no instance of a daily perusal of the bible producing a daily progress   in virtuous habits no the gospel has no such effectit is   always the gospel preacher who works the miracle c  excellent and just in this way are the methodists to be attackedeven as the papists were by baxter not from their doctrines but from their practices and the spirit of their sect there is a fine passage in lord bacon concerning a heresy of manner being not less pernicious than heresy of matter   ib p 118    but their saints who would stop their ears if you should mention with   admiration the name of a garrick or a siddonswho think it a sin to   support such an infamous profession as that through the medium of   which a milton a johnson an addison and a young have laboured to   mend the heart c  whoo see miltons preface to the samson agonistes   ib p 133    in the evangelical magazine is the following article atin   yorkshire after a handsome collection for the missionary society a   poor man whose wages are about 28s per week brought a donation of   20 guineas our friends hesitated to receive it   when he answered    before i knew the grace of our lord i was a poor drunkard i never   could save a shilling my family were in beggary and rags but since   it has pleased god to renew me by his grace we have been industrious   and frugal we have not spent many idle shillings and we have been   enabled to put something into the bank and this i freely offer to the   blessed cause of our lord and saviour this is the second donation of   this same poor man to the same amount whatever these evangelists may   think of such conduct they ought to be ashamed of thus basely taking   advantage of this poor ignorant enthusiast c  is it possible to read this affecting story without finding in it a complete answer to the charge of demoralizing the lower classes does the barrister really think that this generous and grateful enthusiast is as likely to be unprovided and povertystricken in his old age as he was prior to his conversion except indeed that at that time his old age was as improbable as his distresses were certain if he did live so long this is singing io pæan for the enemy with a vengeance   part ii p 14    it behoved him dr hawker in his letter to the barrister to show in   what manner a covenant can exist without terms or conditions  according to the methodists there is a conditionthat of faith in the power and promise of christ and the virtue of the cross and were it otherwise the objection is scarcely appropriate except at the old bailey or in the court of kings bench the barrister might have framed a second lawsyllogism as acute as his former the laws of england allow no binding covenant in a transfer of goods or chattels without value received but there can be no value received by godergo there can be no covenant between god and man and if jehovah should be as courteous as the house of commons and acknowledge the jurisdiction of the courts at westminster the pleading might hold perhaps and the pentateuch be quashed after an argument before the judges besides how childish to puff up the empty bladder of an old metaphysical football on the modus operandi interior of justification into a shew of practical substance as if it were no less solid than a cannon ball why drive it with all the vehemence that five toes can exert it would not kill a louse on the head of methodism repentance godly sorrow abhorrence of sin as sin and not merely dread from forecast of the consequences these the arminian would call means of obtaining salvation while the methodist more philosophically perhaps names them signs of the work of free grace commencing and the dawning of the sun of redemption and pray where is the practical difference   ib p 26    jesus answered him thusverily i say unto you unless a man be born   of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of   godthe true sense of which is obviously thisexcept a man be   initiated into my religion by baptism which at that time was   always preceded by a confession of faith and unless he manifest his   sincere reception of it by leading that upright and spiritual life   which it enjoins he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven or be a   partaker of that happiness which it belongs to me to confer on those   who believe in my name and keep my sayings  upon my faith as a christian if no more is meant by being born again than this the speaker must have had the strongest taste in metaphors of any teacher in verse or prose on record jacob behmen himself not excepted the very alchemists lag behind pity however that our barrister has not shown us how this plain and obvious business of baptism agrees with ver 8 of the same chapter the wind bloweth where it listeth c now if this does not express a visitation of the mind by a somewhat not in the own power or forethought of the mind itself what are words meant for   ib p 29    the true meaning of being born again in the sense in which our   saviour uses the phrase implies nothing more or less in plain terms   than thisto repent to lead for the future a religious life instead   of a life of disobedience to believe the holy scriptures and to pray   for grace and assistance to persevere in our obedience to the end all   this any man of common sense might explain in a few words  pray then for i will take the barristers own commentary what does the man of common sense mean by grace if he will explain grace in any other way than as the circumstances ab extra which would be mere mockery and in direct contradiction to a score of texts and yet without mystery i will undertake for dr hawker and co to make the new birth itself as plain as a pikestaff or a whales foal or sarah robartss rabbits   ib p 30    so that they go on in their sin waiting for a new birth c  so that they go on in their sinwho would not suppose it notorious that every methodist meetinghouse was a cage of newgate larks making up their minds to die game   ib    the following account is extracted from the methodist magazine for   1798 the lord astonished sarah roberts with his mercy by setting   her at liberty while employed in the necessary business of washing   for her family c  n b not the famous rabbitwomanshe was robarts   ib p 31    a washerwoman has all her sins blotted out in the twinkling of an   eye and while reeking with suds is received in the family of the   redeemers kingdom surely this is a most abominable profanation of   all that is serious c  and where pray is the absurdity of this has christ declared any antipathy to washerwomen or the holy ghost to warm suds why does not the barrister try his hand at the abominable profanation in a story of a certain woman with an issue of blood who was made free by touching the hem of a garment without the previous knowledge of the wearer    rode caper vitem tamen hinc cum stabis ad aras in tua quod fundi   cornua possit erit   ib p 32    the leading design of john the baptist   was  thisto prepare the   minds of men for the reception of that pure system of moral truth   which the saviour by divine authority was speedily to inculcate and   of those sublime doctrines of a resurrection and a future judgment   which as powerful motives to the practice of holiness he was soon to   reveal  what then did not john the baptist himself teach a pure system of moral truth was john so much more ignorant than paul before his conversion and the whole jewish nation except a few rich freethinkers as to be ignorant of the sublime doctrines of a resurrection and a future judgment this i well know is the stronghold of socinianism but surely one single unprejudiced perusal of the new testamentnot to suppose an acquaintance with kidder or lightfootwould blow it down like a house of cards   ib p 33   their faiths in the efficacy of their own rites and creeds and   ceremonies and their whole train of substitutions for moral duty   was so entire and in their opinion was such a saving faith that   they could not at all interpret any language that seemed to dispute   their value or deny their importance  poor strange jews they had doubtless what darwin would call a specific paralysis of the auditory nerves to the writings of their own prophets which yet were read sabbath after sabbath in their public synagogues for neither john nor christ himself ever did or indeed could speak in language more contemptuous of the folly of considering rites as substitutions for moral duty or in severer words denounce the blasphemy of such an opinion why need i refer to isaiah or micah   ib p 34    thus it was that this moral preacher explained and enforced the duty   of repentance and thus it was that he prepared the way for the   greatest and best of teachers c  well then if all this was but a preparation for the doctrines of christ those doctrines themselves must surely have been something different and more difficult oh no johns preparation consisted in a complete rehearsal of the drama didacticum which christ and the apostles were to exhibit to a full audiencenay prithee good barrister do not be too rash in charging the methodists with a monstrous burlesque of the gospel   ib p 37    the logic of the new evangelists will convince him that it is a   contradiction in terms even to suppose himself capable of doing any   thing to help or bringing any thing to recommend himself to the   divine favour  now suppose the wisdom of these endless attacks on an old abstruse metaphysical notion to be allowed yet why in the name of common candour does not the barrister ring the same tocsin against his friend dr priestleys scheme of necessityor against his idolized paley who explained the will as a sensation produced by the action of the intellect on the muscles and the intellect itself as a catenation of ideas and ideas as configurations of the organized brain would not every syllable apply yea and more strongly more indisputably and would his fellowsectaries thank him or admit the consequences or has any late socinian divine discovered that do as ye would be done unto is an interpolated precept   ib p 39    even repentance and faith says dr hawker those most essential   qualifications of the mind for the participation and enjoyment of the   blessings of the gospel and which all real disciples of the lord   jesus cannot but possess are never supposed as a condition which   the sinner performs to entitle him to mercy but merely as evidences   that he is brought and has obtained mercy they cannot be the   conditions of obtaining salvation  ought not this single quotation to have satisfied the barrister that no practical difference is deducible from these doctrines essential qualifications says the methodistterms and conditions says the spiritual higgler but if a man begins to reflect on his past life is he to withstand the inclination god forbid exclaim both if he feels a commencing shame and sorrow is he to check the feeling god forbid cry both in one breath but should not remembrancers be thrown in the way of sinners and the voice of warning sound through every street and every wilderness doubtless quoth the rationalist we do it we do it shout the methodists in every corner of every lane in the high road and in the waste we send forth the voicecome to christ and repent and be cleansed aye quoth the rationalist but i say repent and become clean and go to christnow is not mr rationalist as great a bigot as the methodists as he is me judice a worse psychologist   part ii p 40    the former authorities on this subject i had quoted from the gospel   according to st luke that gospel most positively and most solemnly   declares the repentance of sinners to be the condition on which   alone salvation can be obtained but the doctors of the new divinity   deny this they tell us distinctly it cannot be for the future   the gospel according to calvin must be received as the truth sinners   will certainly prefer it as the more comfortable of the two beyond all   comparison  mercy but only to read calvins account of that repentance without which there is no sign of election and to call it the more comfortable of the two the very term by which the german newbirthites express it is enough to give one goosefleshdas herzknirschenthe very heart crashed between the teeth of a lockjawd agony   ib    what is faith is it not a conviction produced in the mind by   adequate testimony  no that is not the meaning of faith in the gospel nor indeed anywhere else were it so the stronger the testimony the more adequate the faith yet who says i have faith in the existence of george ii as his present majestys antecessor and grandfatherif testimony then evidence tooand who has faith that the two sides of all triangles are greater than the third in truth faith even in common language always implies some effort something of evidence which is not universally adequate or communicable at will to others well to be sure he has behaved badly hitherto but i have faith in him if it were otherwise how could it be imputed as righteousness can morality exist without choicenay strengthen in proportion as it becomes more independent of the will a very meritorious man he has faith in every proposition of euclid which he understands   ib p 41    i could as easily create a world says dr hawker as create either   faith or repentance in my own heart surely this is a most monstrous   confession what is not the christian religion a revealed religion   and have we not the most miraculous attestation of its truth  just look at the answer of christ himself to nicodemus john iii 2 3 nicodemus professed a full belief in christs divine mission why it was attested by his miracles what answered christ well said o believer no not a word of this but the proof of the folly of such a supposition verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of godthat is he cannot have faith in me   ib p 42    how can this evangelical preacher declaim on the necessity of   seriously searching into the truth of revelation for the purpose   either of producing or confirming our belief of it when he has   already pronounced it to be just as possible to arrive at conviction   as to create a world  did dr hawker say that it was impossible to produce an assent to the historic credibility of the facts related in the gospel did he say that it was impossible to become a socinian by the weighing of outward evidences no but dr hawker saysand i saythat this is not cannot be what christ means by faith which to the misfortune of the socinians he always demands as the condition of a miracle instead of looking forward to it as the natural effect of a miracle how came it that peter saw miracles countless and yet was without faith till the holy ghost descended on him besides miracles may or may not be adequate evidence for socinianism but how could miracles prove the doctrine of redemption or the divinity of christ but this is the creed of the church of england  it is wearisome to be under the necessity or at least the constant temptation of attacking socinianism in reviewing a work professedly written against methodism surely such a work ought to treat of those points of doctrine and practice which are peculiar to methodism but to publish a diatribe against the substance of the articles and catechism of the english church nay of the whole christian world excepting the socinians and to call it hints concerning the dangerous and abominable absurdities of methodism is too bad   ib p 43    but this calvinistic evangelist tells us by way of accounting for the   utter impossibility of producing in himself either faith or   repentance that both are of divine origin and like the light and   the rain and the dew of heaven which tarrieth not for man neither   waiteth for the sons of men are from above and come down from the   father of lights from whom alone cometh every good and perfect gift  is the barristerare the socinian divinesinspired or infallibly sure that it is a crime for a christian to understand the words of christ in their plain and literal sense when a socinian chooses to give his paraphraseoften too as strongly remote from the words as the old spiritual paraphrases on the song of solomon   ib p 46    according to that gospel which hath hitherto been the pillar of the   christian world we are taught that whosoever endeavours to the best   of his ability to reform his manners and amend his life will have   pardon and acceptance  as interpreted by whom by the socini or the barristeror by origen chrysostom jerome the gregories eusebius athanasiusby thomas aquinas bernard thomasakempisby luther melancthon zuinglius calvinby the reformers and martyrs of the english churchby cartwright and the learned puritansby knoxby george foxwith regard to this point that mere external evidence is inadequate to the production of a saving faith and in the majority of other opinions all these agree with wesley so they all understood the gospel but it is not so ergo the barrister is infallible   ib p 47    when the wicked man turneth away from the wickedness which he hath   committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his   soul alive this gracious declaration the old moral divines of our   church have placed in the front of its liturgy  in the name of patience over and over again who has ever denied this the question is by what power his own or by the free grace of god through christ the wicked man is enabled to turn from his wickedness and again and again i askwere not these old moral divines the authors and compilers of the homilies if the barrister does not know this he is an ignorant man if knowing it he has yet never examined the homilies he is an unjust man but if he have he is a slanderer and a sycophant  is it not intolerable to take up three bulky pamphlets against a recent sect denounced as most dangerous and which we all know to be most powerful and of rapid increase and to find little more than a weak declamatory abuse of certain metaphysical dogmas concerning free will or free will forfeited de libero vel servo arbitrioof grace predestination and the likedogmas on which according to milton god and the logos conversed as soon as man was in existence they in heaven and adam in paradise and the devils in helldogmas common to all religions and to all ages and sects of the christian religionconcerning which brahmin disputes with brahmin mahometan with mahometan and priestley with priceand all this to be laid on the shoulders of the methodists collectively though it is a notorious fact that a radical difference on this abstruse subject is the ground of the schism between the whitfieldite and wesleyan methodists and that the latter coincide in opinion with erasmus and arminius by which latter name they distinguish themselves and the former with luther calvin and their great guide st augustine this i say is intolerableyea a crime against sense candour and white paper   ib p 50    for so very peculiarly directed to the sinner and to him only says   the evangelical preacher is the blessed gospel of the lord jesus   that unless you are a sinner you are not interested in its saving   truths  does not christ himself say the same in the plainest and most unmistakable words i come not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick can he who has no share in the danger be interested in the saving pleased from benevolence he may be but interested he cannot be estne aliquid inter salvum et salutem inter liberum et libertatem salus est pereuntis vel saltem periditantis redemptio quasi pons divinus inter servum et libertatemamissam ideoque optatam   ib p 52    it was reserved for these days of new discovery to announce to   mankind that unless they are sinners they are excluded from the   promised blessings of the gospel  merely read that unless they are sick they are precluded from the offered remedies of the gospel and is not this the dictate of common sense as well as of methodism but does not methodism cry aloud that all men are sicksick to the very heart if we say we are without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us this shallowpated barrister makes me downright piggish and without the stratagem of that famed philosopher in pignature almost drives me into the charons hoy of methodism by his rude and stupid tailhauling me back from it   ib p 53    i can assure these gentlemen that i regard with a reverence as pure   and awful as can enter into the human mind that blood which was shed   upon the cross  that is in the barristers creed that mysterious flint which with the subordinate aids of mutton barley salt turnips and potherbs makes most wonderful fine flint broth suppose christ had never shed his blood yet if he had worked his miracles raised lazarus and taught the same doctrines would not the result have been the sameor if christ had never appeared on earth yet did not daniel work miracles as stupendous which surely must give all the authority to his doctrines that miracles can give and did he not announce by the holy spirit the resurrection to judgment of glory or of punishment   ib p 54    let them not attempt to escape it by quoting a few disconnected   phrases in the epistles but let them adhere solely and steadfastly to   that gospel of which they affect to be the exclusive preachers  and whence has the barrister learnt that the epistles are not equally binding on christians as the four gospels surely of st pauls at least the authenticity is incomparably clearer than that of the first three gospels and if he give up as doubtless he does the plenary inspiration of the gospels the personal authority of the writers of all the epistles is greater than two at least of the four evangelists secondly the gospel of john and all the epistles were purposely written to teach the christian faith whereas the first three gospels are as evidently intended only as memorabilia of the history of the christian revelation as far as the process of redemption was carried on in the life death and resurrection of the divine founder this is the blank brazen blushless or only brassblushing impudence of an old bailey barrister attempting to browbeat out of court the better and more authentic half of the witnesses against him if i wished to understand the laws of england shall i consult hume or blackstonehim who has written his volumes expressly as comments on those laws or the historian who mentions them only as far as the laws were connected with the events and characters which he relates or describes nay it is far worse than this far christ himself repeatedly defers the publication of his doctrines till after his death and gives the reason too that till he had sent the holy ghost his disciples were not capable of comprehending them does he not attribute to an immediate influence of especial inspiration even peters acknowledgment of his filiation to god or messiahshipwas it from the gospels that paul learned to know christwas the church sixty years without the awful truths taught exclusively in johns gospel   part iii p 5    the nostrum of the mountebank will he preferred to the prescription   of the regular practitioner why is this because there is something   in the authoritative arrogance of the pretender by which ignorance is   overawed  this is something and true as far as it goes that is however but a very little way the great power of both spiritual and physical mountebanks rests on that irremovable property of human nature in force of which indefinite instincts and sufferings find no echo no restingplace in the definite and comprehensible ignorance unnecessarily enlarges the sphere of these but a sphere there isfacts of mind and cravings of the soul there arein which the wisest man seeks help from the indefinite because it is nearer and more like the infinite of which he is made the imagefor even we are infinite even in our finiteness infinite as the father in his infinity in many caterpillars there is a large empty space in the head the destined room for the pushing forth of the antennæ of its next state of being   ib p 12    but the antimoralists aver   that they are quoted unfairlythat   although they disavow it is true the necessity and deny the value   of practical morality and personal holiness and declare them to be   totally irrelevant to our future salvation yet that   i might have   found occasional recommendations of moral duty which i have neglected   to notice  the same crambe bis decies cocta of one selfsame charge grounded on one gross and stupid misconception and misstatement and to which there needs no other answer than this simple fact let the barrister name any one gross offence against the moral law for which he would shun a mans acquaintance and for that same vice the methodist would inevitably be excluded publicly from their society and i am inclined to think that a fair list of the barristers friends and acquaintances would prove that the calvinistic methodists are the austerer and more watchful censors of the two if this be the truth as it notoriously is what but the cataract of stupidity uncouched or the thickest film of bigotslime can prevent a man from seeing that this tenet of justification by faith alone is exclusively a matter between the calvinists own heart and his maker who alone knows the true source of his words and actions but that to his neighbours and fellowcreedsmen his spotless life and good works are demanded not indeed as the prime efficient causes of his salvation but as the necessary and only possible signs of that faith which is the means of that salvation of which christs free grace is the cause and the sanctifying spirit the perfecter but i fall into the same fault i am arraigning by so often exposing and confuting the same blunder which has no claim even at its first enunciation to the compliment of a philosophical answer but why in the name of common sense all this endless whoop and hubbub against the calvinistic methodists i had understood that the arminian methodists or wesleyans are the more numerous body by far has there been any union lately have the followers of wesley abjured the doctrines of their founder on this head   ib p 16    we are told by our new spiritual teachers that reason is not to be   applied to the inquiry into the truth or falsehood of their doctrines   they are spiritually discerned and carnal reason has no concern with   them  even under this aversion to reason as applied to religious grounds a very important truth lurks and the mistake a very dangerous one i admit lies in the confounding two very different faculties of the mind under one and the same namethe pure reason or vis scientifica and the discourse or prudential power the proper objects of which are the phænomena of sensuous experience the greatest loss which modern philosophy has through wilful scorn sustained is the grand distinction of the ancient philosophers between the greek noúmena and greek phainómena this gives the true sense of plinyvenerare deos that is their statues and the like et numina deorum that is those spiritual influences which are represented by the images and persons of apollo minerva and the rest   ib p 17    religion has for its object the moral care and the moral cultivation   of man its beauty is not to be sought in the regions of mystery or   in the flights of abstraction  what ignorance is there a single moral precept of the gospels not to be found in the old testament not one a new edition of whites diatessaron with a running comment the hebrew greek and roman writers before christ and those after him who it is morally certain drew no aids from the new testament is a grand desideratum and if anything could open the eyes of socinians this would do it   ib p 24    the masculine strength and moral firmness which once distinguished the   great mass of the british people is daily fading away methodism with   all its cant c  well but in gods name can methodism be at once the effect and the cause of this loss of masculine strength and moral firmnessdid whitfield and wesley blow them out at the first puffthese grand virtues of masculine strength and moral firmness admire i pray you the happy antithesis yet feminine would be an improvement as then the sense too would be antithetic however the sound is sufficient and modern rhetoric possesses the virtue of economy   ib p 27    so with the tinker i would give him the care of kettles but i would   not give him the cure of souls so long as he attended to the   management and mending of his pots and pans i would wish success to   his ministry but when he came to declare himself a chosen vessel   and demand permission to take the souls of the people into his holy   keeping i should think that

his editors that the conscience can never find relief for its disobedience to the law in the law itselfand this is as true of the moral as of the mosaic law i am not defending calvinism or bunyans theology but if victory not truth were my object i could desire no easier task than to defend it against our doughty barrister well but i repentthat is regret ityes and so you doubtless regret the loss of an eye or armwill that make it grow againthink you this nonsense as applied to morality be it so but yet nonsense most tremendously suited to human nature it is as the barrister may find in the arguments of the pagan philosophers against christianity who attributed a large portion of its success to its holding out an expiation which no other religion did read but that most affecting and instructive anecdote selected from the hindostan missionary account by the quarterly review 4 again let me say i am not giving my own opinion on this very difficult point but of one thing i am convinced that the i am sorry for it thats enoughmen mean nothing but regret when they talk of repentance and have consciences either so pure or so callous as not to know what a direful and strange thing remorse is and how absolutely a fact sui generis i have often remarked and it cannot be too often remarked vain as this may sound that this essential heterogeneity of regret and remorse is of itself a sufficient and the best proof of free will and reason the coexistence of which in man we call conscience and on this rests the whole superstructure of human religiongod immortality guilt judgment redemption whether another and different superstructure may be raised on the same foundation or whether the same edifice is susceptible of important alteration is another question but such is the edifice at present and this its foundation and the barrister might as rationally expect to blow up windsor castle by discharging a popgun in one of its cellars as hope to demolish calvinism by such arguments as his   ib p 35 36    and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master   what shall i do to inherit eternal life    he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou    and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy   heart with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all   thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself    and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou   shall live    luke x 2528  so would bunyan and so would calvin have preachedwould both of them in the name of christ have made this assurance to the barristerthis do and thou shalt live but what if he has not done it but the very contrary and what if the querist should be a staunch disciple of dr paley and hold himself morally obliged not to hate or injure his fellowman not because he is compelled by conscience to see the exceeding sinfulness of sin and to abhor sin as sin even as he eschews pain as painno not even because god has forbidden itbut ultimately because the great legislator is able and has threatened to put him to unspeakable torture if he disobeys and to give him all kind of pleasure if he does not 5 why verily in this case i do foresee that both the tinker and the divine would wax warm and rebuke the said querist for vile hypocrisy and a most nefarious abuse of gods good gift intelligible language what do you call this loving the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength and all your mindand your neighbour as yourself whereas in truth you love nothing not even your own soul but only set a superlative value on whatever will gratify your selfish lust of enjoyment and insure you from hellfire at a thousand times the true value of the dirty property if you have the impudence to persevere in misnaming this love supply any one instance in which you use the word in this sense if your son did not spit in your face because he believed that you would disinherit him if he did and this were his main moral obligation would you allow that your son loved youand with all his heart and mind and strength and soulshame shame  now the power of loving god of willing good as good not of desiring the agreeable and of preferring a larger though distant delight to an infinitely smaller immediate qualification which is mere selfish prudence bunyan considers supernatural and seeks its source in the free grace of the creator through christ the redeemerthis the kantean also avers to be supersensual indeed but not supernatural but in the original and essence of human nature and forming its grand and awful characteristic hence he calls it die menschheitthe principle of humanitybut yet no less than calvin or the tinker declares it a principle most mysterious the undoubted object of religious awe a perpetual witness of that god whose image greek eikôn it is a principle utterly incomprehensible by the discursive intellectand moreover teaches us that the surest plan for stifling and paralyzing this divine birth in the soul a phrase of platos as well as of the tinkers is by attempting to evoke it by or to substitute for it the hopes and fears the motives and calculations of prudence which is an excellent and in truth indispensable servant but considered as master and primate of the moral diocese precludes the possibility of virtue in bunyans phrase holiness of spirit by introducing legality which is no cant phrase of methodism but of authenticated standing in the ethics of the profoundest philosopherseven those who rejected christianity as a miraculous event and revelation itself as far as anything supernatural is implied in it i must not mention plato i supposehe was a mystic nor zenohe and his were visionariesbut aristotle the cold and dry aristotle has in a very remarkable passage in his lesser tract of ethics asserted the same thing and called it a divine principle lying deeper than those things which can be explained or enunciated discursively   ib p 45 46    sure i am that no father of a family that can at all estimate the   importance of keeping from the infant mind whatever might raise impure   ideas or excite

not a direct consequence from this system that we all purchase our existence at the price of our mothers purity of mind see what milton has written on this subject in the passage quoted in the friend

desires after the following example mercy being a young and   breeding woman longed for something c  out upon the fellow i could find it in my heart to suspect him of any vice that the worst of men could commit   ib pp 55 56    as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the   obedience of one shall many be made righteous the interpretation of   this text is simply thisas by following the fatal example of one   mans disobedience many were made sinners so by that pattern of   perfect obedience which christ has set before us shall many be made   righteous  what may not be explained thus and into what may not any thing be thus explained it comes out little better than nonsense in any other than the literal sense for let any man of sincere mind and without any system to support look round on all his christian neighbours and will he say or will they say that the origin of their welldoing was an attempt to imitate what they all believe to be inimitable christs perfection in virtue his absolute sinlessness nobut yet perhaps some particular virtues for instance his patriotism in weeping over jerusalem his active benevolence in curing the sick and preaching to the poor his divine forgiveness in praying for his enemiesi grant all this but then how is this peculiar to christ is it not the effect of all illustrious examples of those probably most which we last read of or which made the deepest impression on our feelings were there no good men before christ as there were no bad men before adam is it not a notorious fact that those who most frequently refer to christs conduct for their own actions are those who believe him the incarnate deityconsequently the best possible guide but in no strict sense an examplewhile those who regard him as a mere man the chief of the jewish prophets both in the pulpit and from the press ground their moral persuasions chiefly on arguments drawn from the propriety and seemlinessor the contraryof the action itself or from the will of god known by the light of reason to make st paul prophesy that all christians will owe their holiness to their exclusive and conscious imitation of christs actions is to make st paul a false prophetand what in such case becomes of the boasted influence of miracles even as false would it be to ascribe the vices of the chinese or even our own to the influence of adams bad example as well might we say of a poor scrofulous innocent see the effect of the bad example of his father on him i blame no man for disbelieving or for opposing with might and main the dogma of original sin but i confess that i neither respect the understanding nor have confidence in the sincerity of him who declares that he has carefully read the writings of st paul and finds in them no consequence attributed to the fall of adam but that of his bad example and none to the cross of christ but the good example of dying a martyr to a good cause i would undertake from the writings of the later english socinians to collect paraphrases on the new testament texts that could only be paralleled by the spiritual paraphrase on solomons song to be found in the recent volume of a dictionary of the

use of the white pill as a mode of exposing the frantic quack who vends it promiscuously he fixes on the empirics cures to prove his murdersnot to forget what ought to conclude every paragraph in answer to the barristers hints and were the case as alleged what does this prove against the present methodists as methodists is not the tenet of imputed righteousness the faith of all the scotch clergy who are not false to their declarations at their public assumption of the ministry till within the last sixty or seventy years was not the tenet preached sunday after sunday in every nook of scotland and has the barrister heard that the morals of the scotch peasants and artizans have been improved within the last thirty or forty years since the exceptions have become more and more commonwas it by want of strict morals that the puritans were distinguished to their disadvantage from the rest of englishmen during the reigns of elizabeth james i charles i and ii and that very period which the barrister affirms to have been distinguished by the moral vigor of the great mass of britonswas it not likewise the period when this very doctrine was preached by the clergy fifty times for once that it is heard from the same pulpits in the present and preceding generation never never can the methodists be successfully assailed if not honestly and never honestly or with any chance of success except as methodistsfor their practices their alarming theocracy their stupid mad and maddriving superstitions these are their property in peculio their doctrines are those of the

christian of any sort or sect and is he not ashamed if not afraid to ridicule such passages as these if they are not true the four gospels are false   ib p 86    it is impossible to give them credit for integrity when we behold the   obstinacy and the artifice with which they defend their system against   the strongest argument and against the clearest evidence  modest gentleman i wonder he finds time to write bulky pamphlets for surely modesty like his must secure success and clientage at the bar doubtless he means his own arguments the evidence he himself has adducedi say doubtless for what are these pamphlets but a long series of attacks on the doctrines of the strict lutherans and calvinists for the doctrines he attacks are common to both and if he knew stronger arguments clearer evidence he would certainly have given themand then what obstinate rogues must our bishops be to have suffered these hints to pass into a third edition and yet not have brought a bill into parliament for a new set of articles i have not heard that they have even the grace to intend it   ib p 88    on this subject i will quote the just and striking observations of an   excellent modern writer in whatever village says he the fanatics   get a footing drunkenness and swearingsins which being more   exposed to the eye of the world would be ruinous to their great   pretensions to superior sanctitywill perhaps be found to decline   but i am convinced from personal observation that every species of   fraud and falsehoodsins which are not so readily detected but which   seem more closely connected with worldly advantagewill be found   invariably to increase religion without cant by r fellowes am   of st marys hall oxford  in answer to this let me make a very just observation by some other man of my opinion to be hereafter quoted from an excellent modern writerand it is this that from the birth of christ to the present hour no sect or body of men were zealous in the reformation of manners in society without having been charged with the same vices in the same words when i hate a man and see nothing bad in him what remains possible but to accuse him of crimes which i cannot see and which cannot be disproved because they cannot be proved surely if christian charity did not preclude these charges the shame of convicted parrotry ought to prevent a man from repeating and republishing them the very same thoughts almost the words are to be found of the early christians of the poor quakers of the republicans of the first reformerswhy need i say this does not every one know that a jovial potcompanion can never believe a waterdrinker not to be a sneaking cheating knave who is afraid of his thoughts that every libertine swears that those who pretend to be chaste either have their mistress in secret or far worse and so on   ib p 89    the same religious abstinence from all appearance of recreation on the   lords day and the same neglect of the weightier matters of the moral   law in the course of the week c  this sentence thus smuggled in at the bottom of the chest ought not to pass unnoticed for the whole force of the former depends on it it is a true trick and deserves reprobation   ib p 97    note it was procured mr collyer informs us by the merit of his   lectures on scripture facts it should have been lectures on   scriptural facts what should we think of the grammarian who   instead of historical should present us with lectures on history   facts  but law tracts and is not scripture as often used semiadjectively   ib p 98    do you really believe says dr hawker that because man by his   apostacy hath lost his power and ability to obey god hath lost his   right to command put the case that you were called upon as a   barrister to recover a debt due from one man to another and you knew   the debtor had not the ability to pay the creditor would you tell   your client that his debtor was under no legal or moral obligation to   pay what he had no power to do and would you tell him that the very   expectation of his just right was as foolish as it was tyrannical      i will give my reply to these questions distinctly and without   hesitation    suppose a to have lent b a thousand pounds as a   capital to commence trade and that when he purchased his stock to   this amount and lodged it in his warehouse a fire were to break out   in the next dwelling and extending itself to his warehouse were   to consume the whole of his property and reduce him to a state of   utter ruin if a my client were to ask my opinion as to his right   to recover from b i should tell him that this his right would exist   should b ever be in a condition to repay the sum borrowed    but   that to attempt to recover a thousand pounds from a man thus reduced   by accident to utter ruin and who had not a shilling left in the   world would be as foolish as it was tyrannical    but this is rank sophistry the question isdoes a thief and a   fraudulent debtor is no better acquire a claim to impunity by not   possessing the power of restoring the goods every moral act derives   its character says a schoolman with an unusual combination of   profundity with quaintness aut voluntate originis aut origine   voluntatis now the very essence of guilt its dire and   incommunicable character consists in its tendency to destroy the free   willbut when thus destroyed are the habits of vice thenceforward   innocent does the law excuse the murder because the perpetrator was   drunk dr hawker put his objection laxly and weakly enough but a   manly opponent would have been ashamed to seize an hours victory from   what a move of the pen would render impregnable   ib p 102 3    when at this solemn tribunal the sinner shall be called upon to answer   for the transgression of those moral laws on obedience to which   salvation was made to depend will it be sufficient that he declares   himself to have been taught to believe that the gospel had neither   terms nor conditions and that his salvation was secured by a   covenant which procured him pardon and peace from all eternity a   covenant the effects of which no folly or afteract whatever could   possibly destroywho could anticipate the sentence of condemnation   and not weep in agony over the deluded victim of ignorance and   misfortune who was thus taught a doctrine so fatally false  what then god is represented as a tyrant when he claims the penalty of disobedience from the servant who has wilfully incapacitated himself for obeyingand yet just and merciful in condemning to indefinite misery a poor deluded victim of ignorance and imposture even though the barrister spite of his antipathy to methodists would weep in agony over him but before the barrister draws bills of imagination on his tender feelings would it not have been as well to adduce some last dying speech and confession in which the culprit attributed his crimesnot to sabbathbreaking and loose companybut to sermonhearing on the modus operandi of the divine goodness in the work of redemption how the ebenezerites would stare to find the socinians and themselves in one flock on the sheepside of the judgmentseatand their cousins and fellow methodists the tabernaclers all caprifledgoats every manand why they held that repentance is in the power of every man with the aid of grace while the goats held that without grace no man is able even to repent a makes grace the cause and b makes it only a necessary auxiliary and does the socinian extricate himself a whit more clearly without a due concurrence of circumstances no mind can improve itself into a state susceptible of spiritual happiness and is not the disposition and prearrangement of circumstances as dependent on the divine will as those spiritual influences which the methodist holds to be meant by the word grace will not the socinian find it as difficult to reconcile with mercy and justice the condemnation to hellfire of poor wretches born and bred in the thieves nests of st giles as the methodists the condemnation of those who have been less favoured by grace i have one other question to ask though it should have been asked before suppose christ taught nothing more than a future state of retribution and the necessity and sufficiency of good morals how are we to explain his forbidding these truths to be taught to any but jews till after his resurrection did the jews reject those doctrines except perhaps a handful of rich men called sadducees they all believed them and would have died a thousand deaths rather than have renounced their faith besides what is there in doctrines common to the creed of all religions and enforced by all the schools of philosophy except the epicurean which should have prevented their being taught to all at the same time i perceive that this difficulty does not press on socinians exclusively but yet it presses on them with far greater force than on others for they make christianity a mere philosophy the same in substance with the stoical only purer from errors and accompanied with clearer evidencewhile others think of it as part of a covenant made up with abraham the fulfilment of which was in good faith to be first offered to his posterity i ask this only because the barrister professes to find every thing in the four gospels so plain and easy   ib p 106    the reformers by whom those articles were framed were educated in the   church of rome and opposed themselves rather to the perversion of its   power than the errors of its doctrine  an outrageous blunder   ib p 107    lord bacon was the first who dedicated his profound and penetrating   genius to the cultivation of sound philosophy c  this very same lord bacon has given us his confessio fidei at great length with full particularity now i will answer for the methodists unhesitating assent and consent to it but would the barrister subscribe it   ib p 108    we look back to that era of our history when superstition threw her   victim on the pile and bigotry tied the martyr to his stakebut we   take our eyes from the retrospect and turn them in thankful admiration   to that being who has opened the minds of many and is daily opening   the minds of more amongst us to the reception of these most important   of all truths that there is no true faith but in practical goodness   and that the worst of errors is the error of the life    such is the conviction of the most enlightened of our clergy the   conviction i trust of the far greater part    they deem it   better to inculcate the moral duties of christianity in the pure   simplicity and clearness with which they are revealed than to go   aside in search of doctrinal mysteries for as mysteries cannot be   made manifest they of course cannot be understood and that which   cannot be understood cannot be believed and can consequently make   no part of any system of faith since no one till he understands a   doctrine can tell whether it be true or false till then therefore   he can have no faith in it for no one can rationally affirm that he   believes that doctrine to be true which he does not know to be so and   he cannot know it to be true if he does not understand it in the   religion of a true christian therefore there can be nothing   unintelligible and if the preachers of that religion do not make   mysteries they will never find any  who the bishops or the dignified clergy have they at length exploded all doctrinal mysteries was horsley the one red leaf the last of its clan that held the doctrines of the trinity the corruption of the human will and the redemption by the cross of christ verily this is the most impudent attempt to impose a naked socinianism on the public as the general religion of the nation admitted by all but a dunghill of mushroom fanatics that ever insulted common sense or common modesty and will the far greater part of the english clergy remain silent under so atrocious a libel as is contained in this page do they indeed solemnly pray to their maker weekly before god and man in the words of a liturgy which they know cannot be believed for heavens sake my dear southey do quote this page and compare it with the introduction to and petitions of the liturgy and with the collects on the advent c   ib p 110    we shall discover upon an attentive examination of the subject that   all those laws which lay the basis of our constitutional liberties   are no other than the rules of religion transcribed into the judicial   system and enforced by the sanction of civil authority  what compare these laws first with tacituss account of the constitutional laws of our german ancestors pagans and then with the pandects and novellæ of the most christian justinian aided by all his bishops observe the barrister is asserting a fact of the historical origination of our lawsand not what no man would deny that as far as they are humane and just they coincide with the precepts of the gospel no they were transcribed   ib p 113    where a man holds a certain system of doctrines the state is bound to   tolerate though it may not approve them but when he demands a   license to teach this system to the rest of the community he   demands that which ought not to be granted incautiously and without   grave consideration this discretionary power is delegated in trust   for the common good c  all this dear southey i leave to the lash of your indignation it would be oppression to dowhat the legislature could not do if it wouldprevent a mans thoughts but if he speaks them aloud and asks either for instruction and confutation if he be in error or assent and honor if he be in the right then it is no oppression to throw him into a dungeon but the barrister would only withhold a license nonsense what if he preaches and publishes without it will the legislature dungeon him or not if not what use is either the granting or the withholding and this too from a socinian who by this very book has i believe made himself obnoxious to imprisonment and the pilloryand against men whose opinions are authorized by the most solemn acts of parliament and recorded in a book of which there must be one by law in every parish and of which there is in fact one in almost every house and hovel   part iv p 1    the religion of genuine christianity is a revelation so distinct and   specific in its design and so clear and intelligible in its rules   that a man of philosophic and retired thought is apt to wonder by what   means the endless systems of error and hostility which divide the   world were ever introduced into it  what means this hollow cantthis fifty times warmedup bubble and squeak that such parts are intelligible as the barrister understands that such parts as it possesses in common with all systems of religion and morality are plain and obvious in other words that abc are so legible that they are legible to every one that has learnt to read if the barrister mean other or more than this if he really mean the whole religion and revelation of christ even as it is found in the original records the gospels and epistles he escapes from the silliness of a truism by throwing himself into the arms of a broad brazenfaced untruth what is the sixth chapter of st johns gospel so distinct and specific in its design that any modest man can wonder that the best and most learned men of every age since christ have deemed it mysterious are the many passages concerning the devil and demoniacs so very easy has this writer himself thrown the least light on or himself received one ray of light from the meaning of the word faithor the reason of christs paramount declarations respecting its omnific power its absolutely indispensable necessity if the word mean only what the barrister supposes a persuasion that in the present state of our knowledge the evidences for the historical truth of the miracles of the gospel outweigh the arguments of the sceptics will he condescend to give us such a comment on the assertion that had we but a grain of mustard seed of it we might control all material nature without making christ himself the most extravagant hyperbolist that ever misused language but it is impossible to make that man blush who can seriously call the words of christ as recorded by st john plain easy common sense out of which prejudice artifice and selfish interest alone can compose any difficulty the barrister has just as much right to call his religion christianity as to call flour and water plum puddingyet we all admit that in plum pudding both flour and water do exist   ib p 7    socinus can have no claim upon my veneration i have never concerned   myself with what he believed nor with what he taught c    the scripture is my authority and on no other authority will i ever   knowingly lay the foundation of my faith  utterly untrue it is not the scripture but such passages of scripture as appear to him to accord with his procrustean bed of so called reason and a forcing of the blankest contradictions into the same meaning by explanations to which i defy him to furnish one single analogy as allowed by mankind with regard to any other writings but the old and new testament it is a gross and impudent delusion to call a book his authority which he receives only so far as it is an echo of his own convictions i defy him to adduce one single article of his whole faith creed rather which he really derives from the scripture even the arguments for the resurrection are and must be extraneous for the very proofs of the facts are as every tyro in theology must know the proofs of the authenticity of the books in which they are contained this question i would press upon himsuppose we possessed the fathers only with the ecclesiastical and pagan historians and that not a page remained of the new testamentwhat article of his creed would it alter   ib p 10    if the creed of calvinistic methodism is really more productive of   conversions than the religion of christianity let them openly and at   once say so  but calvinistic methodism why calvinistic methodism not one in a hundred of the methodists are calvinists not to mention the impudence of this crow in his abuse of black feathers is it worse in a methodist to oppose socinianism to christianity that is to the doctrines of wesley or even whitfield which are the same as those of all the reformed churches of christendom and differ only wherein the most celebrated divines of the same churches have differed with each otherthan for the barrister to oppose methodism to christianity his christianitythat is to socinianism which in every peculiar doctrine of christianity differs from all divines of all churches of all ages for the one tenet in which the calvinist differs from the majority of christians are there not ten in which the socinian differs from all to what purpose then this windy declamation about john calvin how many methodists does the barrister think ever saw much less read a work of calvins if he scorns the name of socinus as his authority and appeals to scripture do not the methodists the same when do they refer to calvin in what work do they quote him this page is therefore mere dust in the eyes of the public and his abuse of calvin displays only his own vulgar ignorance both of the man and of his writings for he seems not to know that the humane melancthon and not only he but almost every church lutheran or reformed throughout europe sent letters to geneva extolling the execution of servetus and returning their thanks yet it was a murder not the less yes a damned murder but the guilt of it is not peculiar to calvin but common to all the theologians of that age and nota bene mr barrister the socini not excepted who were prepared to inflict the very same punishment on f davidi for denying the adorability of christ if to wish will resolve and attempt to realize be morally to commit an action then must socinus and calvin hunt in the same collar but o mercy if every human being were to be held up to detestation who in that age would have thought it his duty to have passed sentence de comburendo heretico on a man who had publicly styled the trinity a cerberus and a threeheaded monster of hell what would the history of the reformation be but a list of criminals with what face indeed can we congratulate ourselves on being born in a more enlightened age if we so bitterly abuse not the practice but the agents do we not admit by this very phrase enlightened that we owe our exemption to our intellectual advantages not primarily to our moral superiority it will be time enough to boast when to our own tolerance we have added their zeal learning and indefatigable industry 7   ib p 13 14    if religion consists in listening to long prayers and attending long   sermons in keeping up an outside appearance of devotion and   interlarding the most common discourse with phrases of gospel   usageif this is religion then are the disciples of methodism pious   beyond compare but in real humility of heart in mildness of temper   in liberality of mind in purity of thought in openness and   uprightness of conduct in private life in those practical virtues   which are the vital substance of christianityin these are they   superior no public observation is against the fact and the   conclusion to which such observation leads is rarely incorrect     the very name of the sect carries with it an impression of meanness   and hypocrisy scarce an individual that has had any dealings with   those belonging to it but has good cause to remember it from some   circumstance of low deception or of shuffling fraud its very members   trust each other with caution and reluctance the more wealthy among   them are drained and dried by the leeches that perpetually fasten upon   them the leaders ignorant and bigotedi speak of them collectively   present us with no counterqualities that can conciliate respect   they have all the craft of monks without their courtesy and all the   subtlety of jesuits without their learning  in the whole bibliotlieca theologica i remember no instance of calumny so gross so impudent so unchristian even as a single robber i mean he who robs one man gets hanged while the robber of a million is a great man so it seems to be with calumny this worthy barrister will be extolled for this audacious slander of thousands for which if applied to any one individual he would be in danger of the pillory this paragraph should be quoted for were the charge true it is nevertheless impossible that the barrister should know it to be true he positively asserts as a truth known to him what it is impossible he should knowhe is therefore doubly a slanderer for first the charge is a gross calumny and were it otherwise he would still be a slanderer for he could have no proof no ground for such a charge   ib p 15  amidst all this spirit of research we find nothingcomparatively nothingof improvement in that science of all others the most important in its influence    religion except from the emancipating energy of a few superior minds which have dared to snap asunder the cords which bound them to the rock of error    has been suffered to remain in its principles and in its doctrines just what it was when the craft of catholic superstition first corrupted its simplicity so so here it comes out at last it is not the methodists no it is all and each of all europe infidels and socinians excepted o impudence and then the exquisite selfconceit of the blunderer   ib p 29    if of different denominations how were they thus conciliated to a   society of this ominous nature from which they must themselves of   necessity be excluded by that indispensable condition of admittance   a union of religious sentiment in the great doctrines which   very want of union it is that creates these different denominations  no barrister they mean that men of different denominations may yet all believe in the corruption of the human will the redemption by christ the divinity of christ as consubstantial with the father the necessity of the holy spirit or grace meaning more than the disposition of circumstances and the necessity of faith in christ superadded to a belief of his actions and doctrinesand yet differ in many other points the points enumerated are called the great points because all christians agree in them excepting the arians and socinians who for that reason are not deemed christians by the rest the roman catholic the lutheran the calvinist the arminian the greek with all their subdivisions do yet all accord in these articlesthe booksellers might have said all who repeat the nicene creed n b i do not approve or defend nay i dislike these united theological booksellers but this utter barrister is their best friend by attacking them so as to secure to them victory and all the advantages of being known to have been wickedly slanderedthe best shield a faulty cause can protend against the javelin of fair opposition   ib p 56    our saviour never in any single instance reprobated the exercise of   reason on the contrary he reprehends severely those who did not   exercise it carnal reason is not a phrase to be found in his gospel   he appealed to the understanding in all he said and in all he taught   he never required faith in his disciples without first furnishing   sufficient evidence to justify it he reasoned thus if i have done   what no human power could do you must admit that my power is from   above c  good heavens did he not uniformly require faith as the condition of obtaining the evidence as this barrister calls itthat is the miracle what a shameless perversion of the fact he never did reason thus in one instance only and then upbraiding the base sensuality of the jews he said if ye are so base as not to believe what i say from the moral evidence in your own consciences yet pay some attention to it even for my works sake and this an argumentum ad hominem a bitter reproach just as if a great chemist should saythough you do not care for my science or the important truths it presents yet even as an amusement superior to that of your jugglers to whom you willingly crowd pay some attention to methis is to be set up against twenty plain texts and the whole spirit of the whole gospel besides christ could not reason so for he knew that the jews admitted both natural and demoniacal miracles and their faith in the latter he never attacked though by an argumentum ad hominem for it is no argument in itself he denied its applicability to his own works if christ had reasoned so why did not the barrister quote his words instead of putting imaginary words in his mouth   ib 60 61    religion is a system of revealed truth and to affirm of any   revealed truth that we cannot understand it is in effect either   to deny that it has been revealed orwhich is the same thingto   admit that it has been revealed in vain  it is too worthless i cannot go on merciful god hast thou not revealed to us the being of a conscience and of reason and of willand does this barrister tell us that he understands them let him know that he does not even understand the very word understanding he does not seem to be aware of the schoolboy distinction between the greek hóti esti and the greek dióti but to all these silly objections religion must for ever remain exposed as long as the word revelation is applied to any thing that can be bona fide given to the mind ab extra through the senses of eye ear or touch no all revelation is and must be ab intra the external phænomena can only awake recall evidence but never reveal this is capable of strict demonstration  afterwards the barrister quotes from thomas watson respecting things above comprehension in the study of nature in these cases the fact is evident the cause lies in obscurity deeply removed from all the knowledge and penetration of man then what can we believe respecting these causes and if we can believe nothing respecting them what becomes of them as arguments in support of the proposition that we ought in religion to believe what we cannot understand  are there not facts in religion the causes and constitution of which are mysteries    footnote 1

reward of obedience as a   dogma of belief that doctrine is not their boast but their burden   and difficulty inasmuch as they could never defend it they could   never justify it on independent grounds of deduction nor produce   their warrant and authority to teach it in such precarious and   unauthenticated principles it may pass for a conjecture or pious   fraud or a splendid phantom it cannot wear the dignity of truth  ah why did not mr davison adhere to the manly the glorious strain of thinking from p 134 since prophecy c to p 139 that mercy of this discourse a fact is no subject of scientific demonstration speculatively we can only bring analogies and these heraclitus socrates plato and others did bring but their main argument remains to this day the main argumentnamely that none but a wicked man dares doubt it when it is not in the light of promise it is in the law of fear at all times a part of the conscience and presupposed in all spiritual conviction   ib p 160    some indeed have sought the star and the sceptre of balaams   prophecy where they cannot well be found in the reign of david for   though a sceptre might be there the star properly is not  surely this is a very weak reason a far better is i think suggested by the words i shall see himi shall behold himwhich in no intelligible sense could be true of balaam relatively to david   ib p 162    the israelites could not endure the voice and fire of mount sinai   they asked an intermediate messenger between god and them who should   temper the awfulness of his voice and impart to them his will in a   milder way  deut xviii 15 is the following argument worthy our consideration if as the learned eichhorn paulus of jena and others of their school have asserted moses waited forty days for a tempest and then by the assistance of the natural magic he had learned in the temple of isis initiated the law all our experience and knowledge of the way in which large bodies of men are affected would lead us to suppose that the hebrew people would have been keenly excited interested and elevated by a spectacle so grand and so flattering to their national pride but if the voices and appearances were indeed divine and supernatural well must we assume that there was a distinctive though verbally inexpressible terror and disproportion to the mind the senses the whole organismus of the human beholders and hearers which might both account for and even in the sight of god justify the trembling prayer which deprecated a repetition   ib p 164    to justify its application to christ the resemblance between him and   moses has often been deduced at large and drawn into a variety of   particulars among which several points have been taken minute and   precarious or having so little of dignity or clearness of   representation in them that it would be wise to discard them from the   prophetic evidence  with our present knowledge we are both enabled and disposed thus to evolve the full contents of the word like but i cannot help thinking that the contemporaries of moses if not otherwise orally instructed must have understood it in the first and historical sense at least of joshua   ib p 168    a distinguished commentator on the laws of moses michaelis   vindicates their temporal sanctions on the ground of the mosaic code   being of the nature of a civil system to the statutes of which the   rewards of a future state would be incongruous and unsuitable  i never read either of michaeliss works but the same view came before me whenever i reflected on the mosaic code who expects in realities of any kind the sharp outline and exclusive character of scientific classification it is the predominance of the characterizing constituent that gives the name and class do not even our own statute laws though coexisting with a separate religious code contain many formulæ of words which have no sense but for the conscience davisons stress on the word covet in the tenth commandment is i think beyond what so ancient a code warrantsand for the other instances michaelis would remind him that the mosaic constitution was a strict theocracy and that jehovah the god of all was their king i do not know the particular mode in which michaelis propounds and supports this position but the position itself as i have presented it to my own mind seems to me among the strongest proofs of the divine origin of the law and an essential in the harmony of the total scheme of revelation   disc iv pt ii p 180    but the first law meets him on his own terms it stood upon a present   retribution the execution of its sentence is matter of history and   the argument resulting from it is to be answered before the question   is carried to another world  this is rendered a very powerful argument by the consideration that though so vast a mind as that of moses though perhaps even a lycurgus might have distinctly foreseen the ruin and captivity of the hebrew people as a necessary result of the loss of nationality and the abandonment of the law and religion which were their only point of union their centre of gravityyet no human intellect could have foreseen the perpetuity of such a people as a distinct race under all the aggravated curses of the law weighing on them or that the obstinacy of their adherence to their dividuating institutes in persecution dispersion and shame should be in direct proportion to the wantonness of their apostasy from the same in union and prosperity   disc v pt ii p 234    except under the dictate of a constraining inspiration it is not easy   to conceive how the master of such a work at the time when he had   brought it to perfection and beheld it in its lustre the labour of   so much opulent magnificence and curious art and designed to be   exceeding magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all   countries should be occupied with the prospect of its utter ruin and   dilapidation and that too under the opprobrium of gods vindictive   judgment upon it nor to imagine how that strain of sinister prophecy   that forebodes of malediction should be ascribed to him if he had no   such vision revealed  here i think mr davison should have crushed the objection of the infidel grounded on solomons subsequent idolatrous impieties the infidel argues that these are not conceivable of a man distinctly conscious of a prior and supernatural inspiration accompanied with supernatural manifestations of the divine presence   disc vi pt i p 283    in order to evade this conclusion nothing is left but to deny that   isaiah or any person of his age wrote the book ascribed to him  this too is my conclusion but if i do not delude myself from more evident though not perhaps more certain premisses the age of the cyrus prophecies is the great object of attack by eichhorn and his compilers and i dare not say that in a controversy with these men davisons arguments would appear sufficient but this was not the intended subject of these discourses   disc vi pt ii p 289    but how does he express that promise in the images of the   resurrection and an immortal state consequently there is implied in   the delineation of the lower subject the truth of the greater  this reminds me of a remark i have elsewhere made respecting the expediency of separating the arguments addressed to and valid for a believer from the proofs and vindications of scripture intended to form the belief or to convict the infidel   disc vi pt iv p 325    when cyrus became master of babylon the prophecies of isaiah were   shewn or communicated to him wherein were described his victory and   the use he was appointed to make of it in the restoration of the   hebrew people ezra i 1 2  this i had been taught to regard as one of josephuss legends but upon this passage who would not infer that it had ezra for its authoritywho yet does not expressly say that even the prophecy of the far later jeremiah was known or made known to cyrus who ezra tells us fulfilled it if ezra had meant the prediction of isaiah by the words he hath charged me c why should he not have referred to it together with or even instead of jeremiah is it not more probable that a living prophet had delivered the charge to cyrus see ezra vi 14again davison makes cyrus speak like a christian by omitting the affix of heaven to the lord god in the original cyrus speaks as a cyrus might be supposed to donamely of a most powerful but yet national deity of a god not of god i have seen in so many instances the injurious effect of weak or overstrained arguments in defence of religion that i am perhaps more jealous than i need be in the choice of evidences i can never think myself the worse christian for any opinion i may have formed respecting the price of this or that argument of this or that divine in support of the truth for every one that i reject i could supply two and these greek anékdota   ib p 336    meanwhile this long repose and obscurity of zerubbabels family and   of the whole house of david during so many generations prior to the   gospel was one of the preparations made whereby to manifest more   distinctly the proper glory of it in the birth of the messiah  in whichever way i take this whether addressed to a believer for the purpose of enlightening or to an inquirer for the purpose of establishing his faith in prophecy this argument appears to me equally perplexing and obscure it seems prima facie almost tantamount to a right of inferring the fulfilment of a prophecy in b which it does not mention from its entire failure and falsification in a which and which alone it does mention   ib p 370    behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and   dreadful day of the lord  almost every page of this volume makes me feel my own ignorance respecting the interpretation of the language of the hebrew prophets and the want of the one idea which would supply the key suppose an infidel to ask me how the jews were to ascertain that john the baptist was elijah the prophetam i to assert the preexistence of johns personal identity as elijah if not why elijah rather than any other prophet one answer is obvious enough that the contemporaries of john held elijah as the common representative of the prophets but did malachi do so   ib p 373  i cannot conceive a more beautiful synopsis of a work on the prophecies of the old testament than is given in this recapitulation would that its truth had been equally well substantiated that it can be that it will be i have the liveliest faithand that mr davison has contributed as much as we ought to expect and more than any contemporary divine i acknowledge and honor him accordingly but much very much remains to be done before these three pages merit the name of a recapitulation   disc vii p 375  if i needed proof of the immense importance of the doctrine of ideas and how little it is understood the following discourse would supply it  the whole discussion on prescience and freewill with exception of the page or two borrowed from skelton displays an unacquaintance with the deeper philosophy and a helplessness in the management of the particular question which i know not how to reconcile with the steadiness and clearness of insight evinced in the earlier discourses i neither do nor ever could see any other difficulty on the subject than what is contained and anticipated in the idea of eternity  by ideas i mean intuitions not sensuous which can be expressed only by contradictory conceptions or to speak more accurately are in themselves necessarily both inexpressible and inconceivable but are suggested by two contradictory positions this is the essential character of all ideas consequently of eternity in which the attributes of omniscience and omnipotence are included now prescience and freewill are in fact nothing more than the two contradictory positions by which the human understanding struggles to express successively the idea of eternity not eternity in the negative sense as the mere absence of succession much less eternity in the senseless sense of an infinite time but eternitythe eternal as deity as god our theologians forget that the objection applies equally to the possibility of the divine will but if they reply that prescience applied to an eternal entis absoluti tota et simultanea fruitio is but an anthropomorphism or term of accommodation the same answer serves in respect of the human will for the epithet human does not enter into the syllogism as to contingency whence did mr davison learn that it is a necessary accompaniment of freedom or of free action my philosophy teaches me the very contrary   ib p 392    he contends without reserve that the free actions of men are not   within the divine prescience resting his doctrine partly on the   assumption that there are no strict and absolute predictions in   scripture of those actions in which men are represented as free and   responsible and partly on the abstract reason that such actions are   in their nature impossible to be certainly foreknown  i utterly deny contingency except in relation to the limited and imperfect knowledge of man but the misery is that men write about freewill without a single meditation on will absolutely on the idea greek katt exochàen without any idea and so bewilder themselves in the jungle of alien conceptions and to understand the truth they overlay their reason   disc viii p 416  it would not be easy to calculate the good which a man like mr davison might effect under god by a work on the messianic prophecies specially intended for and addressed to the present race of jewsif only he would make himself acquainted with their objections and ways of understanding scripture for instance a learned jew would perhaps contend that this prophecy of isaiah c ii 24 cannot fairly be interpreted of a mere local origination of a religion historically as the drama might be described as going forth from athens and philosophy from academus and the painted porch but must refer to an established and continuing seat of worship a house of the god of jacob the answer to this is provided in the preceding verse in the top of the mountains which irrefragably proves the figurative character of the whole prediction   ib p 431    one point however is certain and equally important namely that the   christian church when it comes to recognize more truly the obligation   imposed upon it by the original command of its founder go teach all   nations c  that the duty here recommended is deducible from this text is quite clear to my mind but whether it is the direct sense and primary intention of the words whether the first meaning is not negativehave no respect to what nation a man is of but teach it to all indifferently whom you have an opportunity of addressingthis is not so clear the larger sense is not without its difficulties nor is this narrower sense without its practical advantages   disc ix p 453 4  the striking inferiority of several of these latter discourses in point of style as compared with the first 150 pages of this volume perplexes me it seems more than mere carelessness or the occasional infausta tempora scribendi can account for i question whether from any modern work of a tenth part of the merit of these discourses either in matter or in force and felicity of diction and composition as many uncouth and awkward sentences could be extracted the paragraph in page 453 and 454 is not a specimen of the worst in a volume which ought to be and which probably will be in every young clergymans library these maculæ are subjects of just regret the utility of the work no less than its great comparative excellence render its revision a duty on the part of the author specks are no trifles in diamonds   disc xii p 519    four such ruling kingdoms did arise the first the babylonian was in   being when the prophecy is represented to have been given it was   followed by the persian the persian gave way to the grecian the   roman closed the series  this is stoutly denied by eichhorn who contends that the mede or medopersian is the secondif i recollect aright but it always struck me that eichhorn like other learned infidels is caught in his own snares for if the prophecies are of the age of the first empire and actually delivered by daniel there is no reason why the roman empire should not have been predictedfor superhuman predictions the last two at least must have been but if the book was a forgery or a political poem like grays bard or lycophrons cassandra and later than antiochus epiphanes it is strange and most improbable that the roman should have escaped notice in both cases the omission of the last and most important empire is inexplicable   ib p 521    yet we have it on authority of josephus that daniels prophecies were   read publicly among the jews in their worship as well as their other   received scriptures  it is but fair however to remember that the jewish church ranked the book of daniel in the third class only among the hagiographic passionately almost as the jews before and at the time of our saviour were attached to it   ib p 5223    but to a jewish eye or to any eye placed in the same position of view   in the age of antiochus epiphanes it is utterly impossible to admit   that this superior strength of the roman power to reduce and destroy   this heavier arm of subjugation could have revealed itself so   plainly as to warrant the express deliberate description of it  quære see polybius   ib    we shall yet have to inquire how it could be foreseen that this   fourth this yet unestablished empire should be the last in the line  this is a sound and weighty argument which the preceding does not i confess strike me as being on the contrary the admission that by a writer of the maccabaic æra the roman power could scarcely have been overlooked greatly strengthens this second argument as naturally suggesting expectations of change and wavelike succession of empires rather than the idea of a last in the age of augustus this might possibly have occurred to a profound thinker but the age of antiochus was too late to permit the roman power to escape notice and not late enough to suggest its exclusive establishment so as to leave no source of succession    footnote 1 discourses on prophecy

and the church being the synthesis and here is another proof of a principle elsewhere by me asserted and exemplified that divine truths are ever a tetractys or a triad equal to a tetractys 41 or 341 but the entire scheme is a pentadgods hand in the world 2  it may be not amiss that i should leave a record in my own hand how far in what sense and under what conditions i agree with my friend edward irving respecting the second coming of the son of man  i how far first instead of the full and entire conviction the positive assurance which mr irving entertains ieven in those points in which my judgment most coincides with hisprofess only to regard them as probable and to vindicate them as nowise inconsistent with orthodoxy they may be believed and they may be doubted salva catholica fide further from these points i exclude all prognostications of time and event the mode the persons the places of the accomplishment and i decisively protest against all parts of mr irvings and of lacunzas scheme grounded on the books of daniel or the apocalypse interpreted as either of the two irving or lacunza understands them again i protest against all identification of the coming with the apocalyptic millennium which in my belief began under constantine  ii in what sense in this and no other that the objects of the christian redemption will be perfected on this earththat the kingdom of god and his word the latter as the son of man in which the divine will shall be done on earth as it is in heaven will comeand that the whole march of nature and history from the first impregnation of chaos by the spirit converges toward this kingdom as the final cause of the world life begins in detachment from nature and ends in union with god  iii under what conditions that i retain my former convictions respecting st michael and the exsaint lucifer and the genie prince of persia and the reinstitution of bestial sacrifices in the temple at jerusalem and the rest of this class all these appear to me so many pimples on the face of my friends faith from inward heats leaving it indeed a fine handsome intelligent face but certainly not adding to its comeliness  such are the convictions of s t coleridge may 1827  ps i fully agree with mr irving as to the literal fulfilment of all the prophecies which respect the restoration of the jews deuteron xxv 18  it may be long before edward irving sees what i seem at least to see so clearlyand yet i doubt not the time will come when he too will see with the same evidentnesshow much grander a front his system would have presented to judicious beholders on how much more defensible a position he would have placed itand the remark applies equally to ben ezra that is emanuel lacunzahad he trusted the proof to scriptures of undisputed catholicity to the spirit of the whole bible to the consonance of the doctrine with the reason its fitness to the needs and capacities of mankind and its harmony with the general plan of the divine dealings with the worldand had left the apocalypse in the back ground but alas instead of this he has given it such prominence such prosiliency of relief that he has made the main strength of his hope appear to rest on a vision so obscure that his own author and faithsmate claims a meaning for its contents only on the supposition that the meaning is yet to come   preliminary discourse p lxxx    now of these three the office of christ as our prophet is the means   used by the holy spirit for working the redemption of the   understanding of men that faculty by which we acquire the knowledge   on which proceed both our inward principles of conduct and our outward   acts of power  i cannot forbear expressing my regret that mr irving has not adhered to the clear and distinct exposition of the understanding genere et gradu given in the aids to reflection 3  what can be plainer than to say the understanding is the medial faculty or faculty of means as reason on the other hand is the source of ideas or ultimate ends by reason we determine the ultimate end by the understanding we are enabled to select and adapt the appropriate means for the attainment of or approximation to this end according to circumstances but an ultimate end must of necessity be an idea that is that which is not representable by the sense and has no entire correspondent in nature or the world of the senses for in nature there can be neither a first nor a lastall that we can see smell taste touch are means and only in a qualified sense and by the defect of our language entitled ends they are only relatively ends in a chain of motives b is the end to a but it is itself a mean to c and in like manner c is a mean to d and so on thus words are the means by which we reduce appearances or things presented through the senses to their several kinds or genera that is we generalize and thus think and judge hence the understanding considered specially as an intellective power is the source and faculty of wordsand on this account the understanding is justly defined both by archbishop leighton and by immanuel kant the faculty that judges by or according to sense however practical or intellectual it is one and the same understanding and the definition the medial faculty expresses its true character in both directions alike i am urgent on this point because on the right conception of the same namely that understanding and sense to which the sensibility supplies the material of outness materiam objectivam constitute the natural mind of man depends the comprehension of st pauls whole theological system and this natural mind which is named the mind of the flesh greek phrónaema sarkòs as likewise greek psychikàe synesis the intellectual power of the living or animal soul st paul everywhere contradistinguishes from the spirit that is the power resulting from the union and coinherence of the will and the reasonand this spirit both the christian and elder jewish church named sophia or wisdom   benezra part i c v p 67    eusebius and st epiphanius name cerinthusas the inventor of many   corruptions that heresiarch being given up to the belly and the   palate placed therein the happiness of man and so taught his   disciples that after the resurrection    and what appeared most   important each would be master of an entire seraglio like a sultan   c  i find very great difficulty in crediting these black charges on cerinthus and know not how to reconcile them with the fact that the apocalypse itself was by many attributed to cerinthus but mr hunt is not more famous for blacking than some of the fathers   ib pp 73 4    against whom a very eloquent man dionysius alexandrinus a father of   the church wrote an elegant work to ridicule the millennarian fable   the golden and gemmed jerusalem on the earth the renewal of the   temple the blood of victims if the book of st dionysius had   contained nothing but the derision and confutation of all we have just   read it is certain that he doth in no way concern himself with the   harmless millennarians but with the jews and judaizers it is to be   clearly seen that dionysius had nothing in his eye but the ridiculous   excesses of nepos and his peculiar tenets upon circumcision c  lacunza i suspect was ignorant of greek and seems not to have known that the object of dionysius was to demonstrate that the apocalypse was neither authentic nor a canonical book   ib p 85    the ruin of antichrist with all that is comprehended under that name   being entirely consummated and the king of kings remaining master of   the field st john immediately continues in the 20th chapter which   thus commenceth and i saw an angel come down from heaven c and i   saw thrones c and when a thousand years are expired satan shall be   loosed out of his prison  it is only necessary to know that the whole book from the first verse to the last is written in symbols to be satisfied that the true meaning of this passage is simply that only the great confessors and martyrs will be had in remembrance and honour in the church after the establishment of christianity throughout the roman empire and observe it is the souls that the seer beholdsthere is not a word of the resurrection of the bodyfor this would indeed have been the appropriate symbol of a resurrection in a real and personal sense   ib c vi p 108    now this very thing st john likewise declareth   to wit that they   who have been beheaded for the testimony of jesus and for the word of   god and they who have not worshipped the beast these shall live   or be raised at the coming of the lord which is the first   resurrection  aye but by what authority is this synonimizing or asserted the seer not only does not speak of any resurrection but by the word greek psychás souls expressly asserts the contrary in no sense of the word can souls which descended in christs train chorus sacer animarum et christi comitatus from heaven be said resurgere resurrection is always and exclusively resurrection in the bodynot indeed a rising of the corpus greek phantastikón that is the few ounces of carbon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen and phosphate of lime the copula of which that gave the form no longer existsand of which paul exclaimsthou fool not this cbut the corpus greek hypostatikòn àe noúmenon  but there is yet another and worse wresting of the text who that reads lacunza p 108 last line but twelve would not understand that the apocalypt had asserted this enthronement of the souls of the gentile and judæochristian martyrs which he beheld in the train or suite of the descending messiah and that he had first seen them in the descent and afterward saw thrones assigned to them whereas the sentence precedes and has positively no connection with these souls the literal interpretation of the symbols c xx v 4 is i then beheld the christian religion the established religion of the state throughout the roman empireemperors kings magistrates and the like all christians and administering laws in the name of christ that is receiving the scriptures as the supreme and paramount law then in all the temples the name of jesus was invoked as the king of glory and together with him the old afflicted and tormented fellowlaborers with christ were revived in high and reverential commemoration c but that the whole vision from first to last in every sentence yea every word is symbolical and in the boldest largest style of symbolic language and secondly that it is a work of disputed canonicity and at no known period of the church could truly lay claim to catholicitybut for this i think this verse would be worth a cartload of the texts which the romanist divines and catechists ordinarily cite as sanctioning the invocation of saints   ib p 110    you will say nevertheless that even the wicked will be raised   incorruptible to inherit incorruption because being once raised   their bodies will no more change or be dissolved but must continue   entire for ever united with their sad and miserable souls well and   would you call this corruption or incorruptibility certainly this is   not the sense of the apostle when he formally assures us yea even   threatens us that corruption cannot inherit incorruption neither   doth corruption inherit incorruption what then may this singular   expression mean this is what it manifestly meansthat no person   whoever he may be without any exception who possesseth a corrupt   heart and corrupt actions and therein persevereth unto death shall   have reason to expect in the resurrection a pure subtile active and   impassible body  this is actually dangerous tampering with the written letter  without touching on the question whether st paul in this celebrated chapter 1 cor xv speaks of a partial or of the general resurrection or even conceding to lacunza that the former opinion is the more probable i must still vehemently object to this jesuitical interpretation of corruption as used in a moral sense and distinctive of the wicked souls st paul nowhere speaks dogmatically or preceptively not popularly and incidentally of a soul as the proper i it is always we or the man how could a regenerate saint put off corruption at the sound of the trump if up to that hour it did not in some sense or other appertain to him but what need of many words it flashes on every reader whose imagination supplies an unpreoccupied unrefracting medium to the apostolic assertion that corruption in this passage is a descriptive synonyme of the material sensuous organism common to saint and sinnerstanding in precisely the same relation to the man that the testaceous offensive and defensive armour does to the crab and tortoise these slightly combined and easily decomponible stuffs are as incapable of subsisting under the altered conditions of the earth as an hydatid in the blaze of a tropical sun they would be no longer media of communion between the man and his circumstances  a heavy difficulty presses as it appears to me on lacunzas system as soon as we come to consider the general resurrection our lord in books of indubitable and never doubted catholicity speaks of some who rise to bliss and glory others who at the same time rise to shame and condemnation now if the former class live not during the whole interval from their death to the general resurrection including the millennium or dies messiæhow should they whose imperfect or insufficient merits excluded them from the kingdom of the messiah on earth be all at once fitted for the kingdom of heaven   ib ch vii p 118    it appears to me that this sentence being looked to attentively   means in good language this only that the word quick which the   apostles full of the holy spirit set down is a word altogether   useless which might without loss have been omitted and that it were   enough to have set down the word dead for by that word alone is the   whole expressed and with much more clearness and brevity  the narrow outline within which the jesuits confined the theological reading of their alumni is strongly marked in this in so many respects excellent work for example the most believing mind with which lacunza takes for granted the exploded fable of the catechumens vulgo apostles creed having been the quotient of an apostolic picnic to which each of the twelve contributed his several symbolum   ib ch ix p 127    the apostle st peter speaking of the day of the lord says that   that day will come suddenly c 2 pet iii 10  there are serious difficulties besetting the authenticity of the catholic epistles under the name of peter though there exist no grounds for doubting that they are of the apostolic age a large portion too of the difficulties would be removed by the easy and nowise improbable supposition that peter no great scholar or grammarian had dictated the substance the matter and left the diction and style to his amanuensis who had been an auditor of st paul the tradition which connects not only mark but luke the evangelist the friend and biographer of paul with peter as a secretary is in favour of this hypothesis but what is of much greater importance especially for the point in discussion is the character of these and other similar descriptions of the dies messiæ the dies ultima and the like are we bound to receive them as articles of faith is there sufficient reason to assert them to have been direct revelations immediately vouchsafed to the sacred writers i cannot satisfy my judgment that there isfirst because i find no account of any such events having been revealed to the patriarchs or to moses or to the prophets and because i do find these events asserted and for aught i have been able to discover for the first time in the jewish church by uninspired rabbis in nearly or altogether the same words as those of the apostles and know that before and in the apostolic age these anticipations had become popular and generally received notions and lastly because they were borrowed by the jews from the greek philosophy and like several other notions taken from less respectable quarters adapted to their ancient and national religious belief now i know of no revealed truth that did not originate in revelation and find it hard to reconcile my mind to the belief that any christian truth any essential article of faith should have been first made known by the father of lies or the guesswork of the human understanding blinded by paganism or at best without the knowledge of the true god of course i would not apply this to any assertion of any new testament writer which was the final aim and primary intention of the whole passage but only to sentences in ordine ad some other doctrine or precept illustrandi causa or ad hominem or more suasorio sive ad ornaturam et rhetorice   ib part ii p 145    second characteristic the kingdom shall be dividedthird   characteristic the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly   brittlefourth characteristic they shall mingle themselves with   the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another  how exactly do these characters apply to the greek empire under the successors of alexanderwhen the greeks were dispersed over the civilized world as artists rhetoricians grammatici secretaries private tutors parasites physicians and the like   ib p 153    for to them he thus speaketh in the gospel and then shall they see   the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when   these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your   heads for your redemption draweth nigh  i cannot deny that there is great force and an imposing verisimilitude in this and the preceding chapter and much that demands silent thought and respectful attention but still the great question presses on mecoming in a cloud what is the true import of this phrase has not god himself expounded it to the son of man the great apostle assures us all power is given in heaven and on earth he became providencethat is a divine power behind the cloudy veil of human agency and worldly events and incidents controlling disposing and directing acts and events to the gradual unfolding and final consummation of the great scheme of redemption the casting forth of the evil and alien nature from man and thus effecting the union of the creature with the creator of man with god in and through the son of man even the son of god made manifest now can it be doubted by the attentive and unprejudiced reader of st matthew c xxiv that the son of man in fact came in the utter destruction and devastation of the jewish temple and state during the period from vespasian to hadrian both included and is it a sufficient reason for our rejecting the teaching of christ himself of christ glorified and in his kingly character that his apostles who disclaim all certain knowledge of the awful event had understood his words otherwise and in a sense more commensurate with their previous notions and the prejudices of their education they communicated their conjectures but as conjectures and these too guarded by the avowal that they had no revelation no revealed commentary on their masters words upon this occasion the great apocalypse of jesus christ while yet in the flesh for by this title was this great prophecy known among the christians of the apostolic age   ib p 253    never oh our lady never oh our mother shalt thou fall again into   the crime of idolatry  was ever blindness like unto this blindness i can imagine but one way of making it seem possible namely that this round square or rectilineal curvethis honest jesuit i meanhad confined his conception of idolatry to the worship of false godswhereas his saints are genuine godlings and his magna mater a goddess in her own rightand that thus he overlooked the meaning of the word   ib p 254    the entire text of the apostle is as followsnow we beseech you   brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering   together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind c 2 thess   ii 110  o edward irving edward irving by what fascination could your spirit be drawn away from passages like this to guess and dream over the rhapsodies of the apocalypse for rhapsody according to your interpretation the poem undeniably isthough rightly expounded it is a well knit and highly poetical evolution of a part of this and our lords more comprehensive prediction luke xvii   ib p 297    on the ordinary ideas of the coming of christ in glory and majesty it   will doubtless appear an extravagance to name the jews or to take   them into consideration for according to those ideas they should   hardly have the least particle of our attention  in comparing this with the preceding chapter i could not help exclaiming what an excellent book would this jesuit have written if daniel and the apocalypse had not existed or had been unknown to or rejected by him  you may divide lacunzas points of belief into two parallel columnsthe first would be found to contain much that is demanded by much that is consonant to and nothing that is not compatible with reason the harmony of holy writ and the idea of christian faith the second would consist of puerilities and anilities some impossible most incredible and all so silly so sensual as to befit a dreaming talmudist not a scriptural christian and this latter column would be found grounded on daniel and the apocalypse    footnote 1 the coming of messiah in glory and majesty by juan josafat benezra a converted jew

into collision and confusion and   the result will be a new creation nature to use the nervous   language of anold writer will be melted down and recoined and all   will be bright and beautiful  alas

noble to tell me to what name or genus he refers the dross will he tell me to the devil whence came the devil and how was the pure bullion so thoughtlessly made as to have an elective affinity for this devil   sect v p 286    the next anecdote that i shall adduce is similar in its nature to the   last    the relater is dr stilling counsellor at the court of   the duke of baden in a work entitled die theorie der geisterkunde   printed in 1808  mr noble is a man of too much english good sense to have relied on sungs alias dr stillings testimony had he ever read the work in which this passage is found i happen to possess the work and a more anile credulous solemn fop never existed since the days of old audley it is strange that mr noble should not have heard that these three anecdotes were first related by immanuel kant and still exist in his miscellaneous writings   ib p 315    can he be a sane man who records the subsequent reverie as matter of   fact the baron informs us that on a certain night a man appeared to   him in the midst of a strong shining light and said i am god the   lord the creator and redeemer i have chosen thee to explain to men   the interior and spiritual sense of the sacred writings i will   dictate to thee what thou oughtest to write from this period the   baron relates he was so illumined as to behold in the clearest   manner what passed in the spiritual world and that he could converse   with angels and spirits as with men c  i remember no such passage as this in swedenborgs works indeed it is virtually contradicted by their whole tenor swedenborg asserts himself to relate visa et auditahis own experience as a traveller and visitor of the spiritual worldnot the words of another as a mere amanuensis but altogether this gulielmus must be a silly billy   ib p 321    the apostolic canon in such cases is believe not every spirit but   try the spirits whether they be of god 1 john iv 1 and the   touchstone to which they are to be brought is pointed out by the   prophet to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according   to this word it is because there is no truth in them is viii   20 but instead of this canon you offer another    it is simply   this whoever professes to be the bearer of divine communications is   insane to bring swedenborg within the operation of this rule you   quote as if from his own works a passage which is nowhere to be   found in them but which you seem to have taken from some biographical   dictionary or cyclopædia few or none of which give anything like a   fair account of the matter  aye my memory did not fail me i find as to insanity in the sense intended by gulielmus namely as maniai should as little think of charging swedenborg with it as of calling a friend mad who laboured under an acyanoblepsia   ib p 323    did you never read of one who says in words very like your version of   the barons reverie it came to pass that as i took my journey and   was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from   heaven a great light round about me and i fell on the ground and   heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me  in the short space of four years the newspapers contained three several cases two of which i cut out and still have among my ocean of papers and which as stated were as nearly parallel in external accompaniments to st pauls as cases can well bestruck with lightningheard the thunder as an articulate voiceblind for a few days and suddenly recovered their sight but then there was no ananias no confirming revelation to another this it was that justified st paul as a wise man in regarding the incident as supernatural or as more than a providential omen n b not every revelation requires a sensible miracle as the credential but every revelation of a new series of credenda the prophets appealed to records of acknowledged authority and to their obvious sense literally interpreted the baptist needed no miracle to attest his right of calling sinners to repentance see exodus iv 10   ib pp 346 7    this sentiment that miracles are not the proper evidences of   doctrinal truth is assuredly the decision of the truth itself as   is obvious from many passages in scripture we have seen that the   design of the miracles of moses as external performances was not to   instruct the israelites in spiritual subjects but to make them   obedient subjects of a peculiar species of political state and though   the miracles of jesus christ collaterally served as testimonies to his   character he repeatedly intimates that this was not their main   design    at another time more plainly still he says that it is   a wicked and adulterous generation that seeketh after a sign on   which occasion according to mark he sighed deeply in his spirit   how characteristic is that touch of the apostle the jews require a   sign and the greeks seek after wisdom where by wisdom he means the   elegance and refinement of grecian literature  agreeing as in the main i do with the sentiments here expressed by this eloquent writer i must notice that he has however mistaken the sense of the greek saemeion which the jews would have tempted our saviour to shewnamely the signal for revolt by openly declaring himself their king and leading them against the romans the foreknowledge that this superstition would shortly hurry them into utter ruin caused the deep sighas on another occasion the bitter tears again by the greek sophía of the greeks their disputatious greek sophistikàe is meant the sophists pretended to teach wisdom as an art and sophistæ may be literally rendered wisdommongers as we say ironmongers   ib p 350    some probably will say what argument can induce us to believe a man   in a concern of this nature who gives no visible credentials to his   authority    but let us ask in return is it worthy of a being   wearing the figure of a man to require such proofs as these to   determine his judgment    the beasts act from the impulse of   their bodily senses but are utterly incapable of seeing from reason   why they should so act and it might easily be shewn that while a man   thinks and acts under the influence of a miracle he is as much   incapable of perceiving from any rational ground why he should thus   think and act as a beast is what our opponents will perhaps   reply    was it not by miracles that the prophets some of them   testified their authority do you not believe these facts yes my   friends i do most entirely believe them c  there is so much of truth in all this reasoning on miracles that i feel pain in the thought that the result is falsebecause it was not the whole truth but this is the grounding and at the same time pervading error of the swedenborgiansthat they overlook the distinction between congruity with reason truth of consistency or internal possibility of this or that being objectively real and the objective reality as fact miracles quoad miracles can never supply the place of subjective evidence that is of insight but neither can subjective insight supply the place of objective sight the certainty of the truth of a mathematical arch can never prove the fact of its existence i anticipate the answers but know that they likewise proceed from the want of distinguishing between ideas such as god eternity the responsible will the good and the likethe actuality of which is absolutely subjective and includes both the relatively subjective and the relatively objective as higher or transcendant realities which alone are the proper objects of faith the great postulates of reason in order to its own admission of its own beingthe not distinguishing i say between these and those positions which must be either matters of fact or fictions for such latter positions it is that miracles are required in lieu of experience as testimony of experience supplies the want of the same experience for b c d c for example how many thousands believe the existence of red snow on the testimony of captain parry but who can expect more than hints in a marginal note   sect vi pp 378 9 380 1    in the general views then which are presented in the writings of   swedenborg on the subject of heaven and hell as the abodes   respectively of happiness and of misery while there certainly is not   anything which is not in the highest degree agreeable both to reason   and scripture there also seems nothing which could be deemed   inconsistent with the usual conceptions of the christian world  what tends to render thinking readers a little sceptical is the want of a distinct boundary between the deductions from reason and the articles the truth of which is to rest on the barons personal testimony his visa et audita nor is the baron himself as it appears to me quite consistent on this point   ib p 434    witness again the poet milton who introduces active sports among   the recreations which he deemed worthy of angels and strange indeed   for a puritan included even dancing among the number  how could a man of nobles sense and sensibility bring himself thus to profane the awful name of milton by associating it with the epithet puritan  i have often thought of writing a work to be entitled vindiciæ heterodoxæ sive celebrium virorum greek paradogmatizóntôn defensio that is vindication of great men unjustly branded and at such times the names prominent to my minds eye have been giordano bruno jacob behmen benedict spinoza and emanuel swedenborg grant that the origin of the swedenborgian theology is a problem yet on which ever of the three possible hypothesespossible i mean for gentlemen scholars and christiansit may be solvednamely  1 swedenborgs own assertion and constant belief in the hypothesis of a supernatural illumination or  2 that the great and excellent man was led into this belief by becoming the subject of a very rare but not it is said altogether unique conjunction of the somniative faculty by which the products of the understanding that is to say words conceptions and the like are rendered instantaneously into forms of sense with the voluntary and other powers of the waking state or  3 the modest suggestion that the first and second may not be so incompatible as they appearstill it ought never to be forgotten that the merit and value of swedenborgs system do only in a very secondary degree depend on any one of the three for even though the first were adopted the conviction and conversion of such a believer must according to a fundamental principle of the new church have been wrought by an insight into the intrinsic truth and goodness of the doctrines severally and collectively and their entire consonance with the light of the written and of the eternal word that is with the scriptures and with the sciential and the practical reason or say that the second hypothesis were preferred and that by some hitherto unexplained affections of swedenborgs brain and nervous system he from the year 1743 thought and reasoned through the medium and instrumentality of a series of appropriate and symbolic visual and auditual images spontaneously rising before him and these so clear and so distinct as at length to overpower perhaps his first suspicions of their subjective nature and to become objective for him that is in his own belief of their kind and originstill the thoughts the reasonings the grounds the deductions the facts illustrative or in proof and the conclusions remain the same and the reader might derive the same benefit from them as from the sublime and impressive truths conveyed in the vision of mirza or the tablet of cebes so much even from a very partial acquaintance with the works of swedenborg i can venture to assert that as a moralist swedenborg is above all praise and that as a naturalist psychologist and theologian he has strong and varied claims on the gratitude and admiration of the professional and philosophical studentapril 1827  p s notwithstanding all that mr noble says in justification of his arrangement it is greatly to be regretted that the contents of this work are so confusedly tossed together it is however a work of great merit    footnote 1 an appeal in behalf of the views of the eternal world and state and the doctrines of faith and life held by the body of christians who believe that a new church is signified in the revelation c xxi by the new jerusalem including answers to objections particularly those of the rev g beaumont in his work entitled the antiswedenborg addressed to the reflecting of all denominations by samuel noble minister of hanover street chapel london london 1826 ed                                               essay on faith  faith may be defined as fidelity to our own beingso far as such being is not and cannot become an object of the senses and hence by clear inference or implication to being generally as far as the same is not the object of the senses and again to whatever is affirmed or understood as the condition or concomitant or consequence of the same this will be best explained by an instance or example that i am conscious of something within me peremptorily commanding me to do unto others as i would they should do unto mein other words a categorical that is primary and unconditional imperativethat the maxim regula maxima or supreme rule of my actions both inward and outward should be such as i could without any contradiction arising therefrom will to be the law of all moral and rational beingsthis i say is a fact of which i am no less conscious though in a different way nor less assured than i am of any appearance presented by my outward senses nor is this all but in the very act of being conscious of this in my own nature i know that it is a fact of which all men either are or ought to be consciousa fact the ignorance of which constitutes either the nonpersonality of the ignorant or the guilt in which latter case the ignorance is equivalent to knowledge wilfully darkened i know that i possess this consciousness as a man and not as samuel taylor coleridge hence knowing that consciousness of this fact is the root of all other consciousness and the only practical contradistinction of man from the brutes we name it the conscience by the natural absence or presumed presence of which the law both divine and human determines whether x y z be a thing or a personthe conscience being that which never to have had places the objects in the same order of things as the brutes for example idiots and to have lost which implies either insanity or apostasy wellthis we have affirmed is a fact of which every honest man is as fully assured as of his seeing hearing or smelling but though the former assurance does not differ from the latter in the degree it is altogether diverse in the kind the senses being morally passive while the conscience is essentially connected with the will though not always nor indeed in any case except after frequent attempts and aversions of will dependent on the choice thence we call the presentations of the senses impressions those of the conscience commands or dictates in the senses we find our receptivity and as far as our personal being is concerned we are passivebut in the fact of the conscience we are not only agents but it is by this alone that we know ourselves to be such nay that our very passiveness in this latter is an act of passiveness and that we are patient patientesnot as in the other case simply passive the result is the consciousness of responsibility and the proof is afforded by the inward experience of the diversity between regret and remorse  if i have sound ears and my companion speaks to me with a due proportion of voice i may persuade him that i did not hear but cannot deceive myself but when my conscience speaks to me i can by repeated efforts render myself finally insensible to which add this other difference in the case of conscience namely that to make myself deaf is one and the same thing with making my conscience dumb till at length i become unconscious of my conscience frequent are the instances in which it is suspended and as it were drowned in the inundation of the appetites passions and imaginations to which i have resigned myself making use of my will in order to abandon my freewill and there are not i fear examples wanting of the conscience being utterly destroyed or of the passage of wickedness into madnessthat species of madness namely in which the reason is lost for so long as the reason continues so long must the conscience exist either as a good conscience or as a bad conscience  it appears then that even the very first step that the initiation of the process the becoming conscious of a conscience partakes of the nature of an act it is an act in and by which we take upon ourselves an allegiance and consequently the obligation of fealty and this fealty or fidelity implying the power of being unfaithful it is the first and fundamental sense of faith it is likewise the commencement of experience and the result of all other experience in other words conscience in this its simplest form must be supposed in order to consciousness that is to human consciousness brutes may be and are scions but those beings only who have an i scire possunt hoc vel illud una cum seipsis that is conscire vel scire aliquid mecum or to know a thing in relation to myself and in the act of knowing myself as acted upon by that something  now the third person could never have been distinguished from the first but by means of the second there can be no he without a previous thou much less could an i exist for us except as it exists during the suspension of the will as in dreams and the nature of brutes may be best understood by conceiving them as somnambulists this is a deep meditation though the position is capable of the strictest proofnamely that there can be no i without a thou and that a thou is only possible by an equation in which i is taken as equal to thou and yet not the same and this again is only possible by putting them in opposition as correspondent opposites or correlatives in order to this a something must be affirmed in the one which is rejected in the other and this something is the will i do not will to consider myself as equal to myself for in the very act of constituting myself i i take it as the same and therefore as incapable of comparison that is of any application of the will if then i minus the will be the thesis 2 thou plus will must be the antithesis but the equation of thou with i by means of a free act negativing the sameness in order to establish the equality is the true definition of conscience but as without a thou there can be no you so without a you no they these or those and as all these conjointly form the materials and subjects of consciousness and the conditions of experience it is evident that the conscience is the root of all consciousnessa fortiori the precondition of all experienceand that the conscience cannot have been in its first revelation deduced from experience soon however experience comes into play we learn that there are other impulses beside the dictates of conscience that there are powers within us and without us ready to usurp the throne of conscience and busy in tempting us to transfer our allegiance we learn that there are many things contrary to conscience and therefore to be rejected and utterly excluded and many that can coexist with its supremacy only by being subjugated as beasts of burthen and others again as for instance the social tendernesses and affections and the faculties and excitations of the intellect which must be at least subordinated the preservation of our loyalty and fealty under these trials and against these rivals constitutes the second sense of faith and we shall need but one more point of view to complete its full import this is the consideration of what is presupposed in the human conscience the answer is ready as in the equation of the correlative i and thou one of the twin constituents is to be taken as plus will the other as minus will so is it here and it is obvious that the reason or superindividual of each man whereby he is man is the factor we are to take as minus will and that the individual will or personalizing principle of free agency arbitrement is miltons word is the factor marked plus willand again that as the identity or coinherence of the absolute will and the reason is the peculiar character of god so is the synthesis of the individual will and the common reason by the subordination of the former to the latter the only possible likeness or image of the prothesis or identity and therefore the required proper character of man conscience then is a witness respecting the identity of the will and the reason effected by the selfsubordination of the will or self to the reason as equal to or representing the will of god but the personal will is a factor in other moral syntheses for example appetite plus personal willsensuality lust of power plus personal willambition and so on equally as in the synthesis on which the conscience is grounded not this therefore but the other synthesis must supply the specific character of the conscience and we must enter into an analysis of reason such as the nature and objects of the reason are such must be the functions and objects of the conscience and the former we shall best learn by recapitulating those constituents of the total man which are either contrary to or disparate from the reason    i   reason and the proper objects of reason are wholly alien from        sensation reason is supersensual and its antagonist is        appetite and the objects of appetite the lust of the flesh    ii  reason and its objects do not appertain to the world of the        senses inward or outward that is they partake not of sense or        fancy reason is supersensuous and here its antagonist is the        lust of the eye    iii reason and its objects are not things of reflection association        discursion discourse in the old sense of the word as opposed to        intuition discursive or intuitive as milton has it reason        does not indeed necessarily exclude the finite either in time or        in space but it includes them eminenter thus the prime mover        of the material universe is affirmed to contain all motion as its        cause but not to be or to suffer motion in itself  reason is not the faculty of the finite but here i must premise the following the faculty of the finite is that which reduces the confused impressions of sense to their essential formsquantity quality relation and in these action and reaction cause and effect and the like thus raises the materials furnished by the senses and sensations into objects of reflection and so makes experience possible without it mans representative powers would be a delirium a chaos a scudding cloudage of shapes and it is therefore most appropriately called the understanding or substantiative faculty our elder metaphysicians down to hobbes inclusively called this likewise discourse discursus discursio from its mode of action as not staying at any one object but running as it were to and fro to abstract generalize and classify now when this faculty is employed in the service of the pure reason it brings out the necessary and universal truths contained in the infinite into distinct contemplation by the pure act of the sensuous imagination that is in the production of the forms of space and time abstracted from all corporeity and likewise of the inherent forms of the understanding itself abstractedly from the consideration of particulars as in the case of geometry numeral mathematics universal logic and pure metaphysics the discursive faculty then becomes what our shakspeare with happy precision calls discourse of reason  we will now take up our reasoning again from the words motion in itself  it is evident then that the reason as the irradiative power and the representative of the infinite judges the understanding as the faculty of the finite and cannot without error be judged by it when this is attempted or when the understanding in its synthesis with the personal will usurps the supremacy of the reason or affects to supersede the reason it is then what st paul calls the mind of the flesh greek phrónaema sarkòs or the wisdom of this world the result is that the reason is superfinite and in this relation its antagonist is the insubordinate understanding or mind of the flesh  iv reason as one with the absolute will in the beginning was the     logos and the logos was with god and the logos was god and     therefore for man the certain representative of the will of god is     above the will of man as an individual will we have seen in iii     that it stands in antagonism to all mere particulars but here it     stands in antagonism to all mere individual interests as so many     selves to the personal will as seeking its objects in the     manifestation of itself for itselfsit pro ratione     voluntaswhether this be realized with adjuncts as in the lust     of the flesh and in the lust of the eye or without adjuncts as in     the thirst and pride of power despotism egoistic ambition the     fourth antagonist then of reason is the lust of the will  corollary unlike a million of tigers a million of men is very different from a million times one man each man in a numerous society is not only coexistent with but virtually organized into the multitude of which he is an integral part his idem is modified by the alter and there arise impulses and objects from this synthesis of the alter et idem myself and my neighbour this again is strictly analogous to what takes place in the vital organization of the individual man the cerebral system of nerves has its correspondent antithesis in the abdominal system but hence arises a synthesis of the two in the pectoral system as the intermediate and like a drawbridge at once conductor and boundary in the latter as objectized by the former arise the emotions affections and in one word the passions as distinguished from the cognitions and appetites now the reason has been shown to be superindividual generally and therefore not less so when the form of an individualization subsists in the alter than when it is confined to the idem not less when the emotions have their conscious or believed object in another than when their subject is the individual personal self for though these emotions affections attachments and the like are the prepared ladder by which the lower nature is taken up into and made to partake of the highest roomas we are taught to give a feeling of reality to the higher per medium commune with the lower and thus gradually to see the reality of the higher namely the objects of reason and finally to know that the latter are indeed and preeminently real as if you love your earthly parents whom you see by these means you will learn to love your heavenly father who is invisibleyet this holds good only so far as the reason is the president and its objects the ultimate aim and cases may arise in which the christ as the logos or redemptive reason declares he that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me nay he that can permit his emotions to rise to an equality with the universal reason is in enmity with that reason here then reason appears as the love of god and its antagonist is the attachment to individuals wherever it exists in diminution of or in competition with the love which is reason  in these five paragraphs i have enumerated and explained the several powers or forces belonging or incidental to human nature which in all matters of reason the man is bound either to subjugate or subordinate to reason the application to faith follows of its own accord the first or most indefinite sense of faith is fidelity then fidelity under previous contract or particular moral obligation in this sense faith is fealty to a rightful superior faith is the duty of a faithful subject to a rightful governor then it is allegiance in active service fidelity to the liege lord under circumstances and amid the temptations of usurpation rebellion and intestine discord next we seek for that rightful superior on our duties to whom all our duties to all other superiors on our faithfulness to whom all our bounden relations to all other objects of fidelity are founded we must inquire after that duty in which all others find their several degrees and dignities and from which they derive their obligative force we are to find a superior whose rights including our duties are presented to the mind in the very idea of that supreme being whose sovereign prerogatives are predicates implied in the subjects as the essential properties of a circle are coassumed in the first assumption of a circle consequently underived unconditional and as rationally insusceptible so probably prohibitive of all further question in this sense then faith is fidelity fealty allegiance of the moral nature to god in opposition to all usurpation and in resistance to all temptation to the placing any other claim above or equal with our fidelity to god  the will of god is the last ground and final aim of all our duties and to that the whole man is to be harmonized by subordination subjugation or suppression alike in commission and omission but the will of god which is one with the supreme intelligence is revealed to man through the conscience but the conscience which consists in an inappellable bearingwitness to the truth and reality of our reason may legitimately be construed with the term reason so far as the conscience is prescriptive while as approving or condemning it is the consciousness of the subordination or insubordination the harmony or discord of the personal will of man to and with the representative of the will of god this brings me to the last and fullest sense of faith that is as the obedience of the individual will to the reason in the lust of the flesh as opposed to the supersensual in the lust of the eye as opposed to the supersensuous in the pride of the understanding as opposed to the infinite in the greek phronaema sarkos in contrariety to the spiritual truth in the lust of the personal will as opposed to the absolute and universal and in the love of the creature as far as it is opposed to the love which is one with the reason namely the love of god  thus then to conclude faith subsists in the synthesis of the reason and the individual will by virtue of the latter therefore it must be an energy and inasmuch as it relates to the whole moral man it must be exerted in each and all of his constituents or incidents faculties and tendenciesit must be a total not a partial a continuous not a desultory or occasional energy and by virtue of the former that is reason faith must be a light a form of knowing a beholding of truth in the incomparable words of the evangelist thereforefaith must be a light originating in the logos or the substantial reason which is coeternal and one with the holy will and which light is at the same time the life of men now as life is here the sum or collective of all moral and spiritual acts in suffering doing and being so is faith the source and the sum the energy and the principle of the fidelity of man to god by the subordination of his human will in all provinces of his nature to his reason as the sum of spiritual truth representing and manifesting the will divine   end of vol iv the final volume in this series
