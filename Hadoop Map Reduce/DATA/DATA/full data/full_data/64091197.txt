easychair by the open window of her back parlor this was a pleasant place in which to sit in the afternoon for the sun was then on the other side of the house and she could look not only over the smooth grass of the side yard and the flower beds which were under her especial care but across the corner of the front lawn into the village street here between two handsome mapletrees which stood upon the sidewalk she could see something of what was going on in the outer world without presenting the appearance of one who is fond of watching her neighbors it was not much that she saw for the street was a quiet one but a very little of that sort of thing satisfied her  she was a woman who was easily satisfied as a proof of this i may say that she looked upon me as a man who always did what was right indeed i am quite sure there were cases when she saved herself a good deal of perplexing cogitation by assuming that a thing was right because i did it i was her only grandchild my father and mother had died when i was very young and i had always lived with herthat is her house had always been my home and as i am sure there had never been any reason why i should not be a dutiful and affectionate grandson it was not surprising that she looked upon me with a certain tender partiality and that she considered me worthy of all the good that she or fortune could bestow upon me  my grandmother was nearly seventy but her physical powers had been excellently well preserved and as to her mental vigor i could see no change in it even when a little boy i had admired her powers of sympathetic consideration by which she divined the needs and desires of her fellowcreatures and now that i had become a grown man i found those powers as active and ready as they had ever been  the village in which we lived contained a goodly number of families of high standing and comfortable fortune it was a village of wellkept and wellshaded streets of closecut grass with no litter on the sidewalks our house was one of the best in the place and since i had come of age i had greatly improved it i had a fair inheritance from my mother and this my grandmother desired me to expend without reference to what i was receiving and would receive from her to her sons son would come ultimately everything that she possessed  being thus able to carry out my ideas concerning the comfort and convenience of a bachelor i had built a wing to my grandmothers house which was occupied only by myself it communicated by several doors with the main building and these doors were nearly always open but it was satisfactory to me to think that if i chose i might shut and lock them and thus give my apartment the advantages of a separate house the ground floor of my establishment consisted of a large and handsome library and study with a goodsized anteroom opening from it and above were my sleeping and dressing rooms with the exception of the time devoted to reading reflection and repose i lived with my grandmother  neither of us however confined ourself to this village life the winters my grandmother generally spent with a married sister in a neighboring city and i was accustomed to visit and journey whenever it pleased me recently i had spent a year in europe and on my return i joined my grandmother for a while before going to our village home     ii  relating to my year in europe   i do not suppose that any one ever enjoyed travel and residence in england and on the continent more than i did but i do not now intend to give any account of my experiences nor of the effect they had upon me save in one regard i had traveled and lived for the most part alone and one of the greatest pleasures connected with my life in europe was the anticipation of telling my friends who had never crossed the ocean what i had seen heard and done  but when i returned to america i met with a great disappointment my glowing anticipations were not realized i could find scarcely any one who cared to know what i had seen heard or done  at this i was as much surprised as disappointed i believed that i possessed fair powers of description and narration and many of my traveling experiences were out of the common in fact i had endeavored to see things the ordinary traveler does not see and to do things which he seldom does i found however that my unusual experiences were of no advantage to me in making people desirous to hear accounts of my travels i might as well have joined a party of personally conducted tourists  my friends and acquaintances in town were all glad to see me not that they might hear what had happened to me but that they might tell me what had happened to them this disposition sometimes threw me into a state of absolute amazement i could not comprehend for instance why mrs gormer who had known me for years and who i thought would take such an active interest in everything that concerned me should dismiss my european tour with a few remarks in regard to my health in the countries i had passed through and then begin an animated account of the troubles she had had since i had been away how the house she had been living in had had two feet of water in the cellar for weeks at a time and how nobody could find out whether it was caused by a spring in the ground or the bursting of an unknown waterpipebut no matter what it was they couldnt stay there and what a dreadful time they had in finding another house and how the day appointed for jennies wedding coming directly in the middle of the moving it had to be postponed for she declared she would never be married anywhere but at home and how several of mr barclays relations came down from new hampshire on purpose to be at the wedding and had to stay either at hotels or with friends for it was more than a week before her house could be made ready for the wedding she then remarked that of course i had heard of the shameful way in which john had been treated in regard to that position in the treasury department at washington and as i had not heard she went on and told me about it until it was time for me to go  at my club some of the men did not know that i had been away but there were others who were very glad to hear that i had been in europe because it gave them an opportunity to tell me about that very exciting election of brubaker a man of whom i had never heard who had been proposed by shuster with whom i was not acquainted and seconded by cushman whom i did not know i found no one desirous of hearing me talk about my travels and those who were willing to do so were satisfied with a very few general points sometimes i could not but admire the facility and skill with which some of the people who stay at home were able to defend themselves against the attempted loquacity of the returned traveler  occasionally in social gatherings i met with some one generally a lady who did take an interest in hearing that i had been in such or such a place but this was always some place in which she had been and after comparing experiences she would go on to tell of things which she had seen and done and often ended by making me feel very sorry for having neglected my opportunities  yes said one it must have been cold on the top of that lonely mountain with nothing to warm you but those plump little wolves and the constant fear that their mother might come back but you ought to have been here during the blizzard and then she went on with a full history of the great blizzard  everywhere i was met by that blizzard those people who had not moved or who had not had a puzzling disease in the family or who had not been instrumental in founding a free kindergarten could always fall back on the blizzard i heard how their fathers could not get home on the train of the awful prices the people charged for clearing away the snow of the way in which jane and adelaide had to get on without music lessons for nearly ten days and of the scarcity of milk no one who had seen and felt that irrepressible storm suffered from it as i did it chilled the aspirations of my soul it froze the unspoken words of my mouth it overwhelmed and buried every rising hope of speech and smothered and sometimes nearly obliterated my most interesting recollection many a time i have mentally sent that blizzard to regions where its icy blasts would have melted as in a hot simoom  i truly believed that in our village i should find sensible people who would be glad to hear about interesting things which they never had seen many of them had not traveled and a returned tourist was a comparative rarity in the place i went down there on purpose to talk about europe it was too early for my grandmothers return to the country i proposed to spend a week with my village friends and before their bright firesides charm and delight them with accounts of those things which had so charmed and delighted me the lives of city people are so filled with every sort of material that it is useless to try to crowd anything more into them here however were people with excellent intellects whose craving for mental pabulum especially in the winter could be but partially satisfied  but bless me i never heard of such an overstock of mental pabulum as i found there it was poured upon me by every one with whom i tried to converse i was frequently permitted to begin statements which i believed must win their way if they were allowed a fair start but very soon something i said was sure to suggest something which had occurred in the village and before i could brace myself the torrent would burst upon me never did i hear in the same space of time so much about things which had happened as i then heard from my village neighbors it was not that so much had occurred but that so much was said about what had occurred it was plain there was no hope for me here and after three days i went back to town  now it was early summer and my grandmother and i were again in our dear home in the village as i have said she was sitting by the open window where she could look out upon the flowers the grass and a little of the life of her neighbors i sat near her and had been telling her of my three days in the forest of arden and of the veritable jaques whom i met there when she remarked  that must have been extremely interesting and speaking of the woods i wish you would say to thomas that so soon as he can find time i want him to bring up some of that rich woodsoil and put it around those geraniums  this was the first time my grandmother had interjected any remark into my recitals she had often asked me to tell her about my travels and on every other occasion she had listened until she softly fell asleep i now remembered having heard her say that it interfered with her nights rest to sleep in the daytime perhaps her present interruption was intended as a gentle rebuke and no other kind of rebuke had ever come to me from my grandmother  i went out to find thomas oppressed by a mild despair if i were to tell my tales to a stone i thought it would turn on me with a sermon     iii  the modern use of the human ear   during my lonely walks and rides through the country about our village i began to cogitate and philosophize upon the present social value of the human ear why do people in society and in domestic circles have ears i asked myself they do not use them to listen to one another and then i thought and pondered further and suddenly the truth came to me the ears of the present generation are not purveyors to the mind they are merely agents of the tongue who watch for breaks or weak places in the speech of others in order that their principal may rush in and hold the field they are jackals who scent out a timid pause or an unsuspecting silence which the lion tongue straightway destroys very forcibly the conviction came to me that nowadays we listen only for an opportunity to speak  i was grieved that true listening had become a lost art for without it worthy speech is impossible to good listening is due a great part of the noble thought the golden instruction and the brilliant wit which has elevated enlightened and brightened the soul of man there are fine minds whose workings are never expressed in writing and even among those who in print spread their ideas before the world there is a certain cream of thought which is given only to listeners if happily there be such  modern conversation has degenerated into the italian game of moccoletto in which every one endeavors to blow out the candles of the others and keep his own alight in such rude play there is no illumination there should be a reform i declared there should be schools of listening here men and women should be taught how with sympathetic and delicate art to draw from others the useful and sometimes precious speech which without their skillful coöperation might never know existence to be willing to receive in order that good may be given should be one of the highest aims of life  not only should we learn to listen in order to give opportunity for the profitable speech of others but we should do so out of charity and good will to our fellowmen how many weary sickbeds how many cheerless lives how many lonely depressed and silent men and women might be gladdened and for the time transformed by one who would come not to speak words of cheer and comfort but to listen to tales of suffering and trial here would be one of the truest forms of charity an almost unknown joy would be given to the world  there should be brotherhoods and sisterhoods of listeners like good angels they should go out among those unfortunates who have none to hear that which it would give them so much delight to say  but alas i knew of no such good angels must that which i had to tell remain forever untold for the want of one this could not be there must exist somewhere a man or a woman who would be willing to hear my accounts of travels and experiences which in an exceptionable degree were interesting and valuable  i determined to advertise for a listener     iv  i obtain a listener   the writing of my advertisement cost me a great deal of trouble at first i thought of stating that i desired a respectable and intelligent person who would devote a few hours each day to the services of a literary man but on reflection i saw that this would bring me a vast number of answers from persons who were willing to act as secretaries proofreaders or anything of the sort and i should have no means of finding out from their letters whether they were good listeners or not  therefore i determined to be very straightforward and definite and to state plainly what it was i wanted the following is the advertisement which i caused to be inserted in several of the city papers       wanteda respectable and intelligent person willing to      devote several hours a day to listening to the recitals of a      traveler address stating compensation expected oral  i mentioned my purpose to no one not even to my grandmother for i should merely make myself the object of the ridicule of my friends and my dear relatives soul would be filled with grief that she had not been considered competent to do for me so slight a service if i succeeded in obtaining a listener he could come to me in my library where no one would know he was not a stenographer to whom i was dictating literary matter or a teacher of languages who came to instruct me in arabic  i received a dozen or more answers to my advertisement some of which were very amusing and others very unsatisfactory not one of the writers understood what sort of services i desired but all expressed their belief that they were fully competent to give them whatever they might be  after a good deal of correspondence and some interviewing i selected at last a person who i believed would prove himself a satisfactory listener he was an elderly man of genteel appearance and apparently of a quiet and accommodating disposition he assured me that he had once been a merchant engaged in the importation of gunnybags and having failed in business had since depended on the occasional assistance given him by a widowed daughterinlaw this man i engaged and arranged that he should lodge at the village inn and come to me every evening  i was truly delighted that so far i had succeeded in my plan now instead of depending upon the whims fancies or occasional goodnatured compliance of any one i was master of the situation my listener was paid to listen to me and listen to me he must if he did not do so intelligently he should be dismissed it would be difficult to express fully the delight given me by my new possessionthe ownership of attention  every evening my listener came and during a great part of every day i thought of what i should say to him when he should come i talked to him with a feeling of freedom and absolute independence which thrilled me like champagne what mattered it whether my speech interested him or not he was paid to listen without regard to interest more than that he was paid to show an interest whether he felt it or not whether i bored him or delighted him it made no difference in fact it would be a pleasure to me occasionally to feel that i did bore him to have the full opportunity and the perfect right to bore a fellowbeing is a privilege not lightly to be prized and an added zest is given to the enjoyment of the borer by the knowledge that the bored one is bound to make it appear that he is not bored  in an easychair opposite to me my listener sat and listened for two hours every evening i interested myself by watching and attempting to analyze the expressions on his face but what these appeared to indicate made no difference in my remarks i do not think he liked repetitions but if i chose to tell a thing several times i did so he had no right to tell me that he had heard that before immunity from this remark was to me a rare enjoyment  i made it a point to talk as well as i could for i like to hear myself talk well but i paid no attention to the likings of my listener later i should probably do this but at present it was a joy to trample upon the likings of others my own likings in this respect had been so often trampled upon that i would not now deny myself the exercise of the rightbought and paid forto take this sweet revenge  on the evenings of nine weekdays and one sunday when i confined myself entirely to a description of a short visit to palestine i talked and my listener listened about the middle of the evening of the tenth weekday when i was engaged in the expression of some fancies evoked by the recollection of a stroll through the egyptian department of the louvre i looked at my listener and beheld him asleep  as i stopped speaking he awoke with a start and attempted to excuse himself by stating that he had omitted to take coffee with his evening meal i made no answer but opening my pocketbook paid and discharged him     v  chester walkirk   it is not my custom to be discouraged by a first failure i looked over the letters which had been sent to me in answer to my advertisement and wrote to another of the applicants who very promptly came to see me  the appearance of this man somewhat discouraged me my first thought concerning him was that a man who seemed to be so thoroughly alive was not likely to prove a good listener but after i had had a talk with him i determined to give him a trial of one thing i was satisfied he would keep awake he was a man of cheerful aspect alert in motion glance and speech his age was about forty he was of medium size a little inclined to be stout and his face upon which he wore no hair was somewhat ruddy in dress he was neat and proper and he had an air of friendly deference which seemed to me to suit the position i wished him to fill  he spoke of himself and his qualifications with tact if not with modesty and rated very highly his ability to serve me as a listener but he did so in a manner intended to convince me that he was not boasting but stating facts which it was necessary i should know his experience had been varied he had acted as a tutor a traveling companion a confidential clerk a collector of information for technical writers and in other capacities requiring facility of adaptation to exigencies at present he was engaged in making a catalogue for a collector of prints whose treasures in the course of years had increased to such an extent that it was impossible for him to remember what his long rows of portfolios contained the collector was not willing that work among his engravings should be done by artificial light and as the evenings of my visitor were therefore disengaged he said he should be glad to occupy them in a manner which would not only be profitable to him but he was quite sure would be very interesting  the mans name was chester walkirk and i engaged him to come to me every evening as my first listener had done  i began my discourses with walkirk with much less confidence and pleasurable anticipation than i had felt with regard to the quiet unassuming elderly person who had been my first listener and whom i had supposed to be a very model of receptivity the new man i feared would demand moreif not by word at least by manner he would be more like an audience i should find myself striving to please him and i could not feel careless whether he liked what i said or not  but by the middle of the first evening all my fears and doubts in regard to walkirk had disappeared he proved to be an exceptionally good listener as i spoke he heard me with attention and evident interest and this he showed by occasional remarks which he took care should never be interruptions these interpolations were managed with much tact sometimes they were in the form of questions which reminded me of something i had intended to say but had omitted which led me to speak further upon the subject perhaps on some other phase of it now and then by the expression on his countenance or by a word or two he showed interest gratification astonishment or some other appropriate sentiment  when i stopped speaking he would sit quietly and muse upon what i had been saying or if he thought me not too deeply absorbed in reflection would ask a question or say something relative to the subject in hand which would give me the opportunity of making some remarks which it gratified me to know that he wanted to hear  i could not help feeling that i talked better to walkirk than i had ever done to any one else and i did not hesitate to admit to myself that this gratifying result was due in great part to his ability as a listener i do not say that he drew me out but he gave me opportunities to show myself in the broadest and best lights this truly might be said to be good listening it produced good speech  day after day i became better and better satisfied with chester walkirk and it is seldom that i have enjoyed myself more than in talking to him i am sure that it gave me more actual pleasure to tell him what i had seen and what i had done than i had felt in seeing and doing those things this may appear odd but it is a fact i readily revived in myself the emotions that accompanied my experiences and to these recalled emotions was added the sympathetic interest of another  in other ways walkirk won my favor he was goodnatured and intelligent and showed that he was anxious to please me not only as a listener but as a companion or i might better say as an associate inmate of my study what he did not know in this respect he set himself diligently to learn     vi  my understudy   in talking about my travels to chester walkirk i continued for a time to treat the subject in the same desultory manner in which i had related my experiences to my first listener but the superior intelligence and i may say the superior attention of walkirk acted upon me as a restraint as well as an incentive i made my descriptions as graphic and my statements as accurate as i could and stimulated by his occasional questions and remarks i began to discourse systematically and with a wellconsidered plan i went from country to country in the order in which i had traveled through them and placed my reflections on social political or artistic points where they naturally belonged  it was plain to see that walkirks interest and pleasure increased when my rambling narrations resolved themselves into a series of evening lectures upon great britain the continent and the north coast of africa and his pleasure was a decided gratification to me if his engagements and mine had permitted i should have been glad to talk to him at other times as well as in the evening  after a month or more of this agreeable occupation the fact began to impress itself upon me that i was devoting too much time to the pleasure of being listened to my grandmother gently complained that the time i gave to her after dinner appeared to be growing less and less and there was a good deal of correspondence and other business i was in the habit of attending to in the evening which now was neglected or done in the daytime when i should have been doing other things  i was not a man of leisure my grandmother owned a farm about a mile from our village and over the management of this i exercised a supervision i was erecting some houses on land of my own on the outskirts of the village and for this reason as well as others it frequently was necessary for me to go to the city on business errands besides all this social duties had a claim on me summer and winter  i had gradually formed the habit of talking with walkirk on other subjects than my travels and one evening i mentioned to him some of the embarrassments and annoyances to which i had been subjected during the day on account of the varied character of my affairs walkirk sat for a minute or two his chin in his hand gazing steadfastly upon the carpet then he spoke  mr vanderley what you say suggests something which i have been thinking of saying to you i have now finished the catalogue of prints on which i was engaged when i entered your service as a listener and my days therefore being at my disposal it would give me great pleasure to put them at yours  in what capacity i asked  in that of an understudy said he  i assured him that i did not know what he meant  i dont wonder at that said he with a smile but i will explain in theatrical circles each principal performer is furnished with what is termed in the profession an understudy this is an actor male or female as the case may be who studies the part of the performer and is capable of going through with it with more or less ability in case the regular actor from sickness or any other cause is prevented from appearing in his part in this way the manager provides against emergencies which might at any time stop his play and ruin his business now i should like very much to be your understudy and i think in this capacity i could be of great service to you  i made no answer but i am sure my countenance expressed surprise  i do not mean he continued to propose that i shall act as your agent in the various forms of business which press upon you but i suggest that you allow me to do for you exactly what the understudy does for the actor that is that you let me take your place when it is inconvenient or impossible for you to take it yourself  it strikes me said i that in the management of my affairs it would be very seldom that you or any one else could take my place  of course said walkirk under present circumstances that would be impossible but suppose for instance you take me with you to those houses you are building that you show me what has been done and what you intend to do and that you let me make myself familiar with the whole plan and manner of the work this would be easy for me for i have superintended housebuilding and although i am neither a plumber a mason a carpenter a paperhanger or a painter i know how such people should do their work therefore if you should be unable to attend to the matter yourselfand in such case onlyi could go and see how the work was progressing and this i could do with regard to your farm or any other of your business with the details of which you should care to have me make myself familiaralways remembering that i should not act as your regular agent in any one of these affairs but as one who when it is desirable temporarily takes your place i think mr vanderley that it would be of advantage to you to consider my proposition  i did consider it and the next evening i engaged chester walkirk as an understudy     vii  my book   in order to be at hand when i might need him walkirk took up his residence at the village tavern or as some of us were pleased to call it the inn to make him available when occasion should require i took him with me to the scene of my building operations and to my grandmothers farm and he there showed the same intelligent interest that he gave to my evening recitals i had no difficulty in finding occupation for my understudy and so far as i could judge he attended to the business i placed in his hands as well as i could have done it myself indeed in some instances he did it better for he gave it more time and careful consideration  in this business of supplying my place in emergencies walkirk showed so much ability in promoting my interests that i became greatly pleased with the arrangement i had made with him it was somewhat surprising to me and i think to walkirk that so many cases arose in which i found it desirable that he should take my place i was going to look at a horse some visitors arrived i sent walkirk there was a meeting of a scientific society which i wished very much to attend but i could not do that and go to a dinner party to which i had been invited on the same evening walkirk went to the meeting took notes and the next day gave me a full report in regard to some particular points in which i was interested and which were not mentioned in the short newspaper notice of the meeting  in other cases of which at first i could not have imagined the possibility my understudy was of use to me i was invited to address my fellow townsmen and townswomen on the occasion of the centennial anniversary of the settlement of our village and as i had discovered that walkirk was a good reader i took him with me in order that he might deliver my written address in case my courage should give out my courage did not give out but i am very sure that i was greatly supported and emboldened by the knowledge that if at the last moment my embarrassment should not allow me to begin my address or if in the course of its delivery i should feel unable for any reason to go on with it there was some one present who would read it for me  it had long been my habit to attend with my grandmother bimonthly an early evening whist party at the house of an elderly neighbor i had a bad headache on one of these appointed evenings and walkirk who was a perfectly respectable and presentable man went with my grandmother in my stead i afterward heard that he played an excellent hand at whist a remark which had never been made of me  but i will not refer at present to any further instances of the usefulness of my understudy except to say that as i found his feet were of the same size and shape as my own i sent him to be measured for a pair of heavy walkingshoes which i needed and i once arranged for him to serve in my place on a coroners jury in the case of a drowned infant  the evening listenings still went on and as the scope of my remarks grew wider and their purpose became better defined it began to dawn upon me that it was selfish to devote these accounts of remarkable traveling experiences to the pleasure of only two men myself and my listener the public would be interested in these things i ought to write a book  this idea pleased me very much as walkirk was now able to take my place in so many ways i could give a good deal of time each day to composition and moreover there was no reason why such work should interfere with my pleasure in being listened to i could write by day and talk at night it would be all the better for my book that i should first orally deliver the matter to walkirk and afterward write it i broached this idea to walkirk but while he did not say so in words it was plain to me he did not regard it with favor he reflected a little before speaking  the writing of a book he said is a very serious thing and although it is not my province to advise you i will say that if i were in your place i should hesitate a good while before commencing a labor like that i have no doubt judging from what i have already heard of your travels that you would make a most useful and enjoyable book but the question in my mind is whether the pleasure you would give your readers would repay you for the time and labor you would put upon this work  this was the first time that walkirk had offered me advice i had no idea of taking it but i did not resent it  i do not look at the matter in that way i said an absorbing labor will be good for me my undertaking may result in overworking you for you will be obliged to act as my understudy even more frequently than you do now  oh im not afraid of work said he i can stand any amount of it but how about the evening discourseswill they come to an end  not at all said i i shall go on giving you an account of my travels just as before this will help me to judge better what to put in and what to leave out  i am very glad to hear that he said with animation i do not hesitate to own to you that i should very greatly regret to lose those most interesting accounts of your experiences  this was very complimentary but as he was paid to listen the remark did not possess the force it would have had had he paid to hear me  enthusiastically i went to work upon my book and i found that talking about my travels to walkirk helped me to write about them for the public but a week had not passed when i came to the conclusion that writing was in no way so pleasant as talking i disliked labor with the pen i disliked long sitting at my desk the composition of the matter was enough for me some one else should put it on paper i must have a secretary i went immediately to walkirk who was at the inn working upon some of my accounts  walkirk said i i can get somebody else to do that sort of thing i want you to act as my amanuensis  to my surprise his face clouded he seemed troubled even pained  i am very very sorry he said to decline any work which you may desire me to do but i really must decline this i cannot write from dictation i cannot be your amanuensis although it may seem like boasting this is one of the few things i cannot do my nervous temperament my disposition in fact my very nature stand in the way and make the thing impossible  i could not understand walkirks objections to this sort of work for he was a ready writer a good stenographer and had shown himself perfectly willing and able to perform duties much more difficult and distasteful than i imagined this possibly could be but there are many things i do not understand and which i consider it a waste of time to try to understand and this was one of them  then i must get some one else said i  if you decide to do that said walkirk i will attend to the matter for you and you need trouble yourself no further about it i will go to the city or wherever it is necessary to go and get you an amanuensis  do so said i but come and report to me before you make any engagement  the next day walkirk made his report he had not been as successful as he had hoped to be if i had been doing my work in the city he could have found me stenographers amanuenses or typewriters by the hundred by living and working in the country i made his task much more difficult he had found but few persons who were willing to come to me every day no matter what the weather and only one or two who would consent to come to our village to live  but he had made a list of several applicants who might suit me and who were willing to accept one or the other of the necessary conditions  they are all women i exclaimed when i looked at it  yes said he it would be very difficult perhaps impossible to find a competent man who would answer your purpose the good ones could not afford to give you part of their time which is all you require and you would not want any other with women the case is different and besides i am sure from my own experience that a lady amanuensis would suit your purpose much better than a man she would be more patient more willing to accommodate herself to your moods in every way more available  i had not engaged walkirk to be my understudy in matters of judgment and i did not intend that he should act in that capacity but there was force in his remarks and i determined to give them due consideration although i had apartments of my own i really lived in my grandmothers house and of course it was incumbent upon me to consult her upon this subject she looked at the matter in her usual kindly way and soon came to be of the opinion that if i could give a worthy and industrious young woman an opportunity to earn her livelihood i ought to do it taking care of course to engage no one who could not furnish the very best references  i now put the matter again into walkirks hands and told him to produce the persons he had selected he managed the matter with great skill and in the course of one morning four ladies called upon me in such a way that they did not interfere with each other of these applicants none pleased me one of them was a darkhaired darkeyed rather spare person whose youthful energies had been so improved by years that i was sure her briskness of action her promptness of speech and her evident anxiety to get to work and to keep at it would eventually drive me crazy  another was a skilled stenographer who could write i forget how many hundred words a minute and when i told her there were no minutes in which i could dictate as many words as that even if i wanted to and that there would be many minutes in which i should not dictate any words at all she said she was afraid that if she fell into a dillydally poky way of working it would impair her skill and it might be difficult when she left my employment to regain her previous expertness she was quite willing however to engage with me and thought that if i would try to dictate as fast as possible i might in time be able to keep her nearly up to her normal standard  a third one was willing to write longhand and to work as slowly and as irregularly as i pleased i gave her a short trial but her writing was so illegible that i could not discover whether or not she made mistakes in spelling i had however my suspicions on this point  the fourth applicant i engaged to come for a week on trial she exhibited no prominent disabilities and i thought she might be made to answer my purpose but as she possessed no prominent capabilities and as she asked me to repeat almost every sentence which i dictated to her i found it very tiresome to work with her and i punished walkirk by making him act as my understudy on the third and fourth days of her engagement i requested him to dictate to her some detailed incidents of travel which i had told him and which i was sure he remembered very well he undertook the task with alacrity but after two mornings work he advised me to discharge her dictating to her he said was like talking into a tin spout with nobody at the other end somebody might come if you shouted long enough but this was tiresome     viii  the malarial adjunct   the fifth applicant on walkirks list had a morning to herself so soon as she entered my study i hoped that she would suit me and i had not talked with her ten minutes before i decided that she would her personality was exceedingly agreeable she was neither too young nor too old she expressed herself with a goodhumored frankness which i liked and appeared to be of a very practical turn of mind she was a practiced stenographer was accustomed to write from dictation and to read aloud could correct proof and had some admirable references her abilities appeared so excellent and her demeanor was so agreeable to me that i engaged her  i am very happy indeed mr vanderley she said with the pretty dimpled smile which had so frequently shown itself in the course of our conversation that you have given me this position i am sure that i shall like it and i shall try very hard to make my work satisfactory i shall come up every morning in the nine oclock train as you desire and i shall be obliged to bring my husband with me but this will not in any way interfere with my work he is suffering from a malarial disease and is subject to periods of faintness so that it would be impossible for me to leave him for the whole morning but he can sit outside anywhere under a tree or perhaps somewhere in the house if it happens to rain he is perfectly contented if he has a comfortable place to sit in he is not able to attend to any business and as i now have to be the breadwinner i am most deeply grateful for this work which you have given me i am sure that the little trip in and out of town will do him good and as i shall buy commutation tickets it will not be expensive he came with me this morning and if you will excuse me i will bring him in and introduce him and without waiting for any remark from me she left the room and shortly returned with the malarial subject he was an extremely mildmannered man of light weight and sedate aspect the few words in which he indicated his gratification with his wifes engagement suggested to me the need of sulphate of quinia  this revelation of a malarial adjunct to the labors of myself and this very agreeable lady greatly surprised me and i must admit threw me back from that condition of satisfaction in which i had found myself upon engaging her and yet i could think of no reasonable objection to make the lady had promised that he should not be in the way and the most i could say even to myself was that the arrangement did not appear attractive to me of course with no reason but a chaotic distaste i would not recede from my agreement and deprive this worthy lady of the opportunity of supporting herself and her husband and the two departed to return on the following day prepared to labor and to wait  i inquired of walkirk i fear with some petulance if he had known of the incumbrance attached to this candidate and he replied that she had informed him that she was married but he had no idea she intended to bring her husband with her he was very sorry that this was necessary but in his judgment the man would not live very long  my grandmother was greatly pleased when i told her of the arrangement i had made to assist a devoted wife to support an invalid husband she considered it a most worthy and commendable action and she was rejoiced that such an opportunity had been afforded me she would do what she could to make the poor man comfortable while his wife was at work and if he had any sense at all and knew what was to his advantage he would be very careful not to interfere with her duties  the next morning the couple appeared and the lady was ensconced in the anteroom to my study which i had fitted up for the use of my secretary where through the open window in front of her she could see her husband seated in a rockingchair under a widespreading appletree by his side was a table on which lay the morning paper and some books which my grandmother had sent out to him for a time she gave him also her society but as she subsequently informed me she did not find him responsive and soon concluded that he would be happier if left to his reflections and the literature with which she had provided him  as an amanuensis i found my new assistant everything that could be desired she wrote rapidly and correctly never asked me to repeat showed no nervousness at the delays in my dictation and was ready to write the instant i was ready to speak she was quick and intelligent in looking up synonyms and appeared perfectly at home in the dictionary but in spite of these admirable qualifications i did not find myself that morning in a condition favorable to my best literary work whenever my secretary was not actually writing she was looking out of the window sometimes she would smile and nod and on three occasions while i was considering not what i should say next but whether or not i could stand this sort of thing she went gently to the window and asked the invalid in a clear whisper intended to be entirely undisturbing how he was getting on and if he wanted anything  two days after this the air was damp and rain threatened and the malarial gentleman was supplied with comfortable quarters in the back parlor i do not know whether or not he liked this better than sitting under a tree but i am sure that the change did not please his wife she could not look at him and she could not ask him how he was getting on and if he wanted anything i could see that she was worried and fidgety although endeavoring to work as faithfully and steadily as usual twice during a break in the dictation she asked me to excuse her for just one minute while she ran into the parlor to take a peep at him  the next day it rained and there seemed every probability that we should have continued wet weather and that it would be days before the malarial one could sit under the appletree therefore i looked the situation fairly in the face it was impossible for me to dictate to a nervous anxious woman whose obvious mental condition acted most annoyingly upon my nerves and i suggested that she bring her husband into her room and let him sit there while she worked with this proposition my secretary was delighted  oh that will be charming she cried he will sit just as still as a mouse and will not disturb either of us and i shall be able to see how he feels without saying a word  for four days the malarial gentleman as quiet as a mouse sat by my secretarys window while she wrote at the table and i walked up and down my study or threw myself into one chair or another endeavoring to forget that that man was sitting by the window that he was trying his best not to do anything which might disturb me that he did not read or write or occupy his mind in any way that he heard every word i dictated to his wife without indicating that he was not deaf or that he was capable of judging whether my words were good bad or unworthy of consideration not only did i endeavor not to think of him but i tried not to see either him or his wife the silent motionless figure of the one and the silent but animated and vivacious figure of the other filled with an eager desire to do her work properly with a bubbling and hearty love for her husband and an evident joyousness in the fact that she could love work and watch all at the same time drove from my mind every thought of travel or foreign experiences without the malarial husband i should have asked for no better secretary but he spoiled everything he was like a raw oyster in a cup of tea  i could not drive from my mind the vision of that man even when i knew he was asleep in his bed there was no way of throwing him off his wife had expressed to my grandmother the delight she felt in having him in the room with her while she worked and my grandmother had spoken to me of her own sympathetic pleasure in this arrangement i saw it would be impossible to exile him again to the appletree even if the ground should ever be dry enough there was no hope that he would be left at his home there was no hope that he would get better and go off to attend to his own business there was no hope that he would die  from dictating but little i fell to dictating almost nothing at all to keep my secretary at work i gave her some notes of travel of which to make a fair copy while i occupied myself in wondering what i was going to do about that malarial husband  at last i ceased to wonder and i did something i went to the city and after a days hard work i secured a position for my secretary in a large publishing establishment where her husband could sit by a window in a secluded corner and keep as quiet as a mouse the good lady overwhelmed me with thanks for my kindness she had begun to fear that as the season grew colder the daily trip would not suit her husband and she gave me credit for having thought the same thing  my grandmother and walkirk were greatly concerned as well as surprised at what i had done the former said that if i attempted to write my book with my own hand she feared the sedentary work would tell upon my health and my understudy while regretting very much that his efforts to provide me with an amanuensis had proved unsuccessful showed very plainly although he did not say so that he hoped i had found that authorship was an annoying and unprofitable business and that i would now devote myself to pursuits which were more congenial and in which he could act for me when occasion required     ix  walkirks idea   walkirk very soon discovered that i had no intention whatever of giving up the writing of my book and i quieted the fears of my grandmother in regard to my health by assuring her that the sedentary work connected with the production of my volume would not be done by me secretaries could be had and i would get one  this determination greatly disturbed walkirk he did not wish to see me perform a service for myself which it was his business to perform for me and in which he had failed i know that he gave the matter the most earnest consideration and two days after my late secretary and her husband had left me he came into my study his face shining with a new idea  mr vanderley said he to find you an amanuensis who will exactly suit you and who will be willing to come here into the country to work is i think you will admit a very difficult business but i do not intend if i can help it to be beaten by it i have thought of a plan which i believe will meet all contingencies and i have come to propose it to you you know that institution just outside the villagethe house of martha  i replied that i knew of it  well he continued i did not think of it until a day or two ago and i have since been inquiring into its organization and nature that sisterhood of martha is composed of women who propose not only to devote themselves to a life of goodness but to imitate the industrious woman for whom they have named themselves they work not only in their establishment but wherever they can find suitable occupation and all that they earn is devoted to the good of the institution some of them act as nurses for the sickfor pay if people can afford it for nothing if they cannot others have studied medicine and practice in the same way they also prepare medicines and dispense them and do a lot of good thingsif possible for money and the advantage of the house of martha but every woman who joins such an institution cannot expect immediately to find the sort of remunerative work she can best do and i am informed that there are several women there who at present are unemployed now it is my opinion that among these you could find half a dozen good secretaries  i laughed aloud those women said i are just the same as nuns it is ridiculous to suppose that one of them would be allowed to come here as my secretary even if she wanted to  i am not so sure of that persisted walkirk i do not see why literary or rather clerical pursuits should not be as open to them as medicine or nursing  you may not see it said i but i fancy that they do  it is impossible to be certain on that point he replied until we have proposed the matter to them and given them the opportunity to consider it  if you imagine i said that i have the effrontery to go to that nunneryfor it is no more nor less than thatand ask the lady abbess to lend me one of her nuns to write at my dictation you have very much mistaken me  walkirk smiled i hardly expected you to do that said he although i must insist that it is not a nunnery and there is no lady abbess there is a head mother and some submothers i believe my idea was that mrs vanderley should drive over there and make inquiries for you a proposition from an elderly lady of such high position in the community would have a much better effect than if it came from a gentleman  walkirks plan amused me very much and i told him i would talk to my grandmother about it when i did so i was much surprised to find that she received the idea with favor  that mr walkirk she said is a man of a good deal of penetration and judgment and if you could get one of those sisters to come here and write for you i should like it very much and if the first one did not suit you could try another without trouble or expense the fact that you had a good many strings to your bow would give you ease of mind and prevent your getting discouraged i dont want you to give up the idea of having a secretary  then with some hesitation my good grandmother confided to me that there was another reason why this idea of employing a sister pleased her she had been a little afraid that some lady secretary especially like that very pleasant and exemplary person with the invalid husband might put the notion into my head that it would be a good thing for me to have a wife to do my writing now of course she expected me to get married some day that was all right but there was no need of my being in any hurry about it and as to my wife doing my writing that was not to be counted upon positively some wives might not be willing to do it and others might not do it well so as far as that matter was concerned nothing would be gained but one of those sisters would never suggest matrimony they were women apart from all that sort of thing they had certain work to do in this world and they did it for the good of the cause in which they were enlisted without giving any thought to those outside matters which so often occupy the minds of women who have not in a manner separated themselves from the world she would go that very afternoon to the house of martha and make inquiries     x  the plan of seclusion   my grandmother returned from the house of martha disappointed and annoyed life had always flowed very smoothly for her and i had rarely seen her in her present mental condition  i do not believe she said that that institution will succeed those women are too narrowminded if they were in a regular stonewalled convent it would be another thing but they are only a sisterhood they are not shut up there its their business and part of their religion to go out and why they should not be willing to come here and do good as well as anywhere else i cannot see for the life of me  then they objected to the proposition i asked  yes she replied they did and without any reason whatever i saw their superior whom they call mother anastasia and from her i learned that there were several women in the establishment who were thoroughly competent to act as secretaries but when i proposed that one of them should come and write for you she said that would not do at all i reasoned the matter with her that literature was as high a profession as medicine and as much good could be done with the practice of one as the other and if the sisters went out to nurse and to cure they might just as well go out to write for those who cannot write for themselves to that she answered it was not the writing she objected tothat was all well enoughbut it was decidedly outside of the vocation of the order for one of the sisters to spend her mornings with a young gentleman if he were sick and suffering and had no one else to attend to him it would be different upon this i told her that you would be sick if you were obliged to do your own writing and therefore i couldnt see the difference  but i must admit she was very goodnatured and pleasant about it and she told me that if you chose to come to their visitors room and make yourself comfortable there and dictate one of the sisters would sit at the table behind the grating and would write for you i replied that i did not believe you would like that but that i would mention it to you  i laughed so much for walkirks brilliant idea i said i fancy myself going every morning to that nunnery to do my work in their cheerless visitors room  cheerless i should say so exclaimed my grandmotherbare floors bare walls and hard wooden chairs it is not to be thought of  that evening i informed walkirk of the ill success of my grandmothers mission but to my surprise he did not appear to be discouraged  i dont think we need have any trouble at all in managing that affair said he why shouldnt you have a grating put up in the doorway between your study and the secretarys room then the sister could go in there the other door could be locked and she would be as much shut off from the world as if she were behind a grating in the house of martha i believe if this plan were proposed to the sisters it would be agreed to  i scouted the idea as utterly absurd but when the next morning i mentioned it to my grandmother she caught at it eagerly and no sooner had she finished her breakfast than she ordered her carriage and drove to the house of martha  she returned triumphant  we had a long discussion she said but mother anastasia finally saw the matter in its proper light she admitted that if a room could be arranged in this house in which a sister could be actually secluded there was no good reason why she should not work there as consistently with their rules as if she were in the house of martha therefore she agreed if you concluded to carry out this plan to send a sister every morning to write for you so now if you want a secretary from the house of martha you can have one  to this i replied that i most positively wanted one and walkirk was immediately instructed to have a suitable grating made for the doorway between my study and the secretarys room  nearly a week was required for the execution of this work and during this time i took a rest from literary composition and visited some friends leaving all the arrangements for my new secretary in the hands of my grandmother and walkirk when i returned the iron grating was in its place it was a neat and artistic piece of work but i did not like it i object decidedly to anything which suggests restraint the whole affair of the secretary was indeed very different from what i would have had it but i had discovered that even in our advanced era of civilization one cannot always have everything he wants albeit he be perfectly able and willing to pay for it     xi  my nun   at nine oclock on the morning of the appointed day my new secretary came accompanied by one of those sisters called by walkirk submothers  my grandmother received the two and conducted them to the secretarys room i was sitting in my study but no attention was paid to me the submother advanced to the grating and having examined it appeared satisfied to find that it was securely fastened in the doorway the nun as i called her although walkirk assured me the term was incorrect stood with her back toward me and when her companion had said a few words to her in a low tone she took her seat at the table she wore a large gray bonnet the sides and top of which extended far beyond her face a light gray shawl and a gray gown she sat facing the window with her left side turned toward me and from no point of my study could i get a glimpse of her features  the submother looked out of the window which opened upon little more than the once husbandsheltering appletree and then after a general glance around the room she looked at me and for the first time addressed me  i will come for the sister at twelve oclock she said and with that she followed my grandmother out of the room and locked the door behind her  i stood and looked through the grating at my new secretary i am not generally a diffident man and have never been so with persons in my employment but now i must admit i did not feel at my ease the nun sat perfectly motionless her hands were folded in her gray lap and her gray bonnet was slightly bowed so that i did not know whether she was gazing down at the table or out of the window  she was evidently ready for work but i was not i did not know exactly how to begin with such a secretary with the others i had been outspoken from the first i had told them what i wanted and what i did not want and they had been ready enough to listen and ready enough to answer but to this silent motionless gray figure i did not feel that i could be outspoken no words suggested themselves as being appropriate to speak out if i could see her face but for a moment and discover whether she were old or young crosslooking or gentle i might know what to say to her my impulse was to tell her there was a hook on which she could hang her bonnet and shawl but as i did not know whether or not these sisters ever took off their bonnets and shawls i did not feel at liberty to make this suggestion  but it would not do to continue there looking at her she might be a very shy person and if i appeared shy it would probably make her all the shyer so i spoke  you will find paper i said in the drawer of your table and there are pens of different sorts in that tray she opened the drawer took out some paper and selected a pen all without turning her head toward me having broken the ice i now felt impelled to deliver a short lecture on my requirements but how could i say what i required without knowing what manner of person it was of whom i required it i therefore postponed the lecture and determined to begin work without further delay as probably that would be the best way to put us both at our ease but it had been more than two weeks since i had done any work and i could not remember what it was that i had been dictating or endeavoring to dictate to the lady with the malarial husband i therefore thought it well to begin at a fresh point and to leave the gap to be filled up afterward i felt quite sure when last at work i had been treating of the south of france and had certainly not reached marseilles i therefore decided to take a header for marseilles and into marseilles i plunged  as soon as i began to speak the nun began to write and having at last got her at work i felt anxious to keep her at it and went steadily on through the lively seaport touching upon one point after another as fast as i thought of them and without regard to their proper sequence but although i sometimes skipped from one end of the city to the other and from history to street scenes i dictated steadily and the nun wrote steadily she worked rapidly and apparently heard and understood every word i said for she asked no questions and did not hesitate i am sure i never before dictated so continuously i had been in the habit of stopping a good deal to think not only about my work but about other things but now i did not wish to stop  this amanuensis was very different from any other i had had the others worked to make money for themselves or to please me or because they liked it this one worked from principle the money which i paid for her labor did not become her money it was paid to the house of martha she sat there and wrote to promote the principles upon which the house of martha was founded in fact so far as i was concerned she was nothing more than a principle  now to interfere with the working of a principle is not the right thing to do and therefore i felt impelled to keep on dictating which i did until the hall door of the secretarys room was unlocked and the submother walked in she came forward and said a few words to the nun who stopped writing and wiped her pen the other then turned to me and in a low voice asked if the work of the sister was satisfactory i advanced to the grating and answered that i was perfectly satisfied and was about to make some remarks which i hoped would lead to a conversation when the submotherwhose name i subsequently learned was sister sarahmade a little bow and saying if that were the case they would return at nine the next morning left the room in company with the nun the latter when she arose from the table turned her back to me and went out without giving me the slightest opportunity of looking into her cavernous bonnet this she did i must admit in the most natural way possible which was probably the result of training and gave one no idea of rudeness or incivility  when they were gone i was piqued almost angry with myself i had intended stopping work a little before noon in order to talk to that nun even if she did not answer or look at me she should discover that if she was a principle i was at least an entity i did not know exactly what i should say to her but it would be something one human being would be likely to say to another human being who was working for him if from the first i put myself on the proper level she might in time get there but although i had lost my present chance she was coming again the next day  i entered the secretarys room by the hall door and looked at the manuscript which had been left on the table it was written in an excellent hand not too large very legible and correctly punctuated everything had been done properly except that after the first three pages she had forgotten to number the leaves at the top but as every sheet was placed in its proper order this was an omission which could be easily rectified i was very glad she had made it for it would give me something to speak to her about  at luncheon my grandmother asked me how i liked the new secretary and added that if she did not suit me i could try another next day i answered that so far she suited me and that i had not the least wish at present to try another i think my grandmother was about to say something regarding this sister but i instantly begged her not to do so i wished to judge her entirely on her merits i said and would rather not hear anything about her until i had come to a decision as to her abilities i did not add that i felt such an interest in the anticipated discovery of the personality of this secretary that i did not wish that discovery interfered with  in the evening walkirk inquired about the sisteramanuensis but i merely answered that so far she had done very well and dropped the subject in my own mind i did not drop the subject until i fell asleep that night i found myself from time to time wondering what sort of a woman was that nun was she an elderly sharpfaced creature was she a vapid fatfaced creature or a young and pleasing creature and when i had asked myself these questions i snubbed myself for taking the trouble to think about the matter and then i began wondering again  but upon one point i firmly made up my mind the relationship between my secretary and myself should not continue to be that of an entity dictating to a principle     xii  eza   the next day when the nun and sister sarah entered the secretarys room i advanced to the grating and bade them goodmorning they both bowed and the nun took her seat at the table sister sarah then turned to me and asked if i had a gold pen adding that the sister was accustomed to writing with one i answered that i had all kinds of pens and if the sister wanted a gold one it was only necessary to ask me for it i brought several gold pens and handed them through the grating to the submother who gave them to the secretary and then took her leave locking the door behind her my nun took one of the pens tried it arranged the paper and sat ready to write i stood by the grating hoping to converse a little if it should be possible  is there anything else you would like i said if there is you know you must mention it  she gently shook her head the idea now occurred to me that perhaps my nun was dumb but i almost instantly thought that this could not be for dumb people were almost always deaf and she could hear well enough then it struck me that she might be a trappist nun and bound by a vow of silence but i reflected that she was not really a nun and consequently could not be a trappist  having been unsuccessful in my first attempt to make her speak and having now stood silent for some moments i felt it might be unwise to make another trial just then for my object would be too plain i therefore sat down and began dictating  i did not work as easily as i had done on the preceding morning for i intended if possible to make my nun look at me or speak before the hour of noon and thinking of this intention prevented me from keeping my mind upon my work from time to time i made remarks in regard to the temperature of the room the quality of the paper or something of the kind to these she did not answer at all or slightly nodded or shook her head in a deprecatory manner as if they were matters not worth considering  then i suddenly remembered the omission of the paging and spoke of that in answer she took up the manuscript she had written and paged every sheet after this my progress was halting and uneven involuntarily my mind kept on devising plans for making that woman speak or turn her face toward me if she would do the latter i would be satisfied and even if she proved to be an unveiled prophetess of khorassan there would be no further occasion for conjectures and wonderings and i could go on with my work in peace but it made me nervous to remain silent and see that nun sitting there pen in hand but motionless as a post and waiting for me to give her the signal to continue the exercise of the principle to which her existence was now devoted  i went on with my dictation i had left marseilles had touched slightly upon nice and was now traveling by carriage on the cornice road to mentone it was on this road i dictated that an odd incident occurred to me we were nearly opposite the old robber village ofand then i hesitated and stopped i could not remember the name of the village i walked up and down my study rubbing my forehead but the name would not recur to me i was just thinking that i would have to go to the library and look up the name of the village when from out of the depths of the nuns bonnet there came a voice low but distinct and i thought a little impatient and it said eza  eza of course i exclaimedcertainly it is eza how could i have forgotten it i am very much obliged to you for reminding me of the name of that village perhaps you have been there  in answer to this question i received the least little bit of a nod and the nuns pen began gently to paw the paper as if it wanted to go on  i was now really excited she had spoken why should i not do something which should make her turn her face toward mesomething which would take her off her guard as my forgetfulness had just done but no idea came to my aid and i felt obliged to begin to dictate the details of the odd incident when suddenly the door opened sister sarah walked in and the mornings work was over  i had not done much but i had made that nun speak she said eza that was a beginning and i felt confident that i should get on very well in time i was a little sorry that my secretary had been on the cornice road i fancied that she might have been one of those elderly single women who become baedeker tourists and having tired of this sort of thing had concluded to devote her life to the work of the house of martha but this was mere idle conjecture she had spoken and i should not indulge in pessimism  i prepared a very good remark with which to greet the submother on the next morning and although addressing sister sarah i would be in reality speaking to my nun i would say how well i was getting on i had thought of saying we were getting on but reflected afterward that this would never do i was sure that the house of martha would not allow under any circumstances that sister and myself to constitute a we then i would refer to the help my secretary had been to me and endeavor to express the satisfaction which an author must always feel for a suggestion of this kind or any other from one qualified to make them if there was any gratitude or vanity in my nuns heart i felt i could stir it up if sister sarah would listen to me long enough and if gratitude or even vanity could be stirred the rigidity of my nun would be impaired and she might find herself off her guard  but i had no opportunity of making my remark at nine oclock the door of the secretarys room opened the nun entered and the door was then closed and locked sister sarah must have been in a hurry that morning just as well as not i might have made my remark directly to my nun but i did not she walked quickly to the table arranged her paper opened her inkstand and sat down i fancied that i saw a wavy wriggle of impatience in her shawl perhaps she wanted to know the rest of that odd incident near eza it may have been that it was impatient interest which had impaired her rigidity the day before  i went on with the odd incident and made a very good thing of it even when on wellworn routes of travel i tried to confine myself to outoftheway experiences walkirk had been very much interested in this affair when i had told it to him and there was no reason why this nun should not also be interested especially as she had seen eza  i finished the narrative and began another a rather exciting one connected with the breaking of a carriage wheel and an exile from monte carlo but never once did curiosity or any other emotion impair the rigidity of that nun she wrote almost as fast as i could dictate and when i stopped i know she was filled with nervous desire to know what was coming nextat least i fancied that her shawl indicated such nervousness but hesitate as i might or say what i mightand i did say a good many things which almost demanded a remark or answernot one word came from her during the whole morning nor did she ever turn the front of her bonnet toward me     xiii  my friend vespa   i was very much disgusted at the present state of affairs three days had elapsed and i did not know what sort of a human being my secretary was i might as well dictate into a speakingtube a phonograph would be better for although it might seem ridiculous to sit in my room and talk aloud to no one what was i doing now that nun was the same as no one  the next day was sunday and there would be no work and no chance to solve the problem which had become an actual annoyance to me but i did not intend that this problem should continue to annoy me and interfere with my work i am open and aboveboard myself and if my secretary did not choose to be open and aboveboard and behave like an ordinary human being she should depart and i would tell walkirk to get me an ordinary human being capable of writing from dictation or depart himself if he could not provide me with a suitable secretary he was not the efficient man of business that he claimed to be as to the absurdity of dictating to a mystery in a barrow bonnet i would have no more of it  i do not consider myself an illtempered person and my grandmother asserts that i have a very good temper indeed but i must admit that on monday morning i felt a little cross and when sister sarah and the nun entered my antechamber i bade them a very cold goodmorning and allowed the former to go without attempting any conversation whatever the nun having arrived i would not send her away but when the submother came at noon i intended to inform her that i did not any longer desire the services of the writing sister and if she wished to know why i should tell her plainly i would not say that i would as soon dictate to an inanimate treestump but i would express that idea in as courteous terms as possible  for fifteen minutes i let the nun sit and wait if her principles forbade idleness i was glad to have a crack at her principles then i began to dictate steadily and severely i found that the dismissal from my mind of all conjectures regarding the personality of my secretary was of great service to me and i was able to compose much faster than she could write  it was about half past ten i think and the morning was warm and pleasant when there gently sailed into the secretarys room through the open window a wasp i saw him come in and i do not think i ever beheld a more agreeable or benignant insect his large eyes were filled with the light of a fatherly graciousness his semidetached body seemed to quiver with a helpful impulse and his long hind legs hung down beneath him as though they were outstretched to assist befriend or succor with wings waving blessings and a buzz of cheery greeting he sailed around the room now dipping here now there and then circling higher tapping the ceiling with his genial back  the moment the nun saw the wasp a most decided thrill ran down the back of her shawl then it pervaded her bonnet and finally the whole of her as the beneficent insect sailed down near the table she abruptly sprang to her feet and pushed back her chair i advanced to the grating but what could i do seeing me there and doubtless with the desire immediately to assure me of his kindly intentions my friend vespa made a swoop directly at the front of the nuns bonnet  with an undisguised ejaculation and beating wildly at the insect with her hands the nun bounded to one side and turned her face full upon me i stood astounded i forgot the wasp  i totally lost sight of the fact that a young woman was in danger of being badly stung i thought of nothing but that she was a young woman and a most astonishingly pretty one besides  the state of terror she was in opened wide her lovely blue eyes half crimsoned her clear white skin and threw her rosy lips and sparkling teeth into the most enchanting combinations  make it go away she cried throwing up one arm and thereby pushing back her gray bonnet and exhibiting some of the gloss of her light brown hair cant you kill it  most gladly would i have rushed in and shed with my own hands the blood of my friend vespa for the sake of this most charming young woman suddenly transformed from a barrowbonneted principle but i was powerless i could not break through the grating the other door of the secretarys room was locked  dont strike at it i said remain as motionless as you can then perhaps it will fly away striking at a wasp only enrages it  i cant stay quiet she cried nobody could and she sprang behind the table making at the same time another slap at the buzzing insect  you will surely be stung i said if you act in that way if you will slap at the wasp dont use your hand take something with which you can kill it  what can i take she exclaimed now running round the table and stopping close to the grating give me something  i hurriedly glanced around my study i saw nothing that would answer for a weapon but a whisk broom which i seized and endeavored to thrust through the meshes of the grating  oh she cried as the wasp made a desperate dive close to her face give me that quick and she stretched out her hand to me  i cannot i replied i cant push it through it wont go through take your bonnet  at this my nun seized her bonnet by a sort of floating hood which hung around the bottom of it and jerked it from her head bringing with it certain flaps and ligatures and combs which being thus roughly removed allowed a mass of wavy hair to fall about her shoulders  waving her bonnet in her hand like a slungshot she sprang back and waited for the wasp when the buzzing creature came near enough she made a desperate crack at him missing him she struck again and again now high now low she dashed from side to side of the room and with one of her mad sweeps she scattered a dozen pages of manuscript upon the floor  the view of this combat was enrapturing to me the face of my nun now lighted by a passionate determination to kill that wasp was a delight to my eyes if i could have assured myself that the wasp would not sting her i would have helped him to prolong the battle indefinitely but my nun was animated by very different emotions she was bound to be avenged upon the wasp and avenged she was almost springing into the air she made a grand stroke at him as he receded from her hit him and dashed him against the wall he fell to the floor momentarily disabled but flapping and buzzing then down she stooped and with three great whacks with her bonnet she finished the battle the wasp lay motionless  now she said throwing her bonnet upon the table i will close that window and she walked across the room her blue eyes sparkling her face glowing from her violent exercise and her rich brown hair hanging in long waves upon her shoulders  dont do that i said it will make your room too warm there is a netting screen in the corner there if you put that under the sash it will keep out all insects i wish i could do it for you  she took the frame and fitted it under the sash  i am sorry i did not know that before she said as she returned to her table this is a very bad piece of business  i begged her to excuse me for not having informed her of the screen but i did not say that i was sorry for what had occurred i merely expressed my gratification that she had not been stung her chair had been pushed away from the table its back against the wall opposite to me she seated herself upon it gently panting she looked from side to side at the sheets of manuscript scattered upon the floor  i will pick them up presently and go to work but i must rest a minute she did not now seem to consider that it was of the slightest consequence whether i saw her face or not  never mind the papers i said leave them there they can be picked up any time  i wish that were the worst of it and as she spoke she raised her eyes toward me and the least little bit of a smile came upon her lips as if though troubled she could not help feeling the comical absurdity of the situation  it is simply dreadful she continued i dont believe such a thing ever before happened to a sister  there is nothing dreadful about it said i and do you mean to say that the sisters of the house of martha who go out to nurse and do all sorts of good deeds never speak to the people they are befriending nor allow them to look upon their faces  of course said she you have to talk to sick people otherwise how could you know what they need but this is a different case and she began to gather up her hair and twist it at the back of her head  i do not understand i remarked why is it a different case  it is as different as it can be said she picking up her comb from the floor and thrusting it through her hastily twisted knot of hair i should not have come here at all if your grandmother had not positively asserted that there would be nothing for me to do but to listen and to write and mother anastasia and sister sarah both of them especially instructed me that i was not to speak to you nor to look at you but simply to sit at the table and work for the good of the cause that was all i had to do and i am sure i obeyed just as strictly as anybody could except once when you forgot the name of eza and i was so anxious to have you go on with the incident that i could not help mentioning it and now i am sure i dont know what i ought to do  do i asked there is nothing to do except to begin writing where you left off the wasp is dead  i wish it had never been born she said i have no doubt that the whole affair should come to an end now and that i ought to go home but i cant do that until sister sarah comes to unlock the door and so i suppose we had better go to work  we i would not have dared to use that word but it fell from her lips in the easiest and most conventional manner possible it was delightful to hear it i never knew before what a pleasant sound the word had she now set herself to work to gather up the papers from the floor and having arranged them in their proper order she took up her bonnet  do you have to wear that i asked  certainly she answered clapping it on and pulling it well forward  i should think it would be very hot and uncomfortable i remarked  it is she admitted curtly and seating herself at the table she took up her pen  i now perceived that if i knew what was good for myself i would cease from speaking on ordinary topics and go on with my dictation this i did giving out my sentences as rapidly as possible although i must admit i took no interest whatever in what i was saying nor do i believe that my secretary was interested in the subjectmatter of my work she wrote rapidly and as well as i could judge appeared excited and annoyed i was excited also but not in the least disturbed my emotions were of a highly pleasing character we worked steadily for some twenty minutes when suddenly she stopped and laid down her pen  of course it isnt right to speak she said turning in her chair and speaking to me face to face as one human being to another but as i have said so much already i dont suppose a little more will make matters worse and i must ask somebodys help in making up my mind what i ought to do i suspect i have made all sorts of mistakes in this writing but i could not keep my thoughts on my work i have been trying my best to decide how i ought to act but i cannot make up my mind  i shall be delighted to help you if i can i ventured whats the point that you cannot decide  it is just this she replied fixing her blue eyes upon me with earnest frankness am i to tell the sisters what has happened or not if i tell them i know exactly what will be the result i shall come here no more and i shall have to take sister hannahs place at the measles refuge theres nothing in this world that i hate like measles ive had them but that doesnt make the slightest difference sister hannah has asked to be relieved and i know she wants this place dreadfully  she cannot come here i exclaimed i dont believe i ever had the measles and i will not have them  she is a stenographer said she and she will most certainly be ordered to take my place if i make known what i have done today  supposing you were sure that you were not obliged to go to the measles refuge i asked should you still regret giving up this position  of course i should she answered promptly i must work at something or i cannot stay in the house of martha and there is no work which i like so well as this it interests me extremely  now hear me said i speaking perhaps a little too earnestly and i do not believe any one could give you better advice than i am going to give you what has occurred this morning was strictly and absolutely an accident a wasp came in at the window and tried to sting you and there is no woman in the world be she a sister or not who could sit still and let a wasp sting her  no she interrupted i dont believe mother anastasia could do it  and what followed i continued was perfectly natural and could not possibly be helped you were obliged to defend yourself and in so doing you were obliged to act just as any other woman would act nothing else would have been possible and the talking and all that came in with the rest you couldnt help it  thats the way the matter appeared to me said she but the question would arise if it were all right why should i hesitate to tell the sisters  hesitate i exclaimed you should not even think of such a thing no matter what the sisters really thought about it i am sure they would not let you come here any more and you would be sent to the measles institution and thus actually be punished for the attempted wickedness of a wasp  but there is the other side of the matter said she would it not be wicked in me not to tell them  not at all i replied you do not repeat to the sisters all that i tell you to write  of course not she interrupted  and you do not consider it your duty i continued to relate every detail of the business in which you are employed  no she said they ask me some things and some things i have mentioned to them such as not having a gold pen  very good said i you should consider that defending yourself against wasps is just as much your business here as anything else if you are stung it is plain you cant write and the interests of your employer and of the house of martha must suffer  yes she assented still with the steady gaze of her blue eyes  now your duty is clear i went on if the sisters ask you if a wasp flew into your room and tried to sting you and you had to jump around and kill it and speak before you could go on with your work why of course you must tell them but if they dont ask you dont tell them it may seem ridiculous to you i continued hurriedly to suppose that they would ask such a question but i put it in this way to show you the principle of the thing  she withdrew her eyes from my face and fixed them upon the floor  the truth of the matter is she said presently that i havent done anything wrong at least i didnt intend to i might have crouched down in the corner with my face to the wall and have covered my head and hands with my shawl but i should have been obliged to stay there until sister sarah came and i should have been smothered to death and besides i didnt think of it so what i did do was the only thing i could do and i do not think i ought to be punished for it  now it is settled i said your duty is to work here for the benefit of your sisterhood and you should not allow a wasp or any insect to interfere with it  she looked at me and smiled a little abstractedly then she turned to the table  i will go on with my work she said and i will not say anything to the sisters until i have given the matter most earnest and careful consideration i can do that a great deal better at home than i can here  it was very well that she stopped talking and applied herself to her work for i do not believe it was ten minutes afterward when sister sarah unlocked the door and came in to take her away     xiv  i favor permanency in office   as soon as my secretary had gone i went into her room and looked for my friend vespa i found him on the floor quite dead but not demolished picking him up and carrying him to my study i carefully gummed him to a card under his motionless form i wrote the good services of this friend i shall ever keep in grateful remembrance then i pinned the card to the wall between two bookcases  during the rest of that day i found myself in a state of unreasonable exaltation several times i put to myself the questions why is it that you feel so cheerful and so gay why have you the inclination to whistle and to dance in your room why do you light a cigar and let it go out through forgetfulness why do you answer your grandmother at random and feel an inclination to take a long walk by yourself although you know there are people invited to an afternoon tea  i was not able to give an adequate answer to these questions nor did i very much care to i knew that my high spirits were caused by the discoveries the good vespa had enabled me to make and the fact that this reason could not be proved adequate did not trouble me at all but prudence and a regard for my own interests made it very plain to me that other people should not know i had been exalted and how if i desired my nun to continue as my secretary i must not let any one know that i cared in the least to hear her voice or to have the front of her bonnet turned towards me  at dinner that day my grandmother remarked to me  are you still satisfied with the house of marthas sister does she do your work as you wish to have it done  i leaned back in my chair and answered with deliberation  yes i think she will do very well and that after more practice she will do better as it is she is industrious and attentive i place great stress upon that point for i do not like to repeat my sentences but she has a quick ear and catches every word  then asked my grandmother you do not wish to make a change at present  oh no i said it would be very annoying to begin again with a new amanuensis i am getting accustomed to this person and that is a very important matter with me so i do not wish to make any change so long as this sister does her work properly  i must say resumed my grandmother after a little pause in which she seemed to be considering the subject that i was not altogether in favor of that young woman taking the position of your secretary she can have had but little experience and i thought that an older and steadier person would answer your purpose much better but this one was unemployed at the time and wished very much to do literary work and as the institution needed the money you would pay which would probably amount to a considerable sum if your book should be a long one and as you were in a great hurry and might engage some one from the city if one of the martha sisters were not immediately available mother anastasia and i concluded that it would be well to send this young person until one of the older sisters competent for the work should be disengaged i thought you would be very anxious to have this change made as soon as possible so that you might feel that you had a permanent secretary  oh no said i trying very hard not to appear too much in earnest this person is very steady and there is a certain advantage in her being young without much experience as a secretary i wish any one who writes for me to work in my way and if such a person has been accustomed to work in other peoples ways annoyance and interruption must surely result and that i wish very much to avoid a secretary should be a mere writingmachine and i do not believe an elderly person could be that she would be sure to have notions how my work should or should not be done and in some way or other would make those notions evident  i dont quite agree with you said my grandmother but of course you know your own business better than i do and i suppose after all it doesnt make much difference whether the sister is young or not they all dress alike and all look ugly alike i dont suppose there would be anything attractive about the venus de milo if she wore a coalscuttle bonnet and a gray woolen shawl  no i answered especially if she kept the opening of her coalscuttle turned down over her paper as if she were about to empty coals upon it  thats very proper said my grandmother speaking a little more briskly all she has to do is to keep her eyes on her work and i suppose from what you say that the flaps of her bonnet do not interfere with her keeping her ears on you but if at any time you desire to make a change all you have to do is to let me know and i can easily arrange the matter  i promised that i would certainly let her know in case i had such a desire  that evening walkirk remarked to me that he thought nothing could be more satisfactory for me than to have on tap so to speak an institution like the house of martha from which i could draw a secretary whenever i wanted one and keep her for as long or as short a time as pleased me and to have this supply in the immediate neighborhood was an extraordinary advantage  i agreed that the arrangement was a very good one and i think he was about to ask some questions in regard to my nun but i began my recital and cut off any further conversation on the subject  my monologue was rather disjointed that evening for my mind was occupied with other things or more strictly speaking another thing i felt quite sure however that walkirk did not notice my preoccupation for he gave the same earnest and interested attention to my descriptions which he had always shown and which made him such an agreeable and valuable listener indeed his manner put me at my ease because on account of the wandering of my mind his general expression indicated that if i found it necessary to pause in order that i might arrange what i should say next he was very glad of the opportunity thus given him to reflect upon what i had just said he was an admirable listener     xv  how we went back to genoa   the next morning i awaited with considerable perturbation of mind the arrival of my nun i felt assured that after the occurrences of the previous day there must certainly be some sort of a change in her she could not go on exactly as she had gone on before the nature of this anticipated change concerned me very muchtoo much i assured myself would she be more rigid and repellent than she had been before the advent of the wasp but this would be impossible on the other hand would she be more like other people would she relax a little and work like common secretaries orand i whistled as i thought of ithaving once done so would she permanently cut loose from the absurdities enjoined upon her by the house of martha people and look at me and talk to me in the free honest ingenuous frank sincere and thoroughly sensible manner in which she had spoken to me the day before  after revolving these questions in my mind for some time another one rudely thrust itself upon me would she come at all it was already seven minutes past nine she had never been so late now that i came to think of it this would be the most natural result of the wasp business the thought shocked me i ceased to walk up and down my study and stopped whistling i think my face must have flushed i know my pulse beat faster my eyes fell upon the body of him who i believed had been my friend i felt like crushing his remains with my fist he had been my enemy he had shown me what i had to lose and he had made me lose it  even in the midst of my agitation this thought made me smile how much i was making of this affair of my secretary what difference after allbut i did not continue the latter question it did make a difference and it was of no use to reason about it what was i to do about it that was more to the point  at this instant my nun followed by sister sarah entered the adjoining room the latter merely bowed to me went out and locked the door behind her i was very glad she did not speak to me for the sudden revulsion of feeling produced by the appearance of the two would have prevented my answering her coherently i do not know whether my nun bowed or not if she did the motion was very slight she took her seat and prepared for work i did not say anything for i did not know what to say the proper thing to do in order to relieve my embarrassment and hersthat is if she had anywas to begin work at once but for the life of me i could not remember whether my dictation of the day before concerned sicily or egypt i did not like to ask her for that would seem like a trick to make her speak  but it would not do to keep her sitting there with an idle pen in her hand i must say something so i blurted out some remarks concerning the effect of the climate of the mediterranean upon travelers from northern countries and while doing this i tried my best to remember where on the shores of this confounded sea i had been the day before  philosophizing and generalizing were however not in my line i was accustomed to deal with action and definite observation and i soon dropped the climate of the mediterranean and went to work on some of the soulharrowing improvements in the eternal city alluding with particular warmth to the banishment of the models from the spanish stairs now the work went on easily but i was gloomy and depressed my nun sat at the table more like a stiff grayenveloped principle than ever before i did not feel at liberty even to make a remark about the temperature of the room i feared that whatever i said might be construed into an attempt to presume upon the accidental intercourse of the day before  for half an hour or more she went on with the work but during a pause in my dictation she sat up straight in her chair and laid down her pen then without turning her face to me she began to speak i stood openmouthed and i need not say delighted whatever her words might be it rejoiced me to hear them to know that she voluntarily recognized my existence and desired to communicate with me  i have spoken to mother anastasia she said her voice directed towards the screen in the open window and i told her that it was impossible for me to work without sometimes saying a few words to ask for what i need or to request you to repeat a word which i did not catch since i began to write i have lost no less than twentythree words i have left blanks for them and made memoranda of the pages but as i said to her if this sort of thing went on you would forget what words you had intended to use and when you came to read the manuscript you could not supply them and that therefore i was not doing my work properly and honestly earning the money which would be paid to the institution i also told her that you sometimes forgot where you left off the day before and that i ought to read you a few lines of what i had last written in order that you might make the proper connection i think this is very necessary for today you have left an awful gap yesterday we were writing about that old crusaders bank in genoa and now you are at work at rome when we havent even started for that city  each use of this word we was to me like a strain of music from the heavens  do you think i did right she added  right i exclaimed most assuredly you did nothing could be more helpful and in fact more necessary than to let me know just where i left off what did the sisters say  i spoke only to mother anastasia she replied she considered the matter a little while and then said that she could see there must be times when you would require some information from me in regard to the work and that there could be no reasonable objection to my giving such information but she reminded me that the laws of the house of martha require that the sisters must give their sole attention to the labor upon which they are employed and must not indulge when so engaged in any conversation even among themselves that is not absolutely necessary  mother anastasia is very sensible said i and if i were to see her i should be happy to express my appreciation of her good advice upon the subject and by the way did she tell you that it was necessary to wear that hot bonnet while you are working  she did not say anything about it she answered it was not needful we always wear our bonnets outside of the house of martha  i was about to make a further remark upon the subject but restrained myself it was incumbent on me to be very prudent there was a pause and then she spoke again  you are not likely to see mother anastasia she said but please do not say anything on the subject to sister sarah she is very rigorous and would not approve of talking under any circumstances in fact she does not approve of my coming here at all  what earthly reason can she have for that i asked  she thinks its nonsensical for you to have a secretary she answered and that it would be much better for you to do your own work and make a gift of the money to the institution and then i could go and learn to be a nurse i only mention these things to show you that it would be well not to talk to her of mother anastasias good sense  you may rest assured said i that i shall not say a word to her  and now said she shall we put aside what i have written today and go back to genoa the last thing you dictated yesterday was this into this very building once came the old crusaders to borrow money for their journeys to the holy land  we went to genoa  how admirably i exclaimed when she had gone with what wonderful tact and skill she has managed the whole affair not one word about the occurrences of yesterday not an allusion which could embarrass either herself or me if only she had looked at me but she had probably received instructions on that point which she did not mention and it is easy to perceive that she is honest and conscientious  but after all it was not necessary that i should see her face i had seen it and i could never forget it  whistling was not enough for me that day i sang  what puts you into such remarkably good spirits asked my grandmother have you reached an unusually interesting part of your work  indeed i have i answered and i gave her such a glowing account of the way the red cross knights the white cross knights and the black cross knights clanked through the streets of genoa before setting sail to battle for the great cross that the cheeks of the old lady flushed and her eyes sparkled with enthusiastic emotion  i dont wonder it kindles your soul to write about such things she said     xvi  i run upon a sandbar   day by day the interest of my nun in her work appeared to increase every morning so soon as she sat down at her table she read to me the concluding portion of what had been written the day before and if a sunday intervened she gave me a page or more her interest was manifested in various ways several times she so far forgot the instructions she must have received as to turn her face towards me when asking me to repeat something that she did not catch and on such occasions i could not for some moments remember what i had said or indeed what i was about to say  once she stopped writing and turning half round in her chair looked fairly at me and said that she thought i had made a mistake in saying that visitors were not allowed to go up the tower of pisa without a guide for she with two other ladies had gone to the top without any one accompanying them but she thought it was very wrong to allow people to do this and that i should be doing a service to travelers if i were to say something on the subject  of course i replied that i would make the correction and that i would say something about the carelessness to which she referred then there ensued a pause during which she turned her face towards the window imagining i have no doubt that i was busy endeavoring to compose something suitable to say upon the subject but i was not thinking of anything of the sort i was allowing my mind to revel in the delight which i had had in looking at her while she spoke when her pen began to scratch impatiently upon the paper i plunged into some sort of a homily on the laxity of vigilance in leaning towers but even while dictating this i was wondering what she would look like if instead of that gray shawl and gown she were arrayed in one of the charming costumes which often make even ordinary young ladies so attractive  as our daily work went on my nun relaxed more frequently her proscribed rigidity and became more and more like an ordinary person when she looked at me or spoke she always did so in such an unpremeditated manner and with such an obvious good reason that i could not determine whether her change of manner was due to accumulative forgetfulness or to a conviction that it was absurd to continue to act a part which was not only unnatural under the circumstances but which positively interfered with the work in hand some of her suggestions were of the greatest service but i fear that the value of what she said was not as fully appreciated as was the pleasure of seeing and hearing her say it  thus joyously passed the hours of work and in the hours when i was not working i looked forward with glad anticipation to the next forenoon but after a time i began to be somewhat oppressed by the fear that my work would come to an end before long for want of material i was already nearing the southern limit of my travels and my return northward had not been productive of the sort of subjectmatter i desired in my recitals to walkirk i had gone much more into detail regarding my experiences and had talked about a great many things which it had been pleasant to talk about but which i did not consider good enough to put into my book in dictating to my nun i had carefully sifted the mass to which walkirk had listened and had used only such matter as i thought would interest her and the general reader my high regard for the intelligence of my secretary and her powers of appreciation had led me to discard too much and therefore there was danger that my supply of subjectmatter would give out before my nun grew to be an elderly woman and this i did not desire  i had read and heard enough of the travels of others to be able to continue my descriptions of foreign countries for an indefinite period but i had determined from the first that nothing should go into my book except my own actual experiences and therefore i could not rely upon other books for the benefit of mine but in considering the matter i concluded that if my material should be entirely my own it would answer my purpose to make that material what i pleased and thus it happened that i determined to weave a story into my narrative this plan i assured myself would be in perfect harmony with the design of my work the characters could be drawn from the people whom i had met in my travels the scenes could be those which i had visited and the plot and tone of the story could be made to aid the reader in understanding the nature of the country and the people of which it was told more than all i could make the story as long as i pleased  this was a capital idea and i began immediately to work upon it i managed the story very deftly at least that was my opinion my two principal characters made their appearance in sicily and at first were so intermingled with scenery and incidents as not to be very prominent then they came more to the front and other characters introduced themselves upon occasion as these personages appeared and reappeared i hoped that they would gradually surround themselves with an interest which would steadily increase the desire to know more and more about them thus as i went on i said less and less about sicily and more and more about my characters especially the young man and the young woman the curious blending of whose lives i was endeavoring to depict  this went on very smoothly for a few days and then about eleven oclock one morning my nun suddenly leaned back in her chair and laid down her pen  i cannot write any more of this she said looking out of the window  i was so astonished that i could scarcely ask her what she meant  this is lovemaking she continued and with lovemaking the sisters of the house of martha can have nothing to do it is one of our principal rules that we must not think about it read about it or talk about it and of course it would have been forbidden to write about it if such a contingency had ever been thought of therefore i cannot do any more work of that kind  in vain i expostulated in vain i told her that this was the most important part of my book in vain i declaimed about the absurdity of such a regulation in vain i protested in vain i reasoned she shook her head and said there was no use talking about it she knew the rules and should obey them  i had been standing near the grating but now i threw myself into a chair and sat silent wondering what i should do must i give up this most admirable plan of carrying on my work simply because those foolish sisters had made absurd rules for themselves must i wind up my book for want of material not for a moment did i think of getting another secretary or of selecting some other sort of that stuff which literary people call padding for the purpose of prolonging my pleasant labors i was becoming interested in the lovestory i had begun and i wanted to go on with it and i believed also that it would be of great advantage to my book but on the other hand it was plain that my nun would not write this story and it was quite as plain to me that i could not insist upon anything which would cause her to leave me  dont you think she said presently still looking towards the window that we had better do some sort of work for the rest of the morning it is not right for me to sit here idle suppose you try to supply some of the words which were left out of the manuscript in the first days of my writing for you  very well said i and taking up her memoranda she began to look for the vacant spaces which she had left in the manuscript pages i supplied very few words for to save my life i could not at this moment bring my mind to bear upon such trifles but it was pretense of work and better than embarrassing idleness before my secretary left me i must think of something to say to her in regard to the work for tomorrow but what should i say should i tell her i would drop the story or that i would modify it so as to make it feasible for her to write something must quickly be decided upon and while i was tumultuously revolving the matter in my mind twelve oclock and the submother came my secretary went away with nothing but the little bow which she was accustomed to make when leaving the room     xvii  regarding the elucidation of national characteristics   i was left in my study in a very unpleasant state of mind i was agitated and apprehensive perhaps that young woman would not come any more i had not told her that i was going to stop writing about love and there was every reason to suppose she would not return what an imbecile i had been i had done nothing because i could not think of exactly the right thing to do  i now felt that i must ask the advice of somebody in regard to this embarrassing and important affair for a moment i thought of my grandmother but she would be sure to begin by advising me to change my secretary she seldom urged me to do what i did not want to do but if i offered her a chance to give me advice on this occasion i knew what would be uppermost in her mind  so i put on my hat and went to walkirk at the inn i found him at work on a mass of accounts dating back for years which i had given him to adjust with great circumspection i laid before him this new affair  you see said i she is a firstclass secretary she has learned to do my work as i like it done and i do not wish to make a change and on the other hand i do not care to alter the plan of my book  walkirk was always very respectful but he could not restrain a smile at the situation  it does seem to me he said a very funny thing to dictate a lovestory to one of the sisters of the house of martha of course they are not nuns they are not even roman catholics but they are just as strict and straitlaced about certain things as if their house were really a convent so far as i can see there is but one thing to do and that is to confine yourself to descriptions of travel and perhaps it would be well to let your secretary know in some way that you intend to do so otherwise i think she may throw up the business and that would be a pity  it sometimes surprises me to discover what an obstinate person i am when i want to do a thing it is very difficult for me to change my mind  she must not throw up the business i said and i do not see how i can leave out the story i have planned it far ahead and to discard it i should have to go back and cut and mangle a great deal of good work that i have done  walkirk reflected  i admit he replied that that would be very discouraging perhaps we can think of some plan of getting out of the difficulty  i hope you can do that said i for i cannot  how would this do he asked presently suppose i go and see mother anastasia this afternoon and try and make her look at this matter from a strictly business point of view i can tell her that the sort of thing you are doing is purely literature that you cant keep such things out of literature and that the people who engage in the mechanical work of literature cannot help running against those things at one time or another i can try to make her understand what an advantageous connection this is and what a great injury to the house of martha it would be if it should be broken off i can tell her that it is not improbable that you may take to writing as a regular business and that you may give profitable employment to the sisters for years and years there are a good many other things i might say and you may be sure i shall do my very best  go i said but be very careful about what you say dont make her think that i am too anxious to retain this particular sister but make her understand that i do not wish to begin all over again with another one also do not insist too strongly on my desire to write a lovestory but put it to her that when i plan out work of course i want to do the work as i have planned it try to keep these important points in your mind then you can urge common sense upon her as much as you please  i sent a note to my grandmother saying that i should not be home to luncheon and after having taken a bite at the inn i set out for a long walk it was simply impossible for me to talk about common things until this matter was settled  it was about the middle of the afternoon when i returned to the inn and walkirk had not come back i went away again took a turn through the woods and on approaching the inn i saw him walking down the shady road which led from the house of martha i hurried to meet him  so soon as he was near enough walkirk with a beaming face called out  all right sir i have settled that little matter for you  how what i exclaimed what have you done  we had now reached each other and stood together by the side of the road  well said my understudy i have seen mother anastasia and i have found her a very sensible womanan admirable woman i assure you she was a good deal surprised when i told her my errand for that was the first she had heard of the lovestory in fact i suppose your secretary had not had time to tell her about it she commended the sister highly for her refusal to write it saying that her action was in strict accordance with the spirit of their rules when she had finished saying all she had to say on that point i presented your side of the question and i assure you sir that i clapped on it a very bright light so that if she did not see its strong points the fault must be in her own eyes as the event proved there was nothing the matter with her eyes i shall not try to repeat what i said but i began by explaining to her the nature of your work and showed her how impossible it was for you to write about foreign countries without referring to their people and how you could not speak of the people without mentioning their peculiar manners and customs and that this story was nothing more nor less than an interweaving of some of the characteristics of the people of sicily with the descriptions of the country thus much i inferred from your remarks about the story  i persisted that although such characteristics had no connection with the life of the sisters of the house of martha they were a part of the world which you were describing and that it could be no more harm for a sister working for wages and the good of the cause to assist in that description than it would be for one of them to make lace to be worn at a wedding a ceremony with which the sisters could have nothing to do and which in connection with themselves they could not even think about this point made an impression on mother anastasia and having thought about it a minute or two she said there was a certain force in it  then she asked me if this narrative of yours was a strongly accentuated lovestory here she had me at a disadvantage for i have not heard it but i assured her that knowing the scope and purpose of your work i did not believe that you would accentuate any portion of it more than was absolutely necessary  after some silent consideration mother anastasia said she would go and speak with the sister who had been doing your work she was gone a good whileat least it seemed so to me and when she came back she said that she had been making inquiries of the sister and had come to the conclusion that there was no good reason why the house of martha should not continue to assist you in the preparation of your book  did she say she would send the same sister i asked quickly  no she did not answered walkirk but not wishing to put the question too pointedly i first thanked her on your behalf for the kindly consideration she had given the matter i then remarkedwithout intimating that you said anything about itthat i hoped nothing would occur to retard the progress of the work and that the present arrangement might continue without changes of any kind because i knew that when you were dictating your mind was completely absorbed by your mental labors and that any alteration in your hours of work or the necessity of explaining your methods to a new amanuensis annoyed and impeded you to this she replied it was quite natural you should not desire changes and that everything should go on as before  walkirk i exclaimed you are a trump in my exuberant satisfaction i would have clapped him on the back but it would not do to be so familiar with an understudy and besides i did not wish him to understand the extent of my delight at the result of his mission that sort of thing i liked to keep to myself     xviii  an illegible word   every morning there seemed to be some reason or other why i should anticipate with an animated interest the coming of my secretary and on the morning after what i might call her strike the animation of said interest was very apparent to me but i hope not to any one else over and over i said to myself that i must not let my nun see that i was greatly pleased with walkirks intervention it would be wise to take the result as a matter of course  as the clock struck nine she and sister sarah entered the anteroom and the latter advanced to the grating and looked into my study peering from side to side i did not like this sisters face she looked as if she had grown unpleasantly plump on watered milk  is it necessary she asked that you should smoke tobacco during your working hours  i never do it i replied indignantlynever  several times she said i have thought i perceived the smell of tobacco smoke in this sisters garments  you are utterly mistaken i exclaimed during the hours of work these rooms are perfectly free from anything of the sort  she gave a little grunt and departed and when she had locked the door i could not restrain a slight ejaculation of annoyance  you must not mind sister sarah said the sweet voice of my nun behind the barricade of her bonnet she is as mad as hops this morning  what is the matter with her i asked my angry feelings disappearing in an instant  she and mother anastasia have had a long discussion about the message you sent in regard to my keeping on with the story sister sarah is very much opposed to my doing your writing at all  well as she is not the head of your house i suppose we need not trouble ourselves about that i replied but how does the arrangement suit you are you satisfied to continue to write my little story  satisfied she said i am perfectly delighted and as she spoke she turned toward me her eyes sparkling and her face lighted by the most entrancing smile i ever beheld on the countenance of woman this is a thousand times more interesting than anything you have done yet although i liked the rest very much of course i stopped when i supposed it was against our rules to continue but now that i know it is all right i ambut no matter let us go on with it this is what i last wrote and she read tomaso and the pretty lucilla now seated themselves on the rock by a little spring he was trying to look into her lovely blue eyes which were slightly turned away from him and veiled by their long lashes there was something he must say to her and he felt he could wait no longer gently he took the little hand which lay nearest him andthere is where i stopped she said and then her face still bright but with the smile succeeded by an air of earnest consideration she asked do you object to suggestions  not at all said i when they are to the point they help me  well then she said i wouldnt have her eyes blue italian girls nearly always have black or brown eyes it is hard to think of this girl as a blonde  oh but her eyes are blue i said it would not do at all to have them anything else some italian girls are that way at any rate i couldnt alter her in my mind  perhaps not she replied but in thinking about her she always seems to me to have black eyes however that is a matter of no importance and i am ready to go on  thus on matters strictly connected with business my nun and i conversed and then we went on with our work i think that from the very beginnings of literature there could have been no author who derived from his labors more absolute pleasure than i derived from mine never was a story more interesting to tell than the story of tomaso and lucilla it proved to be a very long one much longer than i had supposed i could make it and sometimes i felt that it was due to the general character of my book that i should occasionally insert some description of scenery or instances of travel  my secretary wrote as fast as i could dictate and sometimes wished i think that i would dictate faster she seldom made comments unless she thought it absolutely necessary to do so but there were certain twitches and movements of her head and shoulders which might indicate emotions such as pleasant excitement at the sudden development of the situation or impatience at my delay in the delivery of interesting passages and i imagined that during the interpolation of descriptive matter she appeared to be anxious to get through with it as quickly as possible and to go on with the story  it was my wish to make my book a very large one it was therefore desirable to be economical with the material i had left and to eke it out as much as i could with fiction but upon considering the matter i became convinced that it could not be very long before the material which in any way could be connected with the story must give out and that therefore it would have to come to an end how i wished i had spent more time in sicily i would have liked to write a whole book about sicily  of course i might take the lovers to other countries but i had not planned anything of this kind and it would require some time to work it out now however a good idea occurred to me which would postpone the conclusion of the interesting portion of my work i would have my secretary read what she had written this would give me time to think out more of the story and it is often important that an author should know what he has done before he goes on to do more we had arrived at a point where the narrative could easily stop for a while tomaso having gone on a fishing voyage and the middleaged innkeeper whose union with lucilla was favored by her mother and the village priest having departed for naples to assume the guardianship of two very handsome young women the daughters of an old friend recently deceased  when i communicated to my nun my desire to change her work from writing to reading she seemed surprised and asked if there were not danger that i might forget how i intended to end the story i reassured her on this point and she appeared to resign herself to the situation  shall i begin with the first page of the manuscript said she or read only what i have written  oh begin at the very beginning i said i want to hear it all  then she began hesitating a little at times over the variable chirography of my first amanuensis i drew up my chair near to the grating but before she had read two pages i asked her to stop for a moment  i think said i it will be impossible for me to get a clear idea of what you are reading unless you turn and speak in my direction you see the sides of your bonnet interfere very much with my hearing what you say  for a few moments she remained in her ordinary position and then she slowly turned her chair toward me i am sure she had received instructions against looking into my study which was filled with objects calculated to attract the attention of an intelligent and cultivated person then she read the manuscript and as she did so i said to myself over and over again that for her to read to me was a thousand times more agreeable than for me to dictate to her  as she read her eyes were cast down on the pages which she held in her hand but frequently when i made a correction they were raised to mine as she endeavored to understand exactly what i wanted her to do i made a good many alterations which i think improved the work very much  once she found it utterly impossible to decipher a certain word of the manuscript she scrutinized it earnestly and then her mind entirely occupied by her desire properly to read the matter she rose and came close to the grating holding the page so that i could see it  can you make out this word she asked i cannot imagine how any one could write so carelessly  i sprang to my feet and stood close to the grating i could not take the paper from her and it was necessary for her to hold it i examined the word letter by letter i gave my opinion of each letter and i asked her opinion it was a most illegible word a good many things interfered with my comprehension of it among these were the two hands with which she held up the page and another was the idea which came to me that in the house of martha the sisters were fed on violets i am generally quite apt at deciphering bad writing but never before had i shown myself so slow and obtuse at this sort of thing  suddenly a thought struck me i glanced at the clock in my study it wanted ten minutes of twelve  it must be said i that that word is intended to be heavengivenat any rate we will make it that and now i think i will get you to copy the last part of that page you can do it on the back of the sheet  she was engaged in this writing when sister sarah came in     xix  gray ice   during the engagement of my present secretary a question had frequently arisen in my mind which i wished to have answered but which i had hesitated to ask for fear the sister should imagine it indicated too much personal interest in her this question related to her name and now it was really necessary for me to know it i did not wish any longer to speak to her as if she were merely a principle she had become a most decided entity however harsh and gray and woolly her name might be i wanted to know it and to hear it from her own lips the next morning i asked her what it was  she was sitting at the table arranging the pages she was going to read and at the question she turned toward me her face was flushed but not i think with displeasure  do you know she said it has seemed to me the funniest thing in the world that you have never cared the least bit to know my name  i did care i replied in fact it was awkward not to know it but of course i did not want tointerfere in any way with the rules of your establishment  ah she said i have noticed your extreme solicitude in regard to our rules but there is no rule against telling our names mine is sister hagar  hagar i exclaimed you do not mean that is your real name  it is the name given me by the house of martha she answered there is a list of names by which the sisters must be called and as we enter the institution we take the names in their order on the list hagar came to me  i shall not call you by that said i and we may as well go on with our work  i was anxious to have her read and to forget that she was called hagar  she was a long time arranging the manuscript and putting the pages in order i did not hurry her but i could not see any reason for so much preparation presently she said still arranging the sheets and with her head bent slightly over her work i dont know whether or not i ought to tell you but i dislike to be called hagar the next name on the list is rebecca and i am willing to take that but the rules of the house do not allow us to skip an unappropriated name and permit no choosing however mother anastasia has not pressed the matter and although i am entered as sister hagar the sisters do not call me by that name  what do they call you  oh they simply use the name that was mine before i entered the house of martha said she  and what is that i asked quickly  ah said my nun pushing her sheets into a compact pile and thumping their edges on the table to make them even to talk about that would be decidedly against the rules of the institutionand now i am ready to read  thus did she punish me for what she considered my want of curiosity or interest i knew it as well as if she had told me so i accepted the rebuff and said no more and she went on with her reading  on this and the following day i became aware how infinitely more pleasant it was to listen than to be listened toat least under certain circumstances i considered it wonderfully fortunate to be able to talk to such an admirable listener as walkirk but to sit and hear my nun read to watch the charming play of her mouth and the occasional flush of a smile when she came to something exciting or humorous to look into the blue of her eyes as she raised them to me while i considered an alteration was to me an overwhelming rapturei could call it nothing less but by the end of the third morning of reading my good sense told me that this sort of thing could not go on and it would be judicious for me to begin again my dictation and to let my secretary confine herself to her writing the fact that on any morning i had not allowed her to read until the hour of noon was an additional proof that my decision was a wise one  the story of tomaso and lucilla now went bravely on with enough groundwork of foreign land for the characters to stand on and i tried very hard to keep my mind on the writing of my book and away from its writer outwardly i may have appeared to succeed fairly well in this purpose but inwardly the case was different however if i could suppress any manifestations of my emotions i told myself i ought to be satisfied  a few mornings after the recommencement of the dictation i was a little late in entering my study and i found my secretary already at the table in the anteroom in answer to my morning salutation she merely bowed and sat ready for work she did not even offer to read what she had last written this surprised me was she resenting what she might look upon as undue stiffness and reserve if so i was very sorry but at the same time i would meet her on her own ground if she chose to return to her old rigidity i would accept the situation and be as formal as she liked  more than this i began to feel a little resentment i would revert not only to my former manner but to my former matter i would wind up that lovestory and confine myself to the subject of foreign travel  acting on this resolution i made short work of tomaso and lucilla the former determined not to think of marriage until he was several years older and had acquired the necessary means to support a wife and lucilla accepted the advice of her mother and the priest and obtained a situation in a lacemaking establishment in venice where she resolved to work industriously until the middleaged innkeeper had made up his mind whether or not he would marry one of the handsome girls to whom he had become guardian  to this very prosaic conclusion of the lovestory i added some remarks intended as an apology for introducing such a story into my sketches of travel and showing how the little narrative brought into view some of the characteristics of the people of sicily after that i discoursed of the present commerce of italy as compared with that of the middle ages  my secretary took no notice whatever of my change of subject but went on writing as i dictated this apathy at last became so annoying to me that excusing myself i left my study before the hour of noon  it is impossible for me to say how the events or rather the want of events of that morning disturbed my mind by turns i was angry i was grieved i was regretful i was resentful it is so easy sometimes for one person with the utmost placidity to throw another person into a state of mental agitation and this i think is especially noticeable when the placid party is a woman  as the day wore on my disquiet of mind and body and general ill humor did not abate and wishing that other people should not notice my unusual state of mind i took an early afternoon train to the city leaving a note for walkirk informing him that his services as listener would not be needed that evening the rest of that day i spent at my club where fortunately for my mood i met only a few old fellows who could not get out of town in the summer and who had learned from long practice to be quite sufficient unto themselves seated in a corner of the large readingroom i spent the evening smoking holding in my hand an unread newspaper and asking myself mental questions  i inquired why in the name of common sense i allowed myself to be so disturbed by the conduct of an amanuensis paid by the day and moreover a member of a religious order i inquired why the fates should have so ordered it that this perfectly charming young woman should suddenly have become frozen into a mass of gray ice i inquired if i had inadvertently done or said anything which would naturally wound the feelings or arouse the resentment of a sister of the house of martha i inquired if there could be any reasonable excuse for a girl who on account of an omission or delay in asking her name would assume a manner of austere rudeness to a gentleman who had always treated her with scrupulous courtesy finally i asked myself why it was that i persisted and persisted and persisted in thinking about a thing like this when my judgment told me that i should instantly dismiss the whole affair from my mind and employ my thoughts on something sensible and to this i gave the only answer which i made to any of the inquiries i had put to myself that was that i did not know why this was so but it was so and there was no help for it  walking home from the station quite late at night the question which had so much troubled me suddenly resolved itself and i became convinced that the change in the manner of my secretary was due to increased pressure of the rules of the house of martha i would not i could not believe that a fit of pique occasioned by my apparent want of interest in her could make her thus cold and even rude she was not the kind of girl to do this thing of her own volition it was those wretched rules and if they were to be enforced in this way the head of the house of martha should know that i considered the act a positive discourtesy if nothing more  i was angrythat was not to be wondered at but it was a great relief to me to feel that i need not be angry with my secretary     xx  tomaso and i   the next day my amanuensis bade me goodmorning in her former pleasant manner but without turning toward me seated herself quickly at the table and took the manuscript from the drawer oh ho i thought then you can speak and it was not the rules which made you behave in that way but your own pique which has worn off a little i glanced at her as she intently looked over the work of the day before and i was considering whether or not it would be fitting for me to show that there might be pique on one side of the grating as well as on the other when suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by a burst of laughtergirlish irrepressible laughter with the manuscript in her hands my nun actually leaned back in her chair and laughed so heartily that i wonder my grandmother did not hear her  i declare she said turning to me her eyes glistening with tears of merriment this is the funniest thing i ever saw why you have actually separated those poor lovers for life and crushed every hope in the properest way and then all the rest about commerce i wouldnt have believed you could do it  what do you mean i exclaimed you showed no surprise when you wrote it  again she laughed  wrote it she cried i never wrote a line of it it was sister sarah who was your secretary yesterday didnt you know that  i stood for a moment utterly unable to answer then i gasped sister sarah wrote for me yesterday what does it mean  positively said she pushing back her chair and rising to her feet this is not only the funniest but the most wonderful thing in the world do you mean truly to say that you did not know it was sister sarah who wrote for you yesterday  i did not suspect it for an instant i answered  it was it was she exclaimed clasping her hands in her earnestness and stepping closer to the grating when we came here yesterday and found you were not in your room a sudden idea struck her i will stay here myself this morning she said and do his writing i want to know what sort of a story this is that is being dictated to a sister of our house and so she simply turned me out and told me to go home you dont know how frightened i was i was afraid that as we dress exactly alike you might not at first notice that sister sarah was sitting at the table and that you might begin with an awfully affectionate speech by tomaso for i knew that something of that kind was just on the point of breaking out and i knew too that if you did it there would be lively times in the house of martha and perhaps here also i fairly shivered the whole morning and my only hope was that she would begin to snap at you as soon as you came in and you would then know whom you had to deal with and that you would have to put a lot of water into your lovemaking if you wanted any more help from the sisters but if i had known that you would not find out that she was writing for you i should certainly have died i couldnt have stood it but how in the world could you have kept on thinking that that woman was i she is shorter and fatter and not a bit like me except in her clothes and if you thought i was writing for you why did you dictate that ridiculous stuff  i stood confounded here were answers to devise  of course the dress deceived me i said presently and not once did she turn her face toward me besides i did not imagine for a moment that any one but you could be sitting at that table  but i cannot understand why she pursued if you didnt know it was sister sarah you made that sudden change in your story  for a moment i hesitated and then i saw i might as well speak out honestly when a man sees before him a pair of blue eyes like those which were then fixed upon me the chances are that he will speak out honestly  the fact is i said that im a littlewell sensitive and when you or the person i thought was you did not speak to me nor look at me nor pay any more heed to me than if i had been a talkingmachine worked with a crank i was somewhat provoked and determined that if you suddenly chose to freeze in that way i would freeze too and that you should have no more of that story in which you were so interested and so i smashed the loves of tomaso and lucilla and took up commerce which i was sure you would hate  at this there was a quick flash in her eyes and the first tremblings of a smile at the corners of her mouth  oh she said and that was all she did say as she returned to the table and took her seat  is my explanation satisfactory i asked  oh certainly she answered and if you will excuse me for saying so i think you are a very fortunate man in trying to punish me you protected yourselfthat is if you care to have secretaries from our institution  as i could not see her face i could not determine what answer i should make to this remark and she continued as she turned over the sheets  what are you going to do with the pages which were written yesterday  tear them up i replied and throw them into the basket i wish to annihilate them utterly  she obeyed me and tore sister sarahs work into very small pieces  now we will go on with the original and genuine story i said and as the occurrences of yesterday are entirely banished from my mind and as all recollection of the point where we left off has gone will you kindly read two or three pages of what you last wrote  several times i had perceived or thought i had perceived symptoms of emotion in the back of my secretarys shawl and these symptoms if such they were were visible now she occupied some minutes in selecting a suitable point at which to begin but when she had done this she read without any signs of emotion either in her shawl or in her face  the story of the sicilian young people progressed slowly not because of any lack of material but because i was anxious to portray the phases as clearly and as effectively as i could possibly do it and whenever i could prevent myself from thinking of something else i applied my mind most earnestly to this object i flatter myself that i did the work very well and i am sure there were passages the natural fervor of which would have made sister sarah bounce at least a yard from her chair had they been dictated to her but my nun did not bounce in the least  before the hour at which we usually stopped work i arose from my chair and stated that that would be all for the day my secretary looked at me quickly  all for today she asked a little smile of disapprobation upon her brow it cannot be twelve oclock yet  no i answered it is not but it is not easy to work out the answer which lucilla ought now to make to tomaso and i shall have to take time for its consideration  i shouldnt think it would be easy said she but i hoped you had it already in your mind  then you are interested in it i asked  of course i am she answeredwho wouldnt be and just at this point too when everything depends on what she says but it is quite right for you to be very careful about what you make her say and she gathered her sheets together to lay them away  now i wanted to say something to her i stopped work for that purpose but i did not know what to say an apology for my conduct of the day before would not be exactly in order and an explanation of it would be exceedingly difficult i walked up and down my study and she continued to arrange her pages when she had put them into a compact and very neat little pile she opened the table drawer placed them in it examined some other contents of the drawer and finally closed it and sat looking out of the window after some minutes of this silent observation she half turned toward me and without entirely removing her gaze from the appletree outside she asked  do you still want to know my name  indeed i do i exclaimed stepping quickly to the grating  well then she said it is sylvia  at this moment we heard the footsteps of sister sarah in the hall at least two minutes before the usual time  when they had gone i stood by my study table my arms folded and my eyes fixed upon the floor  horace vanderley i said to myself you are in love and to this frank and explicit statement i answered quite as frankly that is certainly true there can be no mistake about it     xxi  lucilla and i   a saturday afternoon evening and night the whole of a sunday and its night with some hours of a monday morning intervened between the moment at which i had acknowledged to myself my feelings toward my secretary and the moment at which i might expect to see her again and nearly the whole of this time was occupied by me in endeavoring to determine what should be my next step to stand still in my present position was absolutely impossible i must go forward or backward to go backward was a simple thing enough it was like turning round and jumping down a precipice it made me shudder to go forward was like climbing a precipice with beetling crags and perpendicular walls of ice  the first of these alternatives did not require any consideration whatever to the second i gave all the earnest consideration of which i was capable but i saw no way of getting up the heights were inaccessible  in very truth my case was a hard one i could not make love to a woman through a grating and if i could i would not be dishonorable enough to do it when that woman was locked up in a room and could not get away in case she did not wish to listen to my protestations but between the girl i loved and myself there was a grating compared with which the barrier in the doorway of my study was as a spiders web this was the network of solemn bars which surrounded the sisters of the house of marthathe vows they had made never to think of love to read of it or speak of it  to drop metaphors it would be impossible for me to continue to work with her and conceal my love for her it would be stupidly useless and moreover cowardly to declare that love and it would be sensible praiseworthy and in every way advantageous for me to cease my literary labors and go immediately to the adirondacks or to mount desert but would i go away on saturday or sunday when she was coming on monday not i  she came on monday surrounded by a gray halo which had begun to grow as beautiful to my vision as the delicate tints of early dawn when she began to read what she had last written i seated myself in a chair by the grating when she had finished i sat silent for a minute got up and walked about came back sat down and was silent again in my whole mind there did not seem to be one crevice into which an available thought concerning my travels could squeeze itself she sat quietly looking out of the window at the appletree presently she said  i suppose you find it hard to begin work on monday morning after having rested so long it must be difficult to get yourself again into the proper frame of mind  on this monday morning i answered i find it very hard indeed  she turned and for the first time that day fixed her eyes upon me she did not look well she was pale  i had hoped she said with a little smile without any brightness in it that you would finish the story of tomaso and lucilla but i dont believe you feel like composing so how would you like me to read this morning  nothing could suit me better i answered and in my heart i thought that here was an angelic gift a relief and a joy  i will begin she said at the point where i left off reading she took up a portion of the manuscript she brought her chair within a yard of the grating she sat down with her face toward me and she read sometimes she stopped and spoke of what she was reading now to ask a question and now to tell something she had seen in the place i described i said but little i did not wish to occupy any of that lovely morning with my wordswords which were bound to mean nothing as she read and talked some color came into her face she looked more like herself what a shame to shut up such a woman in a house where she never had anything interesting to talk about never anybody interested to talk to  after the reading of half a dozen pages during which she had not interrupted herself she laid the manuscript in her lap and asked me the time i told her it wanted twenty minutes of twelve she made no answer but rose put the manuscript in the drawer and then returned with a little note which she had taken from her pocket  mother anastasia desired me to give you this she said folding it so that she could push it through one of the interstices of the grating she told me to hand it to you as i was coming away but i dont think she would object to your reading it a little before that  i took the note unfolded it and read it mother anastasia wrote an excellent hand she informed me that it had been decided that the sister of the house of martha who had been acting as my amanuensis should not continue in that position but should now devote herself to another class of work if however i desired it another sister would take her place  i stood unable to speak i must have been as pale as the white paint on the doorframe near which i stood  you see said sylvia and from the expression upon her face i think she must have perceived that i did not like what i had read this is the work of sister sarah i might as well tell you that at once and i am sure there is no harm in my doing so she has always objected to my writing for you and although the morning she spent with you would have satisfied any reasonable person that there could be no possible objection to my doing it she has not ceased to insist that i shall give it up and go to the measles refuge that however i will not do but i cannot come here any more mother anastasia and i are both sure that if i am not withdrawn from this work she will make no end of trouble she has consented that i should go on until now simply because this day ends my month  i was filled with amazement grief and rage  the horrible wretch i exclaimed what malignant wickedness  oh said sylvia holding up one finger you mustnt talk like that about the sister she may think she is right but i dont see how she can and perhaps she would have some reason on her side if she could see me standing here talking about her instead of attending to my work but i determined that i would not go away without saying a word you have always been very courteous to us and i dont see why we should not be courteous to you  are you sorry to go i asked getting as close to the grating as i could if they would let you would you go on writing for me  i should be glad to go on with the work she said it is just what i like  too bad too bad i cried cannot it be prevented cannot i see somebody you do not know how much ihow exactly you  excuse me said sylvia for interrupting you but what time is it  i glanced at the clock it wants four minutes of twelve i gasped  then i must bid you goodby she said  goodby i repeated how can you bid me goodby confound this grating isnt that door open  no she replied its locked do you want to shake hands with me  of course i do i cried goodby like this it cannot be  i think she said quickly that if you could get out of your window you might come to mine and shake hands  what a scintillating inspiration what a girl i had not thought of it in a moment i had bounded out of my window and was standing under hers which was not four feet from the ground there she was with her beautiful white hand already extended i seized it in both of mine  oh sylvia i said i cannot have you go in this way i want to tell youi want to tell you how  you are very good she interrupted endeavoring slightly to withdraw her hand and when the story of tomaso and lucilla is finished and printed i am going to read it rules or no rules  it shall never be finished i exclaimed vehemently if you do not write it and lifting her hand i really believe i was about to kiss it when with a quick movement she drew it from me  she is coming she said goodby goodby and with a wave of her hand she was gone from the window  i did not return to my study i stood by the side of the house with my fists clenched and my eyes set then suddenly i ran to the garden wall looking over it i saw far down the shaded village street two gray figures walking away     xxii  i close my book   by the rarest good fortune my grandmother started that afternoon for a visit to an old friend at the seashore and in the mild excitement of her departure i do not think she noticed anything unusual in my demeanor  and so your amanuensis has left you she remarked as she was eating a hasty luncheon sister sarah stopped for a moment and told me so she said there was another one ready to take the place if you wanted her  i tried to suppress my feelings but i must have spoken sharply  want her i exclaimed i want none of her  my grandmother looked at me for a moment  i shall be sorry horace she said if you find that the sisters do not work to suit you i hoped that you might continue to employ them because the house of martha is at such a convenient distance and offers you such a variety of assistance to choose from and also because you would contribute to a most worthy cause you know that all the money they may make is to go to hospitals and that sort of thing  i was a little afraid however she continued after a pause that the sister you engaged might not suit you she was so much younger than the others that i feared that away from the restraints of the institution she might be a little frivolous was she ever frivolous  not in the least i answered not for an instant  i am very glad to hear that she remarkedvery glad indeed i take an interest in that sister years ago i knew her family but that was before she was born i remember that i was intending to speak to you about her but in some way i was interrupted  well i asked tell me now who is she  she is said my grandmother sister hagar of the house of martha she was sylvia raynor of new haven i think that in some way her life has been darkened mother anastasia takes a great interest in her and favors her a good deal i know there was opposition to her entering the house but she was determined to do it you say you are not going to engage another sister who is to be your amanuensis  no one i answered i shall stop writing for the present this is a very good time ive nearly reached the end ofa sort of division of the book  an excellent idea said my grandmother with animation you ought to go to the sea or the mountains you have been working very hard you are not looking well  i shall go i shall go i answered quickly fishing probably but i cant say where ill write to you as soon as i decide  now that is very pleasant said my grandmother as she rose from the table very pleasant indeed and if you write that you will be away fishing for a week or two i shall stay at the bromleys longer than i intendedperhaps until you return  a week or two i muttered to myself  walkirk had sharper eyes than those of my grandmother i am sure that when he came that evening he saw immediately that something was the matter with mesomething of moment he was a man of too much tact to allude to my state of mind but in a very short time i saved him all the trouble of circumspection for i growled out that i could not talk about travels at present and then told him that i could not write about them either for i had lost my secretary his countenance exhibited much concern  but you can get another of the sisters he said  what i replied to this i do not remember but i know i expressed myself so freely so explicitly and with such force that walkirk understood very well that i wanted the secretary i had lost that i wanted none other and that i wanted her very much indeed in fact he comprehended the situation perfectly  i was not sorry i wanted somebody to whom i could talk about the matter in whom i could confide in ten minutes i was speaking to walkirk in perfect confidence  but you cant do anything said he when there came a pause this is a case in which there is nothing to do my advice is that you go away for a time and try to get over it  i am going away i replied  you could do nothing better walkirk remarked i am altogether in favor of that although of course such counsel is against my own interests  not at all said i catching his meaning for i shall take you with me  after a considerable pause in the conversation walkirk inquired if i had decided where i would go  no i answered that is your affair my desire is to get away from every place where there is any chance of seeing a woman i wish to obliterate from my mind all idea of the female human being in fact i think i should like to take lodgings near a monastery and have the monks come and write for mea different one every day  walkirk smiled since you wish me to select your retreat he said i am bound to have an opinion regarding it i might advise a visit to the trappists of kentucky or to some remote fishing and hunting region but it strikes me that a background made up of exclusive association with men would be very apt to bring out in strong relief any particular female image which you might have in your mind i should say that the best way of getting rid of such an image would be to merge it in a lot of other female images  away with the idea i cried walkirk i will neither merge nor relieve i will go with you to some place where we shall see neither men nor women where we can hunt fish sail sleep read smoke and banish the world i dont wish you to take a servant we can do without service and if necessary i can cook i put the whole matter in your hands walkirk and when you have decided on our destination let me know  the next afternoon walkirk found me at my club in the city and informed me that he had selected a place which he thought would suit my purposes  no people i asked  none but ourselves replied he  very good said i when can we start  i shall be ready tomorrow afternoon he answered and i will call for you at your house     xxiii  racket island   we traveled all night and early in the morning alighted at a small station on the shore of a broad bay here we found moored a catrigged sailboat of which walkirk took possession and we stowed therein the valises guns and fishing tackle which we had brought with us i examined the craft with considerable interest it was about twenty feet long had a small cabin divided into two compartments and appeared to be well stocked with provisions and other necessaries  is it to be a long cruise i said to walkirk and do you know how to sail a boat  with this wind he answered we should reach our destination in a couple of hours and i consider myself a very fair skipper  up sail then i cried and i am not in the least hurry to know where i am going  walkirk sailed a boat very well but he did it in rather an odd way as if he had learned it all out of a book and never had handled a tiller before i am not a bad amateur sailor myself but i gave no consideration to the management of our craft walkirk had said that he knew where he was going and was able to sail there and i left the matter entirely to him and whether or not this were his first essay in sailing in due time we ran upon a low beach and he exclaimed  here we are  i rose to my feet and looked about me now then said i i shall ask you where are we  this is racket island he replied and as soon as we get the boat pulled up and the sail down i will tell you about it  racket island said walkirk a short time afterwards as we stood together on a little sandy bluff was discovered two years ago by me and a friend as we were sailing about in this bay i suppose other people may have discovered it before but as i have seen no proof of this i am not bound to believe it we named it racket island having found on the beach an old tennis racket which had been washed there by the waves from no one knows where the island is not more than half a mile long with a very irregular coast the other end of it you see is pretty well wooded we stayed here for three days sleeping in our boat and so far as solitude is concerned we might as well have been on a desert island in the midst of the pacific now i propose that we do the same thing and stay for three days or three weeks or as long as you please this is the finest season of the year for camping out and we can moor the boat securely and cook and sleep on board of it there is plenty of sand and there is plenty of shade and i hope you will like it  i do i cried on racket island let us settle  for two days i experienced a sort of negative enjoyment if i could not be at home dictating to my late secretary or better still looking at her as she sat close to the grating reading to me this was the next best thing i could do i could walk over the island i could sail around it i could watch walkirk fish i could lie on the sand and look at the sky and i could picture sylvia with her hair properly arranged and attired in apparel suited to her in my fancy i totally discarded the gray garb of the sisters of the house of martha and dressed my nun sometimes in a light summer robe with a broad hat shading her face and again in the richest costumes of silks and furs sometimes walkirk interrupted these pleasant reveries but that of course was to be expected  in several directions we could see points of land but it did not interest me to know what these were or how far away they were walkirk and i had racket island to ourselves my grandmother was happy with her friends and where the rest of the world happened to stow themselves i did not care several times i said this to myself but it was a mistake i cared very much where sylvia stowed herself philosophize as i might i thought of her continually in that doleful house of martha and as i thought of her there i cried out against the shortcomings of civilization  we had pitched a small tent in the shelter of a clump of trees on the higher part of the island and near this on the morning of our third day i was sitting smoking and trying the effect of sylvias face under a wide black hat heavy with ostrich plumes when walkirk approached me carrying a string of freshly caught fish  i am sorry to say said he that in coming here to escape the society of women we have made a failure for one of them is sitting on the beach on the other side of the island  i sprang to my feet with an abrupt exclamation  how did the woman get here i cried i thought this place was deserted  it is i know every inch of it no one lives here but this female person came in a small sailboat i saw it tied up not far from where she is sitting  if women come here i said i want to go and you may as well get ready to leave  i think remarked walkirk that it would be well not to be in too great a hurry to leave i know of no place where we are less likely to be disturbed and so long as these dry nights continue there can be no pleasanter camping place she may now be sailing away and the chances are we shall never see her again  ill go and look into the matter said i  i walked over the ridge of the little island and soon caught sight of a female figure sitting on the sandy beach near by was the boat which walkirk had mentioned as soon as i saw her i stopped but she must have heard my approach for she turned toward me i had come merely to make an observation of her but now i must go on as i approached her i turned as if i were about to walk along the shore and as i passed her i raised my hat she was a lady of middle age of a reddish blonde complexion and her hair was negligently put up under a plain straw hat her large blue eyes her slightly uplifted brows and the general expression of her rather thin face gave me the idea that she was a pleasantly disposed woman who was either very tired or not in good health  goodmorning sir she said on desert islands you know people speak to each other without ceremony  i stopped and returned her salutation excuse me i remarked but this does not seem to be a desert island may i be permitted to ask if it is a place of much resort  of course you may she answered people sometimes come here but would you like it better if they did not you need not answer i know you would  this was a very free and easy lady but if she liked that mood it suited me very well  since you will have it i replied i will admit i came here because i thought my companion and i would have the island to ourselves  and now you are disappointed she said with a smile  she was surely a person of very pleasant humor  good lady said i you must not corner me i came here because i thought it would be a good place in which to stop awhile and grumble undisturbed and as you say it is proper to be unceremonious may i ask how you happen to be here and if you sail your boat yourself  i am here she answered because i like this island i take an interest in it for two reasons one is that it is a good island and the other is that i own it  really i exclaimed in sudden embarrassment you must pardon me i assure you i did not know that  dont apologize she said raising her hand scarcely any one knows or at least remembers that i own this island i bought it a good many years ago intending to build upon it but it was considered too remote from the mainland and i have established a summer home on the island which you can just see over there to the west so this island is perfectly free to respectable seekers after solitude or fish i may add that i do not sail my boat but came here this morning with my brother and another gentleman they have now gone up the beach to look for shells  madam said i i feel that i am an intruder but to assure you that i am a respectable one allow me to introduce myself and i presented my card  no thank you she replied with a smile as she gently waved back my card we dont do that sort of thing here as far as possible we omit all ordinary social customs we come here to rid ourselves for a time of manners and customs my other island is called the tangent because there we fly off from our accustomed routine of life we dress as we please and we live as we please we drop all connection with society and its conventions we even drop the names by which society knows us i am known as the lady who sits on the sand commonly condensed to the sand lady my brother who spends most of his time in his boat is the middleaged man of the sea and his scientific friend is the shell man when we have stayed on the tangent as long as the weather and our pleasure induce us we return to our ordinary routine of life now if you have any title which is characteristic of you i shall be glad to hear it as well as that of your companion we consider ourselves capable of forming unbiased opinions in regard to what is generally known as respectability  it struck me as a very satisfactory thing to look upon this pleasant lady solely and simply as a human being it is so seldom that we meet any one who can be looked upon in that light  madam i said i greatly like your plan for putting yourselves out of the world for a time but i find it difficult properly to designate myself  oh anything will do she said for instance your reason for desiring to seclude yourself  very well then said i you may call me a lover in check  excellent she exclaimedjust the sort of person for this place and what is the other one  oh he is an understudy i replied  delightful she said i never saw one and here come my brother and the shell man  i was now introduced formally by my new title to the middleaged man of the sea a hearty personage with a curling beard and to the shell man who was tall and wore spectacles  when my presence was explained the brother was as cordial as the lady had been and proffered any assistance which i might need during my sojourn on the island when they took their leave the sand lady urged me to inhabit her island as long as i pleased and hoped that i and the understudy would sometimes sail over to them and see what it was to be on a tangent at this i shook my head and they all laughed at me but it was easy to see that they were people of very friendly dispositions  when i reported my interview to walkirk he remarked it is impossible to get away from people but in all probability these folks will not come here again  perhaps not i answered and dropped the subject     xxiv  the interpolation   they did not seem in the least surprised to find us here i said to walkirk as we were eating our dinner  who he asked oh the people who came over this morning quite likely they saw us when we were sailing this way we passed their island at no great distance there is no reason why they should object your soft hat and flannel shirt would not prevent them from seeing that you were a gentleman  i nodded and sat silent for a time  walkirk said i suppose we sail over to those people this afternoon it might be interesting  very good he answered turning suddenly to watch a sea gull which had made a great swoop toward us as if attracted by the odors of our meal that will be an excellent thing to do  in making our way that afternoon in the direction of the tangent our course was not mathematically correct for the wind did not favor us and it was impossible to sail in a right line but the sun was still high when we reached the larger island and made the boat fast to a little pier  this island was much more attractive than the one on which we were camping the ground receded from the beach in rolling slopes covered with short grass and here and there were handsome spreading trees on a bluff a few hundred yards from the pier stood a low picturesque house almost surrounded by a grove the path to the house was plainly marked and led us along the face of a little hill to a jutting point where it seemed to make an abrupt turn upward as we rounded this point we saw on a rocky ledge not far ahead of us a lady dressed in white she was standing on the ledge looking out over the water and apparently very much engaged with her own thoughts for she had not yet perceived our approach  at the first glance i saw that the figure before us was not the sand lady this was a tall and graceful woman carrying no weight of years she held her hat in her hand and her dark hair was slightly blown back from a face which seen in profile against the clear blue sky appeared to me to be perfect in its outline we stopped involuntarily and at that moment she turned toward us her face was one of noble beauty with great dark eyes and a complexion of that fine glow which comes to women who are not quite brunettes  walkirk started and seized my arm good heavens he whispered it is mother anastasia  as we now advanced toward the lady i could scarcely believe what i had heard certainly i could not comprehend it here was one of the most beautiful women i had ever beheld dressed in a robe of soft white flannel which though simple was tasteful and elegant she had a bunch of wild flowers in her belt and at her neck a bow of dark yellow ribbon i particularly noticed these points in my amazement at hearing walkirk say that this was the mother superior of the house of martha  as we approached she greeted us pleasantly very much as if she had expected our coming and then addressing walkirk she said with a smile  i see sir that you recognize me and i suppose you are somewhat surprised to find me here and thus glancing at her dress  surprised madam exclaimed walkirk i am astounded  well said she that sort of thing will happen occasionally the people on this island have been expecting a visit from you gentlemen but i really do not know where any of them are it is not always easy to find them but i will go and see if the sand lady is in the house and if so i will tell her of your arrival of course she continued now turning to me you both will remember that in this place we put ourselves outside of a good many of the ordinary conventions and are known by our characteristics instead of our names  i assured her we understood this and considered it an admirable idea  as you sir turning to walkirk have met me before i will immediately state that i am known on this island only as the interpolation  she turned to walk toward the house but stopped we are all here to enjoy ourselves and it is against the rules to worry each other with puzzles i therefore will at once say in explanation of my name that i have briefly thrust myself into the life of my friends and of my appearance that the middleaged man of the sea who is a very selfwilled person caused the costume which i ordinarily wear and in which i arrived to be abstracted and hidden so that i am obliged while here to wear clothes belonging to others now you see mr understudy everything is as plain as daylight  they have been talking about us i remarked as the lady rapidly walked away and of course having recognized you she must know who i am  know you there is no doubt of it he answered she must have seen you often in the village although you may never have noticed her  i certainly never have said i in fact i make it a point not to look under the bonnets of those graygarbed women  when you meet them in the street he asked  yes i replied  she knows us both said walkirk and she has now gone to the house to tell the people who we are and yet i am surprised that she met us so serenely she could not possibly have known that the two men on that little island were her neighbors in the village of arden  i made no answer i was strangely excited i had flown to an uninhabited island to get away from sylvia and if my conscience could be made to work properly to get away from all thoughts of her and here i had met most unexpectedly and suddenly with one who was probably the most intimate connection of the girl from whom i was flying i was amazed my emotion thrilled me from head to foot  it is just like women remarked walkirk as we slowly walked toward the house to put on disguises to conceal their identities but they have no respect for our identities without doubt at this moment mother anastasia is telling the lady of the house all about you and your grandmother your position in society and the manner in which you were furnished with a secretary from the house of martha  still i did not reply mother anastasia i said to myself here is a graygarbed sister transformed into a lovely woman why should not another sister be so transformed why should not sylvia be here in soft white raiment with flowers and a broad hat if one can be thus why not the other the possibility fevered me  we found the mistress of the housethe same who was called the sand ladyupon a piazza her demeanor had been pleasant enough when we had seen her before but now she greeted us as cordially as if we had been old friends it was plain enough that mother anastasia had told her all about us her brother and the shell man were also there and the first was friendly and the latter polite the mother superior was on the piazza but keeping a little in the background as if she felt that she had had her turn  and now mr lover in check and mr understudy said the sand lady i present you with the freedom of this island as i have already presented you with the freedom of the other if what we happen to be doing interests you join us if it does not interest yourselves as you please that is our custom here  the mention of the name which i had applied to myself gave me a little shock under the circumstances i did not like it it was possible that the mother superior of the house of martha might know what it meant and whether she knew it now or ever should come to know it i did not wish the knowledge to come to her in that way  there is still another one of our family said the sand lady but she is very independent and may not care for me to present you just now i will go and ask her  she stepped off the piazza and went to a lady who was reading in a hammock under a tree near by in a minute or two this lady arose and with her book in her hand came toward us she was a woman of good figure and with a certain air of loftiness her dress was extremely simple and she may have been thirty years old approaching us she said  i wish to introduce myself i am a person in this place that is all i am it is my name it denotes my characteristics your titles have been mentioned to me the ceremony is over and with a little nod she returned to her hammock  now said the man of the sea who could prune away conventionalities better than that he then announced that in half an hour the tide would serve for fishingthat he was going out in his boat and would take any one who cared to accompany him and this announcement having been made he settled himself upon the piazza to talk to us the conversation was interesting and lively the people at this house were well worth knowing  the sand lady and walkirk went in the boat to fish the latter had been very prompt to accept the invitation i do not know whether the shell man went with them or not at all events he disappeared and mother anastasia and myself were left upon the piazza it surprised me that events had so quickly shaped themselves to my advantage  do you insist i said when we were left alone on being called an interpolation  of course i do she answered that is what i am  you like plain speech  i am very fond of it was her reply  during the general conversation i had determined that as soon as an opportunity offered i would speak very plainly to this lady i looked about me the occupant of the hammock was not far away i surmised that she could readily hear me if i spoke in my ordinary tone  plain speech appears difficult to you remarked my companion  i still looked about me it strikes me said i that beyond the other side of the house there is a bluff from which one might get a view of the mainland would you like to go and find out whether that is so or not  i have seen that view several times she answered and then after a little pause she added but i dont mind in the least seeing it again together we walked to the bluff there we found two rude seats which had been made for the convenience of viewers and on one of these she seated herself  now said she please sit down and you may immediately begin to ask me about sister ha  oh do not call her by that name i cried  she laughed very well then said she what shall i call her  sylvia i replied  she opened her eyes upon my word she exclaimed this is progress how did you come to know that her name is sylvia  she told me i answered but why do you think i want to ask you about sylvia  i knew there was no other reason for your wishing to have a private talk with me but i must admit that i would not have felt warranted to act upon my assumptions had you not announced yourself in this place as a lover in check  but could not some one else have held me in check i asked  no sir said she i have heard of the manner in which you parted from your late secretary  this conversation was getting to be plainer than i desired it to be i was willing to declare my position but i did not care to have it declared for me i was silent for a minute  i did not suppose i then said that you were so well informed you think that i am a lover held in check by the circumstances surrounding the lady you designated my late secretary  i do  may i ask i continued with a little agitation if sylvia considers me in this light and if she hasexpressed any opinion on the subject  those are pretty questions said the lady fixing her dark eyes upon me she has said nothing about the light in which she considers you in fact all she has told me about you has been in answer to questions i have put to her but had she spoken of you as a lover checked or unchecked of course you would have been none the wiser for me sylvia is a simplehearted frank girl and i have thought that she might not have suspected the nature of your very decided liking for her but now that i have found out that she let you know her as sylvia i am afraid she is deeper than i thought her i should not be surprised if you two had flirted dreadfully  i never flirt i answered emphatically  that is right said she never do it  but why i asked did you allow her to continue to come to me if you thought i had a decided liking for her and all that  because i chose to do it she replied with not the ripple of a smile nor the furrow of a frown upon her face  i looked at her in amazement  madam said i interpolation mother anastasia or whatever name you give yourself begin now and tell me about sylvia and speak to me freely as i speak to you i love her with all my heart if i can i intend to marry her martha or no martha i care not what may be the odds against me now you see exactly where i stand and as far as i am concerned you may speak without restraint  you are certainly very clear and explicit she said and i shall be glad to tell you about sylvia     xxv  about sylvia   before i begin continued my companion slanting her hat so as to prevent the sun from meddling with the perfect tones of her complexion tell me what you already know about this young lady i do not wish to waste any information  all i know said i is that her family name is raynormy grandmother told me thatthat she is absolutely utterly and even wickedly out of place in the house of martha and that i want her for my wife  very good said my companion with a smile now i know what not to tell you i am very fond of sylvia in fact i believe i love her better than any other woman in the world  so do i i interrupted  she laughed for a lover in check you are entirely too ready to move for years i have looked upon her as a younger sister and there is no good thing which i would not have lavished upon her had i been able but instead of that i did her an injury at times i have thought it a terrible injury  you mean i asked that you have allowed her to enter the house of martha  your quickness is wonderful she said but you do not put the case quite correctly had it been possible for me to prohibit her joining our sisterhood i should have done so but she was perfectly free to do as she pleased and my advice against it was of no avail it was my example which induced her to enter the house of martha she had had trouble she wished to retire from the world and devote herself to good works which should banish her trouble i had so devoted myself she loved me and she followed me i talked to her until i made her unhappy and then i let her go her way but the great object of my life for nearly a year has been to make that girl feel that her true way is out of the house of martha  then she is not bound by vows or promises i asked with some excitement  not in the least said she she can leave us when she pleases i do not think she likes her life or her duties unless indeed they lead her in the direction of dictated literature but she has a firm will and having joined us has never shown the slightest sign of a desire to leave us she always asserts that when the proper time arrives she shall vow herself a permanent member of our sisterhood  what preposterous absurdity i exclaimed she will never conform to your rules she hates nursing she has too much good sense to insult her fine womanly nature by degrading and unnecessary sacrifices  how delightfully confidential she must have beenbut i assure you sir that she never said that sort of thing to me there were things she liked and things she did not like but she showed no signs of rebellion  which was wise i said knowing that you thought she ought not to be there any way  oh but she is a little serpent exclaimed my companion and so wise to confide in you and without flirting it must have been charming to see  i did not reply to this remark which i considered flippant and my mind was not inclined to flippancy  it may appear strange to you she continued and would probably appear strange to any one who did not understand the case that i should have allowed her to become your amanuensis but this whole affair is a very peculiar one in the first place it is absolutely necessary that sylvia should work it is not only her duty as a sister but without it she would fall into a morbid mental condition she is not fitted in any way for the ordinary labors of our house so i was glad to find something which would not only suit her but would so interest her that it would help to draw her away from us and back into the world to which she rightfully belongs this must appear an odd desire for a mother superior of a religious body but it is founded on an earnest and conscientious regard for the true welfare of my young friend  and then there was another reason for my allowing her to come to you you would smile if you could picture to yourself the mental image i had formed of you which was founded entirely on your grandmothers remarks when she came to see me about engaging one of our sisters as your secretary before this matter was discussed i may have seen you in the village but i never had known you even by sight and from what that good lady said of you i supposed that you were decidedly middleaged in feeling if not in years that you were extremely grave and studious and wished when engaged upon literary composition to be entirely oblivious of your surroundings and that you desired an amanuensis who should be simply a writingmachinewho would in no way annoy you by intruding upon you any evidence that she possessed a personality a sister from our house your grandmother urged would be the very person you needed and infinitely better suited to the position than the somewhat frivolous young women who very often occupy positions as amanuenses  it was for these reasons that i sent sylvia to write at the dictation of the sedate author of the forthcoming book on european travel even when i heard that a lovestory had been introduced into the descriptions of countries i concluded after consideration not to interfere i did not think that it would be of any disadvantage to sylvia if she should become a little interested in love affairs but that you should become interested in a love affair such as that you have mentioned to me i did not imagine in the remotest degree  i am sure said i that your motives as far as sylvia was concerned and your action as far as i am concerned were heavenborn and now as we are speaking plainly here together let me ask you if you do not think you would be fulfilling what you consider your duty to sylvia by aiding me to make her my wife there can surely be no better way for her to fill her proper place in the world than to marry a man who loves her with his whole heart i know that i love her above all the world i believe that i am worthy of her  she answered me in a tone which was grave but gentle do you not know you are asking me to do something which is entirely impossible in the first place my official position precludes me from taking part in affairs of this nature and although i am willing to admit that i see no reason why you might not be a suitable partner for sylvia i must also admit that on the other hand i have no reason to believe that sylvia would be inclined to accept you as such a partner i have no doubt that she has made herself very agreeable to youthat is her nature i know that she used to make herself very agreeable to people you must remember that even should sylvia leave us your chances may be no better than they are now  madam i said leaning toward her and speaking with great earnestness i will take all possible chances what i ask and implore of you is that if you should ever be able to do the least little thing which would give me the opportunity to plead my own suit before sylvia you would do it i can give her position and fortune i think i am suited to her and if love can make me better suited i have love enough now tell me will you not do this thing if you have the opportunity and see no reason against it will you not help me  this is a hard position for me she said after a pause and all i can promise you is this i love sylvia and i am going to do whatever i think will be of the greatest advantage to her  then i asserted with continued earnestness it shall be my labor to prove that to love the man who loves her as i do will be her greatest good if i do that will you be on my side  she smiled looked at me a few moments and then answered yes  your hand upon it i cried leaning still farther forward she laughed at the enthusiastic warmth of my manner and gave me her hand  it is a promise i exclaimed and was about to raise her fingers to my lips when she quickly drew them away  i declare she said rising as she spoke i did not suppose that you would forget that i am the mother superior of the house of martha  excuse me i replied but you are not that with your own mouth you have assured me that you are an interpolation and there is nothing in a social or moral law which forbids a suitable expression of gratitude to an interpolation  sir said she i think i have seen quite as much as is necessary of the view which you asked me here to look upon     xxvi  mother anastasia   in the half hour during which i remained alone upon the bluff awaiting the return of walkirk and the fishing party i thought as much of the lady with whom i had been talking as the lady of whom i had been talking  how is it possible i asked myself that this gentlewoman warm with her rich blooded beauty alive with ripe youth born to delight the soul of man and fire his heart should content herself to be a head nurse in a hospital to wander in an unsightly disguise among dismal sickbeds to direct the management of measlesrefuges to shut herself up in a barefloored coldwalled institution with narrowminded sister sarahs to be in a word the mother superior of the house of martha  that she should occupy this position seemed to me a crime there were many women in the world who could do all she was doing but there were few who could take her place in the world of full true life  when the fishing party returned i went to the house to take leave of our new friends  you must go said the sand lady and where may i ask is it imperative that you should go  to the island where you have so kindly allowed us to sojourn i replied  you sleep in the cabin of your boat i believe she said and i answered that we did  very well then continued she why not bring your floating home to this island it is in every way better than that i will give you exclusive rights over a little bay and an adjoining dell there you can cook your own meals when you like or you can come to us when you like we always have more than enough for all who inhabit this island in the evening you can sit alone on the beach and think of the faraway loved one or you can come up to the house and play whist or twenty questions the understudy can go fishing with my brother they suit each other admirably what do you say  i say madam i replied with a bow the sands of which you are the lady are the dust of diamonds and your invitation is a golden joy  bless me she exclaimed what must you be out of check  that evening we sailed to racket island brought away our belongings and established ourselves in the landlocked little bay about a quarter of a mile from the house of the sand lady  early the next morning i walked around to a pier where i had noticed a goodsized yacht was moored it was still there apparently no one had left the island after our breakfast on the beach i told walkirk to devote himself to independent occupations and walked up to the house i found the lady who had called herself a person and the one of whom i did not like to think as an interpolation sitting together upon the piazza i joined them  wouldnt you be very much obliged to me asked the person after a scattering conversation in which i suppose i appeared as but a perfunctory performer if i were to go away and leave you alone with this lady  as this is an island of plain speaking i replied i will say yes  both ladies laughed and the person retired to her hammock  now then asked mother anastasia what is the meaning of this alarming frankness  i wish to talk to you of sylvia i answered  if you imagine she said that i intend to spend the short time i shall remain upon this island in talking of sylvia you are very much mistaken  then let us talk of yourself i replied  she turned upon me with a frown and a laugh  if i had known she said your habits of ingenuousness and candor i should have made you dictate to sylvia through a speakingtube you have known me less than a day you have known her for a month can it be possible that you talk to her as freely as you talk to me  madam i exclaimed i love sylvia and therefore could not speak freely to her  your distinctions are wonderfully clearcut she said but why do you wish to talk of me i suppose you want to know why i am mother superior of the house of martha  yes i answered that is a thing i cannot understand but of course i should not feel justified in even alluding to it if yesterday you had not so kindly given me your confidence in regard to yourself and sylvia  it seems to me she remarked that as you decline to recognize the name given to that young woman by our institution you should call her miss raynor but i will say no more of that  it would be well said i she is sylvia to me you must remember that i never met her in the circles of conventionalism  she laughed this whole affair is certainly very independent of conventionalism and as to your curiosity about me that is very easily gratified nearly five years ago i connected myself with the house of martha although there were sisters older than myself i was chosen mother superior because i possessed rather more administrative abilities than any of the others i think i have governed the house fairly well even if in regard to the matter of furnishing secretaries to literary men there has been some dissatisfaction  you allude to sister sarah said i  yes she answered and had she been head of the house your peace of mind would not have been disturbed but what i did in that case i did conscientiously and with good intent  and you are not sorry for it i asked  it may be that i shall be sorry for you she replied but that is all i have to say on that point in a very short time i shall return to my duties and to my sombre bonnet and gown and these interpolated days which in a manner have been forced upon me should be forgotten  but one thing you must not forget i exclaimed it was in this time that you promised me  you selfish selfish man she interrupted you think only of yourself i shall talk no more of yourself of myself or of sylvia my friends are at the other side of the house and i am going to them and she went  while walkirk and i were sailing that afternoon he managing the boat and i stretched upon some cushions i told him of my conversations with mother anastasia i considered him worthy of my confidence and it was pleasant to give it to him  she is a rare strange woman said he i thought her very handsome when i visited her at the house of martha but since i have seen her here dressed in becoming clothes i consider that she possesses phenomenal attractions  and i hope i remarked that she may be phenomenally goodnatured and give me some chances of seeing sylvia raynor  that would indeed be phenomenal said walkirk laughing considering that she is a mother superior and the young lady is a member of the sisterhood but everything relating to the case is peculiar and in my opinion mother anastasia is more peculiar than anything else  that evening we were invited to dine at the house of the sand lady it was a delightful occasion everybody was in good spirits and the general tone of the conversation was singularly lively and unrestrained mother anastasia would not play cards but we amused ourselves with various sprightly social games in which the lady who preferred to be called a person showed a vivacious though sometimes nipping wit i had no opportunity for further private talk with mother anastasia nor did i desire one i wished to interest her in my love for sylvia but not to bore her with it  the next day at about eleven oclock the sand lady and the shell man walked over to our little bay where they found walkirk and me fencing upon the level beach  stop your duel gentlemen said the lady i come to give you the farewells of the interpolation she was sorry she could not do this herself but she went away very early this morning  went away i cried dropping my foil upon the sand where did she go  she sailed in our yacht for sanford answered the sand lady to take the morning train for her beloved house of martha my brother accompanied her to the town but he will be back today  i was surprised and grieved and showed it  we are all sorry to have her go said the sand lady and sorry to see her wearing that doleful gray garb which my brother allowed her to assume this morning  i am glad i exclaimed that i did not see her in it  the lady looked at me with her pleasant quiet smile  you seem very much interested in her  i am i replied very much interested both directly and indirectly and i am exceedingly sorry that she departed without my knowing it  this time the sand lady laughed goodmorning gentlemen said she go on with your duel     xxvii  a person   i fenced no more walkirk i cried let us get our traps on board and be off  my understudy looked troubledmore troubled than i had ever seen him before  why do you think of this he asked where do you propose to go  home said i to my own house that is the place where i want to be  walkirk stood still and looked at me his face still wearing an air of deep concern  it is not my place to advise he said but it seems to me that your return at this moment would have a very odd appearance to say the least every one would think that you were pursuing mother anastasia and she herself would think so  no said i she will not suppose anything of the kind she will know very well on whose account i came and as for the people here they might labor under a mistake at first because of course i should not offer them any explanation but they would soon learn the real state of the case that is if they correspond with the mother superior  you propose then said walkirk to lay siege to the house of martha and to carry away if you can miss sylvia raynor  i have made no plans i answered but i can look after my interests better in arden than i can here i do not like this sudden departure of the mother superior i very much fear that something has induced her to withdraw the good will with which she previously seemed to look upon my attachment to miss raynor were this not so she would have advised with me before she left nothing could have been more natural now i believe she has set herself against me and has gone away with the intention of permanently separating sylvia and myself  have you any reason asked walkirk to impute such an intention to her  her sudden flight indicates it i replied and besides you know although she is not a roman catholic she is at the head of a religious house and persons in that position are naturally averse to anybody marrying the sisters under their charge even if she does not approve of miss raynors remaining in the house she may not want her to date a love affair from the establishment if i remain here miss raynor may be spirited entirely out of my sphere of action  it strikes me said walkirk the way to get her spirited out of your sight and knowledge is for you to go home at this juncture in that case mother anastasia would be bound in duty to the young lady and her family to send her away do you not agree with me that if you were to reach arden in the natural course of events so to speak and especially if you got there after your grandmother had returned you would avoid a great deal of undesirable complication and perhaps actual opposition  you are right i answered it would not look well for me to start away so suddenly we will wait a day or two and then drop off naturally  walking toward the house in the afternoon i met the person she advanced toward me holding out her hand with an air of peremptory friendliness  i am heartily glad to see you i want you to amuse me i could not ask this of you so long as that fascinating abbess was on the island  i was a little surprised at this salutation and not at all pleased i did not fancy this lady she had an air as if she were availing herself of her right to be familiar with her inferiors  i fear it is not in my power to do anything to amuse you said i  entirely too modest she answered let us walk over to this bench in the shade you are not desired at the house everybody is taking a nap  i went with her to the bench she had pointed out and we sat down  now then said she turning toward me will you do me the favor to flirt with me say for twentyfive minutes looking at her watch that will bring us to four oclock when i must go indoors  at first i thought the woman was insane but a glance at her face showed that there was no reason for fear of that kind  that sounds crazy doesnt it she asked but it isnt it is an honest expression of a very natural wish hundreds of ladies have doubtless looked at you and had that wish but social conventions forbade their expressing it here we have no conventions and i speak my mind  madam said i or miss there are few things i hold in such abhorrence as flirtation as i said this i looked at her severely and she looked at me quizzically she had gray eyes which were capable of a great variety of expressions and her face suffused by the light of a bantering jocularity was an attractive one i was obliged to admit this in spite of my distaste for her  i like that she said it sounds so well after your vigorous flirtation with our abbess if i had not seen a good deal of that i should not have dared to ask you to flirt with me i thought you liked it and now that she is gone might be willing to take up with some one else  i was irritated and disquieted i had been very earnest in my attentions to mother anastasia perhaps this lady had seen me attempt to kiss her hand i must set myself right  you are utterly mistaken said i what i had to say to mother anastasia related entirely to another person  one of the sisters in her institution she asked she had nothing to do with any other persons so far as i know truly that is a capital idea she exclaimed without waiting for response from me in order to flirt with a member of the sisterhood a gentleman must direct his attentions to the mother superior who represents them and the flirting is thus done by proxy now dont attempt to correct me the idea is entirely too delightful for me to allow it to be destroyed by any bare statements or assertions  i suppose i answered that mother anastasia has taken you into her confidence  thank you very much for that most gratifying testimony to my powers of insight she cried the mother superior gave me no confidences so you have been smitten by a graygown how did you happen to become acquainted with her i do not imagine they allow gentleman visitors at the house of martha  madam you know or assume to know so much of my affairs said i that in order to prevent injurious conjectures regarding the house of martha its officers and inmates i shall say that i became acquainted in a perfectly legitimate manner with a young lady living therein who has not yet taken the vows of the permanent sisterhood and i intend as soon as circumstances will permit to make her an offer of marriage i assure you i regret extremely that i have been obliged to talk in this way to a stranger and nothing could have induced me to do it but the fear that your conjectures and surmises might make trouble i ask as a right that you will say no more of the matter to any one  would you mind telling me the ladys name she asked  of course i shall do no such thing i answered rising from my seat with my face flushing with indignation  this is odd flirting isnt it said she still retaining her seata quarrel at the very outset i shall not be prevented from informing you why you ought to tell me the name of the lady you see that if you dont give me her name my ungovernable curiosity will set me to working the matter out for myself and it is quite as likely as not that i shall go to the house of martha and ask questions and pry and watch and make no end of trouble if a blooming bride is to be picked from that flock of ashcolored gruelmixers i want to know who it is to be i used to be acquainted with a good many of them but i havent visited the house for some time  i had never known any one assume toward me a position so unjustifiable and so unseemly as that in which this lady had deliberately placed herself i could find no words to express my opinion of her conduct and was on the point of walking away when she rose and quickly stepped to my side  dont go away angry she said on this island we dont get angry it is too conventional i am bound to find out all about this affair because it interests me it is something quite out of the common and although you are in a measure right in saying that i have nothing to do with your affairs you must know you have in a measure mixed yourself up with my affairs i am one of the original subscribers to the house of martha and used to take a good deal of interest in the establishment as was my right and privilege but the sisters bored me after a time and as i have been traveling in europe for more than a year i now know very little of what has been going on there but if there is a young woman in that house who prefers marriage to hospital life and tailormade costumes to ashbags i say that she has mistaken her vocation and ought to be helped out of it and although i know you to be a pretty peppery gentleman i am perfectly willing to help her in your direction if that is the way she wants to go i offer myself to you as an ally take me on your side and tell me all about it it would be perfectly ridiculous to let me go down there imagining that this or that underdonegriddlecakefaced young woman was your ladylove i might make mistakes and do more harm than good  madam i replied let us have done with this i have never said one word to the young lady in question of my feelings toward her and it is in the highest degree improper and unjust that she should be discussed in connection with them i have laid the matter before mother anastasia as she stands in position of parent to the young lady but with no one else can i possibly act or even discuss the subject and i bowed  i dont like this she said without noticing that i had taken leave of her mother anastasia did not intend to leave here until tomorrow and she went away early this morning she has some pressing business on hand and ten chances to one she has gone to fillip your young lady out of your sight and hearing dont you see that it would not look at all well for one of her sisters to marry or even to receive the attentions of a gentleman immediately after she had left the institution  this suggestion so like my own suspicions greatly disturbed me  are you in earnest said i or is all this chaffer what reasonable interest can you take in me and my affairs  i take no interest whatever said she excepting that i have heard you are both eccentric and respectable and that i have found you amusing and in this class of people i am always interested but i will say to you that if there is a woman in that house who might make a suitable and satisfactory marriage if an opportunity were allowed her i believe she should be allowed the opportunity and acting upon general principles of justice and a desire to benefit my fellowmortals i should use my influence to give it to her so you see that i should really be acting for the girl and not for you although of course it would amount to the same thing and if mother anastasia has gone to pull down the curtain on this little drama i am all the more anxious to jerk it up again come now mr lover in checkand when i first heard your name i had no idea how well it fittedconfide in me it would delight me to be in this fight and you can see for yourself that it would be a very humdrum matter for me to join your opponents even if i should be of their opinion they do not need my help  this argument touched me i needed help should mother anastasia choose to close the doors of the house of martha against me what could i do it might divert this lady to act on my behalf if she procured an interview for me with sylvia i would ask no more of her there was nothing to risk except that sylvia might be offended if she heard that she had been the object of compacts but something must be risked otherwise i might be simply butting my head against monastic brickwork  madam said i whatever your motives may be i accept your offer to fight on my side and the sooner the battle begins the better the young lady to whom i wish to offer myself in marriage and with whom i am most eager to meet is miss sylvia raynor a novice or something of the kind in the house of martha  with her brows slightly knitted as if she did not exactly understand my words my companion looked at me for an instant then her eyes sparkled her lips parted and a flush of quick comprehension passed over her face she put back her head and laughed until she almost lost her breath i looked upon her shocked and wounded to the soul  pardon me she said her eyes filled with the tears of laughter but it cant be helped i withdraw my offer i cannot be on your side at least just now but i shall remain neutralyou can count on that and still laughing she went her way  any one more disagreeably unpleasant than this woman i had never met when i told walkirk what had happened i could not restrain my burning indignation and i declared i would not remain another hour on the island with her he listened to me with grave concern  this is very unfortunate he said but do not let us be precipitate     xxviii  the floating grocery   i now positively decided that the next day i would leave this island where people flew off at such disagreeable tangents but as i was here on invitation i could not go away without taking leave of my hostess accordingly in the evening walkirk and i went up to the house  the sand lady was manifestly grieved when she heard of our intended departure and her brother was quite demonstrative in his expressions of regret even the shell man who had discovered in walkirk some tastes similar to his own demurred at our going the person however made no allusion to the subject and gave us indeed as little of her society as she apparently did of her thoughts  in order not to produce the impression that i was running after mother anastasia as walkirk had put it i announced that we should continue our cruise for an indefinite time i was sorry to leave these good people but to stay with that mocking enigma of a woman was impossible she had possessed herself in the most crafty and unwarrantable manner of information which she had no right to receive and i had no right to give and then contemptuously laughed in my face my weakness may have deserved the contempt but that made no difference in my opinion of the woman who had inflicted it upon me i was glad when we bade goodnight and farewell to the little party that the person was not present  but early the next morning just as we were hoisting sail on our boat this lady appeared walking rapidly down to our beach she was dressed in a light morning costume with some sort of a gauzy fabric thrown over her head and if i had not hated her so thoroughly i should have considered her a very picturesque and attractive figure  i am glad i am in time she called out i dont want you to go away with too bad an opinion of me and i came to say that what you have confided to me is just as safe with me as it would be with anybody else do you think you can believe that if you try  it was impossible for me to make any answer to this woman but i took off my hat and bowed the sail filled and we glided away  walkirk was not in good spirits it was plain enough that he liked the tangent island and wanted to stay and he had good reason for he had found pleasant company and this could not always be said to be the case when sailing in a small boat or camping out with me my intention was to sail to a town on the mainland some thirty miles distant there leave our boat and take a train for arden this i considered was sacrificing to appearances as much time as i could allow  but the breeze was light and fitful and we made but little progress and about the middle of the forenoon a fog came slowly creeping up from the sea it grew thicker and heavier until in an hour or two we were completely shut out from all view of the world about us there was now no wind our sail hung damp and flabby moisture silence and obscurity were upon us  the rest of the day we sat doleful waiting for the fog to lift and the wind to rise my fear was that we might drift out to sea or upon some awkward shoals for though everything else was still the tide would move us what walkirk feared if anything i do not know but he kept up a good heart and rigged a lantern some little distance aloft which he said might possibly keep vessels from running into us he also performed at intervals upon a cornet which he had brought with him this was a very wise thing to do but for some reason or other such music in a fog depressed my spirits however as it seemed quite suitable to the condition of my affairs i did not interfere and the notes of bonnie doon or my old kentucky home continued to be soaked into the fog  night came on the fog still enveloped us and the situation became darker we had our supper and i turned in with the understanding that at midnight i was to take the watch and let walkirk sleep it was of no use to make ourselves any more uncomfortable than need be  it was between two and three oclock when i was called to go on watch and after i had been sitting in the stern smoking and thinking for an hour or more i noticed that the light on the mast had gone out it was however growing lighter and fancying that the fog was thinner i trusted to the coming of the day and a breeze and made no attempt to take down and refill the lantern  not long after this my attention was attracted by something which appeared like the nucleus of a dark cloud forming in the air a short distance above the water and not far away on our port quarter rapidly the cloud grew bigger and blacker it moved toward us and in a few moments before i had time to collect my thoughts and arouse walkirk it was almost upon us and then i saw that it was the stern of a vessel looming high above my head  i gave a wild shout walkirk dashed out of his bunk there was a call from above then i felt a shock and our boat keeled over on her starboard side in a moment however she receded from the other vessel and righted herself i do not know that walkirk had ever read in a book what he ought to do in such an emergency but he seized a boat hook and pushed our boat away from the larger vessel  thats right cried a voice from above ill heave ye a line keep her off till we have drifted past ye and then ill haul ye in  slowly the larger vessel which was not very large but which drifted faster than our little boat floated past us until we were in tow at her bow we could now see the form of a man leaning over the rail of the vessel and he called out to us to know if we were damaged and if we wanted to come aboard i was about to reply that we were all right and would remain where we were when walkirk uttered an exclamation  we are taking in water by the bucketful said he our side has been stove in  impossible i exclaimed we were not struck with enough force for that  but examination proved that he was correct one or more of our planks had been broken just below the water line and our boat was filling though not rapidly  stoved in eh shouted the voice from above well ye neednt sink ill haul yer bowline taut and ill heave ye another to make fast to yer stern thatll keep yer little craft afloat until ye can unlade her and the quicker ye get yer traps up here the better if ye dont want em soaked  acting upon these suggestions walkirk and i went vigorously to work and passed up our belongings as rapidly as possible to the man above who by leaning over the rails could easily reach them when everything movable had been taken out of our boat the man let down a ladder and i climbed on board the larger vessel after which he came down to our boat detached the boom gaff and sail and unshipped the mast all of which we afterwards hoisted on board his vessel by means of a block and tackle  now then said our new companion yere safe and yer boat can capsize if its a mind to but it cant sink and when its better daylight and abners on deck perhaps well rig out a couple of spars and haul her up at the stern but theres time enough to settle all that and now id like to know how ye came to be driftin around here with no light out  i explained but added i had not seen any light on his vessel  well said the man looking upward that lights out and ten to one it was out when we run inter ye ispect abner didnt calkerlate for fillin it for day work and night work too  the speaker was a grizzled man middleaged and rather too plump for a sailor he had a genial goodnatured countenance and so far as i could see was the only occupant of the vessel  his craft was truly a peculiar one it was slooprigged and on the after part of the deck occupying about one third of the length of the vessel was a structure resembling a small onestoried house which rose high above the rest of the deck like the poop of an oldfashioned manofwar in the gable end of this house which faced upon the deck there was a window and a door the boom of the mast was rigged high enough to allow it to sweep over the roof  i reckon you gents think this is a queer kind of a craft said the man with a grin of pleasure at our evident curiosity and if ye think that ye are about right for there isnt jist such another one as far as i know this is a floating grocery and i am captain of the sloop or keeper of the store jist as it happens in that house there is a good stock of flour sugar feed trimmings notions and small dry goods with some tinware and pottery and a lot of other things which you commonly find in a country grocery store i have got the trade of about half the families in this bay all of them on the islands and a good many of them on the mainland especially sech as has piers of their own i have regular days for touching at all the different pints and it is a mighty nice thing i can tell ye to have yer grocery store come round to ye instead of yer having to go to it especially if ye live on an island or out in the country  walkirk and i were very much interested in this floating grocery store which was an entirely novel thing to us and we asked a good many questions about it  theres only me and abner aboard said the grocerskipper but thats enough for we do a good deal more anchorin than sailin abner hes head clerk and dont pretend to be no sailor at all but he lays a hold of anythin i tell him to and thats all i ask of him in the sailorin line but he is first class behind the counter i can tell ye and in keepin the books i couldnt find nobody like abnernot in this state now it may strike ye gents that i am not much of a sailor neither to be driftin about here at night in this fog instead of anchorin and tootin a foghorn but ye see i did anchor in the fore part of the night and after abner had gone to his bunkwe dont keep regular watches but kinder divide the night between us when we are out on the bay which isnt common for we like to tie up at night and do our sailin in the daytimeit struck me that as the tide was runnin out we might as well let it take us to simpsons bar which if ye dont know this bay is a big shallow place where there is always water enough for us bein a good deal on the flatbottomed order but where almost any steamin craft at low tide would stick in the mud before they could run into us so thinks i if we want to get on in the direction of widder kinleys whose is the last house i serve down the bay and to feel safe besides we had better up anchor and i upped it but i had ought to remembered about that light it wasnt the square thing to be driftin about without the light no more fur me than fur ye ive sounded a good many times but we dont seem to have reached the bar yet it must be pretty near time for abner to turn out and he looked at his watch  your assistant must be a sound sleeper i remarked  yes he is replied the man he needs lots of sleep and i make it a pint to give it to him if it isnt positively necessary i dont wake him up until the regular time of course if it had been our boat that had been stoved in and she had been like to sink id have called abner but as it was yer boat and none of us was in no danger i didnt call him here he is though on time  at this a tall lean man not quite so much grizzled as the other made his appearance on deck he gazed from one to the other of us and upon our various belongings which were strewn upon the deck with undisguised amazement  his companion laughed aloud i dont wonder abner he cried that ye open yer eyes t aint often two gentlemen come on board in the night bag and baggage but these two stoved in their boat agin our rudder and here they are with their craft triced up to keep her from sinkin  abner made no answer but walked to the side of the vessel looked over and satisfied himself that this last statement was correct  captn jabe said he turning to the other we cant sail much can we with that thing hangin there  well now abner replied the captain we are not sailin at the present timewe are driftin for it is my idee to drop anchor as soon as we get to simpsons bar and this tide is bound to carry us over it if we wait long enough so we must keep soundin and not slip over without knowin it  it strikes me said abner that we should save a lot of trouble if we should put the anchor out and let it hang then when we come to the bar shell ketch and fetch us up without our havin it on our minds  you see gents said captain jabe to us abner dont pretend to be no sailor but hes got his idees about navigation for all that  abner took no notice of this remark captn said he does these gents want to turn in  not till they have had some breakfast replied captain jabe and we assented  all right said abner ill tackle the grub and opening the door of the grocery store he went inside in a few minutes he reappeared captn said he in a voice which he intended to be an aside are you goin to count em as mealers or as if they was visitin the family  captain jabe laughed well abner said he i guess we will count them as mealers though i dont intend to make no charge  abner nodded and again entered the little house  what are mealers i asked of the captain  in this part of the country he answered theres a good many city folks comes for the summer and they take houses but they dont want the trouble of cookin so they make a contract with some one livin near to give them their meals regular and this sort of folks goes by the general name of mealers what abner wanted to know fur was about openin the cans you see most of our victuals is in cans and if abner knowed you was regular payin mealers he would open fresh ones but if you was visitin the family hed make you help eat up what was left in the cans just as we do ourselves  it was not long before the thrifty abner had given us a substantial breakfast and then walkirk and i were glad to take possession of a spare couple of bunks for we were tired and sleepy and the monotonous fog still hung around us  it was about noon when i waked and went on deck where i found walkirk captain jabe and abner engaged in consultation there was a breeze blowing and every particle of fog had disappeared  weve been considerin said the captain addressing me whats the best thing to do with yer boat theres no use tryin to tinker her up for she has got a bad hole in her and it is our fault too one of the iron bands on our rudder got broke and sprung out a good while ago and it must have been the sharp end of that which punched into yer boat when we drifted down on her we aint got no tackle suitable to hist her on board and as to towin hera big boat like that full of watert aint possible weve lost a lot of time already and now theres a good wind and we are bound to make the best of it so me and abner thinks the best thing ye can do is to sink yer boat right here on the bar where we are now anchored having struck it all right as ye see and mark the spot with an oilcag anybody that knows this bay can come and git her if she is on simpsons bar buoyed with an oilcag  i was sorry that we should not be able to repair our boat and continue our trip in her but i saw that this would be impossible and i asked captain jabe if he could take us to brimley  i can do that he answered but not straight i have got fust to sail over to widder kinleys which is on that pint which ye can just see over there on the edge of the water and where i was due yesterday afternoon then ive got to touch at three or four other places along the east shore and then if this wind holds i guess i can git across the bay to my own house where i have got to lay up all day tomorrow the next day is saturday and then i am bound to be in brimley to take in stock there ye two gents can take the cars for wherever ye want to go and if ye choose to give me the job of raisin yer boat and sendin it to its owners ill do it for ye as soon as i can fix things suitable and will charge ye just half price for the job considerin that nuther of us had our lights out and we ought to share damages  i agreed to the proposed disposition of our boat and asked captain jabe if i could not hire him to take us direct to brimley  no sir he answered i never pass by my customers especially widder kinley for she is the farthest off of any of them  and she must be lookin out sharp for us too said abner for she bakes thursdays and she ought to sot her bread last night  and i am a great deal afeard continued captain jabe that her yeast cakes wont be any too fresh when she gits em and the quicker that boats down to the bottom and our anchor up off the bottom the better it will be for the widder kinleys batch of bread  in the course of half an hour an empty oilkeg was moored over the spot where our boat lay upon the sandy bar and we were sailing as fast as such an unwieldy vessel with her mainsail permanently reefed above the roof of her grocery store could be expected to sail our tacks were long and numerous and although walkirk and i lent a hand whenever there was occasion for it and although there was a fair wind the distant point rose but slowly upon our horizon  i hope i remarked to captain jabe that the widow kinley will buy a good bill of you after you have taken all this trouble to get to her  dunno said he she dont generally take more than she has ordered the week before and all she has ordered this time is two yeast cakes  do you mean exclaimed walkirk that you are taking all this time and trouble to deliver two yeast cakes worth i suppose four cents  thats the price on em said the captain but if the widder kinley didnt git em she wouldnt do no bakin this week and that would upset her housekeepin keel up  late in the afternoon we delivered the yeast cakes to the widow kinley whom we found in a state of nervous agitation having begun to fear that another night would pass without her bread being sot then we coasted along the shore tying up at various little piers where the small farmers and fishermens families came on board to make purchases  now abner was in his glory wearing a long apron made of blueandwhite bedticking he stood behind the counter in the little house on deck and appeared to be much more at ease weighing sugar coffee and flour than in assisting to weigh anchor i seated myself in the corner of this floating grocery crowded shelves floor and counter with such goods as might be expected to be found at an ordinary country store  it seemed to me that nearly every one who lived near the points at which we touched came on board the floating grocery but most of them came to talk and not to buy many of those who did make purchases brought farm produce or fish with which to trade it was an interesting spectacle and amused me during our slow progress from one place to another captain jabe told me of an old woman who once offered him an egg which she wished to take out in groceries half in tea and half in snuff  we dont often do business down as fine as that said the captain but then on the other hand we dont calkerlate to supply hotels and couldnt if we wanted to  walkirk appeared uneasy at the detentions which still awaited us  couldnt you take us straight on to brimley he asked of the captain and sail back to your home in the morning  no sir answered captain jabe with much decision my old woman spects me tonightin pint of fact she spected me a good deal before nightand i am not goin to have her thinkin i am run down in a fog and am now engaged in feedin the sharks there is to be a quiltin party at our house tomorrer arternoon and theres a lot to be done to get ready for it abner and me will have to set up pretty late this night i can tell yer  is there no way of getting to the railroad i asked but by your boat  no said captain jabe i cant see that there is pretty nigh all the folks that will be at the bee tomorrow will come in boats none of them live nigh to a railroad station and if they did and could take ye back with em they wouldnt leave early enough for ye to ketch the last train so the best thing ye can do is to stick by me and ill guarantee to git ye over to brimley in time for the mornin train on saturday     xxix  fantasy   we reached captain jabes house a little after nightfall and received a hearty welcome and a good supper from his wife walkirk and i slept on board the floating grocery as also did abner that is to say if he slept at all for he and the captain were busy at the house when we retired the quilting party we were informed was expected to be a grand affair provided of course there were no signs of rain for country people are not expected to venture out for pleasure in rainy weather  captain jabes house as we saw it the next morning was a goodsized waterside farmhouse widespreading and lowroofed the place had a sort of amphibious appearance as if depending for its maintenance equally upon the land and the water the house stood a little distance back from the narrow beach and in its front yard a net was hung to dry and to be mended a small boat in course of repair lay upon some rude stocks while bits of chain an old anchor several broken oars and other nautical accessories were scattered here and there  at the back of the house however there was nothing about the barn the cowyard the chickenyard and the haystacks to indicate that captain jabe was anything more than a thrifty smallfarmer but farmer and sailor as he was captain jabe was none the less a grocer and i think to this avocation he gave his chief attention  he took me into a small room by the side of his kitchen and showed me what he called his sinkin fund stock  here ye see said he is canned fruit and vegetables smoked and salted meat and fish cheeses biscuits and a lot of other things that will keep none of these is this years goods some of them have been left over from last year some from the year before that and some is still older whenever i git a little short i put a lot of these goods on board and sell em with the discount offtwenty per cent for last years stock forty per cent off for the year before that and so on back so ye see if i have got anythin on hand that is five years old i am bound to give it away for nothin if i stick to my principles at fust me and my old woman tried eatin what was left over but discount isnt no good to her and she wants the best victuals that is goin did ye ever think sir what this world would be without canned victuals  i assured him that i never had but would try to do so if possible  the day proved to be a very fine one and early in the afternoon the people invited to the quilting party began to arrive and by two oclock the affair was in full swing the quilting frame was set up in a large chamber at the right of the parlor the comfortable to be quilted was stretched upon it and at the four sides sat as many matrons and elderly maidens as could crowd together each with needle in hand long cords rubbed with chalk were snapped upon the surface of the quilt to mark out the lines to be stitched wax thread and scissors were passed from one to another and every woman began to sew and to talk as fast as she could  i stood in the doorway and watched this scene with considerable interest for i had never before seen anything of the kind the quilting ladies to every one of whom i had been presented cordially invited me to enter and take a seat with them some of the more facetious offering to vacate their places in my favor and more than that to show me how to thread and use a needle i found from their remarks that it was rather an unusual thing for a man to take an interest in this part of the proceedings at a quilting party  after a time i went into the parlor which room was then occupied by the young men and young women it was ever so much pleasanter outofdoors than in this somewhat gloomy and decidedly stuffy parlor but as these people were guests at a quilting party they knew it was proper to enjoy themselves within the house to which they had been invited  the young folks were not nearly so lively and animated as their elders in the next room but they had just begun to play a game which could be played in the house and in which every one could participate and as the afternoon wore on they would doubtless become warmed up walkirk was making the best of it and had entered the game but i declined all invitations to do so  before long there was some laughing and a good deal of romping and i fancied that the girls some of whom were not at all bad looking would have been pleased if i had joined in the sport but this did not suit me i still was as i declared myself a lover in check and the society of young women was not attractive to me  i went outside where a group of elderly men were discussing the tax rates and after remaining a few minutes with them i came to the conclusion that the pleasantest thing i could do would be to take a stroll over the country  i made my way over some rolling meadow land where three or four of captain jabes cows were carefully selecting the edible portions of the herbage and having passed the crest of a rounded hill i found myself on the edge of a piece of woodland which seemed to be of considerable extent this suited my mood exactly and i was soon following the curves and bends of a rude roadway in places almost overgrown by vines and bushes which led me deeper and deeper into the shadowed recesses of the woods it was now about four oclock in the afternoon the sun was still well up and out in the open the day was warm for an upanddownhill stroll but here in the woods it was cool and quiet and the air was full of the pleasant summer smells that come from the trees the leaves and the very earth of the woods  it was not long before i came upon a stream of a character that somewhat surprised me it was not very wide for at this spot the trees met above it darkening its waters with their quivering shadows but it was evidently deep much deeper than the woodland streams of its size to which i had been accustomed i would have liked to cross it and continue my walk but i saw no way of getting over with a broken branch i sounded the water near the shore and found it over two feet deep and as it was no doubt deeper toward the middle i gave up the idea of reaching the other side but as i had no particular reason for getting over especially as i should be obliged to get back again i contented myself easily with my present situation and taking a seat on the upheaved root of a large tree i lighted a cigar and gave myself up to the delights of this charming solitude i was glad to be away from everybody even from walkirk the companion i had chosen for my summer journey  there were insects gently buzzing in the soft summer air on the other side of the stream in a spot unshadowed by the trees the water was sparkling in the sunlight and every little puff of the fitful breeze brought to me the smell of wild grapes from vines which hung from the trees so low that they almost touched the water it was very still in these woods i heard nothing but the gently rustling leaves the faint buzzing in the air and an occasional tiny splash made by some small fish skimming near the surface of the stream when i sat down on the root of the tree i intended to think reflect make plans determine what i should do next but i did nothing of the sort i simply sat and drank in the loveliness of this woodland scene  the stream curved away from me on either hand and the short stretch of it which i could see to the left seemed to come out of the very heart of the woods suddenly i heard in this direction a faint regular sound in the water as if some animal were swimming i could not see anything but as the sounds grew stronger i knew that it must be approaching i did not know much of the aquatic animals in this region perhaps it might be an otter a muskrat i knew not what but whatever it was i wanted to see it and putting down my cigar i slipped softly behind the tree at whose foot i had been sitting  now the swimming object was in view coming rapidly toward me down the middle of the stream there was but little of it above the water and the shadows were so heavy that i could see nothing but a dark point with a bright ripple glancing away from it on either side nearer and nearer it came into the better lighted portion of the stream it was not a small animal the ripples it made were strong and ran out in long lines its strokes were vigorous the head that i saw grew larger and larger steadily it came on it reached the spot in the clear light of the sun it was the head of a human swimmer on the side nearest me i could see under the water the strokes of a darkclad arm above the water was only a face turned toward me and upward a mass of long hair swept away from it its blue eyes gazed dreamily into the treetops for a moment the sunbeams touched its features my heart stopped beatingit was the face of sylvia  another stroke and it had passed into the shadow the silvery ripples came from it to me losing themselves against the shore it passed on and on away from me i made one step from behind the tree then suddenly stopped on went the head and upturned face touched once more by a gleam of light and then it disappeared around a little bluff crowned with a mass of shrubbery and vines i listened breathless the sounds of the strokes died away all was still again  for some minutes i stood bewildered dazed doubting whether i had been awake or dreaming my mind could not grasp what had happenedeven my imagination could not help me but one thing i knew whether this had all been real or whether it had been a dream i had seen the face of sylvia this i knew as i knew i lived  slowly i came away scarcely knowing how i walked or where i emerged from the woods and crossed the open country to the house of captain jabe     xxx  a discovery   i found the quilting party at supper i could see them through the open windows of the large livingroom and i heard their chatter and laughing when i was still a considerable distance from the house with my mind quivering with the emotions excited by what had happened in the woods it was impossible for me to join a party like this i walked around the barn and into a little orchard where between two gnarled appletrees there hung an old hammock into which i threw myself  there i lay piling conjecture and supposition high upon each other but not at all could i conjecture how it was that the face which i had last seen in my own home under the gray bonnet of a sister of martha should flash upon my vision in this faraway spot and from the surface of a woodland stream  it was growing dusky when i heard a loud whistle and my name was called i whistled in return and in a few moments walkirk came running to me  i was beginning to get frightened he said i have been looking everywhere for you we have had supper and the party is breaking up there is no moon tonight and the people must start early for their homes  let them all get away i replied and when they are entirely out of sight and hearing let me know and ill go in to supper  i am afraid said walkirk hesitating that they will not like that you know these country people are very particular about leavetaking and all that sort of thing  i cant help it i answered i dont feel at all like seeing people at present you can go and bid them goodby in my name  as an understudy said he smiling well if i can tell them you are out of condition and not feeling like yourself that will make it all right and will also explain why you kept yourself away all the afternoon with this he left me promising to return when the guests had departed it was a long time before he came back and it was then really dark  your supper is awaiting you he announced and i am afraid that mrs jabe is contemplating a hot footbath and some sort of herb tea and we ought to turn in pretty early tonight for captain jabe has announced that he will sail between four and five oclock in the morning  walkirk said i sitting up in the hammock i have no intention of sailing tomorrow i prefer to stay here for a time i dont know for how long  stay here exclaimed walkirk what on earth can you do here what possible attraction can this place have  my good walkirk i said rising and walking toward the house i am here and here i want to stay reasons are the most awkward things in the world they seldom fit let us drop them perhaps if captain and mrs jabe think i did not treat their company with proper courtesy they may feel that i am making amends by desiring to stay with them any way i am going to stay  captain jabe and his wife were very much surprised when i announced my intention of remaining at their place for a day or two longer but as i had surmised they were also flattered  this is a quiet place said the captain but as ye aint very well and seem to like to keep to yerself i dont see why it shouldnt suit ye theres plenty o good air and fishin if ye want it and we can accommodate ye and give ye plenty to eat i shall be back tomorrow night and expect to stay home over sunday myself  walkirk was very much dissatisfied and made a strong attempt to turn me from my purpose if you intend to do anything in regard to miss raynor he said i really think you ought to get home as soon as you can mother anastasia is now having everything her own way you know  walkirk said i you blow hot and cold if it had not been for you i should be home this minute but you dissuaded me from a hot chase after mother anastasia and now my ardor for the chase has cooled and i am quite inclined to let that sport wait  walkirk looked at me inquiringly it was evident that he did not understand my mood  the next morning i found myself in a quandary i had determined to make a long tramp inland and if necessary to ford or swim streams and i could not determine whether or not it would be wise to take walkirk with me i concluded at last to take him it would be awkward to leave him behind and he might be of use we provided ourselves with fishing rods and tackle and two pairs of wadingboots as well as with a luncheon basket well filled by mrs jabe and started on our expedition i felt in remarkably good spirits  i had formed no acceptable hypothesis in regard to what i had seen the day before but i was going to do something better than that i was going to find out if what had occurred could possibly be real and actual if i should be convinced that this was impossible then i intended to accept the whole affair as a dream which had taken place during an unconscious nap  when we reached the woodland stream walkirk gazed about him with satisfaction this looks like sport he said i see no reason why there should not be good fishing in this creek i did not suppose we should find such pleasant woods and so fine a stream in captain jabes neighborhood  you must know said i that i have a talent for exploration and discovery had it not been for this stream i should not have thought of such a thing as allowing captain jabe and abner to sail off by themselves this morning  really replied walkirk you care much more for angling than i supposed  truly i cared very little for angling but i had discovered that walkirk was an indefatigable and patient fisherman i had intended that he should cross the stream with me but it now occurred to me that it would be far better to let him stay on this side while i pursued my researches alone accordingly i proposed that he should fish in the part of the stream which i had seen the day before while i pressed on farther in this way i remarked artfully we shall not interfere with each other had i supposed that there was the slightest possibility of the appearance on the stream of the apparition of the day before i should have requested walkirk to fish from the top of a distant tree but i had no fears on this score if what i had seen had been a phantasm my understudy would have to doze to see it and i knew he would not do that and if what i had seen was real it would not appear this morning for the water was too low for swimming the creek as i now perceived was affected by the tide and its depth was very much less than on the preceding afternoon  i turned to the right and followed the stream for some distance now walking by its edge and now obliged by masses of undergrowth to make a detour into the woods at last i came to a spot where the stream although wide appeared shallow in fact even in the centre i could see the stones at the bottom i therefore put on my wadingboots and boldly crossed the woods here were mostly of pine free from undergrowth and with the ground softened to the foot by a thick layer of pine needles  now that i was on the other side of the creek i desired to make my way out of the woods which could not i imagined be very extensive to discover a real basis for yesterdays vision i believed that it would be necessary to reach open country leaving the stream behind me it was not long before i came to a rude pathway and although this seemed to follow the general direction of the creek i determined to turn aside from the course i was taking and follow it after walking for nearly a mile sometimes seeing the waters of the stream and sometimes entirely losing sight of them i found the path making an abrupt turn and in a few minutes was out of the woods  the country before me was very much like that about captain jabes residence there were low rolling hills covered with coarse grass and ragged shrubbery with here and there a cluster of trees not a sign of human habitation was in sight reaching the top of a small hill i saw at my right and not very far before me a wide expanse of water this i concluded must be the bay although i had not expected to see it in this direction  i went down the hill toward the shore if what i seek is in reality i said to myself it will naturally love to live somewhere near the water near the beach i struck a path again and this i followed my mind greatly agitated by the thoughts of what i might discover as well as by the fear that i might discover nothing  after a walk of perhaps a quarter of an hour i stopped suddenly i had discovered something i looked about me utterly amazed i was on the little beach which the sand lady had assigned to walkirk and me as a camping ground  i sat down vainly endeavoring to comprehend the situation out of the mass of wild suppositions and conjectures which crowded themselves into my mind there came but one conviction and with that i was satisfied sylvia was here  it mattered not that the sand lady had said that hers was the only house upon the island it mattered not that captain jabe had said nothing of his neighbor in truth nothing mattered one sister of the house of martha had come to this place why not another what i had seen in the woods had been no fantasy sylvia was here     xxxi  taking up unfinished work   my reasons for believing that sylvia was on this island were circumstantial it is true but to me they were entirely conclusive and the vehement desire of my soul was to hasten to the house and ask to see her but i did not feel at all sure that this would be the right thing to do the circumstances of this case were unusual sylvia was a sister of a religious house it was not customary for gentlemen to call upon such sisters and the lady who was the temporary custodian of this one might resent such an attempt  it was however impossible for me entirely to restrain my impulses and without knowing exactly what i intended to do i advanced toward the house very soon i saw its chimneys above the trees which partly surrounded it then peeping under cover of a thicket i went still nearer so that if there had been any people in the surrounding grounds i could have seen them but i saw no one and i sat down on a log and waited it shamed me to think that i was secretly watching a house but despite the shame i continued to sit and watch  there was the flutter of drapery on a little porch my heart beat quickly my eyes were fixed upon the spot but nothing appeared except a maid who brought out some towels which she hung on a bush to dry then again i watched and watched  after a time four people came out from the house two of them carrying colored parasols i knew them instantly there was the middleaged man of the sea and his friend the shell man and there was the sand lady and my enemy who called herself a person they went off toward the little pier sylvia was not with them nor did she join them they entered their boat and sailed away they were going fishing as was their custom the fact that sylvia was not with them and that no one of them had stayed behind to keep her company caused my heart to fall in cases like mine it takes very little to make the heart fall the thought forced itself into my mind that perhaps after all i had seen a vision and had been building theories on dreams  suddenly the shutter of an upper window opened and i saw sylvia  it was truly sylvia she was dressed in white not gray her hair was massed upon her head there was no gray bonnet she looked up at the sky then at the trees and withdrew  my heart was beating as fast as it pleased my face was glowing and shame had been annihilated i sat and watched presently a door opened and sylvia came out  now i rose to my feet i must go to her it might not be honorable to take her at this disadvantage but there are moments when even honor must wait for a decision upon its case however there was no necessity for my going to sylvia she was coming to me  as she walked directly to the spot where i stood i saw sylvia as i had seen her in my daydreamsa beautiful girl dressed as a beautiful girl should dress in summer time in one hand she carried a portfolio in the other a little leathern case as she came nearer i saw that she was attired exactly as mother anastasia had been dressed when i met her here nearer she came but still she did not see me i was not now concealed but her eyes seemed fixed upon the path in which she was walking  when she was within a hundred feet of the thicket through which her path would lead i advanced to meet her i tried to appear cool and composed but i am afraid my success was slight as for sylvia she stopped abruptly and dropped her leathern case i think that at first she did not recognize me and was on the point of screaming suddenly to come upon a man in the midst of these solitudes was indeed startling  quickly however i made myself known and her expression of fright changed to one of amazement i am happy to say that she took the hand i offered her though she seemed to have no words with which to return my formal greeting in cases like this the one who amazes should not impose upon the amazed one the necessity of asking questions but should begin immediately to explain the situation  this i did i told sylvia how i had been accidentally brought to captain jabes house how i had strolled off in this direction and how delighted i was to meet her here in all this i was careful not to intimate that i had suspected her presence in this region while speaking i tried hard to think what i should say when she should remark then you did not know i was here but she did not make this remark she looked at me with a little puzzled wrinkle on her brow and said with a smile  it is absolutely wonderful that you should be here and i should not know it and that i should be here and you should not know it  ever since my meeting with mother anastasia it had been my purpose as soon as i could find or make an opportunity to declare to sylvia my love for her apart from my passionate yearning in this direction i felt that what i had done and attempted to say when i had parted from my secretary made it obligatory on me as a man of honor to say more the moment i should be able to do so  now the opportunity had come now we were alone together and i was able to pour out before her the burning words which so often in my hours of reverie had crowded themselves upon my mind the fates had favored me as i had had no reason to expect to be favored but i took no advantage of this situation i spoke no word of love i cannot say that sylvias demeanor cooled my affection but i can say that it cooled my desire for instantaneous expression of it after her first moments of astonishment her mind seemed entirely occupied with the practical unraveling of the problem of our meeting i endeavored to make this appear a very commonplace affair it was quite natural that my companion and i should come together to a region which he had before visited  yes said she i suppose all outoftheway things can be made commonplace if one reasons long enough as for me of course it is quite natural that needing a change from the house of martha i should come to my mothers island  your mother i stammered  yes she answered mrs raynor who spends her summers in that house over there is my mother her brother is here too and she has some friends with her mother anastasia was away recently on a little jaunt and when she came back she said that i looked tired and wan and that i ought to go to my mothers for a fortnight so i came that was all simple enough you see  simple enough could anything be more extraordinary more enigmatical i did not know what to say what course to pursue but in the midst of my surprise i had sense enough to see that until i knew more the less i said the better sylvia did not know that i had visited her mothers island and her mothers house it is possible that she did not know that mother anastasia had been here i must decide whether or not i would enlighten her on these points my disposition was to be perfectly open and frank with her and to be thus i must enlighten her but i waited and in answer to her statement merely told her how glad i was that she had a vacation and such a delightful place to come to she did not immediately reply but stood looking past me over the little vale beyond us  well here i am she said presently and in a very different dress from that in which you used to see me but for all that i am still a sister of the house of martha and so  so what i interrupted  i suppose i should go back to the house she answered  now i began to warm up furiously  dont think of it i exclaimed now that i have met you give me a few moments of your time let me see you as you are free and undisguised like other women and not behind bars or in charge of old sister sarah  wasnt she horrid said sylvia  indeed she was i replied and now cannot you walk a little with me or shall we sit down somewhere and have a talk  she shook her head even if mother and the rest had not gone away in the boat i could not do that you know  if she persisted in her determination to leave me she should know my love in two minutes but i tried further persuasion  we have spent hours together i said why not let me make you a little visit now  still she gently shook her head and looked away suddenly she turned her face toward me her blue eyes sparkled her lips parted and there was a flush upon her temples  there is one thing i would dearly like she said and i think i could stay for that will you finish the story of tomaso and lucilla  i shall be overjoyed to do it i cried in a state of exultation come let us sit over there in the shade at the bottom of this hill and i will tell you all the rest of that story  together we went down the little slope  you cant imagine she said how i have longed to know how all that turned out over and over again i have finished the story for myself but i never made a good ending to it it was not a bit like hearing it from you  i found her a seat on a low stone near the trunk of a tree and i sat upon the ground near by while my soul bounded up like a loosened balloon  happy thought she exclaimed i came out here to write letters not caring for fishing especially in boats how would you like me to write the rest of the story from your dictation  like it i could scarcely find words to tell her how i should like it  very well then said she opening her portfolio and taking out some sheets of paper my inkstand is in that case which you picked up please give it to me and let us begin now this is a very different affair i am finishing the work which the house of martha set me to do and i assure you that i have been very much dissatisfied because i have been obliged to leave it unfinished please begin  i cannot remember at this moment i said where we left off  i can tell you exactly she answered just as well as if i had the manuscript before me tomaso held lucilla by the hand the cart was ready in which he was to travel to the seacoast they were calling him to hurry and he was trying to look into her face to see if he should tell her something that was in his heart you had not yet said what it was that was in his heart there was a chance you know that it might be that he felt it necessary for her good that the match should be broken off  how did you arrange this in the endings you made i asked did you break off the match  dont let us bother about my endings she said i want to know yours     xxxii  tomaso and lucilla   on this happy morning sitting in the shade with sylvia i should have much preferred to talk to her of herself and of myself than to dictate the story of the sicilian lovers but if i would keep her with me i must humor her at least for a time and so as well as i could i began my story  the situation was however delightful it was charming to sit and look at sylvia her portfolio in her lap pen in hand and her blue eyes turned toward me anxiously waiting for me to speak it was so enchanting that my mind could with difficulty be kept to the work in hand but it would not do to keep sylvia waiting her pen began to tap impatiently upon the paper and i went on we had written a page or two when she interrupted me  it seems to me she said that if tomaso really starts for naples it will be a good while before we get to the end of the story so far as i am concerned you know i would like the story just as long as you choose to make it but we havent very much time and it would be a dreadful disappointment to me if i should have to go away before the story is ended  why do you feel in a hurry i asked if we do not finish this morning cannot i come to you tomorrow  oh no indeed she answered its only by the merest chance you know that i am writing for you this morning and i couldnt do it again that would be impossible in fact i want to get through before the boat comes back not that i should mind mother for she knows that i used to write for you and i could easily explain how i came to be doing it now and i should not care about uncle or mr heming but as for miss lanistonthat is the lady who is visiting usi would not have her see me doing this for anything in the world she hates the house of martha although she used to be one of its friends and i know that she would like to see me leave the sisterhood she ridicules us whenever she has a chance and to see me here would be simply nuts to her  is she a badtempered lady i asked do you know her very well could you trust her in regard to anything important  oh i know her well enough said sylvia she has always been a friend of the family she is wonderfully well educated and knows everything and has never married and travels all about by herself and is just as independent as she can be she has very strong opinions about things and doesnt hesitate to tell you them no matter whether she thinks you like it or not i have no doubt she is perfectly trustworthy and honorable and all that but if you knew her i do not think you would like her and you can easily see why i shouldnt want her to see me doing this it would give her a chance for no end of sneers at the work of the sisters  has she never said anything about your acting as my amanuensis i asked  no indeed replied sylvia you may be sure she never heard of that or she would have made fun enough of it  it was impossible for me to allow this dear girl to remain longer in ignorance of the true state of affairs  miss raynor i saidhow i longed to say sylviai am ashamed that i have allowed you to remain as long as this under a misunderstanding but in truth i did not understand the case myself i did not know that the lady of this house was your mother but i have met her and have been kindly entertained by her i did not know miss lanistons name but i have also met her and talked to her about you and she knows you used to write for me and i do not like her  sylvia answered not a word but as she sat and looked at me with wideopen eyes i told her what had happened since my companion and i had landed at racket island i omitted only my confidences to mother anastasia and miss laniston  mother anastasia has been here repeated sylvia and she never told me that surpasses all and mother never mentioned that you had been here nor did any one she gazed steadfastly upon the ground a little pale and presently she said i think i understand it but it need not be discussed and closing her portfolio she rose to her feet  sylvia i exclaimed springing up and stepping nearer to her it must be discussed ever since i parted from you at the window of your writingroom i have been yearning to speak to you i do not understand the actions of your family and friends but i do know that those actions were on your account and on mine they knew i loved you i have not in the least concealed the fact that i loved you and i hoped sylvia that you knew it  she stood her closed portfolio in one hand her pen in the other her eyes downcast and her face grave and quiet i cannot say she answered presently that i knew it although sometimes i thought it was so but other times i thought it was not so i was almost sure of it when you took leave of me at the window and tried to kiss my hand and were just about to say something which i knew i ought not to stay and hear it was when thinking about that morning in factand i thought about it a great dealthat i became convinced i must act very promptly and earnestly in regard to my future life and be true to the work i had undertaken to do and for this reason it was that i solemnly vowed to devote the rest of my life to the house of martha to observe all its rules and do its work  sylvia i gasped you cannot keep this vow when you made it you did not know i loved you it cannot hold it must be set aside  she looked at me for a moment and then her eyes again fell do not speak in that way she said it is not right of course i was not sure that you loved me but i suspected it and this was the very reason why i took my vow  it is plain then i exclaimed bitterly that you did not love me otherwise you would never have done that  dont you think said she that considering the sisterhood to which i belong we have already talked too much about that  if she had exhibited the least emotion i think i should have burst out into supplications that she would take the advice of her mother superior that she would listen to her friends that she would do anything in fact which would cause her to reconsider this step which condemned me to misery and her to a life for which she was totally unfitteda career in her case of such sad misuse of every attribute of mind and body that it wrung my heart to think of it but she stood so quiet so determined and with an air of such gentle firmness that words seemed useless in truth they would not come to me she opened her portfolio  i will give you these sheets that i have written she said by right they belong to you i am sorry the story was interrupted for i very much want to hear the end of it and now i never shall  i caught at a straw sylvia i cried let us sit down and finish the story we can surely do that come it is all ready in my mind i will dictate rapidly  she shook her head hardly she answered after what has been said here are your pages  i took the pages she handed me because she had written them  sylvia i exclaimed i shall finish that story and you shall hear it this i vow  i am going now she responded goodby  sylvia i cried quickly stepping after her as she moved away will you not say more than that will you not even give me your hand  i will do that she replied stopping if you will promise not to kiss it  i took her hand and held it a few moments without a word then she gently withdrew it  goodby again she said i dont want you to forget me but when you think of me always think of me as a sister of the house of martha  as i stood looking after her she rapidly walked toward the house and i groaned while thinking i had not told her that if she ever thought of me she must remember i loved her and would love her to the end of my life but in a moment i was glad that i had not said this after her words to me it would have been unmanly and besides i knew she knew it  when i lost sight of her in the grove by the house i turned and picked up the pages of the story of tomaso and lucilla which i had dropped in doing so i saw her inkstand with its open case near by it on the ground by the stone on which she had been sitting i put the inkstand in its case closed it and stood for some minutes holding it and thinking but i did not carry it away with me as a memento drawing down a branch of the tree i hung the little case securely by its handles to a twig where it would be in full view of any one walking that way     xxxiii  the distant topsail   i found walkirk still fishing near the place where i had left him  i was beginning to be surprised at your long absence he said and was thinking of going to look for you have you had good luck  this was a hard question to answer i smiled grimly i have not been fishing i answered i have been dictating my story to my nun  the rod dropped from the relaxed fingers of my understudy and he stood blankly staring at me and waiting for an explanation i gave it  depressed as i was i could not help feeling interested in the variety of expressions which passed over walkirks face as i related what had happened since i had seen him when i told him how near we were to our old camp on the sand ladys island he was simply amazed his astonishment when he heard of the appearance of sylvia on the scene was almost overpowered by his amusement as i related how she and i had continued the story of tomaso and lucilla in the shade of the tree but when i informed him of sylvias determination to devote her life to the work of the house of martha without regard to what i told her of my love he was greatly moved and i am sure sincerely grieved  this is too bad too bad he said i did not expect it  miss raynor is young i answered but the strength and integrity of her soul are greater and her devotion to what she believes her duty is stronger than i supposed her character is marked by a simple sincerity and a noble dignity which i have never seen surpassed i think that she positively dislikes the life of the sisterhood but having devoted herself to it she will stand firmly by her resolutions and her promise no matter what happens as regards myself i do not suppose that her knowledge of my existence has any influence on her one way or the other i may have interested and amused her but that is all if i had finished the italian lovestory i had been telling her i think she would have been satisfied never to see me again  walkirk shook his head i do not believe that he said her determination to rivet the bonds which hold her to her sisterhood shows that she was afraid of her interest in you and if it gave her reason to fear it gives you reason to hope  put that in the past tense please i replied whatever it may have given it gives nothing now to hope would be absurd  mr vanderley exclaimed walkirk i would not give up in that way i am certain from what i know that miss raynors interest in you is plain not only to herself but to her family and friends and i tell you sir that sort of interest cannot be extinguished by promises and resolutions if i were you i would keep up the fight she is not yet a vowed sister  walkirk said i offering him my hand you are a good fellow and although i cannot believe what you say i thank you for saying it  it was now long past noon and we were both ready for the luncheon which we had brought with us walkirk opened the basket and as he arranged its contents on the broad napkin which he spread upon the grass he ruminated  i think he remarked as we were eating that i begin to understand the situation at first i could not reconcile the facts with the sand ladys statement that no one lived on her island but her family but now i see that this creek must make an island of her domain and so it is that although captain jabe is her neighbor her statement is entirely correct  having finished our meal i lighted my pipe and sat down under a tree while walkirk with his rod wandered away along the bank of the stream after a while he returned and proposed that we try fishing near the eastern outlet of the creek where as the tide was coming in we might find better sport  that will be a very good thing for you to do said i but i shall not fish i am going to mrs raynors house  where exclaimed walkirk  i am going to speak to mrs raynor i answered whom i have known only as the sand lady but whom i must now know as sylvias mother i have determined to act boldly and openly in this matter i have made suit to mrs raynors daughter i have told other people of the state of my affections and i think i should lose no time having now the opportunity in conferring with mrs raynor herself  walkirks face was troubled  you do not approve of that i asked  since you ask me he answered i must say that i do not think it a wise thing to do if i properly understand miss raynors character her mother knows that you are here and if she is willing to have you visit her under the circumstances she will make a sign in fact i now think that she will make some sort of sign by which you can see how the land lies perhaps mrs raynor is on your side but i am afraid that if you should visit the house where miss raynor is it would set her mother against you i imagine she is a woman who would not like that sort of thing  walkirk said i your reasoning is very good but this is not a time to reasonit is a time to act and i am going to see mrs raynor this day  i hope it may all turn out well he replied and walked away gravely  i did not start immediately for the sand ladys house for a long time i sat and thought upon the subject of the approaching interview planning and considering how i should plead my case and what i should answer and how i should overcome the difficulties which would probably be pointed out to me  at last like many another man when in a similar predicament i concluded to let circumstances shape my plan of action and set forth for mrs raynors house the walk was a long one but i turned in order to pass under the tree where i had begun to dictate to sylvia and glad i was that i did so for to the twig on which i had hung the case containing her inkstand there was now attached a half sheet of note paper i ran to the tree eagerly seized the paper and read these few words that were written on it  thank you very much for taking such good care of my little case  now then said i to myself proudly gazing at these lines this is only a small thing but the girl who would write it and who would expect me to read it must be interested in me she believes that i would not fail to come here again therefore she believes in me that is a great point  for a moment i felt tempted to write something in reply and hang it on the tree twig but i refrained what i would write to sylvia must be read by no one but herself that tree was in a very conspicuous position and my tamest words to her must not hang upon it i carefully folded the paper and put it in my pocket and then greatly encouraged walked rapidly to the house  on the front piazza i found an elderly woman with a broom she knew me for she had frequently seen me during the time that i was encamped upon the island she was now greatly surprised at my appearance on the scene  why sir she exclaimed without waiting for me to speak have you come back to your camp it is too bad  i did not like this salutation but making no answer to it i asked quickly can i see mrs raynor  no indeed said she theyve gone every one of them and not an hour ago what a pity they did not know you were here  gone i cried where  theyve gone off in their yacht for a cruise returned the woman the vessel has been at brimley for more than a week being repaired and she got back this morning and as she was all ready to sail they just made up their minds that theyd go off in her for one of their little voyages they are so fond of and off they went in less than two hours  how long do they expect to be gone i asked  mrs raynor told me they would be away probably for a week or two the woman answered and she would stop somewhere and telegraph to me when she was coming back of course there isnt any telegraph to this island but when messages come to brimley they send them over in a boat  having determined to speak to mrs raynor and having set out to do so this undertaking appeared to me the most important thing in the world and one in which i must press forward without regard to obstacles of any kind  are they going to any particular place i said are they going to stop anywhere  there is only one place that i know of she answered and thats sanpritchit over on the mainland they expect to stop there to get provisions for the cruise for there was but little here that they could take with them they wanted to get there before dark and i dont doubt but that with this wind theyll do it if youll step to this end of the piazza sir perhaps you can see their topsail i saw it just before you came as they were beginning to make the long tack  yes there it is she continued when we reached the place referred to from which a vast stretch of the bay could be seen but not so much of it as i saw just now  their topsail i ejaculated  yes sir she said you cant see their mainsail because they are so far away and its behind the water in a manner  i stood silent for a few minutes gazing at the little ship suddenly a thought struck me do you think they will sail on sunday i asked  no sir she replied mrs raynor never sails on sunday and thats why i wondered after theyd gone why theyd started off on a saturday they will have to lay up at sanpritchit all day tomorrow and it seems to me it would have been a great deal pleasanter for them to stay here sunday and to have started on monday theres no church at sanpritchit or anything for them to do so far as i know unless miss raynor reads sermons to them which she never did here though shes a religious sister which perhaps you didnt know sir  sanpritchit over sunday i repeated to myself  its the greatest pity said the woman that they didnt know you and the other gentlemanthat is if he is with youwere coming back today for i am sure they would have been glad to take you with them theres room enough on that yacht and will be more for mr heming the gentleman that collects shells is not coming back with them they are to put him off somewhere and he is going home i have an idea though i wasnt told so that miss raynor is not coming back with the rest she brought very little baggage with her but she took a lot of things on board the yacht and that looks as if she wasnt coming back but bless me they went off in such a hurry i didnt have time to ask questions  i now turned to go but the woman obliged me to inform her that i had not come to camp on the island and that i was staying with captain jabe  when they go off in this way she said they take the maids and leave me and my husband in charge and if you should fancy to come here and camp again i know that mrs raynor would wish me to make things as comfortable for you as i can which too ill be very glad to do  i thanked her and went away this good woman said i to myself is the person who would have read my message to sylvia had i been foolish enough to hang one to the twig of the tree     xxxiv  the central hotel   captain jabez did not return until late that saturday evening but as soon as he set foot on shore i went to him and asked him if he could in any way get us to sanpritchit that night offering to pay him liberally for the service  ive got a sailboat said he and yed be right welcome to it if it was here but it aint here i lent it to captain neal of brimley having no present use for it and he wont bring it back till next week some time theres a dory here to be sure but sanpritchits twentyfive miles away and thats too far to go in a dory especially at night whats your hurry  i have very important business in sanpritchit i answered and if it is possible i must go there tonight  sanpritchits a queer place to have business in said captain jabe and its a pity ye didnt think of it this mornin when ye might have gone with me and took the train to barley and theres a stage from there to sanpritchit  captain jabez said i as there seems to be no other way for me to do this thing i will pay you whatever you may think the service worth if you will take me to sanpritchit in your grocery boat and start immediately it will be slow work traveling i know but i think we can surely get there before morning  the grocercaptain looked at me for a moment with his eyes half shut then he set down on the pier a basket which had been hanging on his arm and putting both hands in his pockets stared steadfastly at me  do you know he remarked presently that that ere proposition of yours puts me in mind of a story i heard of a california man and a new york man the california man had come east to spend the winter and the new york man was a business acquaintance o his the california man called at the new york mans office before business hours and when he found the new york man hadnt come down town yet he went up town to see him at his house it was a mighty fine house and the new york man being proud of it took the california man all over it look here said the california man what will you take for this house furniture and all just as it stands ill take a hundred and twenty thousand dollars said the new york man does that include all the odds and ends asked the california manold magazines umbrellas needles and pins empty bottles photographs candlesticks japanese fans coal ashes and all that kind of thing that make a house feel like a home my familys comin on from california with nothin but their clothes and i want a house they can go right into and feel at home even to the cold victuals for a beggar if one happens to come along if i throw in the odds and ends it will be one hundred and twentyfive thousand said the new york man thats all right said the california man and my family will arrive with their clothes on the train that gets here at 620 this afternoon so if your family can get out of the house before that time im ready to pay the money cash down all right said the new york man ill see that they do it and at ten minutes after six the new york family went out with their clothes to a hotel and at twenty minutes of seven the california family came to the house with their clothes and found everything all ready for em the servants havin agreed to stay at california wages  now then continued captain jabez i dont want to hurt nobodys feelins and i wouldnt say one word that would make the smallest infant think less of itself than it did afore i spoke but it does strike me that that there proposition of yours is a good deal like the california mans offer to the new york man  well said i that turned out very well each got what he wanted  yes replied captain jabez but this aint new york city no sir not by a long shot i am just as willin to accommodate a fellowman or a fellowwoman for that matter as any reasonable person is but if the president of the united states and queen victoria and the prophet isaiah was to come to me of a saturday night after id just got home from a weeks work and ask me to start straight off and take them to sanpritchit id tell em that id be glad to oblige em but it couldnt be done and thats what i say to ye sirneither more nor less and with this he picked up his basket and went into the house  i was not discouraged however and when the captain came out i proposed to him that he should take me to sanpritchit the next day  no sir said he i never have sailed my grocery boat on sunday and i dont feel like beginnin  i walked away but shortly afterward joined him on board his vessel which he was just about to leave for the night  captain i asked when does sunday end in this part of the country  well strictly speaking its supposed to end at sunset or commonly at six oclock  very well said i if you will start with me for sanpritchit at six oclock tomorrow evening i will pay you your price  i made this offer in the belief that with ordinary good fortune we could reach our destination before the raynor yacht weighed anchor on monday morning  captain jabez considered the matter i am going to sanpritchit on monday any way said he and if youre in such a hurry to be there the first thing in the morning id just as lieve sail tomorrow evening at six oclock as not  it was not much after the hour at which some people in that part of the country when they have a reason for it still believe that sunday comes to an end that the grocery boat left her pier with captain jabez abner walkirk and me on board there was nothing at all exhilarating in this expedition i wanted to go rapidly and i knew we should go slowly i had passed a dull day waiting for the time to start and to avoid thinking of the slow progress we should make i soon turned in  i woke very early and went on deck i do not know that i can remember a more disagreeable morning it was day but the sun was not up it was not cloudy but there was a filmy uncertainty about the sky that was more unpleasant than the clouds the air was cold raw and oppressive there was no one on deck but abner and he was at the wheel which on account of the grocery store occupying so large a portion of the after part of the vessel was placed well forward only a jib and mainsail were set and as i came on deck these were fluttering and sagging as abner carefully brought the vessel round now i saw that we were floating slowly toward the end of a long pier and that we were going to land  as i leaned over the side of the vessel i did not wonder that captain jabez thought sanpritchit was not much of a place to do business in there were few houses perhaps a dozen scattered here and there along a low shore which rose at one end of the place into a little bluff behind which i saw a mast or two on the pier was a solitary man and he was the only living being in sight it was that dreary time before breakfast when everything that seems cheerless is more cheerless everything that is sad more sad everything that is discouraging more discouraging and which rightminded persons who are able to do so spend in bed  gradually the vessel approached the pier and abner to whom i had not yet spoken for i did not feel in the least like talking left the wheel and as soon as he was near enough threw a small line to the man on the pier who caught it pulling ashore a cable with a loop in the end threw the latter over a post and in a few minutes the grocery boat was moored the man came on board and he and abner went below  it was too early to go on shore for nothing could be done at that bleak unearthly hour but i was in that state of nervous disquietude when any change is a relief and i stepped ashore i was glad to put my feet upon the pier now i felt that i was my own master it was too soon to go on board the yacht but i could regulate my movements as i pleased and was very willing to be alone during the hour or two in which i must remain inactive  i walked over the loose and warped planks of the pier the dull water rippling and flopping about the timbers beneath me inhaling that faint smell of the quiet water and soaked logs which is always a little dispiriting to me even at less dispiriting hours the crowing of one or two cocks made me understand how dreadfully still everything was the stillness of the very early morning is quite different from that of the night during the latter people are asleep and may be presumed to be happy in the former they are about to wake up and be miserable that at least was my notion as i walked into the little village  not a creature did i see not a sound did i hear except my own footsteps presently i saw a cat run around the corner of a house and this was a relief i walked on past a wide space in which there were no houses when i came to a small irregularly built white house in front of which hung a sign bearing the inscription central hotel if anything could have made me more disgusted with the world than i then was it was this sign if the name of this miserable little country tavern had been anything suitable to itself and the place if it had been called the plough and harrow the gray horse or even the blue devil i think i should have been glad to see it a village inn might have been a point of interest to me but central hotel in this mournful settlement of small farmers and fishermenit was ridiculous  however the door of the house was open and inside was a man sweeping the sanded floor when he saw me he stopped his work and stared at me  goodmornin he said dont often see strangers here so airly did ye come on the grocery boat i saw her puttin in do ye want a room time for a good nap before breakfast  i answered that i did not want a room but the remark about breakfast made me feel that i should like a cup of coffee and perhaps i might get it here it might have been a more natural thing to go back to the boat and ask abner to make me the coffee but i did not want to go back to the boat i did not want to wake walkirk i did not want to have him with me on shore i did not want to have him talk to me my present intention was to go to the yacht as soon as it was reasonable to suppose that its passengers were awake to see mrs raynor and say to her what i had to say i did not feel in the proper spirit for this but in the spirit in which i found myself the less i was trammeled by advice by suggestions of prudence and all that sort of thing the better it would be for me so i was very glad that my understudy was asleep on the grocery boat and hoped that he would remain in that condition until i had had my talk with sylvias mother  i put my request to the man and he smiled ye cant get no coffee he said until breakfast time and thats pretty nigh two hours off there is people in the place that have breakfast earlier than we do but we keep boarders ye know weve only got captain fluke now but generally have more and ye couldnt ask a man like captain fluke to git up to his breakfast before half past seven then ye dont want yer baggage sent fur perhaps yeve come ter see friends an its a little airly ter drop in on em come in any way and take a seat  i accepted the invitation sitting indoors might possibly be less dreary than walking outofdoors  now i tell ye what ye ought to do continued the man ye ought to take a nip of whiskey with some bitters in it its always kinder damp airly in the mornin and ye must feel it more bein in a strange place ive always thought a strange place was damper airly in the mornin than a place yere used ter and theres nothin like whiskey with a little bitters to get out dampness  i declined to partake of any central hotel whiskey adding that the one refreshment i now needed was a cup of coffee  but theres no fire in the kitchen said he and there wont be for ever so long thats how whiskey comes in so handy dont have to have no fire ye jes pour it out and drink it and theres the end of it  not always i remarked  yere right there said he with a smile a good deal depends on how much ye pour he turned away but stopped suddenly look here said he if ye say so ill make ye a cup of coffee ive got an alcohol lamp up there that i can boil water with in no time im out of alcohol but if youll pay for it ill fill the lamp with whiskey thatll burn just as well  i willingly agreed to his proposition and the man immediately disappeared into the back part of the house  i sat and looked about the little barroom in which there was absolutely nothing of the quaint interest which one associates with a country inn it was a bare cold hard sandy dirty room its air tainted with the stale odors of whiskey sugar and wood still wet from its morning mopping in less than fifteen minutes the man placed before me a cup of coffee and some soda biscuit the coffee was not very good but it was hot and when i had finished it i felt like another man  there now cried the barkeeper looking at me with great satisfaction dont that take the dampness out of ye i tell ye theres no such stiffener in the airly mornin as whiskey and if ye dont use it in one way ye can in another  truly the world seemed warmer and more cheerful the sun was brighter perhaps now it was not too early to go on board the yacht at any rate i would go near where she lay and judge for myself i made inquiries of the innkeeper in regard to mrs raynors yacht  yacht he said theres no yacht here  you must be mistaken i cried a yacht belonging to mrs raynor sailed for sanpritchit on saturday and it was not to leave here until this morning  sanpritchit he exclaimed this is not sanpritchit  what do you mean i asked in amazement that boat was bound direct for sanpritchit  captain jabes boat said the man yes and so she is she sails fur sanpritchit every monday mornin and generally stops here when shes got any freight ter leave fur the store though i never knowed her ter come so airly in the mornin  my conscience i exclaimed i must get on board of her  aboard of her said he shes been gone more n half an hour she dont often stop here more n ten minutes if shes got the tide with her which she had this mornin strong     xxxv  money makes the mare go   i rushed out of the central hotel and looked over the water but i could see nothing of the grocery boat she had disappeared beyond the bluff behind which i had stupidly taken it for granted mrs raynors yacht was lying  oh shes clean gone said the barkeeper who had joined me an shes not likely to come back agin wind an tide they must have thought you was asleep in your berth  this was undoubtedly the truth for there was no reason to suppose that any one on the boat knew i had gone on shore  where can i get a boat to follow them i cried  cant say exactly said the man weve got a big catboat but shes on the stocks gettin a new stern post put in you can see her mast stickin up over the bluff there i dont think theres any other sailboat in the place jes now and captain flukes havin his fresh painted i told him it was a bad time o the year to do it in but hes captain fluke and thats all theres to say about it theres rowboats but sanpritchits eight miles from here and its a putty long pull there and back and i dont know anybody here whod care to take it if ye want to go to sanpritchit ye ought to go in a wagon thats lots the easiest way  where can i get a horse and vehicle i asked quickly so much enraged with myself that i was glad to have some one to direct my movements  thats more n i know jes this minute said the man but if yell step inside and sit down ill go and ask em at the store what they can do fur ye if it aint open yet ill know where ter find em if anybody comes along for a mornin drink jes tell em to wait a minute and ill be back  in about fifteen or twenty minutes the barkeeper returned and announced that i could not hire the horse at the store for one of his hind shoes was off and they wanted to use him any way he had asked two or three other people also for the village was waking up by this time but none of them could let me have a horse  but ill tell ye what ye can do said the man if ye choose to wait here a little while the boss of this house went over to stipbitts last night to see his mother and i expect him back putty soon and i guess hell let ye have his hoss ye see the people about here aint used to hiring hosses and we is people as keeps hotels is expected to do it  there was nothing for me to do but to wait for the return of the landlord of central hotel and for very nearly an hour i walked up and down the main street of that wretched little hamlet the name of which i neither heard nor asked cursing my own stupidity and the incapacity of the waterside rustic  when the boss arrived he was willing to let me have his mare and his buckboard and a boy to drive me but the animal must be fed first and of course i would not start off without my breakfast as i had to wait and the morning meal was almost ready i partook of it but the mare gave a great deal more time to her breakfast than i gave to mine i hurried the preparations as much as i could and shortly after eight oclock we started my little expedition had the features of a useless piece of trouble but i had carefully considered the affair and concluded that i had a good chance of success almost any horse could take me eight miles in an hour and a half even with poor roads and from what i knew of the industrial methods of this part of the country i did not believe that the necessary supplies would be put on the yacht before half past nine therefore i did not allow myself to doubt that i should reach sanpritchit in time to see mrs raynor  the mare was a very deliberate traveler and the boy who sat beside me was an easily satisfied driver  we must go faster than this said i after we had reached what appeared to be a highroad or i shall not get to sanpritchit in time to attend to my business there  ye cant drive a hoss too fast when ye first set out answered the boy yell hurt a hoss if ye do that after a little while shell warm up and then shell go better oh she can go if shes a mind ter shes a rattler when she really gets goin  i dont want her to rattle said i but what is her ordinary rate of travelhow many miles an hour do you suppose  dont know as i ever counted the boy said some miles she goes faster and some miles she goes slower a good deal depends on whether its uphill or downhill  well said i taking out my watch we must keep her up to six miles an hour at least and then we shall do the eight miles by half past nine with something to spare  eight miles repeated the boy eight miles to where  sanpritchit replied i thats what they told me  oh thats by water said the driver but this roads got to go around the end of the bay and after that way round the top of the big marsh and that makes it a good seventeen miles to sanpritchit half past nine why the boss told me if i didnt get there before twelve i must stop somewhere and water the mare and give her some oats ive got a bag of them back there  i sat dumb of course with this conveyance and seventeen miles between me and sanpritchit it was absurd to suppose that i could get there before the yacht sailed it was ridiculous to go an inch farther on such a tedious and useless journey  boy i asked where is the nearest railroad station  stipbitts said he  how far  five miles  take me there i said  the boy looked at me in surprise i cant do that i was told to take you to sanpritchit thats where im goin and im goin to bring back a box belongin to captain fluke thats what i in goin to do  i cannot get there in time i said i didnt know it was so far take me to stipbitts and i will give you a dollar then you can go along and attend to captain flukes box i have already paid for the drive to sanpritchit  have you got as much as a dollar and a half about you asked the boy  i replied that i had  all right said he give me that and ill take you to stipbitts  the bargain was struck i was taken to stipbitts and an hour afterward i was on my way to my home at arden  there was one very satisfactory feature about this course of action it was plain and simple and needed no planning to attempt to follow the yacht would be useless to wait anywhere for walkirk would be equally so he would be more apt to find me at my home than anywhere else it was his business to find me and there was no doubt that he would do it i did not like to defer my intended interview with mrs raynor but it could not be helped and as for sylvia if she had resolved to return to the house of martha the best place for me was the neighborhood of that institution     xxxvi  in the shade of the oak   i found my home at arden very empty and dreary the servants did not expect me my grandmother had not returned and the absence of walkirk added much to my dissatisfaction with the premises  i was never a man who could sit down and wait for things to happen and i felt now that it was absolutely necessary that i should do something that i should talk to somebody and accordingly on the morning after my arrival i determined to walk over to the house of martha and talk to mother anastasia for a man to consult with the mother superior of a religious institution about his love affairs was certainly an uncommon proceeding with very prominent features of inappropriateness but this did not deter me for apart from the fact that there was no one else to talk to i considered that mother anastasia owed me some advice and explanation and without hesitation i went to ask for it  when i reached the house of martha and made known my desire to speak to the head of the institution i was ushered into a room which was barer and harder than i had supposed from walkirks description of it it did not even contain the religious pictures or the crucifixes which would have relieved the blankness of the walls in a roman catholic establishment of the kind  as i stood gazing about me with a feeling of indignation that such a place as this should ever have been the home of such a woman as sylvia a door opened and mother anastasia entered  her appearance shocked me i had in my mind the figure of a woman with whom i had talkeda woman glowing with the warmth of a rich beauty draped in graceful folds of white with a broad hat shadowing her face and a bunch of wild flowers in her belt here was a tall woman clothed in solemn gray her face pale her eyes fixed upon the ground but it was mother anastasia it was the woman who had talked to me of sylvia who had promised to help me with sylvia  still gazing on the floor with her hands folded before her she asked me what i wished at first i could not answer her it seemed impossible to open my heart to a woman such as this one but if i said anything i must say it without hesitation and so i began  of course i said i have come to see you about sylvia raynor i am in much trouble regarding her you promised to aid me and i have come to ask for the fulfillment of that promise my love for that girl grows stronger day by day hour by hour and i have been thwarted mystified and i may say deceived i have come  she of whom you speak interrupted mother anastasia is not to be discussed in that way she has declared her intention to unite herself permanently with our sisterhood and to devote her life to our work she can have nothing more to do with you nor you with her  that will not do at all i said excitedly when i last saw you you did not talk like that and the opinions you expressed at that time are just as good now as they were then i want to go over this matter with you there are things that i have a right to know  a little frown appeared upon her brow this conversation must cease she said the subjects you wish to discuss are forbidden to our sisterhood you must mention them no more  i tried hard to restrain myself and speak quietly madamsaid i  you must not call me madam she broke in i am the mother superior of this house  i understand that i continued and i understand your feeling of duty but you have other duties besides those you owe to your sisterhood you made me a promise which i accepted with an honest and confiding heart if you cannot do what you promised you owe it to me to explain why you cannot do it i do not know what has happened to change your views and her views and so far as i am concerned the whole world you can set me right you can explain everything to me  the frown disappeared and her face seemed paler it is absolutely impossible to discuss anything of the sort in this house i must insist  i did not permit her to finish her sentence very well then i exclaimed if you cannot talk to me here talk to me somewhere else when you desire it you go outside of these walls and you speak freely and fully you have so spoken with me and because you have done so it is absolutely necessary that you do it again your own heart your conscience must tell you that after what you have said to me and after what i have said to you it is unjust to say no more to leave me in this state of cruel mystification not to tell me why you have set aside your promise to me or even to tell me when we talked together of sylvia that we were then at the home of sylvias mother  for the first time she looked at me straight in my eyes as a true woman would naturally look at a man who was speaking strongly to her i think i made her forget for a few moments at least that she was a mother superior then her eyes fell again and she stood silent  perhaps she said presently and speaking slowly i ought to explain these things to you it is a great mistake as i now see that i ever said anything to you on the subject but things were different then and i did not know that i was doing wrong still if you rely on me to set you right you shall be set right i see that this is quite as necessary from other points of view as from your own i cannot speak with you today but tomorrow about this time i shall be on the road to maple ridge where i am going to visit a sick woman  i shall join you on the road i answered and took my leave  for the rest of the day i thought of little but the promised interview on the morrow to this i looked forward with the greatest interest but also with the greatest anxiety i feared that mother anastasia would prove to me that i must give up all thoughts of sylvia in fact if sylvia had resolved to devote herself to the service of the house of marthaand she had told me herself that she had so resolvedi was quite sure she would do so then what was there for mother anastasia to say or me to do the case was settled sylvia raynor must be nothing to me  i greatly wished for walkirk i knew he would encourage me in spite of the obvious blackness of the situation it was impossible for me to encourage myself but however black my fate might be i longed to know why it had been made black and all about it and so waited with a savage impatience for the morning and mother anastasia  immediately after breakfast the next day i was on the maple ridge road strolling from our village toward the top of a hill a mile or more away whence i could see the rest of the road as it wound through the lonely country and at last lost itself in the woods back again to arden i came and had covered the distance between the village and the hilltop five times when turning and coming down the hill i saw far away the figure of a woman walking  i knew it was mother anastasia but i did not hasten to meet her in fact i thought the further she was from the village when our interview took place the more likely she would be to make it long enough to be satisfactory i came slowly down the hill and reaching a place where a great oaktree shaded the road i waited  she came on quickly her gray dress appearing heavier and more sombre against the sunlighted grass and foliage than it had appeared in the dreary room of the house of martha as she approached the tree i advanced to meet her  you made me come too far she said reproachfully as soon as we were near each other the lane which leads to the house i came to visit is a quarter of a mile behind me  i am sorry i replied that i have made you walk any farther than necessary on such a warm morning but i did not know that you intended to turn from this road let us step into the shade of this tree we can talk more comfortably there  she looked at the tree but did not move what i have to say she remarked can be said here it will not take long  you must not stand in the sun i replied you are already heated come into the shade and without waiting her answer i walked toward the tree she followed me  now then said i here is a great stone conveniently placed upon which we can sit and rest while we talk  she fixed her large eyes upon me with a certain surprise truly you have no regard for conventionalities it is sufficiently out of the way for a sister of the house of martha to meet a gentleman in this manner but to sit with him under a tree would be ridiculously absurd to say the least of it  it does not strike me in that light i said you are tired and warm and must sit down you came here on my account and i regard you in a manner as a guest  she smiled and looked at the rock which i had pointed out it was a flat one about three feet long and it seemed as if it had been put there on purpose to serve for a seat  i am tired she said and sat down upon it as she did so she gave a look about her and at the same time made a movement with her right hand which i often before had noticed in women it was the involuntary expression of the female soul longing for a fan a fan however made up no part of the paraphernalia of a sister of the house of martha  allow me i said and taking off my straw hat i gently fanned her  mother anastasia laughed this is really too much please stop it but you may lend me your hat i did not know the morning would be so warm and i am afraid i walked too fast but we are losing time will you tell me precisely what it is you wish to know of me  i can soon do that i answered but i must first say that i believe you will suffocate if you try to talk from under that cavernous bonnet why dont you take it off and get the good of this cool shade you had discarded all that sort of thing when i last talked with you and you were then just as much a mother superior as you are now  she smiled the case was very different then i was actually obliged by the will of another to discard the garb of our sisterhood  i most earnestly wish said i that you could be obliged to do partially the same thing now with that bonnet on you do not seem at all the same person with whom i talked on tangent island you appear like some one to whom i must open the whole subject anew  oh dont do that she said with a deprecating movement of her handi really havent the time to listen and if my bonnet hinders your speech off it shall come now then i suppose you want to know the reason of my change of position in regard to sylvia and you as she said this she took off her bonnet not with a jerk as sylvia had once removed hers but carefully without disturbing the dark hair which was disposed plainly about her head i was greatly relieved this was an entirely different woman to talk to  yes i replied that is what i want to know  i will briefly give you my reasons she said still fanning herself with my hat while i stood before her earnestly listening and you will find them very good and conclusive reasons when i spoke to you before the case was this sylvia raynor had had a trouble which made her think she was the most miserable girl in the whole world and she threw herself into our sisterhood her mother did not object to this because of course sylvia entered as a probationer and she thought a few months of the house of martha life would do her good that her daughter would permanently join the sisterhood never occurred to her as i was a relative it was a natural thing that the girl should enter a house of which i was the head i did not approve of the step but at first i had no fears about it after a while however i began to have fears she never liked our life and never sympathized with it and her heart was never enlisted in the cause of the sisterhood but after a time i found she was endeavoring to conquer herself and when a woman with a willand sylvia is one of theseundertakes in earnest to conquer herself she generally succeeds then it was i began to have my fears and then it was i wished to divert her mind from the life of the sisterhood and send her back to the world to which she belongs  then it was you gave me your promise i added  yes she answered and i gave it honestly i would have helped you all i could i truly believed that in so doing i was acting for sylvias good  i thank you from the bottom of my heart i said and tell me did mrs raynor know when i was on the island of my affection for sylvia  she knew as much as i knew was the answer for i went to the island on purpose to consult with her on the subject and when you confided in me and i gave you my promise to help you i also told her about that  and did she approve i asked anxiously  she did not disapprove she knew all about you and your family although she had never seen you until you were at her island  it is strange said i that i should have happened to go to that place at that time  yes she continued it does seem rather odd but as i was going to say a letter came not more than an hour after we had had our conversation which totally altered the face of affairs sylvia wrote that she had resolved to devote her life to the sisterhood this was a great blow to her mother and to me but mrs raynor had firmly resolved not to interfere with her daughters resolutions in regard to her future life she had done so once and the results had been very unfortunate i was of an entirely different mind and i resolved if the thing could be done to change sylvias purpose but i failed and that is the end of it she is not to be moved i know her well and her conviction and determination are not to be changed she is now on a visit to her mother and when she returns she will enter the house of martha as an inmate for life  yes said i after a little pause i know that i saw her a few days ago and she told me of her purpose  what cried mother anastasia you have seen her a few days ago she told you all this why did you not say so why did you come to me  do not be displeased i said and as i spoke i seated myself beside her on the stone she made no objections i think she was too much agitated even to notice it i had no intention of keeping anything from you but i first wanted to hear what you had to tell me sylvia did not tell me everything nor have you  met her and talked with her ejaculated mother anastasia will you tell me how this happened  she listened with the greatest attention to my story  it is wonderful she said when i had finished it seems like a tantalizing fate but it is well you did not overtake mrs raynor it would have been of no good to you and the interview would have greatly troubled her  now tell me i asked what i most want to know what was the reason of sylvias sudden determination  mother anastasia fixed her dark eyes on mine they were full of a tender sadness i thought of you nearly all last night she said and i determined that if you should ask me that question today i would answer it it is a hard thing to do but it is the best thing sylvias resolve was caused by her conviction that she loved you feeling assured of that she unhesitatingly took the path which her conscience pointed out to her  conscience i exclaimed  yes said mother anastasia it was her conscience she was far more in earnest than we had thought her it was conviction not desire or sympathy which had prompted her to enter the sisterhood now her convictions her conscience prompt her to crush everything which would interfere with the life she has chosen all this she has told me her conscience stands between you and her and you must understand that what you wish is absolutely impossible you must be strong and give up all thought of her will you promise me to do this and as she spoke she laid her hand upon my arm promise it and i shall feel that i have devoted myself this morning to as true a mission of charity as anything to which our sisters vow themselves  i did not respond but sat silent with bowed head  i must go now said mother anastasia reflect on what i have said and your heart and your practical sense will tell you that what i ask you to do is what you ought to do and must do goodby and she held out her hand to me  i took her hand and held it the thought flashed into my mind that when i released that hand the last tie between sylvia and myself would be broken  presently the hand was adroitly withdrawn mother anastasia rose and i was left alone sitting in the shadow of the tree     xxxvii  the performance of my understudy   on the next day when walkirk came back i received him coolly to be sure the time of his return was now of slight importance but my manner showed him that on general principles i blamed his delay  i did not care to hear his explanations but proceeded at once to state the misfortunes which had befallen me i told him in detail all that had happened since i left the floating grocery i did not feel that it was at all necessary to do this but there was a certain pleasure in talking of my mishaps and sorrows i was so dreadfully tired of thinking of them  as i told walkirk of my interview with mother anastasia on the maple ridge road he laughed aloud he instantly checked himself and begged my pardon but assured me that never had he heard of a man doing anything so entirely out of the common as to make an appointment with a mother superior to meet him under a tree at first i resented his laugh but i could not help seeing for myself that the situation as he presented it was certainly an odd one and that a man with his mind free to ordinary emotions might be excused for being amused at it  when i had finished and had related how mother anastasia had proved to me that all possible connection between myself and sylvia raynor was now at an end walkirk was not nearly so much depressed as i thought he ought to be in fact he endeavored to cheer me and did not agree with mother anastasia that there was no hope at this i lost patience  confound it i cried what you say is not only preposterous but unfeeling i hate this eternal making the best of things when there is no best with me everything is at its worst and it is cruel to try to make it appear otherwise  i am sorry to annoy you he said but i must insist that to me the situation does not appear to be without some encouraging features let me tell you what has happened to me since we parted  i resumed the seat from which i had risen to stride up and down the room and walkirk began his narrative  i do not know sir he said that i ever have been so surprised as when i went on deck of the grocery boat a short time before breakfast and found that you were not on board captain jabe and his man were equally astonished and i should have feared that you had fallen overboard if a man who had come on the boat at a little pier where we had stopped very early in the morning had not assured us that he had seen you go ashore at that place but had not thought it worth while to mention so commonplace an occurrence i wished to put back to the pier but it was then far behind us and captain jabe positively refused to do so both wind and tide would be against us he said and if you chose to go ashore without saying anything to anybody that was your affair and not his i thought it possible you might have become tired with the slow progress of his vessel and had left it to hire a horse to get to sanpritchit before we did  when we reached sanpritchit and you were not there i was utterly unable to understand the situation but mrs raynors yacht was there just on the point of sailing and i considered it my duty as your representative to hasten on board and to apprise the lady that you were on your way to see her of course she wanted to know why you were coming and all that and as you were not there to do it yourself i told her the nature of your errand and impressed upon her the importance of delaying her departure until she had seen you and had heard what you had to say she did not agree with me that the interview would be of importance to any one concerned but she consented to wait for a time and see you if you arrived she agreed to meet you on shore for she would not consent to your coming on board the yacht where her daughter was i went ashore and waited there with great impatience until early in the afternoon when a boy arrived who said he had started to bring you to sanpritchit but that you had changed your mind and he had conveyed you to a railroad station where you had taken a westernbound train  i went to the yacht to report i think mrs raynor was relieved at your nonarrival and as she knew i wished to join you as soon as possible she invited me to sail with them to a little town on the coasti forget its namefrom which i could reach the railroad much quicker than from sanpritchit  she did not object then said i to your being on the yacht with her daughter  oh no he answered for she found that miss raynor did not know me or at least recognize me and had no idea that i was in any way connected with you of course i accepted mrs raynors offer but i did not save any time by it for the wind fell off toward evening and for hours there was no wind at all and it was late the next afternoon when we reached the point where i went ashore  did you see anything of miss raynor in all that time i inquired  yes he replied she was on deck a great deal and i had several conversations with her  with her alone i asked  yes said he mrs raynor is a great reader and fond of naps and i think that the young lady was rather tired of the companionship of her uncle and the other gentleman who were very much given to smoking and was glad of the novelty of a new acquaintance on my part i felt it my duty to talk to her as much as possible that i might faithfully report to you all that she said and thus give you an idea of the state of her mind  humph i exclaimed but what did she say  of course continued walkirk a great deal of our conversation was desultory and of no importance but i endeavored as circumspectly as i could so to turn the conversation that she might say something which it would be worth while to report to you  now walkirk said i if i had known you were doing a thing of that sort i should not have approved of it but did she say anything that in any way referred to me  yes she did he answered and this is the way it came about somethingi think it was the heat of the windless daycaused her to refer to the oppressive costume of the sisters of the house of martha and she then remarked that she supposed i knew she was one of that sisterhood i replied that i had been so informed and then betrayed as much natural interest in regard to the vocations and purposes of the organization as i thought would be prudent i should have liked to bring up every possible argument against the folly of a young lady of her position and prospects extinguishing the very light of her existence in that hard cold soulchilling house which i knew so well but the circumstances did not warrant that i was obliged to content myself with very simple questions  how do the sisters employ themselves i inquired  in all sorts of ways she said some nurse or teach and others work for wages like ordinary people except that they do not have anything to do with the money they earn which is paid directly to the house  i think i then remarked that there are a good many employments which would give the sisters very pleasant occupation such as decorative art or clerical work  at this her face brightened clerical work is very nice i tried that once myself  was it bookkeeping i asked  oh no she answered i shouldnt have liked that it was writing from dictation i worked regularly so many hours every morning it was a book which was dictated to mesketches of travel that is it was partly travel and partly fiction it was very interesting  i should think it would be so i answered to ladies of education and literary taste i should say such employment would be highly congenial do you intend to devote yourself principally to that sort of thing  oh no said she not at all i like the work very much but for various reasons i shall not do any more of it  i endeavored mildly to remonstrate against such a decision but she shook her head i was not a full sister at the time she said and this was an experiment i shall do no more of it  her manner was very decided but i did not drop the subject if you do not fancy writing from dictation i said why dont you try typewriting i should think that would be very interesting and it could be done in your own room the work would not require you to go out at all if you object to that now this was a slip because she had not told me that she had gone out but she did not notice it  a sister does not have a room of her own she answered and i do not understand typewriting and with that she left me and went below looking very meditative  but my remark had had an effect i think it was not half an hour afterward when she came to me  i have been thinking about your suggestion of typewriting she said is it difficult to learn do you understand it what use could i make of a machine in the house of martha  i told her that i understood the art and gave her all the information i could in regard to it taking care to make the vocation as attractive as my conscience would allow as to the use she could make of it i said that at present there was a constant demand for typewritten copies of all sorts of writingslegal literary scientific everything  and people would send me things she asked and i would copy them on the typewriter and send them back and that would be all  you have put it exactly i said if you do not choose you need have no communication whatever with persons ordering the work  and do you know of any one who would want such work done  yes i said i know people who would be very glad to send papers to be copied i could procure you some work which would be in no hurry and that would be an advantage to you in the beginning  indeed it would she said and then her mother joined us and the subject of typewriting was dropped the only time that it was referred to again was at the very end of my trip when miss raynor came to me just as i was preparing to leave the yacht and told me that she had made up her mind to get a typewriter and to learn to use it and she asked me if i were still willing to assist her in securing work to send my address to the mother superior of the house of martha which of course i assured her i would do  why in the name of common sense i cried turning suddenly around in my chair and facing walkirk did you put into miss raynors head all that stuff about typewriting did you do it simply because you liked to talk to her  by no means he replied i did it solely on your account and for your benefit if she learns to copy manuscripts on the typewriter why should she not copy your manuscripts not immediately perhaps but in the natural course of business if she should make me her agent which i have no doubt she would be willing to do i could easily manage all that in this way you could establish regular communications with her there would be no end to your opportunities and i am sure you would know how to use them with such discretion and tact that they would be very effective  i folded my arms and looked at him walkirk said i you are positively completely and hopelessly off the track mother anastasia has shown me exactly how i stand with sylvia raynor she has vowed herself to that sisterhood because she thinks it is wrong to love me she has made her decision and has taken all the wretched steps which have rendered that decision final and now i do not intend to try to make her do what she religiously believes is wrong  that is not my idea answered walkirk what i wish is that she shall get herself into such a state of mind that she shall think the sisterhood is wrong and therefore leave it  i gave a snort of despair and disgust and began to stride up and down the room presently however i recovered my temper walkirk said i i am quite sure that you mean well and i dont intend to find fault with you but this sort of thing does not suit me let us have no more of it     xxxviii  a broken trace   as soon as my grandmother heard that i was at arden she terminated her visit abruptly and returned home when she saw me she expressed the opinion that my holiday had not been of any service to me she did not remember ever seeing me so greatly out of condition and was of the opinion that i ought to see the doctor  these watering places and islands she said are just as likely to be loaded down with malaria as any other place in fact i dont know but it is just as well for our health for us to stay at home that is if we live in a place like arden  i had no desire to conceal from this nearest and dearest friend and relative the real cause of my appearance and i laid before her all the facts concerning sylvia and myself  she was not affected as i supposed she would be in fact my narrative appeared to relieve her mind of some of her anxieties  any way she remarked after a moment or two of consideration this is better than malaria if you get anything of that kind into your system it is probable that you will never get it out and it is at any time likely to affect your health one way or another but love affairs are different they have a powerful influence upon a person as i well know but there is not about them that insidious poison which although you may think you have entirely expelled it from your system is so likely to crop out again especially in the spring and fall  to this i made no answer but a sigh what was the good of saying that in my present state of mind health was a matter of indifference to me  i am not altogether surprised continued my grandmother that that secretary business turned out in this way if it had been any other young woman i should have advised against it but sylvia raynor is a good matchgood in every way and i thought that if her working with you had made you like her and had made her like you it might be very well but i am sure it never entered my mind that if you did come to like each other she would choose the sisterhood instead of you i knew that she was not then a full sister and i hadnt the slightest doubt that if you two really did fall in love with each other she would leave the house of martha as soon as her time was up you must not think my dear boy she continued that i am anxious to get rid of you but you know you must marry some day  i solemnly shook my head all that i said is at an end we need speak no more of it  my grandmother arose and gently placed her hand upon my shoulder come come do not be so dreadfully cast down you have yet one strong ground of hope  what is that i inquired  my grandmother looked into my face and smiled the girl isnt dead yet she answered  i now found myself in a very unsettled and unpleasant state of mind my business affairs which had been a good deal neglected of late i put into the charge of walkirk who attended to them with much interest and ability my individual concernsthat is to say the guidance and direction of myselfi took into my own hands and a sorry business i made of it  i spent a great deal of my time wondering whether or not sylvia had returned to the house of martha i longed for her coming the very thought of her living within a mile of me was a wild and uneasy pleasure then i would ask myself why i wished her to come her presence in the neighborhood would be of no good to me unless i saw her and of course i could not see her and if this could be so what would be worse for me or for her than our seeing each other from these abstract questions i came to a more practical one what should i do to go away seemed to be a sensible thing but i was tired of going away i liked my home and besides sylvia would be in the neighborhood it also seemed wise to stay and endeavor to forget her but how could i forget her if she were in the neighborhood if she were to go away i might be willing to go away also but the chances were that i should not know where she had gone and how could i endure to go to any place where i was certain she was not  during this mental tangle i confided in no one there was no one who could sympathize with my varying view of the subject and i knew there was no one with whose view of the subject i could agree sometimes it was almost impossible for me to sympathize with myself  it suited my mood to take long walks in the surrounding country one morning returning from one of these when about half a mile out of the village i saw in the road not very far from me a carriage which seemed to be in distress it was a fourwheeled curtained vehicle of the kind to be had for hire at the railroad stations and beside the rawboned horse which drew it stood a man and a woman the latter in the gray garb of a sister of the house of martha  when i recognized this costume my heart gave a jump and i hastened toward the group but the woman had perceived my approach and to my surprise came toward me i quickly saw that it was mother anastasia my heart sank without any good reason it must be admitted but still it sank  the face of the mother superior was slightly flushed as she walked rapidly in my direction saluting her i inquired what had happened  nothing of importance she answered a trace has broken  i will go and look at it i said sometimes that sort of mishap can be easily remedied  oh no said she dont trouble yourself its broken in the middle and so you cannot cut a fresh hole in it or do any of those things which men do to broken traces i have told the boy that he must take out the horse and ride it back to the stable and get another set of harness that is the only thing to be done i shall wait here for his return and i am very glad to have met you  naturally i was pleased at this then you have something to say to me i remarked  yes she answered i have a good deal to say let us walk on to a more shaded place  now it strikes me said i that the most pleasant place to wait will be in the carriage there we can sit and talk quite comfortably  oh no she said with a sort of half laugh it is stuffy and horrid i greatly prefer the fresh air i have reason to suppose you do not object to conversing under a tree i see a promising bit of shade a little farther on  would it be wise to go so far from the carriage i asked have you left in it anything of value  mother anastasia was more animated than i had ever seen her before when in the uniform of the house  oh pshaw she answered you know the people around here do not steal things out of carriages let us step on  but first i said i will run down and pull the carriage out of the way of passing vehicles it now stands almost across the road  with a movement of impatience she put her hand upon my arm dont trouble yourself about that hack let it stand where it is i wish to speak with you and do not let us waste our time  i had no objection to speaking with mother anastasia and giving no further thought to the abandoned vehicle i walked with her to a spot where a clump of straggling locusttrees threw a scanty shade upon the sidewalk i could not but feel that my companion had something important to say to me for she was evidently a good deal agitated she stepped a little in front of me and then turned and faced me  there is no place to sit down here she said but im not tired are you  i assured her that i was not and would as soon talk standing as sitting  now then she began tell me about yourself what have you been doing what are your plans  my plans i cried of what importance are my plans and actions i thought you wished to speak to me of sylvia  she smiled there is really nothing to say about that young person of whom by the way you should not speak as sylvia she is now a full member of the sisterhood and has accepted the name of sister hagar we found that the other sisters would not like it if an exception were made in her favor in regard to her name  hagar i groaned horrible  oh no replied mother anastasia there is nothing horrible about it hagar is a little harsh perhaps but one soon gets used to that sort of thing  i can never get used to it i said  my dear mr vanderley said the mother superior speaking very earnestly but with a gentleness that was almost affectionate i wish i could impress upon your mind that there is no need of your getting used to the name of our young sister or of your liking it or disliking it you ought thoroughly to understand from what she has told you and from what i have told you that she never can be anything to you and that out of regard to yourself if to no one else you should cease to think of her as i see you do think  as long as i live in this world i replied i shall continue to think of her as i do think  mother anastasia gave a sigh the unreasonableness of men is something inexplicable perhaps you think i am not old enough to give you advice but i will say that for your own sake you ought to crush and obliterate the feelings you have toward our sister and if you do not choose to do it for your own sake you ought to do it for her sake and that of our sisterhood it makes it extremely awkward for us to say the least of it to know that there is a gentleman in the village who is in love with one of the sisters of the house of martha  i suppose you would have me exile myself i replied leave forever my home my grandmother everything that is dear to me and all for the sake of the peace and quiet of your sisterhood let me assure you i do not care enough for your sisterhood to do that  the mother superior smiled ironically but not illnaturedly i am very much afraid she remarked that in this matter you care for no one but yourself there is nothing so selfish as a man in love  he needs to be i answered but tell me is sylvia here  sylvia again said she half laughing yes she has returned to the house of martha and you can see for yourself that if you continue in your present state of mind it will be impossible for her ever to go outside of the house  i shall not hurt her i answered  yes you will hurt her quickly replied mother anastasia you will hurt her very much if you meet her and show by your words looks or actions that your former attitude toward her is not changed she came nearer to me looking into my face with her eyes full of an earnest tenderness and as she spoke she laid the tips of her fingers gently upon my shoulder she had a very pleasant way of doing this i do wish she said that you would let me prevail upon you to do what your conscience must tell you is right if you have ever loved the girl who was once sylvia raynor that is the best of reasons why you should cease to love her now you owe it to her to cease to love her  i looked steadily into the face of the mother superior  you promise me that you will do that she said with a smile upon her lips and a light in her eyes which might have won over almost any man to do almost anything you promise me that you will allow our young sister who has hardships enough to bear without any more being thrust upon her to try to be happy in the way she has chosen and that you will try to be happy in the way you should have chosen that you will go out into the world and act your part in life that you will look upon this affair as something which has vanished into the past and that you will say to your heart you are free if not by my will by the irresistible force of circumstances  i looked at her a few moments in silence and then answered very quietly i shall do nothing of the kind  she gave her head a little toss and stepped backward and then with a half laugh which seemed to indicate an amused hopelessness she said you are utterly impracticable and i am certain i do not know what is to be done about it but i see that the boy has returned with the horse and i must continue my journey i am going to the iron furnace to see a sick woman i wish you would think of what i have said and remember that it was spoken from the depth of my soul and do not think she continued as i turned and accompanied her toward the carriage that i do not appreciate the state of your feelings i understand them thoroughly and i sympathize with you as perhaps only a woman can sympathize but still i say to you that there are some things in this world which we must give up and which we ought to give up promptly and willingly  do you think said i that if sylvia were to learn typewriting there would be any objection to her copying manuscript for me  mother anastasia burst into a laugh you ought to be ashamed of yourself for making a person of my position behave so giddily in the presence of a hackdriver  we now reached the carriage and i assisted her to enter it  goodmorning she said her face still perturbed by her suddenly checked merriment and do not forget the counsels i have given you  i bowed and stepped back but the driver did not start he sat for a moment irresolute and then turning toward mother anastasia asked shall i wait for the other sister  oh go on cried the mother superior there is no other sister  the boy startled by her tone gave his horse a cut and the equipage rattled away i walked slowly homeward meditating earnestly upon mother anastasias words and upon mother anastasia     xxxix  a soul whisper   my meditations upon the mother superior of the house of martha were not concluded during my homeward walk the subject occupied my mind for the greater part of the rest of the day i do not call myself a philosopher but i am in the habit of looking into the nature and import of what happens about me my reflections on mother anastasia gradually produced in me the conviction that there was something more in her words her manner and her actions than would appear to the ordinary observer  in considering this matter i went back to the very first of my intercourse with this beautiful woman who divested of the dismal disguise of her sisterhood had produced upon my memory an impression which was so strong that whenever i now thought of mother anastasia she appeared before my mental vision in a white dress with a broad hat and a bunch of flowers in her belt in the character of a beautiful and sensible woman and not at all in that of a mother superior she had warmly commended my suit of sylvia raynor with our regard for sylvia as a basis we had consulted we had confided we had shown ourselves to each other in a most frank and friendly manner  suddenly she had changed she had deserted me without a word of explanation and the next time i saw her she was totally opposed to my maintaining any connection whatever with sylvia  but there had been more than this this woman beautiful even in her gray garb had shown an increasing interest in the subject which could not be altogether explained by her interest in sylvia if she truly believed that that young sister would devote her life to the service of the house of martha that matter might be considered as settled and what was her object in so earnestly endeavoring to impress upon my mind the fact that i could not marry sylvia it might be supposed that in the ordinary course of events i should be compelled to admit this point but not only did she continually bring up this view of the subject but she showed such a growing interest in me and my welfare that it made me uneasy  it is almost impossible truly to understand a woman most men will admit this i could not say that i understood mother anastasia at times i hoped i did not understand her from what i knew of the constitution of the sisterhood some of its members were vowed to it for life and others for a stated period putting together this and that which mother anastasia had said to me about the organization it did not appear to me that she felt that devotion to it which a sister for life would naturally feel she had used all the art of a logician to impress upon me the conviction that sylvia was a life sister and could be nothing else was it possiblei scarcely dared to ask myself the questionthat she had used the arts of a woman to intimate to me that she might be something else it did not cross my mind for an instant that anything that mother anastasia had said to me or anything that could be deduced from her manner was in the slightest degree out of the way a woman has a right to indicate her position in regard to a fellowbeing and in this age she generally does indicate it if the true nature of mother anastasia had so far exerted itself as to impel her perhaps involuntarily to let me know that she was as much a woman as she was a mother superior and that in time she would be all of the first and not any of the latter she had truly done this with a delicate ingenuousness beyond compare it had not been the exhalation by the flower of inviting perfume or its show of color it had been the simple opening of the blossom to the free sun and air before my eyes  my last interview with mother anastasia had crystallized in my mind a mist of suppositions and fancies which had vaguely floated there for some time it is not surprising that i was greatly moved at the form the crystal took  when walkirk came the next day to make his usual reports i talked to him of mother anastasia of course i did not intimate to him how i had been thinking of her but i gave him as many facts as possible in order that i might discover what he would think of her when i had finished my account of the interview of the morning before i could see that a very decided impression had been made upon him his countenance twitched he smiled he looked upon the floor for a moment i thought he was going to laugh  this amuses you i remarked  yes he replied his face having recovered its ordinary composure it is a little funny mother anastasia seems to be a good deal of a manager  yes i said reflectively that is true it is quite plain that perceiving an opportunity of a private conference with me she took advantage of the circumstances we could have had an ordinary chat just as well in one place as another but it was easy to see that she did not wish the boy who was unhitching the horse to hear even the first words of our conversation as you say she is a good manager and i had my suspicions of that before you mentioned it as i said this i could not help smiling as i thought how surprised he would be if he knew in what direction my suspicions pointed do you know i continued if it is necessary that the head of a sisterhood should be a life member of it  i have never heard he answered but i have been informed that the organization of the house of martha is a very independent one and does not attempt to conform itself to that of any other sisterhood the women who founded it had ideas of their own and what rules and laws they made i do not know  for a few moments i walked up and down the room then i asked how did mother anastasia come to be the mother superior  i have been told said walkirk that she gave most of the money for the founding of the institution and it was natural enough that she should be placed at the head i have an idea that she would not have been willing to enter the house except as its head  it is about four years since it was established is it not i asked and walkirk assured me that i was correct  all this information ranged itself on the side of conviction she was just the woman to try a thing of this kind for a stated time she was just the woman not to like it and she was just the woman whose soul could not be prevented from whispering that the gates of the bright world were opening before her but why should her soul whisper this to me the whole matter troubled me very much  i determined not to base any action upon what had thus forced itself upon my mind i would wait i would see what would happen next i would persist in my determination never to give up sylvia and i will mention that there was a little point in connection with her which at this time greatly annoyed me whenever i thought of her she appeared before me in the gray dress of a sister and not as i had seen her on the island i wished very much that this were not the case     xl  an inspiration   i now found myself in an embarrassing situation all my plans and hopes of tidings from sylvia or of any possible connection with her were based upon mother anastasia but would it be wise for me to continue my very friendly relations with the mother superior on my side these relations were extremely pleasant though that did not matter one way or another but would it be kind and just to her to meet with her on the footing i had enjoyed in every point of this affair i wished to be honorable and considerate acting on these principles i went away for two weeks it was very hard for me to absent myself for so long a period from arden but it was my duty to take the chances of another meeting with mother anastasia following close upon the recent one which had made so forcible an impression upon me would be imprudent a moderate absence might be of great advantage  on my return i took to strolling about the village especially in the neighborhood of the house of martha and if in these strolls i had met the mother superior i should not have hesitated to accost her and ask news of sylvia for more reasons than one i felt it was highly desirable that i should impress it on the mind of mother anastasia that my interest in sylvia had not in the least abated  but several days passed and i met no one clad in gray bonnet and gown i was disappointed there were a good many questions about sylvia which i wished to ask and a good many things in regard to her that i wished to say i might go to the house of martha and boldly ask to see the mother superior but a step like that might produce an undesirable impression and naturally the position in which i had placed myself regarding sylvia would prevent my going to visit her  as i could do nothing for myself in this matter i must ask some one to help me and there was no one so willing and able to do this as my grandmother she could go to the house of martha and ask what questions she pleased i went to the dear old lady and made known my desires she laid down her knitting and gave me her whole attention  now tell me exactly what it is you want she said you cannot expect to be asked to take tea with the sisters you know though i see no reason why you should not say what they will they are not nuns  what i want i replied is to know how sylvia is what she is doing all about her i do not even know that she is still there  my dear boy said my grandmother very tenderly i suppose that even if you are obliged to give up all hope of ever having sylvia for your own you will want to know every day for the rest of your life just how she is getting on  yes i answered that is true  poor fellow said the old lady her eyes a little dimmed as she spoke the fates have not been using you well is there anything else you want me to inquire about  oh yes i answered i take a great interest in the institution  which is natural enough since sylvia is there interpolated my grandmother  and i should be glad i continued to know anything of interest regarding the sisterhood from the mother superior down  mother anastasia is a very fine woman said my grandmother and i should think you would be likely to be greatly interested in her i am going to make some inquiries about the rules of the house of martha i see no reason why the sisters should not occasionally accept invitations to tea  this remark startled me and i was prompted to make a cautionary observation but i restrained myself in cases like this interference would be likely to provoke comment and by my grandmothers desire i went to order the carriage  in less than an hour she returned i was promptly at hand to receive her report  well said she i have visited the sisters but i am sorry i did not see mother anastasia she was away  away i exclaimed where has she gone  she went to washington more than a week ago was the answer  for a long stay i asked quickly  the sisters did not know continued my grandmother but their impression is that she will return in a few days  i knitted my brows  you are disappointed and so am i i intended to ask her here to tea next friday and to urge her if she did not too greatly object to bring sylvia with her there is nothing like quiet intercourse of that kind to break down obstacles  alas i said i am afraid there are obstacles  but do not let us talk about them she interrupted nobody knows what will happen and let us be as happy as we can  did you see sylvia i asked  oh yes she answered and i had some talk with her but it did not amount to much she is trying to make a regular nun of herselfthat is if a protestant can be a nunbut i do not think she will ever succeed she admitted that she greatly disliked the ordinary work of the sisters and wished to employ herself in some way which would be just as lucrative to the institution and yet not so repugnant to her now you can see for yourself that that will not do if she intends to be a sister of the house of martha she must do as the other sisters do she cannot always expect to be an exception at present she is learning typewriting  i gave a great start typewriting i exclaimed  yes said my grandmother is it not odd that she should have taken up that she has a machine and practices steadily on it she showed me some of her printed sheets and i must say so far as i am concerned that i should prefer plain handwriting where the letters are not so likely to get on top of one another she wanted to know if i could give her any advice about getting work when she thought she could do it well enough but of course i know nothing about such things my hope is that she will get to dislike that as much as she does nursing and apothecary work and to find out that her real duty is to live like an ordinary human being and so make herself and other people truly happy  i do not know that there is any inherent connection between a typewriting machine and the emotions and sentiments of love but in this case such a connection instantly established itself in my mind it seemed plain to me that walkirks suggestion to sylvia had taken root and why did she wish to typewrite if she did not wish to typewrite for me was this an endeavor of her tender heart to keep up a thread of connection with me which should not be inconsistent with the duties the vows and the purposes of her life dear girl if the thing could be managed she should typewrite for me as much as she wished even if she piled the letters on one another as high as the great pyramid  with much enthusiasm i communicated to walkirk my intention to employ sylvia in typewriting and requested his assistance in regard to the details of the business i could easily furnish her material enough i had lots of things i should like to have copied and i was ready to prepare a great deal more my understudy made no allusion to my previous reception of his suggestion about typewriting but brought his practical mind to bear upon the matter and advised that preliminary arrangements should be made immediately in a case like this it was well to be in time and to secure the services of miss raynor at once i agreed with walkirk that it was very wise to take time by the forelock but mother anastasia was the only person who could properly regulate this affair which should be instantly laid before her and as it was impossible to find out when she would return to arden i felt that it was my duty to go to her when i mentioned this plan to walkirk he offered to go in my place but i declined this was a very delicate affair to which no one could attend as well as i could myself  walkirk said i do you suppose that the mother superior will appear in washington under her real name or as mother anastasia and by the way what is her real name  is it possible exclaimed walkirk that you do not know it it is raynormiss marcia raynor she is a cousin of the younger lady  oh yes i know that i replied but it never occurred to me to inquire what name mother anastasia bore before she entered the house of martha the first thing for me to do is to get her washington address  and may i ask continued walkirk how you are going to do that  i was not prepared to give an immediate answer to this question  i suppose i remarked presently that it would not do to ask for the address at the house of martha but i could go to sylvias mother i should like to call there any way and i have no doubt she would know where mother anastasia would be likely to stop  my understudy shook his head pardon me he said but i do not think it would be wise to go to mrs raynor she would be sure to connect her daughter with your urgent desire to see mother anastasia and she would not hesitate to question you on the matter i think i understand her disposition in regard to you and miss raynor and i am very certain that when she heard of the typewriting scheme she would instantly put her foot on it and if i am not mistaken he continued with a noticeable deference in his tone that is the only reason you can give for your wish to confer with mother anastasia  i strode impatiently up and down the room certainly it is said i and although it is reason enough i suppose you are right and it would not do to offer it to mrs raynor and for the matter of that mother anastasia may think it a very little thing to take me down to washington  i had thought of that said walkirk and that was one reason why i proposed to go in your stead  i made no answer to this remark my mind was filled with annoying reflections about the unreasonableness of people who insist upon knowing peoples reasons for doing things and my annoyance was increased by the conviction now that i looked more closely into the matter that the only reason i could give for hastening after mother anastasia in this way was indeed a very little one  walkirk i exclaimed cant you think of some other reason for my seeing the mother superior without delay  truly he replied smiling it is rather difficult you might offer to build an annex to the house of martha but such a matter could surely wait until the return of the mother superior  i sniffed and continued to stride i must see mother anastasia in washington because there i might have a chance of speaking to her freely which i could not expect to have anywhere else and yet how was i going to explain to her or to any one else my desire to speak with her at all it might have been difficult to explain this to myself at all events i did not try to do it suddenly an idea struck me  annex i criedcapital  my dear sir said walkirk rising in much agitation i hope you do not think that i seriously proposed your building an annex to  building i interrupted nonsense the annex i am thinking of is quite different and yet not altogether so either walkirk dont you think that a man in my position could do a great deal to help those sisters in their good work dont you think that he could act as an outside collaborator i am sure there are many things he could do which might not be suitable for them to do or which they might not want to do for instance this business that has taken mother anastasia to washington perhaps it is something that she hates to do and i might have done as well as not i have a mind to propose to her to go in and take all this sort of thing off the hands of the sisters i think that is a good practical idea and it is very natural that i should wish to propose it to her at the very time she is engaged in this outside business  in a word remarked walkirk you would make yourself a brother of the house of martha  i laughed that is not a bad notion i said in fact it is a very good one i do not know that i shall put the matter exactly in that light but a brother of the house of martha is what i should like to be then i should be free to discuss all sorts of things and to do all sorts of things and i could be of a lot of service i am sure but i shall approach the matter cautiously i shall begin with a simple offer of service and perhaps for the present i may drop the typewriting plan now for mother anastasias address i must get that without delay  walkirk did not seem to have paid attention to this last remark his mind appeared occupied with amusing reflections  i beg your pardon he said in apologizing for his abstraction but i was thinking what a funny thing it would be to be a brother of the house of martha as to the addresslet me see do you remember that lady who was staying with mrs raynor at her island who called herself a personmiss laniston  of course i remember her i answered and with the greatest disgust  i happen to know her address said walkirk and i think she is more likely to give you the information you want than mrs raynor if you do not care to confer with her i can go to the city  no no no i exclaimed she might object to giving you the address i shall insist that she give it to me i think i can manage the matter she owes me something and she knows it  in fact i did not care to trust walkirk with this affair it was plain that he did not thoroughly sympathize with me in the project i was afraid he might make a blunder or in some way fail me any way this was a matter which i wished to attend to myself     xli  miss laniston   at eight oclock that evening i was at the house of miss laniston the lady was at home and received me she advanced with both hands extended  truly she cried this is the most charming instance of masculine forgiveness i have ever witnessed  i took one of her hands this much for the sake of policy madam i said i am not thinking of forgiveness or unforgiveness i am here to ask a favor and if you grant it i am willing that it shall counterbalance everything between us which suggests forgiveness  dear me she exclaimed leading the way to a sofa sit down and let me know my opportunities  i did not want to sit down but as i said before i felt that i must be politic and so took a seat on the other end of the sofa  my errand is a very simple one i said i merely want to know the address of mother anastasia in washington  the lady folded her hands in her lap and looked at me steadily  very simple indeed she said why do you come to me for this address would not the sisters give it to you  for various reasons i did not care to ask them i replied  one of them being i suppose that you knew you would not get it  i did not reply to this remark  if you know the address i inquired will you kindly give it to me it is necessary that i should have it at once  to telegraph she asked  no i am going to her  oh ejaculated the lady and there was a pause in the conversation it does not strike me she said presently that i have any authority to tell gentlemen where to find mother anastasia but i can telegraph and ask her if she is willing that i shall send you to her  this proposition did not suit me at all i was quite sure that the mother superior would not consider it advisable that i should come to her and would ask me to postpone my communication until she should return to arden but arden as i had found would be a very poor place for the long and earnest interview which i desired  that would not do i answered she would not understand i wish to see her on an important matter which can be explained only in a personal interview  you excite my curiosity said miss laniston why dont you make me your confidante in that case i might decide whether or not it would be proper to give you the address  impossible i saidthat would be impossible  miss lanistons eyes were of a blue gray and very fine ones and she fixed them upon me with a lively intentness  do you still hope she asked to marry sylvia raynor surely you must know that is impossible she is now a member for life of the sisterhood  i know all that i replied impatiently it is not about that matter that i wish to see the mother superior  is it then about mother anastasia herself do you wish to marry her  i sprang to my feet in my excitement why do you speak to me in that way i exclaimed and about a woman who is at the head of a religious institution and whose earthly existence is devoted to it  not at all quietly answered the lady mother anastasia is not a life member of the sisterhood of the house of martha  at these words my blood began to boil within me in a manner which i could not comprehend my eyeballs seemed to burn as i stood and gazed speechlessly at my companion  you take such an interest in these sisters she said that i supposed you knew that mother anastasia joined the sisterhood only for a term of years now nearly expired she was made mother superior because those who helped form the institution knew that no one else could so well fill the place especially during its first years i was one of those persons  i do not remember a time when my mind was in such a state of ungovernable emotion not only was i unable to control my feelings but i did not know what they were one thing only could i comprehend i must remove this impression from the mind of miss laniston and i could think of no other way of doing it than to confide to her the business on which i wished to see mother anastasia i reseated myself on the sofa and without delay or preface i laid before her my plan of collaboration with the sisters of the house of martha explaining how much better a man could attend to certain outside business than the sisters could do it and showing how in a manner i proposed to become a brother of the house of martha thus only could i defend myself against her irrational and agitating suppositions  she heard me to the end and then she leaned back on the sofa and laughedlaughed until i thought the people in the street must hear her i was hurt but said nothing  you must excuse me she said when she was able to speak but this is so sudden my mind is not prepared for it and so you wish to become a brother of the house of martha i would be solemn about it if i could but really i cannot and again she laughed  i was about to retire but she checked me  do not go she said do not be angry forget that i laughed now perhaps i can help you i will make you a promise if you will agree faithfully to tell me how mother anastasia receives your proposition i will give you her address  promise i said severely you may remember that this is not the first time you have made me a promise  dont bring up that old affair she exclaimed what i did then could not be helped when we had our talk about the sister with whom you had fallen in love i had no idea she was sylvia raynor the daughter of my hostess when i discovered the truth i had to drop the whole affair any person of honor would have done that i could not help its being funny you know  i had become calmer and was able to be politic again  if mother anastasia will allow me i said i am willing to promise to tell you what she thinks of my plan  very good she replied it is a bargain she is stopping with a friend mrs gardley at 906 alaska avenue i address her as miss raynor because i always do that when i have a chance but i think it will be well for you to ask for mother anastasia  i arose and she followed my example  now then said she we are friends and her sparkling eyes seemed to have communicated their merriment to the gems upon the white hand which she held out to me  i took the hand and as i did so a politic idea flashed up within me if i must be friends with this woman why not make use of her this was a moment when she was well disposed to serve me  if you are willing to consider me a friend i replied still holding her hand you will not refuse to tell me something which i have long wanted to know and which i ought to know  what is it she asked  what was the trouble which caused sylvia raynor to enter the house of martha  she withdrew her hand and reflected for a moment  man is an inquisitive animal she answered but we cannot alter his nature and there is some excuse for your wanting to know all about sylvia she is out of your reach of course but you have certainly taken as much interest in her as a man can take in a woman the matter is not a close secret and i suppose i may as well tell you that the cause of her entering the sisterhood was nothing at all out of the common it was simply a thwarted love affair you dont like that i can see by your face  no i do not like it and i am very sorry to hear it  my dear sir said she you must be early on hand and prompt in action to be number one with a girl like sylvia but then you know a number one seldom counts in this case however he did count for he made a number two impossible  not so i cried hotly i am number two and shall always continue so  she laughed i am afraid she said that it will be necessary for a brother of the house of martha to get rid of that sort of feeling  how was she thwarted i asked quickly  the story is briefly this replied miss laniston a certain gentleman courted sylvias cousin and everybody supposed they would be married but in some way or other he treated her badly and the match was broken off then a few years later this same person fell in love with sylvia who knew nothing of the previous affair the young girl found him a most attractive lover and he surely would have won her had not her mother stepped in and put an extinguisher upon the whole affair she knew what had happened before and would not have the man in her family then it was that sylvia found the world a blank and concluded to enter the sisterhood  do you mean i asked that the cousin with whom the man was first in love was marcia raynor mother anastasia  yes answered miss laniston it was she you do not like that  like it a cold and tingling pain ran through my body and there sprang up in me an emotion of the intensest hatred for a person whom i had never seen  my feelings were such as i could not express the situation was one which i could not discuss i took leave of miss laniston without giving sufficient consideration to her expression of countenance and to her final words now to be able to say whether they indicated amusement or sympathy     xlii  the mother superior   seldom i think has a berth in a sleepingcar held a more turbulentminded man than i was during my journey from new york to washington the revelation that the same man had loved and been loved by mother anastasia and by sylvia had disquieted me in a manner not easy to explain but i knew that i was being torn by jealousy and jealousy is a passion which it is sometimes impossible to explain  an idea which came into my mind in the night increased the storm within me i imagined that the wretch who had made suit to both marcia and sylvia was walkirk he knew a good deal about these women sometimes i was surprised to discover how much he knew perhaps now acting in a base disguise he was endeavoring to make of me a steppingstone to his ultimate success with one or the other hound i would crush him  my thoughts ran rapidly backward i remembered how zealous he had been in following miss raynors yacht he had told me of his conversations with sylvia but what reason had i to believe he spoke the truth that any man should have loved these two women filled me with rage that that man should be walkirk was an insupportable thought i was not only jealous but i felt myself the victim of a treacherous insult  it was seven oclock when i reached washington but although i had arrived at my destination i could give no thought to the object of my journey until i had discovered the truth about walkirk that was allimportant  but of whom should i inquire i could think of no one but miss laniston i had been a fool not to ask her the name of the man when i was with her but i would telegraph to her now and ask for it she might be asleep at that hour but i believed she was a woman who would awake and answer my question and then go to sleep again  i immediately went to the telegraph office and sent this message what is the name of the man of whom we spoke last evening it is necessary that i know it please answer at once she would understand this we had spoken of but one man  for nearly an hour i walked the floor and tossed over the morning papers and then came the answer to my message it was this brownson he is dead  there is a quality in the air of washington which is always delightful to me but i think it has never affected me as it did that morning as i breathed it it exhilarated me it cheered and elated me it rosetinted my emotions it gave me an appetite for my breakfast it made me feel ready for any enterprise  as soon as i thought it proper to make a morning call i went to number 906 alaska avenue there i found a large and handsome house of that independent and highly commendable style of architecture which characterizes many of the houses of washington i had not yet made up my mind whether i should inquire for mother anastasia or miss raynor i did not know the custom of mother superiors when traveling or visiting and i determined as i ascended the steps to be guided in this matter by the aspect of the person who opened the door  it has always been interesting to me to study the character as well as i can do so in the brief opportunity generally afforded of the servants who open to me the doors of houses to a certain degree although of course it does not do to apply this rule too rigidly these persons indicate the characters of the dwellers in the house my friends have disputed this point with me and have asserted that they do not wish to be so represented but nevertheless i have frequently found my position correct  i prefer to visit those houses whose door service is performed by a neat goodlooking intelligent brightwitted kindlytempered conscientious and sympathetic maidservant a man is generally very unsatisfactory he performs his duty in a perfunctory manner his heart is not in it he fears to say a word more than he thinks absolutely necessary lest you should imagine him new in service and had not lost his interest in answering questions  but even if the person you ask for be not at home it is sometimes a pleasure to be told so by an intelligent maid such as i have mentioned above ones subsequent action is frequently influenced by her counsel and information frequently she is able to indicate to you your true relation with the household sometimes she assists in establishing it  when the door before me opened i saw a colored woman i was utterly discomfited none of my rules applied to a middleaged colored woman who gazed upon me as if she recognized me as one whom she carried in her arms when an infant actuated by impulse only i inquired for miss raynor  i reckon said she yous got to de wrong house dat lady doan live hyar  well then i asked quickly is there a lady here named mother anastasia  the woman showed thirtytwo perfectly developed teeth  oh dats she you means de sister shes hyar yes sah want to see her  i stated that i certainly desired to see her  shes gone out now sah an deres no tellin when deyll git back dey ginerally all gits back bout dark commonly jist a little arter dark  not return before dark i exclaimed that is bad can you give me any idea where i might find mother anastasia  i spects you kin fin her mighty easy mos likely shes at de patent office or at de army and navy buildin or de white house or de treasury or de smifsonian or de navy yard or de new servatory or on de avenue shoppin or gone to de capitol to de senate or de house one or perhaps she druv out to arlinton or else shes gone to de gressional libry mos likely shes at one or de odder of dem places an about one oclock she an mis gardley is mighty sure to eat der luncheon somewhar an arter that i reckon theyll go to bout four arternoon teas i doan know xactly whare de teas ll be dis arternoon but ye kin tell de houses whar dar is a tea inside by de carriages awaitinan ef it aint a tea its a funraland all yers got to do is to go inside an see if shes dar  i could not refrain from smiling but i was greatly discouraged how could i wait until evening for the desired interview  if you is kin to de sister said the womanan i reckon you is for i see de likeness powerful strongshell be mighty glad to see ye sah want me ter tell her yell come back this evening if you doan fin her before dat  i desired her to give such a message and went away well pleased that the woman had not asked my name it was desirable that mother anastasia should not know who was coming to call on her  i am as i have said before much given to the consideration of motives and all that sort of thing and in the course of the day i found myself wondering why i should have taken the trouble to walk through the patent office and half a dozen other public buildings continually looking about me not at the objects of interest therein but at the visitors that is if they were ladies why this uneasy desire to find the mother superior when by quietly waiting until evening i was almost certain to see her but in the midst of my selfquestionings i went on looking for mother anastasia  i finished my long ramble by a visit to the gallery of the house of representatives a member was making a speech on a bill to establish a national medical college for women the speech and the subject may have interested some people but i did not care for either and i am afraid i was a little drowsy after a time i took a cab and went to my hotel at all events the long day of waiting was nearly over  early in the evening i called again at mrs gardleys house and to my delight i was informed that the lady i desired to see was at home  when mother anastasia came into the drawingroom where i awaited her she wore the gray gown of her sisterhood but no head covering i had before discovered that a woman could be beautiful in a martha gown but at this moment the fact asserted itself with peculiar force she greeted me with a smile and an extended hand  you do not seem surprised to see me i said  why should i be she answered i saw you in the house of representatives and wondered why you should doze when such an interesting matter was being discussed and when i came home and heard that a gentleman answering your description intended to call on me this evening i declined to go out to the theatre wishing to be here to receive you  i was disgusted to think that she had caught me napping and that she had been near me in the house and i had not known it but i said nothing of this  you are very good i remarked to give up the theatre  oh dont thank me she interrupted perhaps you will not think i am good before we say anything more i want you to tell me whether or not you came here to talk about sylvia raynor  here was a blunt question but from the bottom of my heart i believed that i answered truly when i said i had not come for that purpose  very good said mother anastasia leaning back in her chair now i can freely say that i am glad to see you i was dreadfully afraid you had come to talk to me on that forbidden subject and i must admit that this fear had a very powerful influence in keeping me at home this evening if you had come to talk to me of her i would have had something very important to say to you but i am delighted that my fears were groundless and now tell me how you could help being interested in that grand scheme for a womans college  i have never given it any thought do you care for it  care for it she exclaimed i am enlisted in the cause hand and heart i came down here because the bill was to be brought before the house if the college is establishedand i believe it will bei expect to be one of the faculty  you are not a physician said i  oh i have studied and practiced medicine she answered and expect to do a great deal more of it before we begin operations the physicians art is my true vocation  and you will leave the house of martha i asked  yes she replied the period for which i entered it has nearly expired i do not regret the time i have spent there but i must admit i shall be glad to leave the sisterhood that life is too narrow for me and perhaps too shallow i say nothing against it in a general way i only speak of it as it relates to myself the very manner in which i rejoice in the prospect of freedom proves to me that i ought to be free and that i did a wise thing in limiting the term of my sisterhood  as mother anastasia spoke there was a glow of earnest pleasure upon her face she was truly very happy to be able to talk of her approaching freedom  i am a prudent man and a cautious one this frank enthusiasm alarmed me how deftly she had put sylvia out of sight how skillfully she had brought herself into full view free and untrammeled by vows and rulesa woman as other women  the more i saw of mother anastasia the better i liked her but i perceived that she was a woman with whom it was very necessary to be cautious she was apt i thought to make convictions of her presumptions if she presumed that my love for sylvia was an utterly hopeless affection to be given up and forgotten i did not like it it might be that it was hopeless but i did not care to have any one else settle the matter for me in that waynot even mother anastasia  of course i remarked i am glad that you have concluded to withdraw from a vocation which i am sure is not suited to you and yet i feel a little disappointed to hear that you will not continue at the head of the house of martha for i came to washington on purpose to make you a proposition in regard to that institution  came to washington on purpose to see me and to make a proposition what can it possibly be  i now laid before her with considerable attention to detail my plan for working in coöperation with the house of martha i showed her the advantages of the scheme as they had suggested themselves to me and as an example of what could be done i mentioned sylvias fancy for typewriting and demonstrated how easily i could undertake the outside management of this very lucrative and pleasant occupation i warmed up as i talked and spoke quite strongly about what iand perhaps in time other menmight do for the benefit of the sisterhood if my proposition were accepted  she listened to me attentively her face growing paler and harder as i proceeded when i had finished she said  it is not at all necessary for me to discuss this utterly preposterous scheme nor even to refer to it except to say that i plainly see its object whatever you have persuaded yourself to think of your plan i know that its real object is to reëstablish a connection with sylvia you would know if you would allow yourself to think about it that your absurd and even wicked scheme of typewriting companionship in work and all that stuff could only result in making the girl miserable and perhaps breaking her heart you know that she loves you and that it has been a terrible trial to her to yield to her conscience and do what she has done and you know furthermoreand this more than anything else darkens your intentionthat sylvias artless ingenuous and impulsive nature would give you advantages which would not be afforded to you by one who did not love you and who better understood the world and you  madam i exclaimed you do me an injustice  she paid no attention to this remark and proceeded and now let me tell you that what you have said to me tonight has changed my plans my life i shall not leave sylvia exposed to your cruel attacksattacks which i believe will come in every practical form that your ingenuity can devise it was my example that brought that girl into the house of martha and now that she has vowed to devote her life and her work to its service i shall not desert her i will not have her pure purpose shaken and weakened little by little day by day until it falls listless and deadened with nothing to take its place therefore until i know that you are no longer a source of danger to her i shall remain mother superior of the house of martha and rest assured that while i am in that position sylvia shall be safe from you and with that she rose and walked out of the room     xliii  was his heart true to poll   never before had any one spoken to me as mother anastasia had just spoken never before had i felt as i felt in leaving the house where she had spoken to me i did not admit all that she had said and yet not even to myself could i gainsay her statements i was not convinced that i had been wrong but i could not help feeling that she was right i was angry i was mortified i was grieved the world seemed cold and dark and the coldest and darkest thing in it was the figure of mother anastasia as she rose to leave me  when i reached new york i bethought myself of my promise to miss laniston it tortured my soul to think of what had happened i knew it would torture it still more to talk of these things but i am a man who keeps his promises besides i wanted to see miss laniston i did not like her very much but the people whom i did like seemed to be falling away from me and she was a woman of vigorous spirit to whom one in my plight would naturally turn that she could give me any encouragement was not likely but she might offer me an enheartening sympathy and moreover she was well acquainted with mother anastasia and there were a good many questions i wanted to ask about that lady  i found miss laniston at home but i was obliged to wait a good while before she made her appearance  if you were any other man in this world she said i should have felt obliged to excuse myself from seeing you for i am engaged on most important business with a modiste who is designing a gown for me but i am perfectly wild to hear about your interview with mother anastasia and i was afraid if i sent you away that you would not come back again so tell me about it i pray you i know you have seen her for you look so uncommonly glum i am afraid that you have not yet become a brother of the house of martha  there was nothing inspiring about this badinage but i braced myself to the work and told her what had happened in washington  this is truly dreadful she declared of course i had no idea that mother anastasia would consider your plan as anything more than the wild outreachings of a baffled lover but i did not imagine that she would take it in this way this is very bad  it is i answered everything is knocked from under me  oh bless you said the lady i wasnt thinking of you but of mother anastasia it was the happiest news i can remember when i heard that she was soon to drop that name and all that belonged to it and to begin a life in which she would be a woman among her peers no matter with what sex they happen to be classed but if she stops short and remains in that miserable house of martha the result is bound to be disastrous if she believes it is necessary to spend her life in protecting sylvia from your assaults she is the woman to spend her life in that way  what her friends should do said i is to convince her that it is not necessary  miss laniston gazed upon me fixedly you think it would be a great pity for a beautiful womana remarkably fine woman like mother anastasiato hide herself away in that makebelieve convent  indeed i do i answered with animation  and since one fine woman is shut up for life in that prison you think it a shame that another one should remain within its walls  i assented warmly  now then remarked miss laniston rising it is absolutely necessary for me to go to the frenchwoman who i know is fuming for me and whose time is very precious i shall be with you again in about twenty minutes and during that time i wish you would make up your mind with whom you are in lovemother anastasia or sylvia raynor when that point is settled we will see what can be done  it was a man of a bewildered mind who was left alone in that drawingroom i did not understand what had been said to me but now that ideas of this kind had been put into words there seemed to be a certain familiarity about them how dared she speak to me in that way what ground had she for such words  and yetsylvia was shut up for life in the house of martha i could not gainsay that  i could not put my thoughts into form and with my mind in chaos i strode up and down the room until miss laniston returned  what an uneasy person you are she said have you settled that little point  settled it there is nothing to settle  she laughed i am not so sure about that i thought i saw a change in the wind when you were here last and it is natural enough that it should change what is the good of its blowing steadfastly from the north when the north is nothing but ice  you have no right to talk in that way i exclaimed angrily i utterly repudiate your supposition  come come she said let us be practical i really take an interest in you you know and besides that i take an interest in my friends and it is quite plain to me that you must not be allowed to wander about in a detached way making all sorts of trouble you have made a good deal already so if we must consider sylvia raynor as really out of the race on account of being tied up by her sisterhood obligations we must turn our attention to mother anastasia who probably has not yet done anything definite in regard to retaining her position in the house of martha if anything can be done in this direction it will be entirely satisfactory because if you get the exmother superior of course you will be content to leave the young sister alone  madam you insult me i cried springing to my feet  by which i suppose she answered you wish me to understand that your heart is true to pollby poll meaning sylvia raynor  you know that as well as i do i replied i have taken you into my confidence i have told you that i loved her that i should always love her and it is unwomanly in you  that will do she interruptedthat will do dont say hard words to one of your best friends if you will continue to be true to poll not as the sailor was in the song but constant and steadfast in all sorts of weather and without any regard to that mere material point of eventually getting her for your own why then i am your fast friend to the end and will do everything that i can to soften your woes and lighten your pathway and all the reward i desire for my labors is the pleasure of knowing that there is at least one man in the world who can love truly and unchangeably without seeing any chance ahead of him of winning the woman he loves do you think you can fill that position  i looked at her sternly and answered i have said all upon that point that is necessary to say when i love a woman i love her forever  very good said miss lanistonvery good and i dare say your little side flights didnt mean anything at all and now i shall talk with mother anastasia as soon as possible and make her understand that she has no right to sacrifice herself to sylvia or any one else if i can get her started off on the right road i will see what i can do with the new mother superior whoever she may be perhaps you may yet be able to establish that delightful brotherhood of the house of martha any way i promise you you shall have something it may not be much and it may not be often but it shall be enough to keep your love alive and that you see is my great object i want to make of you a monument of masculine constancy  as i took leave of her miss laniston gave my hand a vigorous pressure which seemed to me to indicate that her intentions were better than her words as i went away my mind was quieter though not cheered there was in it a certain void and emptiness but this was compensated for by a sense of selfapprobation which was strengthening and comforting i was even able to smile at the notion of the interview between miss laniston and sister sarah when the former should propose my plan of the brotherhood     xliv  preliminary brotherhood   when i returned to arden i gave walkirk an outline of what had occurred but i did not go into details having no desire that the preposterous idea which had gotten into the head of miss laniston should enter that of my understudy walkirk was not in good spirits  i had hoped something he said from your interview with mother anastasia though perhaps not exactly in the line of a brotherhood i thought if she came to thoroughly understand your earnestness in the matter she might use her influence with miss raynor which at some time or other or in some way or other might result to your advantage and that of the young lady i had and still have great belief in the capabilities of mother anastasia but now i am forced to believe very much against my will that there is no hope ahead with mother anastasia decidedly against us the fight is lost  us i repeated  my dear sir said he i am with you soul and body  without a word i took him by the hand and pressed it warmly  what do you think of continuing your recitals of travel walkirk said to me later in the day i should think they would interest you and i know they were vastly interesting to me you must have a great deal more to tell  i have i answered but i shall not tell it now instead of talking about travels i have determined to travel at present it is awkward for me to remain here it is impossible for me to feel independent and able to do what i please and know that there are persons in the village who do not wish to meet me and with whom it would be embarrassing and perhaps unpleasant to meet i know i must meet them some time or other unless they shut themselves up or i shut myself up that sort of thing i cannot endure and i shall go to turkey and egypt those countries i have not visited if it suits you i shall take you with me and i shall also take a stenographer to whom i shall dictate on the spot the materials for my book  do you mean asked walkirk that you will dispense altogether with that preparatory narration to me of what you intend afterwards to put into your book i consider that a capital plan and i think you found it of advantage  that is true i answered the plan worked admirably i did not propose to work in that way again but i will do it every night i will tell you what i have done and what i think about things and the next morning ill dictate that material revised and shapen to the stenographer who can then have the rest of the day to write it out properly  a capital plan said walkirk and i shall be charmed to go with you  i was indeed very anxious to leave arden i could not believe that mother anastasia had ever imagined any of the stuff that miss laniston had talked about but she certainly had shown me that she was greatly offended with me and nothing offends me so much as to have people offended with me such persons i do not wish to meet  i did not immediately fix a date for my departure for it was necessary for me to consider my grandmothers feelings and welfare and arrange to make her as happy as possible while i should be gone in the mean time it was of course necessary that i should take air and exercise and while doing this one morning in a pretty lane just out of the village a figure in the house of martha gray came into sight a little distance ahead of me her back was toward me and she was walking slower than i was now then thought i here is a proof of the awkwardness of my position here even in a little walk like this i must run up against one of those sisters i must pass her or turn around and go back for i shall not slow up and appear to be dogging her footsteps but i shall not turn backthat does not suit me consequently i walked on and soon overtook the woman in gray she did not turn her head as i approached for the sisters are taught not to turn their heads to look at people after all it would be easy enough for me to adopt the same rule and to pass her without turning my head or paying the slightest attention to her this was the manner indeed in which the general public was expected to act toward the inmates of the house of martha when met outside their institution  when i came up with her i turned and looked into the bonnet it was sylvia as my eyes fell upon the face of that startled angel my impulse was to throw my arms around her and rush away with her gray bonnet shawl and all to some distant clime where there were no houses of martha mother anastasias or anything which could separate my dear love and me but i crushed down this mad fancy smothered as well as i could my wild emotions and said as calmly as possible  good morning sister  over the quick flushes of her face there spread a smile of pleasure  i like that she said i am glad to have you call me sister i thought you would be prejudiced against it and would not do it  prejudiced i said not a bit of it i am delighted to do so  that is really good of you she said and how have you been you look a little wan and tired have you been doing your own writing  oh no i said i have given up writing at least for the present i wish i could make you understand how glad i am to call you sister and how it would joy my heart if you would call me brother  oh that would not do at all she said in a tone which indicated surprise at my ignorance that would be quite a different thing i am a sister to everybody but you are not a brother to anybody  when you hear what i have to say about this i answered you will understand what i mean by wishing to be called brother may i ask where you are going  i am going to visit a sick person in that little house at the bottom of the hill sister agatha came with me but she had the toothache and had to go back i expect sister sarah will send some one of the others to join me for she always wants us to go about in couples  she is entirely right said i i did not know she had so much sense and i shall make one of the couple this time you ought not to be walking about here by yourself  i suppose i ought to have gone back with sister agatha said she but i didnt want to im dreadfully tired of staying in the house of martha trying to learn typewriting i can do it pretty well now but nothing has come of it sister sarah got me one piece of work which was to copy a lot of bad manuscript about local option i am sure if i am to do that sort of thing i shall not like typewriting  you shall not do that sort of thing said i and now let us walk on slowly while i tell you what i meant by the term brother i was in a whirl of delight now i would talk to one who i believed would sympathize with my every thought who would be in harmony with my outreachings if she could do no more and from whom i need expect neither ridicule nor revilings we walked on slowly and i laid before her my scheme for the brotherhood of the house of martha  i was not mistaken in my anticipation of sylvias sympathy she listened with sparkling eyes and when i finished clapped her hands with delight  that is one of the best plans that was ever heard of in this world she said how different it would make our life at the institution of course the brothers wouldnt live there but we should see each other like ordinary people in society and everything would not be so dreadfully blank and there is no end to the things which you could do which we cannot do unless with a great deal of trouble the usefulness of your plan seems to have no limits at all how many brothers do you think we ought to have  i have not considered that point i said at present i know of but one person besides myself who would have the necessary qualifications for the position  i expect she said looking at me with a twinkle of fun in her eye that if you had the selection of the other brothers they would be a tame lot  perhaps you are right i said and we both broke into a laugh  i wish i could tell you said sylvia how much i am charmed with your idea of the brotherhood i havent enjoyed myself so much for ever so long  we were now nearing the little house at the bottom of the hill an idea struck me  who is it that you are going to visit i asked  it is an old man she said who has the rheumatism so badly that he cannot move he has to take his medicine every hour and his wife is worn out sitting up and giving it to him and sister agatha and i were sent to take care of him during the morning and let the poor old woman get some sleep  very good said i here is a chance for me to make a beginning in my scheme of brotherhood and that without asking leave or license of anybody i will go in with you and help you nurse the old man  i expect you can do it splendidly said sylvia and now we can see how a brotherhood would work  we entered a little house which apparently had once been a good enough home for humble dwellers but which now showed signs of extreme poverty a man with gray hair and placid pale face was lying on a bed in one corner of the room into which the door opened and in a chair near by sat an old woman her head bobbing in an uneasy nap she roused when we entered and seemed glad to see us  hes about the same as he was she said an as hes loike to be width thim little draps of midicine but if youre a docther sir it aint for me to be meddlin an sayin that one of thim pepper pod plasters width howles in it would do more good to his poor back than thim draps inside of him  rheumatism is not treated externally so much as it used to be i said you will find that internal medication will be of much more service in the long run  that may be sir said she but it wont do to make the run too long considtherin he hasnt been able to do a sthroke of work for four weeks an if yed ever tried one of thim plasters sir yed know theys as warmin as sandpaper an salt but if i kin git a little slape it will be better for me than any midicine inside or out  thats what we came to give you said sylvia go into the other room and lie down and you shall not be called until it is time for your dinner  the woman gave a little shrug which i imagine was intended to indicate that dinner and dinnertime had not much relation to each other in this house and going into an adjoining room was probably soon fast asleep  it would be better to begin by giving him his medicine i know all about it for i was here yesterday i forgot to ask his wife when she gave it to him last said sylvia but we might as well begin fresh at the halfpasts  she poured out a teaspoonful of the stuff and administered it to the old man who opened his mouth and took it placidly  he is very quiet and very patient said sylvia to me in an undertoneand it is impossible for me to describe how delightful it was to have her speak to me in such a confidential undertonehe doesnt talk any she continued and doesnt seem to care to have anybody read to him for when sister agatha tried that yesterday he went to sleep but he likes his brow bathed and i can sit on this side of his bed and do that and you can find a chair and sit on the other side and tell me more about your plan of brotherhood  there was no other chair but i found a box on which i seated myself on the other side of the old mans cot while sylvia taking a bottle from her pocket proceeded to dampen the forehead of the patient with its pleasantly scented contents  i did not much like to see her doing this nor did i care to discuss our projects over the body of this rheumatic laborer  it strikes me i said that it would be a good idea to put on that bay rum or cologne or whatever it is with a clean paintbrush or something of the kind dont you dislike using your fingers  sylvia laughed you have lots to learn yet she said before you can be a brother and now tell me what particular kind of work you think the brothers would do i hardly think nursing would suit them very well  i did not immediately answer and sylvias quick mind divined the reason of my reluctance  let us talk en français she said that will not disturb this good man and he can go to sleep if he likes  très bien i said parlons nous en français  il serait charmant said she jaime la belle langue  the old man turned his head from one to the other of us all his placidity vanished and he exclaimed  ciel voilà les anges lun et lautre qui vient parler ma chère langue  good gracious exclaimed sylvia i thought he was irish  the patient now took the talking business into his own hands and in his dear language told us his tale of woe it was a very ordinary tale and its dolefulness was relieved by the old mans delight at finding people who could talk to him like christians one of his woes was that he had not been long enough married to his wife to teach her much french  i wish interpolated sylvia to me that we had kept on in english it would have been much more satisfactory i expect one of the other sisters will be here before very long and before she comes i wish you would tell me how you are getting on with your book i have been thinking about it ever and ever so much  i am not getting on at all said i without you there will be no book  at this sylvia knit her brows a little and looked disturbed  that is not a good way to talk about it she said unless indeed the book could be made a part of the brotherhood work in some way the publisher might want a typewritten copy and if i should make it i should know the end of the story of tomaso and lucilla you know i had almost given up ever knowing what finally happened to those two  you shall know it said i we shall work together yet i can think of a dozen ways in which we can do it and i intend to prove that my brotherhood idea is thoroughly practicable  of course it is said sylvia isnt this practical and she bedewed the patients brow so liberally that some of the perfume ran into his eyes and made him wink vigorously  merci mademoiselle said he mais pas beaucoup mais pas beaucoup  a capital practical idea has just occurred to me i said do you think you shall be here tomorrow  i expect to come here she answered for i take a great deal of interest in this old man mother anastasia is still away and i expect that sister sarah will send me again for this is the kind of work she believes in she has a very poor opinion of typewriting but of course a sister will come with me  there is one coming to join you now i said i see her gray figure on the top of the hill as she will not understand matters and as i do not wish to talk any more about my plans until i am better able to show how they will work i think it will be well for me to retire but i shall be here tomorrow morning and it would suit my plans very well if another sister comes with you  sylvia looked around at the approaching gray figure  i think that is sister lydia she said at least i think i recognize her walk and so it might be well for you to go if it were sister agatha it wouldnt matter so much of course when your plan is all explained and agreed to it will not make any difference who comes or goes  very true said i and now i think i will bid you goodmorning be sure and be here tomorrow  she shook hands with me across the prostrate form of the rheumatic frenchman who smiled and murmured bien bien mes anges and she assured me that i might expect her on the morrow     xlv  i make coffee and get into hot water   i do not like to do anything which looks in the least underhanded but i must admit that i left that wretched cottage by the back door and taking a path through some woods made a wide circuit before returning to the village  as soon as i reached my house i called walkirk from his writing and rapidly gave him instructions in regard to the execution of an idea which had come into my mind during my brotherhood labors of the morning  i told him to hasten to the scene of my building operations and to take away all the carpenters painters and plasterers he could crowd into a twohorse wagon and to go with them to the house of the rheumatic frenchman from which i knew the sisters would have departed before he reached it i promised to join him there and at the same time that he set out on his errand i hurried to a shop in the village the owner of which combined the occupations of cabinet maker and undertaker and who generally kept on hand a small stock of cheap furniture from this i selected such articles as i thought would be suitable or useful in a small house which at present contained nothing too good for a bonfire and ordered them sent immediately to the frenchmans cottage  i reached this wretched little house a few minutes before the arrival of walkirk and the wagonload of mechanics my understudy had entered heartily into my scheme and by his directions the men had brought with them everything needed to carry out my plans and in a very short time he and i had set every man to work  there were carpenters plasterers painters paperhangers and a tinner and glazier and when they learned that i wanted that little house completely renovated in the course of the afternoon they looked upon the business as a lark and entered into it with great spirit the astonished woman of the house did not understand what was about to happen and even when i had explained it to her her mind seemed to take in nothing except the fact that the house ought to be cleaned before the painting and paperhanging began but there was no time for delays of this sort and the work went on merrily  when the furniture arrived the woman gave a gasp for the last time the vehicle which brought them to her house had been there it had taken away her previous husband but a bureau and table and a roll of carpet assured her of its different purpose and she turned in with a will to assist in arranging these articles  before dark the work was all done the rheumatic frenchman was lying on a shining new bedstead a box of pepper pod plasters had been placed in the hands of his delighted wife a grocery wagon had deposited a load of goods in the kitchen the mechanics in gay spirits had driven away and walkirk and i tired but triumphant walked home leaving behind us a magical transformation a pervading smell of paint and damp wallpaper and an aged couple as much dazed as delighted with what had happened  soon after breakfast the next day i repaired to the bright and tidy little cottage and there i had my reward standing near the house a little in the shadow of a good sized evergreentree which i had ordered transplanted bodily from the woods into the little yard i beheld sylvia approaching and with her a sister with a bandaged face whom i rightly supposed to be the amiable sister agatha  when the two came within a moderate distance of the cottage they stopped they looked about them from side to side and it was plain to see that they imagined they were on the wrong road then they walked forward a bit stopped again and finally came towards the house on a run  i advanced to meet them  good morning sisters said i the two were so much astonished that they did not return my greeting and for a few moments scarcely noticed me then sylvia turned  how in the world she exclaimed did all this happen it must be the same house  i smiled it is very simple said i thisand as i spoke i waved my hand towards the cottageis an instance of the way in which the brothers of the house of martha intend to work  and you did this exclaimed sylvia with radiant eyes  i explained to the eagerly listening sisters how the transformation had been accomplished and with a sort of reverent curiosity they approached the house sister agathas astonishment was even greater than that of sylvia for she had long known the wretched place  it is a veritable miracle she said see this beautiful white fence and the gate it opens on hinges  be careful said i as they entered the little yard some of the paint may yet be wet although i told them to put as much drying stuff in as was possible  actually cried sylvia a gravel walk up to the house  and the outside a daffodil yellow with fern green blinds said sister agatha  and the eaves tipped with geranium red cried sylvia  and a real tree on each side of the front door and new steps exclaimed sister agatha  when they entered the house the amazement and delight of the two sisters was a joy to my soul they cried out at the carpet on the floor the paper on the walls the tables the chairs the bureau the lookingglass the three framed lithographs on the wall the clock and the shining new bedstead on which their patient lay  if mother anastasia could but see this cried sylvia she would believe in the brotherhood  he sez yer angels said the woman of the house coming forward thats what he sez an hes roight too for with thim pepper pod plasters an the smell of paint in the house which he hates hell be out o doors in two days or im much mishtaken  sylvia and i now approached the old man to see what he thought about it he was very grateful and said nothing about the smell of paint but we found him with a burning desire in his heart which had been fanned into flames by the arrival of the groceries on the day before he eagerly asked us if we could make coffee when he was well he could make it himself but since he had been lying on that bed he had not tasted a drop of the beloved liquid his wife did not drink it and could not make it but as we could speak french and had sent coffee he felt sure that we could compound the beverage so dear to the french heart  the angels make coffee he said in his best patois otherwise what would heaven be  both of the angels declared that the good man should have some coffee without delay but sylvia said to me that although she had not the least idea how to make it she was quite sure sister agatha could do it but that sister when asked declared that she knew nothing about coffee and did not approve of it for sick people but if the man did not like the tea his wife made she would try what she could do  but this offer was declined the old man must have his coffee and as there was no one else to make it i undertook to do it myself i thought i remembered how coffee had been made when i had been camping out and i went promptly to work everybody helped the old woman ground the berries sister agatha stirred up the fire and sylvia broke two eggs in order to get shells enough to clear the liquid  it was a good while before the coffee was ready but at last it was made and sylvia carried it to our patient in a great bowl she sat down on one side of the bed to administer the smoking beverage with a spoon while i sat on the other side and raised the old mans head that he might drink the better after swallowing the first tablespoonful the patient winked  i hope it did not scald his throat said sylvia do you know what scald is in french  i cannot remember said i you had better let the next spoonful cool a littlebut the patient opened his mouth for more  cest potage he said mais il est bon  i am sorry i made soup of it i said to sylvia but i am sure it tastes like coffee  we continued to feed the old man who absorbed the newfangled broth as fast as it was given to him until a voice behind me made us both jump  sister hagar said the voice what does this mean  goodness mother anastasia cried sylvia you made me scald the outside of his throat  at the foot of the bed stood mother anastasia clad in her severest gray her brows knit and her lips close pressed  sister hagar she repeated what is all this  i let down the old mans head and sylvia placing the almost empty bowl upon the table replied serenely  mr vanderley is making a beginning in brotherhood workthe brotherhood of the house of martha you know i think it would work splendidly just look around and see what he has done he has made this charming cottage out of an old rattletrap house everything you see in one afternoon and lots of provisions in the kitchen besides sisters alone could never have done this  mother anastasia turned to me  i will speak with you outside she said and i followed her into the little yard as soon as we were far enough from the house to speak without being overheard she stopped and turning to me said  you are not content with driving me from the life on which i had set my heart back into this mistaken vocation but you are determined to make my lot miserable and unhappy and not mine only but that of that simplehearted and unsuspecting girl i do not see how you can be so selfishly cruel you are resolved to break her heart and to do it in the most torturing way but you shall work her no more harm i do not now appeal to your honor to your sense of justice i simply say that i shall henceforth stand between you and her what misery may come to her and to me from what you have already done i do not know but you do no more  i stood and listened with the blood boiling within me  marcia raynor i saidfor i shall not call you by that title which you put on and take off as you pleasei here declare to you that i shall never give up sylvia if i never speak to her again or see her i shall not give her up i make no answer to what you have charged me with but i say to you that as sylvias life and my life cannot be one as i would have it i shall live the life that she lives even though our lives be ever apart for the love i bear her i shall always do the work that she does but i believe that the time will come when people wiser than you are will see that what i proposed to do is a good thing to do and the time will come when a man and a woman can labor side by side in good works and both do better work because they work together and to sylvia and to my plan of brotherhood i shall ever be constant remember that  without a word or change in her expression she left me went into the house and closed the door behind her i did not wish to make a scene which would give rise to injurious gossip and therefore walked away though as i did so i turned to look in at the open window but i did not see sylvia i only saw the bandaged face of sister agatha looking out at me more mournful than before  as i rapidly walked homeward i said to myself now i declare myself a full brother of the house of martha i shall take up their cause and steadfastly work for it whether they like it or not     xlvi  going back for a friend   when i reached home i looked up my grandmother and told her everything that had happened my excitement was so great that it was necessary i should talk to some one and i felt a pang of regret when i remembered that latterly i had given no confidences to her  my grandmother listened eagerly and without interrupting me but as i spoke she shook her head again and again and when i had finished she said  my dear boy if you understood the world and the people in it as well as i do you would know that that sort of thing could never never work before long you and sylvia would be madly in love with each other and then what would happen nobody knows it may be that mother anastasia has not fully done her duty in this case or it may be that she has done too much and other people may have acted improperly and without due thought and caution but be this as it may it is plain enough to see that your poor heart has been dreadfully wrung i wish i had known before of this brotherhood notion and of what you intended to do and i would have told you as i tell you now that in this world we must accept situations that is the only way in which we can get along at all sylvia raynor has gone soul and body into this martha house which is the same as a convent and to all intents and purposes she is the same as a nun now there is no use fighting against that sort of thing even if she should consent to climb over the wall and run away with you i do not believe you would like a wife who would do that after all she had vowed and given her solemn word to  my dear grandmother i said all that you say may be true but it makes no difference to me i shall always be faithful to sylvia  perhaps so perhaps so said my grandmother but you must remember this it may be all very well to be faithful but you should be careful how you do it in some respects mother anastasia is entirely right and your faithfulness if injudiciously shown may make miserable the life of this young woman i sighed but said nothing my grandmother looked pityingly upon me  i think you can do nothing better than to go and travel as you have proposed stay away for a year dear knows i do not want to keep you from me for all that time but the absence will be for your good it will influence your life when you come back then you will know yourself better than you can possibly know yourself now then you will be able to see what you truly ought to do and i promise you that if i am alive i will help you do it  i took the dear old lady in my arms and her advice to my heart i acknowledged to myself that at this conjuncture the wisest thing the kindest thing was to go away i might not stay away for a year but i would go  grandmother i said i will do what you advise but i have something to ask of you i have vowed that i will be a brother of the house of martha and that i will do its work with or without the consent of the sisters and with or without their companionship now if i go will you be my substitute will you as far as you can assist the sisters in their undertakings and do what you think i would have done had i been here  i cannot change a dilapidated hut into a charming cottage in one afternoon she said placing both hands on my shoulders as she spoke but i will do all that i can and all that you ought to do if you were here that much i promise  then i will go i said with a heavy heart but with an easier conscience  walkirk entirely approved of an immediate start upon the journey which i had before proposed i think he feared that if it was postponed any longer i might get some other idea into my head which would work better than the brotherhood scheme and that our travels might be postponed indefinitely  but there was a great deal to be done before i could leave home for a lengthy absence and a week was occupied in arranging my business affairs and planning for the comfort and pleasure of my grandmother while i should be away walkirk engaged the stenographer and was the greatest possible help to me in every way but notwithstanding his efforts to relieve me of work that was a busier week for me than any week in my whole life this was an advantage to me for it kept me from thinking too much of the reason for my hurried journey  at last the day arrived on which the steamer was to sail and the generally cool walkirk actually grew nervous in his efforts to get me ready to start by the early morning train for the city in these efforts i did not assist him in the least in fact had he not been with me i think that i should not have tried to leave home in time to catch the steamer the more i thought of catching the steamer the less i cared to do so the more i thought of leaving home the less i cared to do so it was not that i was going away from sylvia that made me thus reluctant to start it was because i was going away without taking leave of herwithout a word or even a sign from her i ground my teeth as i thought of how i had lost the only chance i had had of bidding her farewell and of assuring her that no matter what happened i would be constant to her and to the principles in which we had both come to believe i had been too much excited on the morning i had left her in the frenchmans cottage to think that that would be my last chance of seeing her that thereafter mother anastasia would never cease to guard her from my speech or sight i should have rushed in caring for nothing people might have talked but sylvia would have known that prohibitions and separations would make no difference in my feeling for her  and now i was going away without a word or a sign or even the slightest trifle which i could cherish as a memento of her there was a blankness about it all which deadened my soul  but walkirk was inexorable he made every arrangement and even superintended my farewell to my grandmother and gently but firmly interrupted me as i repeated my entreaties that she would speedily find out something about sylvia and write to me at last we were in the carriage with time enough to reach the station and walkirk wiped his brow as would a man who had had a heavy load lifted from his mind  we had not gone a quarter of the distance when the thought suddenly struck me why should i go away without a memento of sylvia why had i not remembered my friend vespa the wasp whose flight around my secretarys room had made the first break in the restrictions which surrounded her had first shown me a sylvia in place of a graybonneted nun that dead wasp pinned to a card on the wall of my study was the only thing i possessed in which sylvia had a share i must go back and get it i must take it with me  when i shouted to the coachman to turn that i must go back to get something i had forgotten walkirk was thrown into a fever of anxiety if we did not catch this train we would lose the steamer the next train would be three hours later but his protestations had no effect upon me i must have sylvias wasp no matter what happened  back to the house we dashed and upstairs i ran i took down the card to which the wasp was affixed i found a little box in which to put it and while i was looking for a rubber band by which to secure the lid a servant came hurriedly into the room with a telegram for me i tore it open it was from miss laniston and read thus       come to me as soon as you can important business  important business i ejaculated she can have no business with me that does not concern sylvia i will go to her instantly in a few seconds i was in the carriage shouting to the man to drive as fast as he could  yes indeed said walkirk you cannot go too fast  i handed my companion the telegram he read it blankly  it is a pity he said if the business is important all that can be done now is to telegraph to her that she must write to you in london by the next steamer  i shall do nothing of the kind said i i am going to her the instant we reach new york  walkirk clenched his hands together and looked away he had no words for this situation  my temper was very different  what a wonderful piece of luck i exclaimed if we had kept on to the station by this short cut the telegraph boy who of course came by the main road would have missed me and there would not have been time for him to get back to the station before the train started how fortunate it was that i went back for that wasp  wasp almost screamed walkirk and by the way he looked at me i know he imagined that i was temporarily insane  we caught the train and on the way i explained my allusion to the wasp so far as to assure walkirk that i was no more crazy than men badly crossed in love are apt to be  but are you really going to miss laniston he said  i shall be able to drive up there give her fifteen minutes with five as a margin and reach the steamer in time you can go directly to the dock and attend to the baggage and everything  my understudy sighed but he knew it was of no use to make any objections he did not fail however to endeavor to impress upon me the importance of consulting my watch while listening to miss lanistons communication  my plan was carried out we separated as soon as we reached the city and in a cab i rattled to miss lanistons house     xlvii  i interest miss laniston   when i reached miss lanistons house that lady was at breakfast but she did not keep me waiting long  truly she said as she entered the drawingroom you are the most expeditious person i ever knew i knew that you would come to me but i did not suppose you would even start as soon as this  i had already started when i received your telegram i said  to come here  no to sail for europe  well well she exclaimed from this moment i shall respect my instincts a thing i never did before when i woke this morning my first thought was of the message i intended to send to you and i intended to attend to it immediately after breakfast but my hitherto unappreciated instincts hinted to me that no time should be lost and i called my maid and dispatched the telegram immediately moral do all the good you can before you get up in the morning why are you starting for europe  i havent time to tell you i said in fact i can only remain a few minutes longer or i shall lose the steamer please tell me your business  is sylvia the cause of your going away she asked  yes i said is she the reason of your wishing to see me  most certainly she answered when does your steamer start  by ten oclock i said  oh bless me she remarked glancing at the clock you have quite time enough to hear all i have to say and then if you do not catch the steamer it is your own fault sit down i pray you  very reluctantly i took a seat for at last the spirit of walkirk had infected me  now said she i will cut my story as short as possible but you really ought to hear it before you start i made a visit to arden on the day after you performed the grand transformation scene in your brotherhood extravaganza i should have been greatly amused by what was told me of this prank if i had not seen that it had caused so much trouble sylvia was in a wretched way and in an extremely bad temper marcia was almost as miserable for she was acting the part of an extinguisher not only to sylvias hopes and aspirations but to her own so far as i could see there was no way out of the doleful dumps in which you seemed to have plunged yourself and all parties concerned but i set to work to try what i could do to straighten out matters my principal object being i candidly admit to enable marcia raynor to feel free to give up her position of watchdog and go to her national college on which her soul is set but to accomplish this i must first do something with sylvia but that girl has a conscience like a fence post and a disposition like a squirrel that skips along the rails i could do nothing with her she had sworn to be a sister of martha for life and yet she would not consent to act like an out and out sister and give up all that stuff about typewriting for you and the other nonsensical notions of comarthaism with which you infected her she stoutly stuck to it in spite of all the arguments i could use that there was no good reason why you and she as well as the other sisters and some other gentlemen could not work together in the noble cause of i dont remember what folderol pretty comarthas you and she would make  then i tried to induce marcia to give up her fancies of responsibilities and all that and to leave the girl in the charge of the present mother inferior an elderly woman called sister sarah who in my opinion could be quite as much of a griffin as the case demanded but she would not listen to me she had been the cause of her cousins joining the sisterhood and now she would not desert her and she said a lot about the case requiring not only vigilance but kindness and counsel and that sort of thing then i went back to the city and tried my hand on sylvias mother but with no success at all she is like a stone gatepost and always was and declared that as sylvia had entered the institution because marcia was there it was the latters duty to give up everything else and to throw herself between sylvia and your mischievous machinations and to stay there until you were married to somebody and the danger was past  machinations i ejaculateda most unreasonable person  perhaps so said miss laniston but not a bit more than the rest of you you are the most unreasonable lot i ever met with having failed utterly with the three women i had some idea of sending for you and of trying to persuade you to marry some one who is not under the sisterhoods restrictions and so smooth out this wretched tangle but i knew that you were more obstinate and stiffnecked than any of them and so concluded to save myself the trouble of reasoning with you  a wise decision i remarked  but i could not give up she continued i could not bear the thought that my friend marcia raynor should sacrifice herself in this way i went back to arden in the hope that something might suggest itself that a gleam of sense might be shown by the one or the other of the lunatics in gray for whose good i was racking my brains but i found things worse than i had left them sylvia had stirred herself into a spirit of combativeness of which no one would have supposed her capable and had actually endeavored to browbeat her mother superior into the belief that a brotherhood annex was not only necessary to the prosperity and success of the house of martha but that it was absolutely wicked not to have it she had gone on in this strain until marcia had become angry and then there had been a scene and tears and much subsequent misery  i talked first with one doleful sister and then with the other with the only result that i became nearly as doleful as they in my despair i went to marcia and urged her to acknowledge herself vanquished to give up this contest which would be her ruin to show herself a true woman and to take up the true work of her life oh i couldnt do it she said and she looked as if she were going to cry a most unusual thing with her if i went away tomorrow they would be together making mudpies for the children of the poor i sprang to my feet marcia raynor i cried you made this house of martha you are the head and the front the top and the bottom of it you are its founder and its autocrat it lives on your moneyfor everybody knows that what these sisters make wouldnt buy their pillboxesand now having run it all these years and having brought yourself and sylvia to the greatest grief by it it is your duty to put an end to it to abolish it  abolish the house of martha she cried with her great eyes blazing at me  yes i said abolish it destroy it annihilate it declare it null void dead and gone utterly extinguished and out of existence you can do this and you ought to do this it is your only way out of the dreadful situation in which you have got yourself and sylvia let the other sisters go to some other institutions or wherever they like you and sylvia will be free that is the great point now do not hesitate stop supplies dissolve the organization break up the house of martha and do it instantly  she made one step towards me and seized me by the wrist janet she said i will do it and she did it that day at present there is no house of martha  i sat and gazed at miss laniston without comprehending what i had heard  no house of martha i ejaculated  that is precisely the state of the case she answered the establishment was dissolved at noon yesterday as i had had all the trouble of bringing this thing about i considered that i had a right to tell you of it myself i thought it would interest me to see how you took it  i rose to my feet i stepped towards her  no house of martha i gaspedand sylvia  sylvia will go home to her mother so she told me yesterday i was present at the dissolution i think she will probably come to the city this afternoon  i snatched up my hat i must go to her instantly i said i must see her before she reaches her mother i have lost time already  upon my word exclaimed miss laniston your way of taking it is indeed interesting not a word of thanks not a sign of recognition  i had nearly reached the door but now rushed back and seized her by the hand excuse me i said but you can see for yourselfand with one violent shake i dropped her hand and hurried away  oh yes she cried i can easily see for myself and as i left the house i heard her hearty laugh  i sprang into my cab ordering the man to drive fast for the railroad station it mattered not to me whether walkirk went to europe or not all i cared for was to catch the next train which would take me to arden     xlviii  in a cold bare room   when i reached arden i took one of the melancholy vehicles which stand at our station and very much astonished the driver by ordering him to take me not to my own home but to the house of martha  you know theyre busted up sir said the man turning to me as his old horse hurried us along at the best of his speed  but the sisters have not left i eagerly asked  not all he said but two or three of them went down this morning  drive on quicker i replied i am in a hurry  the man gave the horse a crack with his whip which made no difference whatever in our rate of speed and said  if youve got a bill agin any of them sir you neednt worry the mother is still there and shes all right you know  bill nonsense said i  im sorry theyre busted said the man they didnt do much hackin but they give us a lot of haulin from the station  as i hurried up the broad path which led to the front of the house of martha i found the door of the main entrance open something i had never noticed before although i had often passed the house i entered unceremoniously and saw before me in the hallway a woman in gray stooping over a trunk she turned at the sound of my footsteps on the bare floor and i beheld sister sarah her eyes flashed as she saw me and i know that her first impulse was to order me out of the house this of course she now had no right to do but there were private rights which she still maintained  i should think she said that a man who has done all the mischief that you have done who has worked and planned and plotted and contrived until he has undermined and utterly ruined the sisterhood of pious women who ask nothing of this world but to be let alone to do their own work in their own way would be ashamed to put his nose into this house but i suppose a man who would do what you have done does not know what shame is have you come here to sneer and jibe and scorn and mock and gloat over the misfortunes of the women whose home you have broken up ruined and devastated  madam said i can you tell me where i can find miss sylvia raynor  she looked as if she were about to spring and bite  atrocious she exclaimed i will not stay under the same roofand she marched out of the door  i made my way into the reception room i met no one and the room was empty although i heard on the floor above the sound of many footsteps apparently those of the sisters preparing for departure  i looked around for a bell or some means of making my presence known the room appeared harder barer emptier than when i had seen it before in a moment it was filled with all the light and beauty of the world a door opened and sylvia entered  i saw you come she said advancing with outstretched hands and hurried down as soon as i could  she was in her gray dress but without shawl or head covering her face was filled with the most charming welcome i hastened towards her i did not take her hands but opening my arms i folded her in them and kissed her over and over again with flushed face she pushed herself a little from me  isnt this taking a great deal for granted she said  granted i exclaimed think of what has been denied think of the weeks the months  we would a great deal better think somebody may come in here and see us said sylvia pushing herself still farther from me  but didnt you expect me to rush to you the instant i heard you were a free woman did you suppose there was anything to be taken for granted between us  oh no she said i think we understood each other pretty well but then dont you see i didnt suppose it would be like this i am expecting a trunk from new york every minute and i thought when it came i should be dressed like other people now that i am not a sister i did not want you to see me in these dreary clothes then i would go to my mothers house and i thought you would call on me there and things would go on more regularly but you are so impetuous  my dearest love said i it fills me with rapture to take you in my arms in the same dress you wore when i fell in love with you often and often as i looked at you through that grating have i thought that it would be to me the greatest joy on earth if i could take you in my arms and tell you that i loved you  you thought that exclaimed sylvia it was very wrong of you  right or wrong i did it said i and now i have her my dear little nun here in my arms  she ceased to push and looked up at me with a merry smile  do you remember she said the morning the wasp came near stinging me  indeed i do i said vehemently  well before that wasp came she continued i used to be a good deal afraid of you i thought you were very learned and dignified but after i was so frightened and you saw me without my bonnet and all that i felt we were very much more like friends and that was the very beginning of my liking you  my darling i exclaimed that wasp was the best friend we ever had do you want to see it and releasing her i took from my pocket the pasteboard box in which i had placed our friend vespa as she looked at the insect her face was lighted with joyous surprise  and that is the same wasp she said and you kept it  yes and shall always keep it i said even now it has not ceased to be our friend and then i told her how my desire to take with me this memento of her had held me back from the rolling atlantic and brought me to her she raised her face to me with her beautiful eyes in a mist of tenderness and this time her arms were extended  you are the dearest man she said  in less than a minute after she had spoken these words mother anastasia entered the room she stood for a moment amazed and then she hastily shut the door  really she exclaimed you two are incomprehensible beings dont you know that people might come in here at any moment it is fortunate that i was the person who came in at this moment  but you knew he was here said sylvia  yes i knew that the other replied but i expected you would both remember that at present this house might almost be considered a public place  my dear marcia said sylvia if you knew him as well as i do you would know that he would never remember anything about a place  i turned to the exmother superior who had already discarded the garb of the sisterhood and was dressed in a dark walking suit  if you knew me as well as i know myself i said reaching to her both my hands you would know that my gratitude towards you is deeper than the deepest depths of the earth she took one of my hands  if you have anything to be grateful for she said it is for the lectures i have given you and which i am afraid i ought to continue to give you as to what was done here yesterday i consider myself as much benefited as anybody and i suppose sylvia is of the same opinion regarding herself but there is one person to whom you truly ought to be gratefulmiss laniston  i know that i said i have seen her she told me what she did and i treated her as i would treat a boy who had brushed my coat but i shall make amends  indeed you shall said sylvia and i will go with you when you do it  but you must not set yourself aside in this way said i addressing the older lady it was you who fanned my hopes of winning sylvia when there seemed no reason why they should not fade away it was you who promised to help me and who did help me  did you do that marcia asked sylvia  the beautiful woman who had been mother anastasia flushed a little as she answered  yes dear but then you were only a sister on probation  and you wanted me to marry him  the other smiled and nodded and in the next moment sylvias arms were about her neck and sylvias lips were on her cheek  i was very much affected and there is no knowing how my feelings and gratitude might have been evinced had not the clumping of a trunk upon the stairs and the voices of sisters at the door called me to order     xlix  my own way   when i went home to my grandmother she was greatly surprised to see me and i lost no time in explaining my unexpected appearance  really really she exclaimed i was just writing you a letter which i intended to send after you so that you would get it when you arrived in london and in it i was going to tell you all about the breaking up of the house of martha of which i first heard half an hour after you left me i was glad you had not known of it before you started for i thought it would be so much better for all the changes to be made while you were away and for sylvia to be in her mothers house where she could get rid of her nunnish habits and have some proper clothes made up of course i knew you would come back soon but i thought your own mind would be in much better order for a little absence  my dear grandmother i cried in mind and body i am in perfect order and it is presence not absence which made me so  somehow or other said she smiling the fates seem to help you to have your own way and i am sure i am delighted that you will stay at home and what has become of mr walkirk  upon my word i exclaimedi do not know  towards evening walkirk returned looking tired and out of spirits i truly regretted the carelessness and neglect with which i had treated him and explained and apologized to the best of my ability he was a goodnatured fellow and behaved magnanimously  things have turned out wonderfully well he said as he took a seat but i shall be more delighted with the state of affairs when i am a little less fatigued minor annoyances ought not to be considered but i assure you i have had a pretty rough time of it as the hour for sailing drew near and you did not make your appearance i became more and more nervous and anxious i would not allow our baggage to be put on board for i knew a conference with a lady was likely to be of indefinite duration and when at last the steamer sailed i went immediately to miss lanistons house to inform you of the fact and to find out what you proposed to do but miss laniston was not at home and the servant told me that a gentlemanundoubtedly youhad left the house nearly an hour before and his great haste made her think that he was trying to catch a steamer  people would not hurry like that she said to catch a train for theres always another one in an hour or two  then i began to fear that in your haste you had gone on board the wrong steamertwo others sailed today a little later than ours and i went to their piers and made all sorts of inquiries but i could find out nothing then i went to your club to your lawyers office and several other places where i supposed you might go but no one had seen or heard of you then a fear began to creep over me that you had had some greatly depressing news from miss laniston and that you had made away with yourself  walkirk i exclaimed how dared you think that  men in the nervous condition i was he answered think all sorts of things and that is one of the things i thought finally i went to miss lanistons house again and this time i found her and learned what had happened then i went to the pier ordered the trunk sent back here for i knew there was no question now of the trip to europe and here i am  it was easy to see that whatever pleasure the turn in my affairs may have given walkirk he was disappointed at losing his trip to europe but i thought it well not to reopen his wounds by any allusion to this fact and contented myself by saying the most earnest and cordial things about what he had done and suffered for me that day and inwardly determining that i would make full amends to him for his lost journey  in about ten days i received a message by cable from liverpool which was sent by my stenographer informing me that he had gone aboard the steamer as per agreement and being busy writing letters to send back by the pilot had not discovered that walkirk and i were not on board until it was too late the message was a long one and its cost as well as that of the one by which i informed the stenographer that he might come home and the price of the mans passage to liverpool and back besides the sum i was obliged to pay him for his lost time might all have been saved to me had the fellow been thoughtful enough to make himself sure that we were on board before he allowed himself to be carried off but little rubs of this kind were of slight moment to me at that time  on the day after things had been taken for granted between sylvia and myself i saw her at her mothers house and i must admit that although it had given me such exquisite pleasure to feel that she was mine in the coarse gray gown of a sister it delighted me more to feel she was mine in the ordinary costume of society she was as gay as a butterfly ought to be which had just cast off its gray wrappings and spread its wings to the coloring light  i found mrs raynor in a somewhat perturbed state of mind  i cannot accommodate myself she said to these sudden and violent mutations i like to sit on the sands and stay there as long as i please and to feel that i know how high each breaker will be and how far the tide will come in but these tidal waves which make beach of sea and sea of beach sweep me away utterly i cannot comprehend where i am a week ago i considered you as an enemy with active designs on the peace of my daughter i was about to write you a letter to demand that you should cease from troubling her but i heard you were going to europe and then i felt that henceforth our paths would be smoother for i believed that absence would cure you of your absurd and objectless infatuation but suddenly down goes the house of martha and up comes the enemy transformed into a suitor who is loved by sylvia and against whom i can have no possible objection now can not you see for yourself how this sort of thing must affect a mind accustomed to a certain uniformity of emotion  madam said i it will be the object of my life to make you so happy in our happiness that you shall remember this recent tumult of events as something more gratifying to look back upon than your most cherished memories of tranquil delight  you seem to have a high opinion of your abilities she said smiling and of the value of what you offer me i am perfectly willing that you try what you can do nevertheless i wish you had gone to europe everything would have turned out just the same and the affair would have been more seemly  oh we can easily make that all right said i sylvia and i will go to europe on our bridal trip  as i finished these words sylvia came into the room accompanied by miss laniston  here is a gentleman said my dear girl to her companion who has declared his desire to thank you for something you have done for him and he has spoken so strongly about the way in which he intended to pour out his gratitude that i want to see how he does it  mr vanderley said miss laniston i forbid you to utter one word of that outpouring which you would have poured out yesterday morning had it not been so urgently necessary to catch a train when i am ready for the effusion referred to i will fix a time for it and let you know the day before and i will take care that no one shall be present at it but ourselves  any way said sylvia he will tell me all about it  if he does said miss laniston you will reenter a convent     l  my book of travel   when the house of martha had been formally abolished the members of the sisterhood made various dispositions of themselves some determined to enter institutions of a similar character while others who had homes planned to retire to them with the intention of endeavoring to do what good they could without separating themselves from the world in which they were to do it sister sarah was greatly incensed at the dissolution of the house and much more so because had it continued she expected to be at the head of it she declared her intention of throwing herself into the arms of the mother church where a sisterhood meant something and where such nonsense and treachery as this would be impossible  i did not enjoy the autumn of that year to the extent that i should have enjoyed it had i been able to arrange matters according to my own ideas of what was appropriate to the case  sylvia lived in the city and i lived in the country and although i went to her whenever i could and she and her mother dined several times with my grandmother there were often long stretches sometimes extending over the greater part of the day when i did not see her at all  thus it was that i had sometimes to think of other things and one morning i said to my understudy walkirk there is something i regret very much and that is the noncompletion of my book i shall never finish it i am sure because every thing that has ever happened to me is going to be made uninteresting and tedious by what is to happen travel and life itself will be quite another thing to me and i am sure that i will be satisfied with enjoying it and shall not want to write about it and so goodby to the book  in regard to your book said walkirk i feel it my duty to say to you that there is no occasion for you to bid goodby to it  you are wrong there i exclaimed i shall never write it i do not want to write it  nevertheless said walkirk the book will be written i shall write it in fact i have written a great part of it already  what in the name of common sense do you mean i cried staring at him in astonishment  what i am going to say to you replied walkirk may displease you but i earnestly hope that you may eventually agree with me that what i have done is for the general good you may remember that when you first talked to me of your travels you also handed me some of the manuscript you had prepared for the opening chapters of your book and gave me an outline of the projected plan of the work now as i have often told you i considered the material for a book of travels contained in your experiences as recited to me as extremely fresh novel and entertaining and would be bound to make what publishers call a hit if properly presented but at the same time i am compelled to say that i soon became convinced that there was no probability that you would properly present your admirable subject matter to the reading world  upon my word said i this is cool  it is hard to speak to you in this way he answered and the only way in which i can do it is to be perfectly straightforward and honest about it i am at heart a literary man and have so far as i have the power cultivated the art of putting things effectively and i assure you sir that it gave me actual pain when i found how you were going to present some of the incidents of your journey such as for instance your diving experiences in the maelstrom or at least in the place where it was supposed to be and where judging from your discoveries it may under certain conditions and to a certain extent really exist  there were a good many other points which i believe could be made of startling interest and value not only to ordinary readers but to scientific people if they were properly brought out i saw no reason that you would so bring them out and i felt not only that i could do it but that it would delight me to do it  my feeling on the subject was so strong that as you may remember i declined to act as your secretary i am perhaps oversensitive but i could not have written your book as you would have dictated it to me and as you did indeed dictate it to your various secretaries  go on i said i am perfectly charmed with my power of repressing resentment  therefore it was he continued that i set to work to write the book myself founding it entirely upon your daily recitals my plan was to write as long as i found you were in the humor to talk and in fact if you lost interest in me as a listener i determined that i would then declare what i had done show you my work and implore you if you felt like it to give me enough subject matter to finish it  i have now stated my case and i place it entirely in your hands i will give you what i have written and if you choose to read it and do not like it you can throw it into the fire the subject matter is yours and i have no rights over it but if you think that the work which you have decided to discontinue can be successfully carried on by me i shall be delighted to go ahead and finish it  walkirk said i you have the effrontery of a stone sphinx but let me see your manuscript  he handed it to me and during the rest of the morning and for a great part of the night after i had returned in a late train from the city i read it the next day i handed it to him  walkirk said i as my understudy go ahead and finish this book you never came nearer the truth than when you said that that material is vastly interesting  walkirk was delighted and took up the work with enthusiasm whenever i had a chance i talked to him and whenever he had a chance he wrote however at that time i gave so much of my business to my understudy that he was not able to devote himself to his literary work as assiduously as he and i would have desired in fact the book is not yet finished but when it appears i think it will be a success     li  a loose end   i was now a very happy man but i was not an entirely satisfied one looking back upon what had happened i could see that there were certain loose ends which ought to be gathered up before they were broken off and lost or tangled up with something to which they did not belong  it has always been my disposition to gather up the loose ends to draw together the floating strands of circumstance tendency intention and all that sort of thing so that i may see what they are and where they come from i like to know how i stand in relation to them and how they may affect me  one of the present loose ends was brought to my mind by a conversation with sylvia i had been speaking of her cousin marcia raynor and expressing my pleasure that she was about to enter a new life to which she seemed so well adapted  marcia is a fine woman she said and i love her ever so much but you know she has caused me a great deal of pain that she has actually made me cry when i was in bed at night  i assured her that i had never imagined such a thing possible  of course sylvia continued i do not refer to the way she acted just before the house of martha was broken up then she opposed everything i wanted to do and would listen to no reason but i wouldnt listen to her reasons either and i was entirely too angry with her to think of crying on her account it was before that that she made my very heart sick and all on your account  she was severe upon me i suppose  not a bit of it said sylvia if she had been severe i should not have minded it so much but it was quite the other way now just put yourself in my place and try to think how you would have felt about it here was i fixed and settled for life in the house of martha and here were you perfectly convincedat least i was afraid you were convincedthat there was nothing for you to do but to give me up and here was marcia just about to step out into the world a free woman and at the same time taking a most wonderful interest in you and trying to make you understand that you ought to let me alone and all that sort of thing  in which she did not succeed at all i said  so it appears said sylvia but i couldnt be sure about that at the time you know and if she had succeeded there was no earthly reason why you should not have become as much interested in her as she was in you and thenbut its too dreadful to talk about it used to make me fairly boil  you mean to say said i that you were jealous of your cousin marcia  yes she answered there is no use in calling it by any other name i was jealous savagely so sometimes  now this was a very high compliment and i did not fail to express my satisfaction at having been the subject of such emotions but one of the results of sylvias communication was to remind me of the existence of a loose end i had never understood mother anastasias feelings towards me it had been very interesting to me to make conjectures about those feelings and now that i could safely do more than conjecture i wished to do more and to find out if possible if there had been any reasons for the construction i had placed upon the actions of the beautiful mother superior of course this was of no real importance now but one cannot be brought into relations with such a woman as marcia raynor without wanting to know exactly what those relations were  i had far too much prudence however to talk on this subject with sylvia if i talked with any one i must do it very cautiously one morning i called upon miss laniston that lady was informed on a great many points and moreover was exceedingly freespoken i did not expect any direct information from her but she might say something from which i might make inferences  she thought i had come to thank her for what she had done for me but i assured her that this ceremony must be postponed for the present for sylvia had instructed me to write my gratitude in a letter which she thought would be a much preferable method than for me to pour it out in a private interview  your sylvia seems to be a jealous little body she remarked  oh no said i although of course it is natural enough for persons in our state of mind to have tendencies that way by the way one of these tendencies on her part was rather odd do you know that at one time she was almost jealous of her cousin marcia at that time a graybonneted sister as you know so much of our affairs i do not think i am going too far in telling that  miss laniston seemed to be considering the subject  it is the commonest thing she said presently to make mistakes about matters of this sort now for instance i once put some questions to you which seemed to indicate that there might be some reason for sylvias uneasiness didnt you think they pointed that way  yes i did i replied  and have you ever thought of it since she asked  occasionally of course the matter is of no vital interest now but at the time you spoke of it i could not help wondering if i had said or done anything during my rather intimate acquaintance with mother anastasia which would give you good cause to put the questions to which you just now alluded  well said miss laniston you seemed to me at the time to be in a decidedly unbalanced state of mind but i think i acted most unwarrantably in speaking of marcia as i did in fact i often act unwarrantably it is one of my habits and to prove it to you i am going to act unwarrantably again having brought the elder miss raynor before you in a way that might have led you to have undefined ideas about her i am going to bring her before you again in order that those ideas may be exactly defined it is all wrong i know but i like to set things straight whether i do it in the right way or wrong way  that is exactly my disposition i replied i always want to set things straight  she left the room and soon returned with a letter  when i decide positively to do a thing she said sitting down and opening the letter i think it just as well to drop apologies and excuses you and i have decided that matters ought to be set straight and so here goes marcia has just written me a long letter in which she says a good deal about you and sylvia and i am going to read you a part of it which i think will straighten out some things which i may have made crooked in my efforts to do good to all parties concerneda dangerous business i may say  it is delightful to think thus marcia writesthat sylvias life is at last settled for her and that too in the right way of course neither you nor i would be satisfied with a match like that but sylvia is not only satisfied with mr vanderley but i have no doubt that she will be perfectly happy with him more than that i believe she will supply his shortcomings and strengthen his weaknesses and as he has a naturally good disposition and an ample fortune i think sylvia is to be sincerely congratulated when we first spoke of this matter a good while ago i thought that if the sylviavanderley affair could ever be arranged it would be a good thing and i have not changed my opinion the rest of the letter said miss laniston folding it as she spoke chiefly concerns the new college and i do not suppose it would interest you  i agreed with her and took my leave the loose end had been gathered up     lii  i finish the sicilian lovestory   it might have been supposed that my little experience in gathering up loose ends would have deterred me from further efforts in this direction but it did not  i had left miss laniston without asking some questions i had intended to put to her i wished very much to knowi thought it was my right to knowsomething definite about the mr brownson who had formerly been connected so to speak with the misses raynor i hated this subject as i hated the vilest medicine but i felt that i must get the matter straightened in my mind yet i could not say anything to sylvia about it and after what miss laniston had read to me i could not ask her anything even if my mind had been sufficiently composed to formulate questions she was a very plainspoken person too much so perhaps  walkirk was very different in fact i think he erred on the other side i am sure that he would have liked to conceal from me anything that would give me pain in the course of his life he had met a great many people he might know something about brownson any way i would throw out some feelers in that direction  yes i remarked to him in the course of a conversation about the late mother superior what she is going to do is a very fine thinga noble enterprise and she is just the sort of person to go into it but after all i would rather see her married to the right sort of man a woman like that owes it to society to be married  i fancy said walkirk that she has permanently left the marrying class when she broke with brownson i think she broke with marriage  what were the points of that i asked did you ever happen to hear anything about him  i knew him very well answered walkirk those were his prints i was cataloguing just before i entered your service he had then been dead a year or more and i was working for the estate  i arose and went to the window i wiped my forehead which had become moist if this man had known brownson why should he not know all was he familiar with both engagements it made me sick to think of it there was no sense or reason in such emotion for it was not likely that sylvias engagement had been a secret one but i had a proud soul and could not bear to think that people about me especially walkirk should be aware of sylvias attachment slight as it may have been to another than myself i heartily wished that i had not spoken of the subject  still as i had spoken of it i might as well learn all that i could  what sort of a man was this brownson i asked what reason was there that miss marcia raynor should have cared for him  he was a fine man said walkirk he was educated goodlooking rich he was young enough but had been a bachelor too long perhaps and had very independent ways it was on account of his independence of thought especially on religious matters that he and miss marcia raynor had their difficulties which ended in the breaking of the engagement i am quite sure that she was a good deal cut up as i said before i do not think that she will consider marriage again  i took in a full breath of relief here walkirk had told the little story of brownson and had said nothing of any subsequent engagement perhaps he knew of none this thought was truly encouraging  perhaps you are right i said she may know better than any of us what will suit her any way i ought to be satisfied and that reminds me walkirk that i have never expressed to you as strongly as i wished to do it my appreciation of the interest you have taken in my varied relations with miss sylvia raynor and for the valuable advice and assistance you have given me from time to time for instance i believe that your reluctance to have me go away from tangent island was due to your discovery that the island belonged to sylvias mother and therefore there was some probability that she might come there  walkirk smiled you have hit the truth he said  i have sometimes wondered i continued why a man should take so much interest in the love affairs of another when one engages an understudy he does not generally expect that sort of thing  well said walkirk when a man engages as an understudy or in a similar capacity he often performs services without regard to his duty and salary simply because they interest and please him now it struck me that it would be a curious bit of romantic realism if two beautiful women who on account of one man had become nuns in a convent or what was practically the same thing should both be taken out of that convent and brought back to their true life in the world by another man  two womeni gasped  walkirk smiled and his voice assumed a comforting tone  of course that sort of thing has its rough points for the second man but in this case i do not think they amount to much brownsons affair with the younger lady would have come to an end as soon as she had discovered the rocks in his character but her mother broke it off before it came to that but i do not think she would have gone into the sisterhood if it had not been for the mans death very soon after the breaking of the engagement this affected her very much but there was no reason why it should for he was killed in a railway accident and i am positively certain that he would have married some one else if he had lived long enough  i had nothing to say to all this i walked slowly into my study and shut the door surely i had had enough of picking up loose ends if there were any more of them i would let them flap dangle float in the air do what they please i would not touch them                                       that evening i spent with sylvia in the course of our conversation she suddenly remarked  do you know we have had so much to do and so much to talk about and so much to think about and plan that i have had no chance to ask you some questions that i have been thinking about in the first place i want you to tell me all about mr walkirk how long has he been with you are you always going to keep him what does he do what was his business before he came to you was he always an understudy for people it has struck me that that would be such an odd occupation for a man to have and then there is another thinga mere supposition of mine but still something that i have had a sort of curiosity about supposing that the house of martha had not been broken up and it were all fixed and settled that i should stay there always and supposing cousin marcia had left us and had gone into her college work just as she is doing nowdo you think that you would have had any desire to study medicine  and then there is another thing that is not a question but something which i think i ought to tell yousomething which you have a right to know before we are married  sylvia said i interrupting her let me give you a little piece of wisdom from my own experience the gnawings of ungratified curiosity are often very irritating but we should remember that the gnawings of gratified curiosity are frequently mangling  indeed she exclaimed is that the way you look at it well i can assure you that what i have to tell is of no importance at all but if you have anything to say that is mangling i want to hear it this very minute  my dear sylvia said i we have had so much to do and so much to talk about and so much to think about and plan that i have had no chance to finish the story of tomaso and lucilla  that is true she cried with sparkling eyes and above all things i want to hear the end of that story  i sat by her on the sofa and finished the story of the sicilian lovers  in some ways she said it is very much like our story isnt it  except i answered that the best part of ours is just beginning
