entered according to act of congress in the year 1857 by   phillips sampson  co   in the clerks office of the district court of massachusetts       contents     rollo at play in the woods    the setting out    bridgebuilding    a visitor    difficulty    hearts wrong    hearts right again       rollo at play         in     the woods                                         the setting out   one pleasant morning in the autumn when rollo was about five years old he was sitting on the platform behind his fathers house playing he had a hammer and nails and some small pieces of board he was trying to make a box he hammered and hammered and presently he dropped his work down and said fretfully  o dear me  what is the matter rollo said jonasfor it happened that jonas was going by just then with a wheelbarrow  i wish these little boards would not split so i cannot make my box  you drive the nails wrong you put the wedge sides with the grain  the wedge sides said rollo what are the wedge sidesand the grain i do not know what you mean  but jonas went on trundling his wheelbarrow though he looked round and told rollo that he could not stop to explain it to him then  rollo was discouraged about his box he thought he would look and see what jonas was going to do jonas trundled the wheelbarrow along until he came opposite the barndoor and there he put it down he went into the barn and presently came out with an axe then he took the sides of the wheelbarrow off and placed them up against the barn then he laid the axe down across the wheelbarrow and went into the barn again pretty soon he brought out an iron crowbar and laid that down also in the wheelbarrow with the axe  then rollo called out  jonas jonas where are you going  i am going down into the woods beyond the brook  what are you going to do  i am going to clear up some ground  may i go with you  i should like itbut that is not for me to say  rollo knew by this that he must ask his mother he went in and asked her and she in return asked him if he had read his lesson that morning he said he had not he had forgotten it  then said his mother you must first go and read a quarter of an hour  rollo was sadly disappointed and also a little displeased he turned away hung down his head and began to cry it is not strange that he was disappointed but it was very wrong for him to feel displeased and begin to cry  come here my son said his mother  rollo came to his mother and she said to him kindly  you have done wrong now twice this morning you have neglected your duty of reading and now you are out of humor with me because i require you to attend to it now it is my duty not to yield to such feelings as you have now but to punish them so i must say that instead of a quarter of an hour you must wait half an hour before you go out with jonas  rollo stood silent a minutehe perceived that he had done wrong and was sorry he did not know how he could find jonas in the woods but he did not say any thing about that then he only asked his mother what he must do for the half hour she said he must read a quarter of an hour and the rest of the time he might do as he pleased  so rollo took his book and went out and sat down upon the platform and began to read aloud when he had finished one page which usually took a quarter of an hour he went in to ask his mother what time it was she looked at the clock and told him he had been reading seventeen minutes  is seventeen minutes more than a quarter of an hour or not so much asked rollo  it is morefifteen minutes is a quarter of an hour now you may do what you please till the other quarter has elapsed  rollo thought he would go and read more it is true he was tired but he was sorry he had done wrong and he thought that if he read more than he was obliged to his mother would see that he was penitent and that he acquiesced in his punishment  so he went on reading and the rest of the half hour passed away very quickly in fact his mother came out before he got up from his reading to tell him it was time for him to go she said she was very glad he had submitted pleasantly to his punishment and she gave him something wrapped up in a paper  keep this till you get a little tired of play down there and then sit down on a log and open it  rollo wondered what it was he took it gladly and began to go but in a minute he turned round and said  but how shall i find jonas  what is he doing said his mother  he said he was going to clear up some land  then you will hear his axe go down to the edge of the woods and listen and when you hear him call him but you must not go into the woods unless you hear him     bridge building   rollo went on down the green lane till he came to the turnstile and then went through into the field he then followed a winding path until he came to the edge of the trees and there stopped to listen  he heard the brook gurgling along over the stones and that was all at first but presently he began to hear the strokes of an axe he called out as loud as he could  jonas jonas  but jonas did not hear  then he walked along the edge of the woods till he came nearer the place where he heard the axe he found here a little opening among the trees and bushes so that he could look in he saw the brook and over beyond it on the opposite bank was jonas cutting down a small tree  so rollo walked on until he came to the brook and then asked jonas how he should get over the brook was pretty wide and deep  jonas said if he would wait a few minutes he would build him a bridge  you cannot build a bridge said rollo  wait a little and see  so rollo sat down on a mossy bank and jonas having cut down the small tree began to work on a larger one that stood near the bank  after he had cut a little while rollo asked him why he did not begin the bridge  i am beginning it said he  rollo laughed at this but in a minute jonas called to him to stand back away from the bank and then after a few strokes more the top of the tree began to bend slowly over and then it fell faster and faster until it came down with a great crash directly across the brook  there said jonas there is your bridge  rollo looked at it with astonishment and pleasure  now said jonas i will come and help you over  no said rollo i can come over myself i can take hold of the branches for a railing  so rollo began to climb along the stem of the tree holding on carefully by the branches when he reached the middle of the stream he stopped to look down into the water  this is a capital bridge of yours jonas said he how beautiful the water looks down here o i see a little fish he is swimming along by a great rock now he is standing perfectly still o jonas come and see him  no said jonas i must mind my work  after a little time rollo went carefully on over the bridge and sat down on the bank of the brook but he did not have with him the parcel his mother gave him he had left it on the other side  after he had watched the fishes and thrown pebblestones into the brook some time he began to be tired and he asked jonas what he had better do  i think you had better build a wigwam  a wigwam what is a wigwam said rollo  it is a little house made of bushes such as the indians live in  o i could not make a house said rollo  i think you could if i should tell you how and help you a little  but you say you must mind your work  yesi can mind my work and tell you at the same time  rollo thought he should like to build a wigwam very much jonas told him the first thing to be done was to find a good place where the ground was level rollo looked at a good many places but at last chose a smooth spot under a great oak tree which jonas said he was not going to cut down it was near a beautiful turn in the brook where the water was very deep  jonas told him that the first thing was to make a little stake and drive it down in the middle of his wigwamground then rollo recollected that he had left his hatchet over on the other side of the brook together with the parcel his mother gave him and he was going over to get them when jonas told him he would trim up the bridge a little and then he could go over more easily  so jonas went upon the bridge and began to cut away the branches that were in the way leaving enough on each side to take hold of and to keep rollo from falling in rollo could then go back and forth easily he held on with one hand and carried his hatchet in the other then he went over again and brought his parcel and laid it down near the great oak tree  then he made a little stake and drove it down in the middle of the wigwamground then he asked jonas what he must do next  that is the centre of your wigwam now you must strike a circle around it  what said rollo  dont you know how to strike a circle said jonas  rollo said he did not and then jonas told him to do exactly as he should say and that would show him  first said jonas have you got a string  rollo felt in his pockets in vain but he recollected his little parcel which was tied with a piece of twine and held it up to ask jonas if that would do jonas said it would and told him to take it off carefully and tie one end of it to his centre stake  and rollo did so  now said jonas make another little sharp stake for the marker and tie the other end of the twine to that near the sharp end  rollo worked busily for some time and then called out  jonas it is done  all this time jonas was at work in the bushes at a little distance he now came to rollos wigwamground and took hold of the marker and held it off as far from the middle stake as it would go and then began to make a mark on the ground all around the middle stake now as the marker was tied to the middle stake by the string the mark was equally distant from the middle stake in every part and that made it exactly round then jonas laid down the marker and pulled out the middle stake and they looked down and saw that there was a round mark on the ground about as large as a cartwheel  then jonas took the crowbar and made deep holes all around in this circle so far apart that rollo could just step from one to the other but rollo could not understand how he could make a house so  i will tell you said jonas you must now go and get some large branches of trees and trim off the twigs from the lower end and stick them down in these holes i will show you how  so jonas took a large bough and trimmed the large end and sharpened it a little and then he fixed it down in one of these holes in such a manner that the top of it bent over towards the middle of the circle then he went back to his work leaving rollo to go on with the wigwam     a visitor   rollo put down two or three branches very well and was very much delighted at seeing it gradually begin to look like a house when he thought he heard a voice he listened a moment and heard some one at a distance calling rollo rollo  rollo dropped his hatchet and looked in the direction that the sound came from and called out as loud as he could what  whereareyou was heard in reply  rollo answered here and then immediately clambered along over the bridge and ran through the woods until he came out into the open field and there he saw a small boy away off at a distance just coming through the turnstile  it was his cousin james it seems that james had come to play with him that day and rollos mother had directed him down towards the woods  james came running along towards rollo holding up something round and bright in each hand they were half dollars  where did you get them said rollo  one is for you and one is for me said james uncle george sent them to us  what a beautiful little eagle said rollo as he looked at one side of his half dollar i wish i could get it off and keep it separate  o no said james that would spoil your half dollar  why they would know it was a half dollar by the letters and the head on the other side what a pretty thin eagle how do you suppose they fasten it on so strong  james said he thought he could get it off so they went and sat down on a smooth log that was lying on the ground and laid rollos half dollar on the log then he took a pin and tried to drive the point of it under the eagles head with a small stone but the eagle would not move they only made some little marks and scratches on the silver  never mind said rollo i will keep it as it is so he took his half dollar and they walked along towards the brook  they showed their money to jonas and told him that they had tried to get the eagle off he smiled at this the boys went back soon to the wigwam and james said he would help rollo finish it while they were at work they put their money on a large flat stone on the bank of the brook they fixed a great many boughs into their wigwam weaving them in all around and thus made a very pleasant little house leaving a place for a door in front when they were tired they went and opened rollos little package and found a fine luncheon in it of bread and butter and pie which they ate very happily together sitting on little hemlock branches in the wigwam     difficulty   after their luncheon the boys began to talk about the best place for a window for the wigwam  i think we will have it this side towards the brook said james and then we can look out to the water  no said rollo it will be better to have it here towards where jonas is working and then we can look out and see him  no said james that is not a good plan i do not want to see jonas  and i do not want to see the water replied rollo it is my wigwam and i mean to have the window here  so saying he went to the side towards jonas and began to take away a bough james came there too and said angrily  the wigwam is mine as much as it is yours for i helped make it and i will not have a window here  so he took hold of the branch that rollo had hold of they both felt guilty and condemned but their angry feelings urged them on and they looked fiercely at each other and pulled upon the branch  rollo said james let go  james said rollo i tell you let my wigwam alone  it is not your wigwam  i tell you it is  just then they heard a noise in the bushes they looked around and saw jonas coming towards them they felt ashamed and were silent though each kept hold of the branch  now boys said jonas you have got into a foolish and wicked quarrel i have heard it all now you may do as you pleaseyou may let me settle it or i will lead you home to your mother and tell her about it and let her settle it  the boys looked ashamed but said nothing  if you conclude to let me settle it you must do just as i say but i do not pretend that i have any right to decide such a case unless you consent so i will take you home if you prefer  the boys both preferred that he should settle it and promised to do as he should say  well then said he the first thing is for you rollo to go over the other side of the brook and you james to stay here and both to sit down still until you have had time to cool  the boys obeyed and jonas went back to his work  the boys sat still feeling guilty and ashamed but they were not penitent they ought to have been sorry for their fault and become goodnatured and pleasant again but instead of that they were silent and displeased eyeing one another across the brook jonas waited some time and then came and called them both to him  now says james i will tell you all about it and you shall decide who was to blame  i heard it all and i know which was to blame you james came here to see rollo and found him building a wigwam it was his wigwam not yours he began it without you and was going on without you and when you came you had no right to assume any authority about it you ought to have let him do as he wished with his own wigwam you were unjust  here rollo began to look pleased and triumphant that jonas had decided in his favor  but continued jonas you rollo were playing here alone your little cousin came to see you and you were very glad to have him come he helped you build and when he wanted to have the window in a particular way you ought to have let him to quarrel with a visitor for such a cause as that was very ungentlemanly and unkind so you see you were both very much to blame  the boys looked guilty and ashamed but they did not feel really penitent they were not cordially reconciled neither was willing to give up  but said rollo how shall we make the window  i think you ought not to make any window as you cannot agree about it  they wanted to make a window now more than ever for each wanted to have his own way but jonas would not consent and as they had agreed to abide by his decision they submitted jonas then returned to his work and the boys stood by the side of the brook not knowing exactly what to do jonas told them when they went away that he expected that they would have another quarrel as he perceived that their hearts were still in a bad state     hearts wrong   the boys sat down on the bank of the brook and began to pick up little stones and throw them into the water they began soon to talk of the window again  rollo said jonas thought you were most to blame i know  no he did not replied james he blamed you the most he said you were unjust  i dont care said rollo you do not know how to build a wigwam you cannot reach high enough to make a window  i can reach high said james i can reach as high as that said he stretching up his hand  and i can reach as high as that said rollo stretching up his hand higher than james did for he was a little taller  james was somewhat vexed to find that rollo could reach higher than he could though it was very foolish to allow himself to be put out of humor by such a thing but boys when they are illhumored and dispute are always unreasonable and foolish james determined not to be outdone so he took up a stick and reached it up in the air as high as he could and said  i can reach up as high as that  then rollo took up a stone and tossed it up into the air saying  and i can reach as high as that  now when boys throw stones into the air they ought to consider where they will come down but unfortunately rollo did not in this case and the stone fell directly upon jamess head it was however a small stone and his cap prevented it from hurting him much but he was already vexed and out of humor and so he began to cry out aloud  rollo was frightened a little for he was afraid he had hurt his cousin a good deal and then he expected too that jonas would come but jonas took no notice of the crying but went on with his work now jonas was very kind and careful and always came quick when there was any one hurt but this time he knew by the tone of jamess crying that it was vexation rather than pain that caused it  james finding that his crying did no good gradually became still and in a few minutes as he happened to look round his eye rested on the stone where they had put their half dollars and he saw that only one of them was there  o rollo said he one of our half dollars is gone  they went to the stone and true enough one was gone they looked around but it was no where to be found boys that are out of humor with one another are never at a loss for subjects of dispute and rollo said he believed james had taken it and james charged it upon rollo then there was a dispute who should have the one that was left james knew it was his he said he remembered exactly how his looked and rollo knew it was his for the head and the stars were very bright on his and they were very bright on this james however had the half dollar and would not give it up and so rollo went to jonas and told him that james had got his half dollar  jonas came and heard the whole story from both of the boys james said he knew the one that was left was his for he remembered exactly how it looked and he also remembered exactly the very spot on the stone where he put it down  james did not mean to tell a lie but he was a little angry and excited and when boys are in that state of mind they are very apt to say they know not what  jonas looked at both sides of the half dollar very attentively  which half dollar was it said he that you tried to get the eagle off of  mine said rollo let me see  jonas held down the half dollar and showed to rollo and james the marks and scratches made by the pin proving that this was rollos half dollar james looked ashamed and confounded jonas just waited to hear what he would say     hearts right again   james stood still a minute thinking presently he said  well rollo i suppose my half dollar is lost but i am glad yours is safe at any rate  i am sorry yours is lost said rollo but then i can give you half of what i buy with mine  where did you put the half dollars said jonas  on that rock said rollo  they walked along towards the rock it was by the edge of the water jonas thought that as they had been dragging boughs of trees along near the rock some little branch might have reached over and brushed off one of the pieces of money into the water so he walked up to it and looked over  in a minute or two he pointed down and the boys looked and saw something bright and glittering on the bottom  is that it said james  i believe it is said jonas jonas then took off his jacket rolled up his shirt sleeve lay down on the rock and reached his arm down into the water but it was a little too deep he could not reach it  i cannot get it so said he  what shall we do said james how foolish i was to put it so near the water  i think we shall contrive some way to get it said jonas  he then sat down on the rock and looked into the water we can go home and get a long pair of tongs and get it with them at any rate said he  o yes said rollo i will go and get them and he ran off towards the bridge  no said jonas stop i will try one plan more  so he went and cut a long straight stem of a bush and trimmed it up smooth and cut the largest end off exactly square then he went to a hemlock tree near and took off some of the gum which was very sticky he pressed some of this with his knife on the end of the stick then he reached it very carefully down and pressed it hard against the half dollar it crowded the half dollar down into the sand out of sight  there you have lost it said james  i dont know said jonas and he began slowly and carefully to draw it up  illustration  when the end of the stick came up out of the sand the boys saw to their great delight that the half dollar was sticking fast on they clapped their hands and capered about on the stone while jonas gently drew up the half dollar and put it all wet and dripping into jamess hands  the boys thanked jonas for getting up the money and then they asked him to keep both pieces for them until they went home then they began to think of the wigwam again  we will make the window as you want it james said rollo i am willing  no said james i was just going to say we would make it your way i rather think it would be better to make it towards the land  why can you not have two windows said jonas  so we can said both of the boys and they immediately went to work collecting branches and weaving them in leaving a space for a window both sides their quarrelsome feelings were all gone and they talked very pleasantly at their work until it was time for them to go home to dinner
