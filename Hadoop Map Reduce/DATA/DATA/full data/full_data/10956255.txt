10956255	fennel and rue  by william dean howells     i  the success of verrian did not come early and it did not come easily he had been trying a long time to get his work into the best magazines and when he had won the favor of the editors whose interest he had perhaps had from the beginning it might be said that they began to accept his work from their consciences because in its way it was so good that they could not justly refuse it the particular editor who took verrians serial after it had come back to the author from the editors of the other leading periodicals was in fact moved mainly by the belief that the story would please the better sort of his readers these if they were not so numerous as the worse he felt had now and then the right to have their pleasure studied  it was a serious story and it was somewhat bitter as verrian himself was after his struggle to reach the public with work which he knew merited recognition but the world which does not like people to take themselves too seriously also likes them to take themselves seriously and the bitterness in verrians story proved agreeable to a number of readers unexpectedly great it intimated a romantic personality in the author and the world still likes to imagine romantic things of authors it likes especially to imagine them of novelists now that there are no longer poets and when it began to like verrians serial it began to write him all sorts of letters directly in care of the editor and indirectly to the editor whom they asked about verrian more than about his story  it was a mans story rather than a womans story as these may be distinguished but quite for that reason women seemed peculiarly taken with it perhaps the women had more leisure or more courage to write to the author and the editor at any rate most of the letters were from women some of the letters were silly and fatuous enough but others were of an intelligence which was none the less penetrating for being emotional rather than critical these maids or matrons whoever or whichever they were knew wonderfully well what the author would be at and their interest in his story implied a constant if not a single devotion now and then verrian was tempted to answer one of them and under favor of his mother who had been his confidant at every point of his literary career he yielded to the temptation but one day there came a letter asking an answer which neither he nor his mother felt competent to deal with they both perceived that they must refer it to the editor of the magazine and it seemed to them so important that they decided verrian must go with it in person to the editor then he must be so far ruled by him if necessary as to give him the letter and put himself as the author beyond an appeal which he found peculiarly poignant  the letter which had overcome the tacit misgivings of his mother as they read it and read it again together was from a girl who had perhaps no need to confess herself young or to own her inexperience of the world where stories were written and printed she excused herself with a delicacy which verrians correspondents by no means always showed for intruding upon him and then pleaded the power his story had over her as the only shadow of right she had in addressing him its fascination she said had begun with the first number the first chapter almost the first paragraph it was not for the plot that she cared she had read too many stories to care for the plot it was the problem involved it was one which she had so often pondered in her own mind that she felt in a way she hoped he would not think conceited almost as if the story was written for her she had never been able to solve the problem how he would solve it she did not see how she could wait to know and here she made him a confidence without which she said she should not have the courage to go on she was an invalid and her doctor had told her that though she might live for months there were chances that she might die at any moment suddenly he would think it strange and it was strange that she should tell him this and stranger still that she should dare to ask him what she was going to ask the story had yet four months to run and she had begun to have a morbid foreboding that she should not live to read it in the ordinary course she was so ignorant about writers that she did not know whether such a thing was ever done or could be done but if he could tell her how the story was to come out he would be doing more for her than anything else that could be done for her on earth she had read that sometimes authors began to print their serial stories before they had written them to the end and he might not be sure of the end himself but if he had finished this story of his and could let her see the last pages in print she would owe him the gratitude she could never express  the letter was written in an educated hand and there were no foibles of form or excesses of fashion in the stationery to mar the character of sincerity the simple wording conveyed the postal address with the date was fully given and the name signed at the end was evidently genuine  verrian himself had no question of the genuineness of the letter in any respect his mother after her first misgivings which were perhaps sensations thought as he did about it she said the story dealt so profoundly with the deepest things that it was no wonder a person standing like that girl between life and death should wish to know how the author solved its problem then she read the letter carefully over again and again verrian read it with an effect not different from that which its first perusal had made with him his faith in his work was so great so entire that the notion of any other feeling about it was not admissible  of course he said with a sigh of satisfaction i must show the letter to armiger at once  of course his mother replied he is the editor and you must not do anything without his approval  the faith in the writer of the letter which was primary with him was secondary with her but perhaps for that reason she was all the more firmly grounded in it     ii  there was nothing to cloud the editors judgment when verrian came to him except the fact that he was a poet as well as an editor he read in a silence as great as the authors the letter which verrian submitted then he remained pondering it for as long a space before he said that is very touching  verrian jumped to his question do you mean that we ought to send her the proofs of the story  no the editor faltered but even in this decision he did not deny the author his sympathy youve touched bottom in that story verrian you may go higher but you can never go deeper  verrian flushed a little oh thank you  im not surprised the girl wants to know how you manage your problemsuch a girl standing in the shadow of the other world which is always eclipsing this and seeing how youve caught its awful outline  verrian made a grateful murmur at the praise that is what my mother felt then you have no doubt of the good faith  no the editor returned with the same quantity if not the same quality of reluctance as before you see it would be too daring  then why not let her have the proofs  the thing is so unprecedented  our doing it neednt form a precedent  no  and if youve no doubt of its being a true case  we must prove that it is or rather we must make her prove it i quite feel with you about it if i were to act upon my own impulse my own convictions i should send her the rest of the story and take the chances but she may be an enterprising journalist in disguise its astonishing what women will do when they take to newspaper workand we have no right to risk anything for the magazines sake if not yours and mine will you leave this letter with me  i expected to leave the whole affair in your hands do you mind telling me what you propose to do of course it wont be anythingabrupt  oh no and i dont mind telling you what has occurred to me if this is a true case as you say and ive no question but it is the writer will be on confidential terms with her pastor as well as her doctor and i propose asking her to get him to certify in any sort of general terms to her identity i will treat the matter delicatelyor if you prefer to write to her yourself  oh no its much better for you to do it you can do it authoritatively  yes and if she isnt the real thing but merely a woman journalist trying to work us for a story in her sunday edition we shall hear no more from her  i dont see anything to object to in your plan verrian said upon reflection she certainly cant complain of our being cautious  no and she wont i shall have to refer the matter to the house  oh will you  why certainly i couldnt take a step like that without the approval of the house  no verrian assented and he made a note of the writers address from the letter then after a moment spent in looking hard at the letter he gave it back to the editor and went abruptly away  he had proof the next morning that the editor had acted promptly at least so far as regarded the house the house had approved his plan if one could trust the romantic paragraph which verrian found in his paper at breakfast exploiting the fact concerned as one of the interesting evidences of the hold his serial had got with the magazine readers he recognized in the paragraph the touch of the good fellow who prepared the weekly bulletins of the house and offered the press literary intelligence in a form ready for immediate use the case was fairly stated but the privacy of the authors correspondent was perfectly guarded it was not even made known that she was a woman yet verrian felt in reading the paragraph a shock of guilty dismay as if he had betrayed a confidence reposed in him and he handed the paper across the table to his mother with rather a sick look  after his return from the magazine office the day before there had been a good deal of talk between them about that girl mrs verrian had agreed with him that no more interesting event could have happened to an author but she had tried to keep him from taking it too personally and from making himself mischievous illusions from it she had since slept upon her anxieties with the effect of finding them more vivid at waking and she had been casting about for an opening to penetrate him with them when fortune put this paragraph in her way  isnt it disgusting he asked i dont see how armiger could let them do it i hope to heaven shell never see it  his mother looked up from the paragraph and asked  why  what would she think of me  i dont know she might have expected something of the kind  how expect something of the kind am i one of the selfadvertisers  well she must have realized that she was doing rather a bold thing  bold  venturesome mrs verrian compromised to the kindling anger in her sons eyes  i dont understand you mother i thought you agreed with me about the writer of that letterher sincerity simplicity  sincerity yes but simplicityphilip a thoroughly singleminded girl never wrote that letter you cant feel such a thing as i do a man couldnt you can paint the character of women and you do it wonderfullybut after all you cant know them as a woman does  you talk he answered a little sulkily as if you knew some harm of the girl  no my son i know nothing about her except that she is not singleminded and there is no harm in not being singleminded a great many singleminded women are fools and some doubleminded women are good  well singleminded or doubleminded if she is what she says she is what motive on earth could she have in writing to me except the motive she gives you dont deny that she tells the truth about herself  dont i say that she is sincere but a girl doesnt always know her own motives or all of them she may have written to you because she would like to begin a correspondence with an author or she may have done it out of the love of excitement or for the sake of distraction to get away from herself and her gloomy forebodings  and should you blame her for that  no i shouldnt i should pity her for it but all the same i shouldnt want you to be taken in by her  you think then she doesnt care anything about the story  i think very probably she cares a great deal about it she is a serious person intellectually at least and it is a serious story no wonder she would like to know at first hand something about the man who wrote it  this flattered verrian but he would not allow its reasonableness he took a gulp of coffee before saying uncandidly i cant make out what youre driving at mother but fortunately theres no hurry about your meaning the things in the only shape we could possibly give it and i am satisfied to leave it in armigers hands im certain he will deal wisely with itand kindly  yes im sure hell deal kindly i should be very unhappy if he didnt he could easily deal more wisely though than she has  verrian chose not to follow his mother in this all is he said with finality i hope shell never see that loathsome paragraph  oh very likely she wont his mother consoled him     iii  only four days after he had seen armiger verrian received an envelope covering a brief note to himself from the editor a copy of the letter he had written to verrians unknown correspondent and her answer in the original verrian was alone when the postman brought him this envelope and he could indulge a certain passion for method by which he read its contents in the order named if his mother had been by she would have made him read the girls reply first of all armiger wrote  my dear verriani enclose two exhibits which will possess you of all the facts in the case of the young lady who feared she might die before she read the end of your story but who you will be glad to find is likely to live through the year as the story ends in our october number she need not be supplied with advance sheets i am sorry the house hurried out a paragraph concerning the matter but it will not be followed by another perhaps you will feel as i do that the incident is closed i have not replied to the writer and you need not return her letter yours ever                      m armiger  the editors letter to the young lady read  dear madammr p s verrian has handed me your letter of the 4th and i need not tell you that it has interested us both  i am almost as much gratified as he by the testimony your request bears to the importance of his work and if i could have acted upon my instant feeling i should have had no hesitation in granting it though it is so very unusual as to be in my experience as an editor unprecedented i am sure that you would not have made it so frankly if you had not been prepared to guard in return any confidence placed in you but you will realize that as you are quite unknown to us we should not be justified in taking a step so unusual as you propose without having some guarantee besides that which mr verrian and i both feel from the character of your letter simply then for purposes of identification as the phrase is i must beg you to ask the pastor of your church or better still your family physician to write you a line saying that he knows you as a sort of letter of introduction to me then i will send you the advance proofs of mr verrians story you may like to address me personally in the care of the magazine and not as the editor                 yours very respectfully                           m armiger  the editors letter was dated the 6th of the month the answer dated the 8th betrayed the anxious haste of the writer in replying and it was not her fault if what she wrote came to verrian when he was no longer able to do justice to her confession under the address given in her first letter she now began in a hand into which a kindlier eye might have read a pathetic perturbation  dear siri have something awful to tell you i might write pages without making you think better of me and i will let you think the worst at once i am not what i pretended to be i wrote to mr verrian saying what i did and asking to see the rest of his story on the impulse of the moment i had been reading it for i think it is perfectly fascinating and a friend of mine another girl and i got together trying to guess how he would end it and we began to dare each other to write to him and ask at first we did not dream of doing such a thing but we went on and just for the fun of it we drew lots to see which should write to him the lot fell to me but we composed that letter together and we put in about my dying for a joke we never intended to send it but then one thing led to another and i signed it with my real name and we sent it we did not really expect to hear anything from it for we supposed he must get lots of letters about his story and never paid any attention to them we did not realize what we had done till i got your letter yesterday then we saw it all and ever since we have been trying to think what to do and i do not believe either of us has slept a moment we have come to the conclusion that there was only one thing we could do and that was to tell you just exactly how it happened and take the consequences but there is no reason why more than one person should be brought into it and so i will not let my friend sign this letter with me but i will put my own name alone to it you may not think it is my real name but it is you can find out by writing to the postmaster here i do not know whether you will publish it as a fraud for the warning of others but i shall not blame you if you do i deserve anything                    yours truly                       jerusha peregrine brown   if verrian had been an older man life might have supplied him with the means of judging the writer of this letter but his experience as an author had not been very great and such as it was it had hardened and sharpened him there was nothing wild or whirling in his mood but in the deadly hurt which had been inflicted upon his vanity he coldly and carefully studied what deadlier hurt he might inflict again he was of the crueller intent because he had not known how much of personal vanity there was in the seriousness with which he took himself and his work he had supposed that he was respecting his ethics and aesthetics his ideal of conduct and of art but now it was brought home to him that he was swollen with the conceit of his own performance and that however well others thought of it his own thought of it far outran their will to honor it he wished to revenge himself for this consciousness as well as the offence offered him of the two the consciousness was the more disagreeable  his mother dressed for the street came in where he sat quiet at his desk with the editors letters and the girls before him and he mutely referred them to her with a hand lifted over his shoulder she read them and then she said this is hard to bear philip i wish i could bear it for you or at least with you but im late for my engagement with mrs alfred as it isno i will telephone her im detained and well talk it over  no no not on any account id rather think it out for myself you couldnt help me after all it hasnt done me any harm  and youve had a great escape and i wont say a word more now but ill be back soon and then weoh im so sorry im going  verrian gave a laugh you couldnt do anything if you stayed mother do go  well she looked at him smoothing her muff with her hand a moment and then she dropped a fond kiss on his cheek and obeyed him     iv  verrian still sat at his desk thinking with his burning face in his hands it was covered with shame for what had happened to him but his humiliation had no quality of pity in it he must write to that girl and write at once and his sole hesitation was as to the form he should give his reply he could not address her as dear miss brown or as dear madam even madam was not sharp and forbidding enough besides madam alone or with the senseless prefix was archaic and verrian wished to be very modern with this most offensive instance of the latest girl he decided upon dealing with her in the third person and trusting to his literary skill to keep the form from clumsiness  he tried it in that form and it was simply disgusting the attitude stiff and swelling and the diction affected and unnatural with a quick reversion to the impossible first type he recast his letter in what was now the only possible shape     my dear miss brownthe editor of the american miscellany has    sent me a copy of his recent letter to you and your own reply and    has remanded to me an affair which resulted from my going to him    with your request to see the close of my story now publishing in his    magazine     after giving the matter my best thought i have concluded that it    will be well to enclose all the exhibits to you and i now do this    in the hope that a serious study of them will enable you to share my    surprise at the moral and social conditions in which the business    could originate i willingly leave with you the question which is    the more trustworthy your letter to me or your letter to him or    which the more truly represents the interesting diversity of your    nature i confess that the first moved me more than the second    and i do not see why i should not tell you that as soon as i had    your request i went with it to mr armiger and did what i could to    prompt his compliance with it in putting these papers out of my    hands i ought to acknowledge that they have formed a temptation to    make literary use of the affair which i shall now be the better    fitted to resist you will of course be amused by the ease with    which you could abuse my reliance on your good faith and i am sure    you will not allow any shame for your trick to qualify your pleasure    in its success     it will not be necessary for you to acknowledge this letter and its    enclosures i will register the package so that it will not fail    to reach you and i will return any answer of yours unopened or if    not recognizably addressed then unread                 yours sincerely                         p s verrian   he read and read again these lines with only the sense of their insufficiency in doing the effect of the bitterness in his heart if the letter was insulting it was by no means as insulting as he would have liked to make it whether it would be wounding enough was something that depended upon the person whom he wished to wound all that was proud and vain and cruel in him surged up at the thought of the trick that had been played upon him and all that was sweet and kind and gentle in him when he believed the trick was a genuine appeal turned to their counter qualities yet feeble and inadequate as his letter was he knew that he could not do more or worse by trying and he so much feared that by waiting he might do less and better that he hurried it into the post at once if his mother had been at hand he would have shown it her though he might not have been ruled by her judgment of it he was glad that she was not with him for either she would have had her opinion of what would be more telling or she would have insisted upon his delaying any sort of reply and he could not endure the thought of difference or delay  he asked himself whether he should let her see the rough first draft of his letter or not and he decided that he would not but when she came into his study on her return he showed it her  she read it in silence and then she seemed to temporize in asking where are her two letters  ive sent them back with the answer  his mother let the paper drop from her hands philip you havent sent this  yes i have it wasnt what i wanted to make it but i wished to get the detestable experience out of my mind and it was the best i could do at the moment dont you like it  oh she seemed beginning to say something but without saying anything she took the fallen leaf up and read it again  well he demanded with impatience  oh you may have been right i hope youve not been wrong  mother  she deserved the severest things you could say and yet  well  perhaps she was punished enough already  what do you mean  i dont like your beingvindictive  vindictive  being so terribly just then she added at his blank stare this is killing philip  he gave a bitter laugh i dont think it will kill her she isnt that kind  shes a girl his mother said with a kind of sad absence  but not a singleminded girl you warned me i wish i could have taken your warning it would have saved me from playing the fool before myself and giving myself away to armiger and letting him give himself away i dont think miss brown will suffer much before she dies she will get together as she calls it with that other girl and have a real good time over it you know the village type and the village conditions where the vulgar ignorance of any larger world is so thick you could cut it with a knife dont be troubled by my vindictiveness or my justice mother i begin to think i have done justice and not fallen short of it as i was afraid  mrs verrian sighed and again she gave his letter back to her son perhaps you are right philip she is probably so tough as not to feel it very painfully  shes not so tough but shell be very glad to get out of it so lightly she has had a useful scare and ive done her a favor in making the scare a sharp one i suppose verrian mused that she thinks ive kept copies of her letters  yes why didnt you his mother asked  verrian laughed only a little less bitterly than before i shall begin to believe youre all alike mother  i didnt keep copies of her letters because i wanted to get her and her letters out of my mind finally and forever besides i didnt choose to emulate her duplicity by any sort of dissimulation  i see what you mean his mother said and of course you have taken the only honorable way  then they were both silent for a time thinking their several thoughts  verrian broke the silence to say i wish i knew what sort of other girl it was that she got together with  why  because she wrote a more cultivated letter than this magnanimous creature who takes all the blame to herself  then you dont believe theyre both the same  they are both the same in stationery and chirography but not in literature  i hope you wont get to thinking about her then his mother entreated intelligibly but not definitely  not seriously verrian reassured her ive had my medicine     v  continuity is so much the lesson of experience that in the course of a life by no means long it becomes the instinctive expectation the event that has happened will happen again it will prolong itself in a series of recurrences by which each ones episode shares in the unending history of all the sense of this is so pervasive that humanity refuses to accept death itself as final in the agonized affections the shattered hopes of those who remain the severed life keeps on unbrokenly and when time and reason prevail at least as to the life here the defeated faith appeals for fulfilment to another world and the belief of immortality holds against the myriad years in which none of the numberless dead have made an indisputable sign in witness of it the lost limb still reports its sensations to the brain the fixed habit mechanically attempts its repetition when the conditions render it impossible  verrian was aware how deeply and absorbingly he had brooded upon the incident which he had done his utmost to close when he found himself expecting an answer of some sort from his unknown correspondent he perceived then without owning the fact that he had really hoped for some protest some excuse some extenuation which in the end would suffer him to be more merciful though he had wished to crush her into silence and to forbid her all hope of his forgiveness he had in a manner not meant to do it he had kept a secret place in his soul where the sinner against him could find refuge from his justice and when this sanctuary remained unattempted he found himself with a regret that he had barred the way to it so effectually the regret was so vague so formless however that he could tacitly deny it to himself at all times and explicitly deny it to his mother at such times as her touch taught him that it was tangible  one day after ten or twelve days had gone by she asked him you havent heard anything more from that girl  what girl he returned as if he did not know and he frowned you mean the girl that wrote me about my story  he continued to frown rather more darkly i dont see how you could expect me to hear from her after what i wrote but to be categorical i havent mother  oh of course not did you think she would be so easily silenced  i did what i could to crush her into silence  yes and you did quite right i am more and more convinced of that but such a very tough young person might have refused to stay crushed she might very naturally have got herself into shape again and smoothed out the creases at least so far to try some further defence  it seems that she hasnt verrian said still darkly but not so frowningly  i should have fancied his mother suggested that if she had wanted to open a correspondence with youif that was her original objectshe would not have let it drop so easily  has she let it drop easily i thought i had left her no possible chance of resuming it  that is true his mother said and for the time she said no more about the matter  not long after this he came home from the magazine office and reported to her from armiger that the story was catching on more and more with the best class of readers the editor had shown verrian some references to it in newspapers of good standing and several letters about it  i thought you might like to look at the letters verrian said and he took some letters from his pocket and handed them to her across the lunchtable she did not immediately look at them because he went on to add something that they both felt to be more important armiger says there has been some increase of the sales which i can attribute to my story if i have the cheek  that is good  and the house wants to publish the book they think down there that it will have a very pretty successnot be a big seller of course but something comfortable  mrs verrians eyes were suffused with pride and fondness and you can always think philip that this has come to you without the least lowering of your standard without forsaking your ideal for a moment  that is certainly a satisfaction  she kept her proud and tender gaze upon him no one will ever know as i do how faithful you have been to your art did any of the newspapers recognize thator surmise it or suspect it  no that isnt the turn they take they speak of the strong love interest involved in the problem and the abundance of incident i looked out to keep something happening you know im sorry i didnt ask armiger to let me bring the notices home to you im not sure that i did wisely not to subscribe to that pressclippings bureau  his mother smiled you mustnt let prosperity corrupt you philip wouldnt seeing what the press is saying of it distract you from the real aim you had in your story  were all weak of course it might if the story were not finished but as it is i think i could be proof against the stupidest praise  well for my part im glad you didnt subscribe to the clippings bureau it would have been a disturbing element she now looked down at the letters as if she were going to take them up and he followed the direction of her eyes as if reminded of the fact by this he said  armiger asked me if i had ever heard anything more from that girl  has he his mother eagerly asked transferring her glance from the letters to her sons face  not a word i think i silenced her thoroughly  yes his mother said there could have been no good object in prolonging the affair and letting her confirm herself in the notion that she was of sufficient importance either to you or to him for you to continue the correspondence with her she couldnt learn too distinctly that she had donea very wrong thing in trying to play such a trick on you  that was the way i looked at it verrian said but he drew a light sigh rather wearily  i hope his mother said with a recurrent glance at the letters that there is nothing of that silly kind among these  no these are blameless enough unless they are to be blamed for being too flattering that girl seems to be sole of her kind unless the girl that she got together with was really like her  i dont believe there was any other girl i never thought there was more than one  there seemed to be two styles and two grades of culture such as they were  oh she could easily imitate two manners she must have been a clever girl mrs verrian said with that admiration for any sort of cleverness in her sex which even very good women cannot help feeling  well perhaps she was punished enough for both the characters she assumed verrian said with a smile that was not gay  dont think about her his mother returned with a perception of his mood im only thankful that shes out of our lives in every sort of way     vi  verrian said nothing but he reflected with a sort of gloomy amusement how impossible it was for any woman even a woman so wideminded and highprincipled as his mother to escape the personal view of all things and all persons which women take he tacitly noted the fact as the novelist notes whatever happens or appears to him but he let the occasion drop out of his mind as soon as he could after it had dropped out of his talk  the night when the last number of his story came to them in the magazine and was already announced as a book he sat up with his mother celebrating as he said and exulting in the future as well as the past they had a little supper which she cooked for him in a chafingdish in the diningroom of the tiny apartment where they lived together and she made some coffee afterwards to carry off the effect of the newburg lobster perhaps because there was nothing to carry off the effect of the coffee he heard her through the partition of their rooms stirring restlessly after he had gone to bed and a little later she came to his door which she set ajar to ask are you awake philip  you seem to be mother he answered with an amusement at her question which seemed not to have imparted itself to her when she came in and stood beside his bed in her dressinggown  you dont think we have judged her too harshly philip  do you mother  no i think we couldnt be too severe in a thing like that she probably thought you were like some of the other storywriters she couldnt feel differences shades she pretended to be taken with the circumstances of your work but she had to do that if she wanted to fool you well she has got her comeuppings as she would probably say  verrian replied thoughtfully she didnt strike me as a country personat least in her first letter  then you still think she didnt write both  if she did she was trying her hand in a personality she had invented  girls are very strange his mother sighed they like excitement adventure its very dull in those little places i shouldnt wish you to think any harm of the poor thing  poor thing why this magnanimous compassion mother  oh nothing but i know how i was myself when i was a girl i used almost to die of hunger for something to happen can you remember just what you said in your letter  verrian laughed no i cant but i dont believe i said half enough youre nervous mother  yes i am but dont you get to worrying i merely got to thinking how i should hate to have anybodys unhappiness mixed up with this happiness of ours i do so want your pleasure in your success to be pure not tainted with the pain of any human creature  verrian answered with light cynicism it will be tainted with the pain of the fellows who dont like me or who havent succeeded and theyll take care to let me share their pain if ever they can but if you mean that merry maiden up country shes probably thinking if she thinks about it at all that shes the luckiest girl in the united states to have got out of an awful scrape so easily at the worst i only had fun with her in my letter probably she sees that she has nothing to grieve for but her own break  no and you did just as you should have done and i am glad you dont feel bitterly about it you dont do you  not the least  his mother stooped over and kissed him where he lay smiling well thats good after all its you i cared for now i can say goodnight but she lingered to tuck him in a little from the persistence of the mother habit i wish you may never do anything that you will be sorry for  well i wontif its a good action  they laughed together and she left the room still looking back to see if there was anything more she could do for him while he lay smiling intelligently for what she was thinking and patiently for what she was doing     vii  even in the time which was then coming and which now is when successful authors are almost as many as millionaires verrians book brought him a pretty celebrity and this celebrity was in a way specific it related to the quality of his work which was quietly artistic and psychological whatever liveliness of incident it uttered on the surface he belonged to the good school which is of no fashion and of every time far both from actuality and unreality and his recognition came from people whose recognition was worth having with this came the wider notice which was not worth having like the notice of mrs westangle since so well known to society reporters as a society woman which could not be called recognition of him because it did not involve any knowledge of his book not even its title she did not read any sort of books and she assimilated him by a sort of atmospheric sense she was sure of nothing but the attention paid him in a certain very goodish house by people whom she heard talking in unintelligible but unmistakable praise when she said casually with a liquid glitter of her sweet small eyes i wish you would come down to my place mr verrian im asking a few young people for christmas week will you  why thank youthank you very much verrian said waiting to hear more in explanation of the hospitality launched at him he had never seen mrs westangle till then or heard of her and he had not the least notion where she lived but she seemed to have social authority though verrian in looking round at his hostess and her daughter who stood near letting people take leave learned nothing from their common smile mrs westangle had glided close to him in the way she had of getting very near without apparently having advanced by steps and she stood gleaming and twittering up at him  i shall send you a little note i wont let you forget she said then she suddenly shook hands with the ladies of the house and was flashingly gone  verrian thought he might ask the daughter of the house and if i dont forget am i engaged to spend christmas week with her  the girl laughed if she doesnt forget you are but youll have a good time shell know how to manage that other guests kept coming up to take leave and verrian who did not want to go just yet was retired to the background where the girls voice thrown over her shoulder at him reached him in the words as gay as if they were the best of the joke its on the sound  the inference was that mrs westangles place was on the sound and that was all verrian knew about it till he got her little note mrs westangle knew how to write in a formless hand but she did not know how to spell and she had thought it best to have a secretary who could write well and spell correctly though as far as literacy was concerned she was such an almost incomparably ignorant woman she had all the knowledge the best society wants or if she found herself out of any she went and bought some she was able to buy almost anything  verrian thanked the secretary for remembering him in the belief that he was directly thanking mrs westangle whose widespread consciousness his happiness in accepting did not immediately reach and in the very large house party which he duly joined under her roof he was aware of losing distinctiveness almost to the point of losing identity this did not quite happen on the way to belford for when he went to take his seat in the drawingroom car a girl in the chair fronting him put out her hand with the laugh of miss macroyd  she did remember you she cried out how delightful i dont see how she ever got onto youshe made the slang her ownin the first place and she must have worked hard to be sure of you since  verrian hung up his coat and put his suitcase behind his chair the porter having put it where he could not wheel himself visavis with the girl she took all the time there was he answered i got my invitation only the day before yesterday and if i had been in more demand or had a worse conscience  oh do say worse conscience its so much more interesting the girl broke in  i shouldnt have the pleasure of going to seasands with you now he concluded and she gave her laugh do i understand that simply my growing fame wouldnt have prevailed with her  anything seemed to make miss macroyd laugh she couldnt have cared about that and she wouldnt have known you may be sure that it was a social question with her after the personal question was settled she must have liked your looks again miss macroyd laughed  on that side im invulnerable its only a literary vanity to be soothed or to be wounded that i have verrian said  oh there wouldnt be anything personal in her liking your looks it would be merely deciding that personally you would do miss macroyd laughed as always and verrian put on a mock seriousness in asking  then i neednt be serious if there should happen to be anything so westangular as a mr westangle  not the least in the world  but there is something  oh i believe so but not probably at seasands  is that her house  yes every other name had been used and she couldnt say soundsands  then where would the mr westangular part more probably be found  oh in montana or mesopotamia or any of those places dont you know about him how ignorant literary people can be why he was the amalgamated clothespin you havent heard of that  she went on to tell him with gay digressions about the invention which enabled westangle to buy up the other clothespins and merge them in his ownto become a commercial octopus clutching the throats of other clothespin inventors in the tentacles of the westangle pin but he isnt in clothespins now hes in mines and banks and steamboats and railroads and i dont know what all and mrs westangle the second of her name never was in clothespins  miss macroyd laughed all through her talk and she was in a final burst of laughing when the train slowed into stamford there a girl came into the car trailing her skirts with a sort of vivid debility and overturning some minor pieces of handbaggage which her draperies swept out of their shelter beside the chairs she had to take one of the seats which back against the wall of the stateroom where she must face the whole length of the car she sat weakly fallen back in the chair and motionless as if almost unconscious but after the train had begun to stir she started up and with a quick flinging of her veil aside turned to look out of the window in the flying instant verrian saw a colorless face with pinched and sunken eyes under a wornlooking forehead and a withered mouth whose lips parted feebly  on her part miss macroyd had doubtless already noted that the girl was with no show of expensiveness authoritatively well gowned and personally hatted she stared at her and said what a very hunted and escaping effect  she does look ratherfugitive verrian agreed staring too  one might almost fancyan asylum  yes or a hospital  they continued both to stare at her helpless for what ever different reasons to take their eyes away and they were still interested in her when they heard her asking the conductor must i change and take another train before we get to belford my friends thought  no this train stops at southfield the conductor answered absently biting several holes into her drawingroom ticket  can she be one of us miss macroyd demanded in a dramatic whisper  she might be anything verrian returned trying instantly with a whir of his inventive machinery to phrase her he made a sort of luxurious failure of it and rested content with her face which showed itself now in profile and now fronted him in full and now was restless and now subsided in a look of delicate exhaustion he would have said if he would have said anything absolute that she was a person who had something on her mind at instants she had that hunted air passing at other instants into that air of escape he discussed these appearances with miss macroyd but found her too frankly disputatious and she laughed too much and too loud     viii  at southfield where they all descended miss macroyd promptly possessed herself of a groom who came forward tentatively touching his hat miss macroyd she suggested  yes miss the man said and led the way round the station to the victoria which when miss macroyds maid had mounted to the place beside her had no room for any one else  verrian accounted for her activity upon the theory of her quite justifiable wish not to arrive at seasands with a young man whom she might then have the effect of having voluntarily come all the way with and after one or two circuits of the station it was apparent to him that he was not to have been sent for from mrs westangles but to have been left to the chances of the local drivers and their vehicles these were reduced to a single carryall and a frowsy horse whose rough winter coat recalled the aspect of his species in the period following the glacial epoch the mud as of a worldthaw encrusted the wheels and curtains of the carryall  verrian seized upon it and then went into the waitingroom where he had left his suitcase he found the stranger there in parley with the young woman in the ticketoffice about a conveyance to mrs westangles it proved that he had secured not only the only thing of the sort but the only present hope of any other and in the hard case he could not hesitate with distress so interesting it would have been brutal to drive off and leave that girl there and it would have been a vulgar flourish to put the entire vehicle at her service besides and perhaps above all verrian had no idea of depriving himself of such a chance as heaven seemed to offer him  he advanced with the delicacy of the highestbred hero he could imagine and said i am going to mrs westangles and im afraid ive got the only conveyancesuch as it is if you would let me offer you half of it mr verrian he added at the light of acceptance instantly kindling in her face which flushed thinly as with an afterglow of invalidism  why thank you im afraid i must mr merriam and verrian was aware of being vexed at her failure to catch his name the name of verrian ought to have been unmistakable the young lady in the office says there wont be another and im expected promptly she added with a little tremor of the lip i dont understand why mrs westangle but then she stopped  verrian interpreted for her the seahorses must have given out at seasands or probably theres some mistake and he reflected bitterly upon the selfishness of miss macroyd in grabbing that victoria for herself and her maid not considering that she could not know and has no business to ask whether this girl was going to mrs westangles too have you a check he asked i think our driver could find room for something besides my valise or i could have it come  not at all the girl said i sent my trunk ahead by express  a frowsy man to match the frowsy horse looked in impatiently any other baggage  no verrian answered and he led the way out after the vanishing driver our chariot is back here in hiding miss  shirley she said and trailed before him through the door he opened  he felt that he did not do it as a man of the world would have done it and in putting her into the ramshackle carryall he knew that he had not the grace of the sort of man who does nothing else but miss shirley seemed to have grace enough of a feeble and broken sort for both and he resolved to supply his own lack with sincerity he therefore set his jaw firmly and made its upper angles jut sharply through his cleanshaven cheeks it was well that miss shirley had some beauty to spare too for verrian had scarcely enough for himself such distinction as he had was from a sort of intellectual tenseness which showed rather in the gaunt forms of his face than in the gray eyes heavily lashed above and below and looking serious but dull with their rank black brows he was chewing a cud of bitterness in the accusal he made himself of having forced miss shirley to give her name but with that interesting personality at his side under the same tattered and illscented japanese goatskin he could not refuse to be glad with all his selfblame  im afraid its rather a long drivefor you miss shirley he ventured with a glance at her face which looked very little under her hat the driver says its five miles round through the marshes  oh i shall not mind she said courageously if not cheerfully and he did not feel authorized further to recognize the fact that she was an invalid or at best a convalescent  these wintry treeforms are fine though he found himself obliged to conclude his apology rather irrelevantly as the wheels of the rattling and tilting carry all crunched the surface of the road in the succession of jerks responding to the alternate walk and gallop of the horse  yes they are miss shirley answered looking around with a certain surprise as if seeing them now for the first time so much variety of color and that burnished look that some of them have the trees far and near were giving their tones and lustres in the low december sun  yes he said its decidedly more refined than the autumnal coloring we brag of  it is she approved as with novel conviction the landscape is really beautiful so nice and flat she added  he took her intention and he said as he craned his neck out of the carryall to include the nearer roadside stretches with their low bushes lifting into remoter trees its restful in a way that neither the mountains nor the sea quite manage  oh yes she sighed with a kind of weariness which explained itself in what she added its the kind of thing youd like to have keep on and on she seemed to say that more to herself than to him and his eyes questioned her she smiled slightly in explaining i suppose i find it all the more beautiful because this is my first real look into the world after six months indoors  oh he said and there was no doubt a prompting in his tone  she smiled still sick people are terribly egotistical and i suppose its my conceit of having been the centre of the universe so lately that makes me mention it and here she laughed a little at herself showing a charming little peculiarity in the catch of her upper lip on her teeth but this is divinethis air and this sight she put her head out of her side of the carryall and drank them in with her lungs and eyes  when she leaned back again on the seat she said i cant get enough of it  but isnt this old rattletrap rather too rough for you he asked  oh no she said visiting him with a furtive turn of her eyes its quite ideally what invalids in easy circumstances are advised to take carriage exercise  yes its certainly carriage exercise verrian admitted in the same spirit if it was a drolling spirit he could not help being amused by the situation in which they had been brought together through the vigorous promptitude of miss macroyd in making the victoria her own and the easy indifference of mrs westangle as to how they should get to her house if he had been alone he might have felt the indifference as a slight but as it was he felt it rather a favor if miss shirley was feeling it a slight she was too secret or too sweet to let it be known and he thought that was nice of her still he believed he might recognize the fact without deepening a possible hurt of hers and he added with no apparent relevance if mrs westangle was not looking for us on this train she will find that it is the unexpected which happens  we are certainly going to happen the girl said with an acceptance of the plural which deepened the intimacy of the situation and which was not displeasing to verrian when she added if our friends vehicle holds out then she turned her face full upon him with what affected him as austere resolution in continuing but i cant let you suppose that youre conveying a society person or something of that sort to mrs westangles his own face expressed his mystification and she concluded im simply going there to begin my work  he smiled provisionally in temporizing with the riddle you women are wonderful nowadays for the work you do  oh but she protested nervously anxiously it isnt good work that im going to doi understand what you meanits work for a living ive no business to be arriving with an invited guest but it seemed to be a question of arriving or not at the time when i was due     ix  verrian stared at her now from a visage that was an entire blank though behind it conjecture was busy and he was asking himself whether his companion was some new kind of hairdresser or uncommonly cultivated manicure or a nursery governess obeying a hurry call to take a place in mrs westangles household or some sort of amateur housekeeper arriving to supplant a professional but he said nothing  miss shirley said with a distress which was genuine though he perceived a trace of amusement in it too i see that i will have to go on  oh do he made out to utter  i am going to mrs westangles as a sort of mistress of the revels the business is so new that it hasnt got its name yet but if i fail it wont need any i invented it on a hint i got from a girl who undertakes the floral decorations for parties i didnt see why some one shouldnt furnish suggestions for amusements as well as flowers i was always rather lucky at that in my own famat my fathers she pulled herself sharply up as if danger lay that way i got an introduction to mrs westangle and shes to let me try i am going to her simply as part of the catering and im not to have any recognition in the hospitalities so it wasnt necessary for her to send for me at the station except as a means of having me on the ground in good season i have to thank you for that andi thank you she ended in a sigh  its very interesting verrian said and he hoped he was not saying it in any ignoble way  he was very presently to learn round a turn of the road there came a lively clacking of horses shoes on the hard track with the muted rumble of rubbertired wheels and mrs westangles victoria dashed into view the coachman had made a signal to verrians driver and the vehicles stopped side by side the footman instantly came to the door of the carryall touching his hat to verrian  going to mrs westangles sir  yes  mrs westangles carriage going to the station for you sir  miss shirley verrian said will you change  oh no she answered quickly its better for me to go on as i am but the carriage was sent for you you must  verrian interrupted to ask the footman how far is it yet to mrs westangles  about a mile sir  i think i wont change for such a short distance ill keep on as i am verrian said and he let the goatskin which he had half lifted to free miss shirley for dismounting fall back again go ahead driver  she had been making several gasping efforts at speech accompanied with entreating and protesting glances at verrian in the course of his brief colloquy with the footman now as the carryall lurched forward again and the victoria wheeled and passed them on its way back she caught her handkerchief to her face and to verrians dismay sobbed into it he let her cry as he must in the distressful silence which he could not be the first to break besides he did not know how she was taking it all till she suddenly with threw her handkerchief and pulled down her veil then she spoke three heartbroken words how could you and he divined that he must have done wrong  what ought i to have done he asked with sullen humility  you ought to have taken the victoria  how could i  you ought to have done it  i think you ought to have done it yourself miss shirley verrian said feeling like the worm that turns he added less resentfully we ought both to have taken it  no mrs westangle might have felt very properly that it was presumptuous in me whether i came alone in it or with you now we shall arrive together in this thing and she will be mortified for you and vexed with me she will blame me for it and she will be right for it would have been very well for me to drive up in a shabby station carryall but an invited guest  no indeed she shall not blame you miss shirley i will make a point of taking the whole responsibility i will tell her  mr merriam she cried in anguish will you please do nothing of the kind do you want to make bad worse leave the explaining altogether to me please will you promise that  i will promise thator anythingif you insist verrian sulked  she instantly relented a little you mustnt think me unreasonable but i was determined to carry my undertaking through on business principles and you have spoiled my chancei know you meant it kindly or if not spoiled made it more difficult dont think me ungrateful mr merriam  my name isnt merriam he resented at last a misnomer which had annoyed him from the first  oh i am so glad dont tell me what it is she said giving a laugh which had to go on a little before he recognized the hysterical quality in it when she could check it she explained now we are not even acquainted and i can thank a stranger for the kindness you have shown me i am truly grateful will you do me another favor  yes verrian assented but he thought he had a right to ask as though he had not promised what is it  not to speak of me to mrs westangle unless she speaks of me first  thats simple i dont know that i should have any right to speak of you  oh yes you would she will expect you perhaps to laugh about the little adventure and i would rather she began the laughing you have been so good  all right but wouldnt my silence make it rather more awkward  i will take care of the awkwardness thank you and you promise  yes i promise  that is very good of you she put her hand impulsively across the goatskin and gave his with which he took it in some surprise a quick clasp then they were both silent and they got out of the carryall under mrs westangles portecochere without having exchanged another word miss shirley did not bow to him or look at him in parting     x  verrian kept seeing before his inner eyes the thin face of the girl dimmed rather than lighted with her sick yes when she should be stronger there might be a pale flush in it like sunset on snow but verrian had to imagine that he did not find it difficult to imagine many things about the girl whom in another mood a more judicial mood he might have accused of provoking him to imagine them as it was he could not help noting to that second self which we all have about us that her confidences such as they were had perhaps been too voluntary certainly they had not been quite obligatory and they could not be quite accounted for except upon the theory of nerves not yet perfectly under her control to be sure girls said all sorts of things to one ignorantly and innocently but she did not seem the kind of girl who in different circumstances would have said anything that she did not choose or that she did not mean to say she had been surprisingly frank and yet at heart verrian would have thought she was a very reticent person or a secret personthat is mentally frank and sentimentally secret possibly she was like most women in that what he was sure of was that the visual impression of her which he had received must have been very vivid to last so long in his consciousness all through his preparations for going down to afternoon tea her face remained subjectively before him and when he went down and found himself part of a laughing and chattering company in the library he still found it in his inner sense here there and yonder  he was aware of suffering a little disappointment in mrs westangles entire failure to mention miss shirley though he was aware that his disappointment was altogether unreasonable and he more reasonably decided that if she knew anything of his arrival or the form of it she had too much of the making of a grande dame to be recognizant of it he did not know from her whether she had meant to send for him at the station or not or whether she had sent her carriage back for him when he did not arrive in it at first nothing was left in her manner of such slight specialization as she had thrown into it when at the macroyds she asked him down to her house party she seemed if there were any difference to have acquired an additional ignorance of who and what he was though she twittered and flittered up close to his elbow after his impersonal welcome and asked him if she might introduce him to the young lady who was pouring tea for her and who after the brief drama necessary for possessing him of a cup of it appeared to have no more use for him than mrs westangle herself had there were more young men than young women in the room but he imagined the usual superabundance of girlhood temporarily absent for repair of the fatigues of the journey every girl in the room had at least one man talking to her and the girl who was pouring tea had one on each side of her and was trying to fix them both with an eye lifted towards each while she struggled to keep her united gaze watchfully upon the teaurn and those who came up with cups to be filled or refilled  verrian thought his fellowguests were all amiable enough looking though he made his reflection that they did not look any of them as if they would set the sound on fire and again he missed the companion of his arrival  after he had got his cup of tea he stood sipping it with a homeless air which he tried to conceal and cast a furtive eye round the room till it rested upon the laughing face of miss macroyd a young man was taking away her teacup and verrian at once went up and seized his place  how did you get here she asked rather shamelessly since she had kept him from coming in the victoria but amusingly since she seemed to see it as a joke if she saw it at all  i walked he answered  truly  no not truly  but truly how did you because i sent the carriage back for you  that was very thoughtful of you but i found a delightful public vehicle behind the station and i came in that im so glad to know that it wasnt mrs westangle who had the trouble of sending the carriage back for me  miss macroyd laughed and laughed at his resentment but surely you met it on the way i gave the man a description of you didnt he stop for you  oh yes but i was too proud to change by that time or perhaps i hated the trouble  miss macroyd laughed the more then she purposely darkened her countenance so as to suit it to her lugubrious whisper how did she get here  what she  the mysterious fugitive wasnt she coming here after all  after all your trouble in supposing so verrian reflected a moment and then he said deliberately i dont know  miss macroyd was not going to let him off like that you dont know how she came or you dont know whether she was coming  i didnt say  her laugh resounded again now you are trying to be wicked and that is very wrong for a novelist  but what object could i have in concealing the fact from you miss macroyd he entreated with mock earnestness  that is what i want to find out  what are you two laughing so about the voice of mrs westangle twittered at verrians elbow and looking down he found her almost touching it she had a very long narrow neck and since it was long and narrow she had the good sense not to palliate the fact or try to dress the effect of it out of sight she took her neck in both hands as it were and put it more on show so that you had really to like it now it lifted her face though she was not a tall person well towards the level of his to be sure he was himself only of the middle height of men though an aquiline profile helped him up  he stirred the tea which he had ceased to drink and said i wasnt laughing so about mrs westangle it was miss macroyd  and i was laughing so about a mysterious stranger that came up on the train with us and got out at your station  and i was trying to make out what was so funny in a mysterious stranger or even in her getting out at your station  mrs westangle was not interested in the case or else she failed to seize the joke at any rate she turned from them without further question and went away to another part of the room where she semiattached herself in like manner to another couple and again left it for still another this was possibly her idea of looking after her guests but when she had looked after them a little longer in that way she left the room and let them look after themselves till dinner  come mr verrian miss macroyd resumed what is the secret ill never tell if you tell me  you wont if i dont  now you are becoming merely trivial you are ceasing even to be provoking miss macroyd in token of her displeasure laughed no longer  am i he questioned thoughtfully well then i am tempted to act upon impulse  oh do act upon impulse for once she urged im sure youll enjoy it  do you mean that im never impulsive  i dont think you look it  if you had seen me an hour ago you would have said i was very impulsive i think i may have exhausted myself in that direction however i feel the impulse failing me now     xi  his impulse really had failed him it had been to tell miss macroyd about his adventure and frankly trust her with it he had liked her at several former meetings rather increasingly because she had seemed open and honest beyond the most of women but her piggish behavior at the station had been rather too open and honest and the sense of this now opportunely intervened between him and the folly he was about to commit besides he had no right to give miss shirleys part in his adventure away and since the affair was more vitally hers than his to take it at all out of her hands the earlyfalling dusk had favored an unnoticed advent for them and there were other chances that had helped keep unknown their arrival together at mrs westangles in that squalid carryall such as miss shirleys having managed instantly to slip indoors before the man came out for verrians suitcase and of her having got to her own appointed place long before there was any descent of the company to the afternoon tea  it was not for him now to undo all that and begin the laughing at the affair which she had pathetically intimated that she would rather some one else should begin he recoiled from his imprudence with a shock but he had the pleasure of having mystified miss macroyd he felt dismissal in the roving eye which she cast from him round the room and he willingly let another young man replace him at her side  yet he was not altogether satisfied a certain meaner self that there was in him was not pleased with his relegation even merely in his own consciousness to the championship of a girl who was going to make her living in a sort of menial way it had better be owned for him that in his visions of literary glory he had figured in social triumphs which though vague were resplendent with the glitter of smart circles he had been so ignorant of such circles as to suppose they would have some use for him as a brilliant young author and though he was outwearing this illusion he still would not have liked a girl like julia macroyd whose family if not smart was at least chic to know that he had come to the house with a professional mistress of the revels until miss shirley should have approved herself chic too the notion of such an employment as hers was in itself chic but the girl was merely a paid part of the entertainment as yet and had not risen above the hireling status if she had sunk to that level from a higher rank it would be all right but there was no evidence that she had ever been smart verrian would therefore rather not be mixed up with herat any rate in the imagination of a girl like julia macroyd and as he left her side he drew a long breath of relief and went and put down his teacup where he had got it  by this time the girl who was pouring had exhausted one of the two original guards on whom she had been dividing her vision and verrian made a pretence which she favored that he had come up to push the man away the man gracefully submitted to be dislodged and verrian remained in the enjoyment of one of the girls distorted eyes till yet another man coming up she abruptly got rid of verrian by presenting him to yet another girl in such manoeuvres the hour of afternoon tea will pass and the time really wore on till it was time to dress for dinner  by the time that the guests came down to dinner they were all able to participate in the exchange of the discovery which each had made that it was snowing outdoors and they kept this going till one girl had the goodluck to say i dont see anything so astonishing in that at this time of year now if it was snowing indoors it would be different  this relieved the tension in a general laugh and a young man tried to contribute further to the gayety by declaring that it would not be surprising to have it snow indoors he had once seen the thing done in a crowded hall one night when somebody put up a window and the freezing current of air congealed the respiration of the crowd which came down in a light fall of snowflakes he owned that it was in boston  oh that excuses it then miss macroyd said but she lost the laugh which was her due in the rush which some of the others made to open a window and see whether it could be made to snow indoors there  oh it isnt crowded enough here the young man explained who had alleged the scientific marvel  and it isnt boston miss macroyd tried again on the same string and this time she got her laugh  the girl who had first spoken remained at the risk of pneumonia with her arm prettily lifted against the open sash for a moment peering out and then reported in dashing it down with a shiver it seems to be a very soft snow  then it will be rain by morning another predicted and the girl tried hard to think of something to say in support of the hit she had made already but she could not and was silent almost through the whole first course at dinner  in spite of its being a soft snow it continued to fall as snow and not as rain it lent the charm of stormy cold without to the brightness and warmth within much later when between waltzes some of the dancers went out on the verandas for a breath of air they came back reporting that the wind was rising and the snow was drifting  upon the whole the snow was a great success and her guests congratulated mrs westangle on having thought to have it the felicitations included recognition of the originality of her whole scheme she had downed the hoary superstition that people had too much of a good time on christmas to want any good time at all in the week following and in acting upon the wellknown fact that you never wanted a holiday so much as the day after you had one she had made a movement of the highest social importance these were the ideas which verrian and the young man of the indoors snowstorm urged upon her his name was bushwick and he and verrian found that they were very goodfellows after they had rather supposed the contrary  mrs westangle received their ideas with the twittering reticence that deceived so many people when they supposed she knew what they were talking about     xii  at breakfast where the guests were reasonably punctual they were all able to observe in the rapid succession in which they descended from their rooms that it had stopped snowing and the sun was shining brilliantly  there isnt enough for sleighing mrs westangle proclaimed from the head of the table in her high twitter and there isnt any coasting here in this flat country for miles  then what are we going to do with it one of the young ladies humorously pouted  thats what i was going to suggest mrs westangle replied she pronounced it sujjest but no one felt that it mattered and of course she continued you neednt any of you do it if you dont like  well all do it mrs westangle bushwick said we are unanimous in that  perhaps youll think it rather funnyodd she said  the odder the better i think verrian ventured and another man declared that nothing mrs westangle would do was odd though everything was original  well there is such a thing as being too original she returned then she turned her head aside and looked down at something beside her plate and said without lifting her eyes you know that in the middle ages there used to be flowerfights among the young nobility in italy the women held a tower and the men attacked it with roses and flowers generally  why is this a speech miss macroyd interrupted  a speech from the throne yes bushwick solemnly corrected her and shes got it written down like a queenhavent you mrs westangle  yes i thought it would be more respectful  she coming out bushwick said to verrian across the table  and if i got mixed up i could go back and straighten it the hostess declared with a goodhumored candor that took the general fancy and you could understand without so much explaining we havent got flowers enough at this season she went on looking down again at the paper beside her plate but we happen to have plenty of snowballs and the notion is to have the women occupy a snow tower and the men attack them with snowballs  why bushwick said this is the snowfort business of our boyhood lets go out and fortify the ladies at once he appealed to verrian and made a feint of pushing his chair back may we use watersoaked snowballs or must they all be soft and harmless he asked of mrs westangle who was now the centre of a storm of applause and question from the whole table  she kept her head and referred again to her paper the missiles of the assailants are to be very soft snowballs hardly more than mere clots so that nobody can be hurt in the assault but the defenders may repel the assailants with harder snowballs  oh miss macroyd protested this is consulting the weakness of our sex  in the fury of the onset well forget it verrian reassured her  do you think you really will mr verrian she asked what is all our athletic training to go for if you do  mrs westangle read on  the terms of capitulation can be arranged on the ground whether the castle is carried or the assailing party are made prisoners by its defenders  hopeless captivity in either case bushwick lamented  isnt it rather academic miss macroyd asked of verrian in a low voice  im afraid rather he owned  but why are you so serious she pursued  am i serious he retorted with a trace of exasperation and she laughed  their parley was quite lost in the clamor which raged up and down the table till mrs westangle ended it by saying theres no obligation on any one to take part in the hostilities there wont be any conscription its a free fight that will be open to everybody she folded the paper she had been reading from and put it in her lap in default of a pocket she went on impromptu  you neednt trouble about building the fort mr bushwick ive had the farmer and his men working at the castle since daybreak and the ladies will find it all ready for them when theyre ready to defend it down in the meadow beyond the edge of the birchlot the battle wont begin till eleven oclock  she rose and the clamor rose again with her and her guests crushed about her demanding to be allowed at least to go and look at the castle immediately  one of the mens voices asked may i be one of the defenders mrs westangle i want to be on the winning side sure  oh is this going to be a circus chariotrace another lamented  no indeed a girl cried its to be the real thing  it fell to verrian in the assortment of couples in which mrs westangles guests sallied out to view the proposed scene of action to find himself not too willingly at miss macroyds side in his heart and in his mind he was defending the amusement which he instantly divined as no invention of mrs westangles and both his heart and his mind misgave him about this first essay of miss shirley in her new enterprise it was as miss macroyd had suggested academic and at the same time it had a danger in it of being tomboyish golf tennis riding boating swimmingall the vigorous sports in which women now excelwere boldly athletic and yet you could not feel quite that they were tomboyish was it because the bent of miss shirley was so academic that she was periling upon tomboyishness without knowing it in this primal inspiration of hers inwardly he resented the word academic although outwardly he had assented to it when miss macroyd proposed it to be academic would be even more fatal to miss shirleys ambition than to be tomboyish and he thought with pathos of that touch about the italian nobility in the middle ages and how little it could have moved the tough fancies of that crowd of wellgroomed young people at the breakfasttable when mrs westangle brought it out with her ignorant acceptance of it as a social force after all miss macroyd was about the only one who could have felt it in the way it was meant and she had chosen to smile at it he wondered if possibly she could feel the secondary pathos of it as he did but to make talk with her he merely asked  do you intend to take part in the fray  not unless i can be one of the reserve corps that wont need to be brought up till its all over ive no idea of getting my hair down  ah he sighed you think its going to be rude  that is one of the chances but you seem to be suffering about it mr verrian she said and of course she laughed  who i he returned in the temptation to deny it but he resisted i always suffer when theres anything silly happening as if i were doing it myself dont you  no thank you i believe not but perhaps you are doing this one cant suppose mrs westangle imagined it  no i cant plead guilty but why isnt it predicable of mrs westangle  you mustnt ask too much of me mr verrian somehow i wont say how its been imagined for her shes heard of its being done somewhere it cant be supposed shes read of it anywhere  no i dare say not  miss macroyd came out with her laugh i should like to know what she makes of you mr verrian when she is alone with herself she must have looked you up and authenticated you in her own way but it would be as far from your way aswell saythe milky way  you dont think she asked me because she met me at your house  no that wouldnt be enough from her point of view she means to go much further than weve ever got  then a year from now she wouldnt ask me  it depends upon who asks you in the mean time  you might get to be a fad and then she would feel that she would have to have you  youre not flattering me  do you find it flattering  it isnt exactly my idea of the reward ive been working for what shall i do to be a fad  well rather degrading stunts if you mean in the smart set jump about on all fours and pick up a womans umbrella with your teeth and bark anything else would be easier for you among chic people where your brilliancy would count  brilliancy oh thank you go on  now a girlif you were a girl  oh yes if i were a girl that will be so much more interesting  a girl miss macroyd continued might do it by posing effectively for amateur photography or doing something original in dramatics or pantomimics or recitationbut very original because chic people are critical or if she had a gift for getting up things that would show other girls off or suggesting amusements but that would be rather in the line of swell people who are not good at getting up things and are glad of help  i see i see verrian said eagerly but he walked along looking down at the snow and not meeting the laughing glance that miss macroyd cast at his face well  i believe thats all she said sharply she added less sharply she couldnt afford to fail though at any point the fad that fails is extinguished forever will these simple facts do for fiction or is it for somebody in real life youre asking mr verrian  oh for fiction and thank you very much oh thats rather pretty     xiii  they had come into the meadow where the snow battle was to be and on its slope against the dark weft of the young birchtrees there was a mimic castle outlined in the masonry of white blocks quarried from the drifts and built up in courses like rough blocks of marble a decoration of green from the pines that mixed with the birches had been suggested rather than executed and was perhaps the more effective for its sketchiness  yes its really beautiful miss macroyd owned and though she did not join her cries to those of the other girls who stood scattered about admiring it and laughing and chattering with the men whose applause of course took the jocose form there was no doubt but she admired it what i cant understand is how mrs westangle got the notion of this theres the soprano note in it and some woman must have given it to her  not contralto possibly verrian asked  i insist upon the soprano she said  but he did not notice what she said his eyes were following a figure which seemed to be escaping up through the birches behind the snow castle and ploughing its way through the drifts in front of the structure they had been levelled to make an easier battlefield he knew that it was miss shirley and he inferred that she had been in the castle directing the farmhands building it and now being caught by the premature arrival of the contesting forces had fled before them and left her subordinates to finish the work he felt with a throe of helpless sympathy that she was undertaking too much it was hazardous enough to attempt the practice of her novel profession under the best of circumstances but to keep herself in abeyance so far as not to be known at all in it and at the same time to give way to her interest in it to the extent of coming out with her infirmly established health into that wintry weather and superintending the preparations for the first folly she had planned was a risk altogether too great for her  who in the world miss macroyd suddenly demanded is the person floundering about in the birch woods  perhaps the soprano verrian returned hardily  bushwick detached himself from a group of girls near by and intercepted any response from miss macroyd to verrian by calling to her before he came up are you going to be one of the enemy miss macroyd  no i think i will be neutral she added is there going to be any such thing as an umpire  we hadnt thought of that there could be the office could be created but you know its the post of danger  verrian joined the group that bushwick has left he found a great scepticism as to the combat mixed with some admiration for the castle and he set himself to contest the prevalent feeling what was the matter with a snowfight he demanded it would be great fun decidedly he was going in for it he revived the drooping sentiment in its favor and then flown with his success he went from group to group and couple to couple and animated all with his zeal which came he hardly knew whence what he pretended to the others was that they were rather bound not to let mrs westangles scheme fall through their doubts vanished before him and the terms of the battle were quickly arranged he said he had read of one of those mediaeval flowerfights and he could tell them how that was done where it would not fit into the snowfight they could trust to inspiration every real battle was the effect of inspiration  he came out and some of the young women and most of the young men who had dimly known of him as a sort of celebrity and suspected him of being a prig were reconciled and accepted him for a nice fellow and became of his opinion as to the details of the amusement before them  it was not very homeric when it came off or very mediaeval but it was really lots of fun or far more fun than one would have thought the storming of the castle was very sincere and the fortress was honestly defended miss macroyd was made umpire as she wished and provided with a large snowball to sit on at a safe distance as she was chosen by the men the girls wanted to have an umpire of their own who would be really fair and they voted verrian into the office but he refused partly because he did not care about being paired off with miss macroyd so conspicuously and partly because he wished to help the fight along  attacks were made and repelled and there were feats of individual and collective daring on the side of the defenders which were none the less daring because the assailants stopped to cheer them and to disable themselves by laughing at the fury of the foe a detachment of the young men at last stormed the castle and so weakened its walls that they toppled inward then the defenders to save themselves from being buried under the avalanche swarmed out into the open and made the entire force of the enemy prisoners  the men pretended that this was what might have been expected from the beginning but by this time the berserker madness had possessed miss macroyd too she left her throne of snow and came forward shouting that it had been perfectly fair and that the men had been really beaten and they had no right to pretend that they had given themselves up purposely the sexpartisanship which is such a droll fact in women when there is any question of their general opposition to men possessed them all and they stood as one girl for the reality of their triumph this did not prevent them from declaring that the men had behaved with outrageous unfairness and that the only one who fought with absolute sincerity from first to last was mr verrian  neither their unity of conviction concerning the general fact nor the surprising deduction from it in verrians case operated to make them refuse the help of their captives in getting home when they had bound up their tumbled hair in some cases and repaired the ravages of war among their feathers and furs and draperies in other cases they accepted the hands of the late enemy at difficult points of the path but they ran forward when they neared the house and they were prompt to scream upon mrs westangle that there never had been such a success or such fun and that they were almost dead and soon as they had something to eat they were going to bed and never going to get up again  in the details which they were able to give at luncheon they did justice to verrians noble part in the whole affair which had saved the day not only in keeping them up to the work when they had got thinking it couldnt be carried through but in giving the combat a validity which it would not have had without him they had to thank him next to mrs westangle herself whom they praised beyond any articulate expression for thinking up such a delightful thing they wondered how she could ever have thought of itsuch a simple thing too and they were sure that when people heard of it they would all be wanting to have snow battles  mrs westangle took her praises as passively if not as modestly as verrian received his she made no show of disclaiming them but she had the art invaluable in a woman who meant to go far in the line she had chosen of not seeming to have done anything or of not caring whether people liked it or not verrian asked himself as he watched her twittering back at those girls and shedding equally their thanks and praises from her impermeable plumage how she would have behaved if miss shirleys attempt had been an entire failure he decided that she would have ignored the failure with the same impersonality as that with which she now ignored the success it appeared that in one point he did her injustice for when he went up to dress for dinner after the long stroll he took towards night he found a note under his door by which he must infer that mrs westangle had not kept the real facts of her triumph from the mistress of the revels       dear mr verrian i am not likely to see you but i must      thank you                     m shirley       p s dont try to answer please  verrian liked the note he even liked the impulse which had dictated it and he understood the impulse but he did not like getting the note if miss shirley meant business in taking up the line of life she had professed to have entered upon seriously she had better in the case of a young man whose acquaintance she had chanced to make let her gratitude wait but when did a woman ever mean business except in the one great business     xiv  to have got that sillily superfluous note to verrian without any ones knowing besides miss shirley must have stolen to his door herself and slipped it under in order to do this unsuspected and unseen she must have found out in some sort that would not give her away which his room was and then watched her chance it all argued a pervasiveness in her after such a brief sojourn in the house and a mastery of finesse that he did not like though he reflected he was not authorized to like or dislike anything about her he was thirtyseven years old and he had not lived through that time with his mother at his elbow to suggest inferences from facts without being versed in wiles which even when they were honest were always wiles and in lures which when they were of the most gossamer tenuity were yet of texture close enough to make the man who blundered through them aware that they had been thrown across his path he understood of course that they were sometimes helplessly thrown across it and were mere expressions of abstract woman with relation to abstract man but that did not change their nature he did not abhor them but he believed he knew them and he believed now that he detected one of them in miss shirleys note of course one could take another view of it one could say to ones self that she was really so fervently grateful that she could not trust some accident to bring them together in a place where she was merely a part of the catering as she said and he was a guest and that she was excusable or at least mercifully explicable in her wish to have him know that she appreciated his goodness verrian had been very good he knew that he had saved the day for the poor thing when it was in danger of the dreariest kind of slump she was a poor thing as any woman was who had to make her own way and she had been sick and was charming besides she had found out his name and had probably recognized a quality of celebrity in it unknown to the other young people with whom he found himself so strangely assorted under mrs westangles roof  in the end and upon the whole verrian would rather have liked if the thing could have been made to happen meeting miss shirley long enough to disclaim meriting her thanks and to ascribe to the intrinsic value of her scheme the brilliant success it had achieved this would not have been true but it would have been encouraging to her and in the revery which followed upon his conditional desire he had a long imaginary conversation with her and discussed all her other plans for the revels of the week these had not the trouble of defining themselves very distinctly in the conversation in order to win his applause and their consideration did not carry him with miss shirley beyond the strictly professional ground on which they met  she had apparently invented nothing for that evening and the house party was left to its own resources in dancing and sitting out dances which apparently fully sufficed it they were all tired and broke up early the women took their candles and went off to bed and the men went to the billiardroom to smoke on the way down from his room where he had gone to put on his smokingjacket verrian met miss macroyd coming up candle in hand and received from her a tacit intimation that he might stop her for a joking goodnight  i hope youll sleep well on your laurels as umpire he said  oh thank you she returned and i hope your laurels wont keep you awake it must seem to you as if it was blowing a perfect gale in them  what do you mean i did nothing  oh i dont mean your promotion of the snow battle but havent you heard he stared youve been found out  found out verrians soul was filled with the joy of literary fame  yes you cant conceal yourself now youre verrian the actor  the actor verrian frowned blackly in his disgust so blackly that miss macroyd laughed aloud  yes the coming matinee idol one of the girls recognized you as soon as you came into the house and the name settled it though of course youre supposed to be here incognito  the mention of that name which he enjoyed in common with the actor made verrian furious for when the actor first appeared with it in new york verrian had been at the pains to find out that it was not his real name and that he had merely taken it because of the weak quality of romance in it which verrian himself had always disliked but of course he could not vent his fury on miss macroyd all he could do was to ask then they have got my photograph on their dressingtables with candles burning before it  no i dont believe i can give you that comfort the fact is your acting is not much admired among the girls here but they think you are unexpectedly nice as a private person  thats something and does mrs westangle think im the actor too  how should mrs westangle know what she thinks and if she doesnt how should i  thats true and are you going to give me away  i havent done it yet but isnt it best to be honest  it mightnt be a success  the honesty  my literary celebrity  theres that miss macroyd rejoiced well so far ive merely said i was sure you were not verrian the actor ill think the other part over she went on upstairs with the sound of her laugh following her and verrian went gloomily back to the billiardroom where he found most of the smokers conspicuously yawning he lighted a fresh cigar and while he smoked they dropped away one by one till only bushwick was left  some of the fellows are going thursday he said are you going to stick it out to the bitter end  till then it had not occurred to verrian that he was not going to stay through the week but now he said i dont know but i may go thursday shall you  i might as well stay on i dont find much doing in real estate at christmas do you  this was fishing but it was better than openly taking him for that actor and verrian answered unresentfully i dont know im not in that line exactly  oh i beg your pardon bushwick said i thought i had seen your name with that of a west side concern  no i have a sort of outside connection with the publishing business  oh bushwick returned politely and it would have been reassuringly if verrian had wished not to be known as an author the secret in which he lived in that regard was apparently safe from that young amiable goodlooking realestate broker he inferred from the absence of any allusion to the superstition of the women as to his profession that it had not spread to bushwick at least and this inclined him the more to like him they sat up talking pleasantly together about impersonal affairs till bushwick finished his cigar then he started for bed saying well goodnight i hope mrs westangle wont have anything so active on the tapis for tomorrow  try and sleep it off goodnight     xv  verrian remained to finish his cigar but at the end he was not yet sleepy and he thought he would get a book from the library if that part of the house were still lighted and he looked out to see apparently it was as brilliantly illuminated as when the company had separated there for the night and he pushed across the foyer hall that separated the billiardroom from the drawingzoom and library he entered the drawingroom and in the depths of the library relieved against the rows of books in their glass cases he startled miss shirley from a pose which she seemed to be taking there alone  at the instant of their mutual recognition she gave a little muted shriek and then gasped out i beg your pardon while he was saying too i beg your pardon  after a tacit exchange of forgiveness he said i am afraid i startled you i was just coming for a book to read myself asleep with i  not at all she returned i was just then she did not say what and he asked  making some studies  yes she owned with reluctant promptness  i mustnt ask what he suggested and he made an effort to smile away what seemed a painful perturbation in her as he went forward to look at the bookshelves from which till then she had not slipped aside  im in your way she said and he answered not at all he added to the other sentence he had spoken if its going to be as good as what you gave us today  you are very kind she hesitated and then she said abruptly what i did today owed everything to you mr verrian and while he desisted from searching the bookshelves she stood looking anxiously at him with the pulse in her neck visibly throbbing her agitation was really painful but verrian did not attribute it to her finding herself there alone with him at midnight for though the other guests had all gone to bed the house was awake in some of the servants and an elderly woman came in presently bringing a breadth of silvery gauze which she held up asking if it was that  not exactly but it will do nicely mrs stager would you mind getting me the very paleblue piece that electric blue  im looking for something good and dull verrian said when the woman was gone  travels are good or narratives for sleeping on she said with a breathless effort for calm i found she panted in my own insomnia that merely the brokenup look of a page of dialogue in a novel racked my nerves so that i couldnt sleep but narratives were beautifully soothing  thank you he responded thats a good idea and stooping with his hands on his knees he ranged back and forth along the shelves but mrs westangles library doesnt seem to be very rich in narrative  he had not his mind on the search perhaps and perhaps she knew it she presently said i wish i dared ask you a favori mean your advice mr verrian  he lifted himself from his stooping posture and looked at her smiling would that take much courage his smile was a little mocking he was thinking that a girl who would hurry that note to him and would personally see that it did not fail to reach him would have the courage for much more  she did not reply directly i should have to explain but i know you wont tell this is going to be my piece de resistance my grand stunt im going to bring it off the last night she stopped long enough for verrian to revise his resolution of going away with the fellows who were leaving the middle of the week and to decide on staying to the end i am going to call it seeing ghosts  thats good verrian said provisionally  yes i might say i was surprised at my thinking it up  that would be one form of modesty  yes she said with a wan smile she had and then again it mightnt be another she went on abruptly as many as like can take part in the performance its to be given out and distinctly understood beforehand that the ghost isnt a veridical phantom but just an honest madeup everyday spook it may change its pose from time to time or its drapery but the setting is to be always the same and the people who take their turns in seeing it are to be explicitly reassured one after another that theres nothing in it you know the fun will be in seeing how each one takes it after they know what it really is  then youre going to give us a study of temperaments  yes she assented and after a moment given to letting the notion get quite home with her she asked vividly would you let me use it  the phrase why certainly but wouldnt it be rather too psychological i think just seeing ghosts would be better  better than seeing ghosts a study of temperaments perhaps it would it would be simpler  and in this house you need all the simplicity you can get he suggested  she smiled intelligently but reticently my idea is that every one somehow really believes in ghostsi know i doand so fully expects to see one that any sort of makeup will affect them for the moment just as if they did see one i thoughtthat perhapsi dont know how to say it without seeming to make use of you  oh do make use of me miss shirley  that you could give me some hints about the setting with your knowledge of the stage she stopped having rushed forward to that point while he continued to look steadily at her without answering her she faced him courageously but not convincingly  did you think that i was an actor he asked finally  mrs westangle seemed to think you were  but did you  im sure i didnt meani beg your pardon  its all right if i were an actor i shouldnt be ashamed of it but i was merely curious to know whether you shared the prevalent superstition im afraid i cant help you from a knowledge of the stage but if i can be of use from a sort of amateur interest in psychology with an affair like this i shall be only too glad  thank you she said somewhat faintly with an effect of dismay disproportionate to the occasion  she sank into a chair before which she had been standing and she looked as if she were going to swoon  he started towards her with an alarmed miss shirley  she put out a hand weakly to stay him dont she entreated im a littlei shall be all right in a moment  cant i get you somethingcall some one  not for the world she commanded and she pulled herself together and stood up but i think ill stop for tonight im glad my idea strikes you favorably its merelyoh you found it mrs stager she broke off to address the woman who had now come back and was holding up the trailing breadths of the electricblue gauze isnt it lovely she gave herself time to adore the drapery with its changes of meteoric lucence before she rose and took it she went with it to the background in the library where against the glass door of the cases she involved herself in it and stood shimmering a thrill pierced to verrians heart she was indeed wraithlike so that he hated to have her call how will that do  mrs stager modestly referred the question to him by her silence i will answer for its doing if it does for the others as its done for me  she laughed and you doubly knew what it was yes i think it will go she took another pose and then another what do you think of it mrs stager she called to the woman standing respectfully abeyant at one side  its awful i dont know but ill be afraid to go to my room  sit down and ill go to your room with you when im through i wont be long now  she tried different gauzes which she had lying on one of the chairs and crowned herself with triumph in the applauses of her two spectators rejoicing with a glee that verrian found childlike and winning if theyre all like you it will be the greatest success  theyll all be like me and more he said im really very severe  are you a severe person she asked coming forward to him ought people to be afraid of you  yes people with bad consciences im rattier afraid of myself for that reason  have you got a bad conscience she asked letting her eyes rest on his  yes i cant make my conduct square with my ideal of conduct  i know what that is she sighed do you expect to be punished for it  i expect to be got even with  yes one is ive noticed that myself but i didnt suppose that actorsoh i forgot i beg your pardon again mr verrian ohgoodnight she faced him evanescently in going out with the woman after her but whether she did so more in fear or more in defiance she left him standing motionless in his doubt and she did nothing to solve his doubt when she came quickly back alone before he was aware of having moved to say mr verrian i want toi have totell you thati didnt think you were the actor then she was finally gone and verrian had nothing for it but to go up to his room with the book he found he had in his hand and must have had there all the time  if he had read it the book would not have eased him off to sleep but he did not even try to read it he had no wish to sleep the waking dream in which he lost himself was more interesting than any vision of slumber could have been and he had no desire to end it in that he could still be talking with the girl whose mystery appealed to him so pleasingly it was none the less pleasing because at what might be called her first blushes she did not strike him as altogether ingenuous but only able to discipline herself into a final sincerity from a consciousness which had been taught wisdom by experience  she was still a scarcely recovered invalid and it was pathetic that she should be commencing the struggle of life with strength so little proportioned to the demand upon it and the calling she had taken up was of a fantasticality in some aspects which was equally pathetic but all the undertakings of women he mused were piteous not only because women were unequal to the struggle at the best but because they were hampered always with themselves with their sex their femininity and the necessity of getting it out of the way before they could really begin to fight whatever they attempted it must be in relation to the mans world in which livings were made but the immemorial conditions were almost wholly unchanged a woman approached this world as a woman with the inborn instinct of tempting it as a woman to win it to love her and make her a wife and mother and although she might stoically overcome the temptation at last it might recur at any moment and overcome her this was perpetually weakening and imperilling her and she must feel it at the encounter with each man she met she must feel the tacit and even unconscious irony of his attitude towards her in her enterprise and the finer her make the crueller and the more humiliating and disheartening this must be  of course this miss shirley felt verrians irony which he had guarded from any expression with genuine compassion for her she must feel that to his knowledge of life she and her experiment had an absurdity which would not pass whatever their success might be if she meant business and business only they ought to have met as two men would have met but he knew that they had not done so and she must have known it all that was plain sailing enough but beyond this lay a sea of conjecture in which he found himself without helm or compass why should she have acted a fib about his being an actor and why after the end should she have added an end in which she returned to own that she had been fibbing for that was what it came to and though verrian tasted a delicious pleasure in the womanish feat by which she overcame her womanishness he could not puzzle out her motive he was not sure that he wished to puzzle it out to remain with illimitable guesses at his choice was more agreeable for the present at least and he was not aware of having lapsed from them when he woke so late as to be one of the breakfasters whose plates were kept for them after the others were gone     xvi  it was the first time that verrian had come down late and it was his novel experience to find himself in charge of mrs stager at breakfast instead of the butler and the butlers man who had hitherto served him at the earlier hour there were others somewhat remote from him at table who were ending when he was beginning and when they had joked themselves out of the room and away from mrs stagers ministrations he was left alone to her he had instantly appreciated a quality of motherliness in her attitude towards him and now he was sensible of a kindly intimacy to which he rather helplessly addressed himself  well mrs stager did you see a ghost on your way to bed  i dont know as i really expected to she said wont you have a few more of the buckwheats  do you think id better i believe i wont theyre very tempting miss shirley makes a very good ghost he suggested  mrs stager would not at first commit herself further than to say in bringing him the butter shes just up from a long fit of sickness she impulsively added she aint hardly strong enough to be doing what she is i tell her  i understood she had been ill verrian said we drove over from the station together the other day  yes mrs stager admitted kind of a nervous breakdown i believe but shes got an awful spirit mrs westangle dont want her to do all she is doing  verrian looked at her in surprise he had not expected that of the indiarubber nature he had attributed to mrs westangle in view of mrs stagers privity to the unimagined kindliness of his hostess he relaxed himself in a further interest in miss shirley as if it would now be safe shes done splendidly so far he said meaning the girl im glad mrs westangle appreciates her work  i guess mrs stager said that if it hadnt been for you at the snowfightshe got back from getting ready for it that morning almost down sick she was afraid so it was going to fail  i didnt do anything verrian said putting the praise from him  mrs stager lowered her voice in an octave of deeper confidentiability you got the note i put it under and i didnt know  oh yes i got it verrian said sensible of a relief which he would not assign to any definite reason in knowing that miss shirley had not herself put it under his door but he now had to take up another burden in the question whether miss shirley were of an origin so much above that of her confidant that she could have a patrician fearlessness in making use of her or were so near mrs stagers level of life that she would naturally turn to her for counsel and help miss shirley had the accent the manners and the frank courage of a lady but those things could be learned they were got up for the stage every day  verrian was roused from the muse he found he had fallen into by hearing mrs stager ask wont you have some more coffee  no thank you he said and now he rose from the table on which he dreamily dropped his napkin and got his hat and coat and went out for a walk he had not studied the art of fiction so long in the many private failures that had preceded his one public success without being made to observe that life sometimes dealt in the accidents and coincidences which his criticism condemned as too habitually the resource of the novelist hitherto he had disdained them for this reason but since his serial story was off his hands and he was beginning to look about him for fresh material he had doubted more than once whether his severity was not the effect of an unjustifiable prejudice  it struck him now in turning the corner of the woodlot above the meadow where the snowbattle had taken place and suddenly finding himself face to face with miss shirley that nature was in one of her uninventive moods and was helping herself out from the old stockintrade of fiction all the same he felt a glow of pleasure which was also a glow of pity for while miss shirley looked as always interesting she look tired too with a sort of desperate air which did not otherwise account for itself she had given at sight of him a little start and a little oh dropped from her lips as if it had been jostled from them she made haste to go on with something like the voluntary hardiness of the courage that plucks itself from the primary emotion of fear you are going down to try the skating  do i look it without skates  you may be going to try the sliding she returned im afraid there wont be much of either for long this soft air is going to make havoc of my plans for tomorrow  thats too bad of it why not hope for a hard freeze tonight you might as well the weather has been known to change its mind you might even change your plans  no i cant do that i cant think of anything else its to bridge over the day thats left before seeing ghosts if it does freeze youll come to mrs westangles afternoon tea on the pond  i certainly shall how is it to be worked  shes to have her table on a platform with runners in a bower of evergreen boughs and be pushed about and the people are to skate up for the tea there are to be tea and chocolate and two girls to pour just as in real life it isnt a very dazzling idea but i thought it might do and mrs westangle is so goodnatured now if the thermometer will do its part  i am sure it will verrian said but a glance at the gray sky did not confirm him in his prophetic venture the snow was sodden under foot a breath from the south stirred the pines to an aeolian response and moved the stiff dry leaves of the scruboaks a sapsucker was marking an accurate circle of dots round the throat of a tall young maple and enjoying his work in a low guttural soliloquy seemingly yet dismayingly suggestive of spring  its lovely anyway she said following his glance with an upward turn of her face  yes its beautiful i think this sort of winter day is about the best the whole year can do but i will sacrifice the chance of another like it to your skatingtea miss shirley  he did not know why he should have made this speech to her but apparently she did and she said youre always coming to my help mr verrian  dont mention it  i wont then she said with a smile that showed her thin face at its thinnest and left her lip caught on her teeth till she brought it down voluntarily it was a small but full lip and pretty and this trick of it had a fascination she added gravely i dont believe you will like my icetea  i havent any active hostility to it you cant always be striking twelvetwelve midnightas you will be in seeing ghosts but your icetea will do very well for striking five im rather elaborate  not too elaborate to hide your real opinion i wonder what you do think of my own elaborationi mean of my scheme  yes  they had moved on at his turning to walk with her so as not to keep her standing in the snow and now she said looking over her shoulder at him ive decided that it wont do to let the ghost have all the glory i dont think it will be fair to let the people merely be scared even when theyve been warned that theyre to see a ghost and told it isnt real  she seemed to refer the point to him and he said provisionally i dont know what more they can ask  they can ask questions im going to let each person speak to the ghost if not scared dumb and ask it just what they please and im going to answer their questions if i can  wont it be something of an intellectual strain  yes it will but it will be fun too a little and it will help the thing to go off what do you think  i think its fine are you going to give it out so that they can be studying up their questions  no their questions have got to be impromptu or at least the first one has of course after the scheme has once been given away the ghostseers will be more or less prepared and the ghost will have to stand it  i think its great are you going to let me have a chance with a question  are you going to see a ghost  to be sure i am may i really ask it what i please  if youre honest  oh i shall be honest  he stopped breathlessly but she did not seem called upon to supply any meaning for his abruptness im awfully glad you like the idea she said i have had to think the whole thing out for myself and i havent been quite certain that the questionasking wasnt rather silly or at least sillier than the rest thank you so much mr verrian  ive thought of my question he began again as abruptly as he had stopped before may i ask it now  cries of laughter came up from the meadow below and the voices seemed coming nearer  oh i mustnt be seen miss shirley lamented oh dear if im seen the whole thing is given away what shall i do she whirled about and ran down the road towards a path that entered the wood  he ran after her my question is may i come to see you when you get back to town  yes certainly but dont come now you mustnt be seen with me im not supposed to be in the house at all  if verrians present mood had been more analytic it might have occurred to him that the element of mystery which miss shirley seemed to cherish in regard to herself personally was something that she could dramatically apply with peculiar advantage to the phantasmal part she was to take in her projected entertainment but he was reduced from the exercise of his analytic powers to a passivity in which he was chiefly conscious of her pathetic fascination this seemed to emanate from her frail prettiness no less than from the sort of fearful daring with which she was pushing her whole enterprise through it came as much from her undecided blondnessfrom her dustcolored hair for instanceas from the entreating look of her pinched eyes only just lighting their convalescent fires and from the weakness that showed with the grace in her run through the wintry woods where he watched her till the underbrush thickened behind her and hid her from him altogether his impression was very complex but he did not get so far even as the realization of this in his mental turmoil as he turned with a deep sigh and walked meditatively homeward through the incipient thaw  it did not rain at night as it seemed so likely to do and by morning the cloudiness of the sky had so far thinned that the sun looked mildly through it without more than softening the frozen surface of the pond so that mrs westangles icetea as everybody called it by a common inspiration or by whatever circuitous adoption of verrians phrase came off with great success people from other houses were there and they all said that they wondered how she came to have such a brilliant idea and they kept her there till nearly dark then the retarded rain began in a fine drizzle and her house guests were forced homeward but not too soon to get a good long rest before dressing for dinner she was praised for her understanding with the weather and for her meteorological forecast as much as for her invention in imagining such a delightful and original thing as an icetea which no one else had ever thought of some of the women appealed to verrian to say if he had ever heard of anything like it and they felt that mrs westangle was certainly arriving and by no beaten track  none of the others put it in these terms of course it was merely a consensus of feeling with them and what was more articulate was dropped among the ironies with which miss macroyd more confidentially celebrated the event out of hearing of the others in slowly following them with verrian she recurred to their talk yes its only a question of money enough for newport after this shes chic now and after a season there she will be smart but oh dear how came she to be chic can you imagine  verrian did not feel bound to a categorical answer and in his private reflections he dealt with another question this was how far miss shirley was culpable in the fraud she was letting mrs westangle practise on her innocent guests it was a distasteful question and he did not find it much more agreeable when it subdivided itself into the question of necessity on her part and of a not very clearly realized situation on mrs westangles the girl had a right to sell her ideas and perhaps the woman thought they were her own when she had paid for them there could be that view of it all the furtive nature of miss shirleys presence in the house might very well be a condition of that grand event she was preparing it was all very mysterious     xvii  it rained throughout the evening with a wailing of the wind in the gables and a weeping and a sobbing of the water from the eaves that mrs westangles guests securely housed from the storm made the most of for weirdness there had been a little dancing which gave way to so much sittingout that the volunteer music abruptly ceased as if in dudgeon and there was nothing left but weirdness to bring young hearts together weirdness can do a good deal with girls lounging in low chairs and young men on rugs round a glowing hearth at their feet and every one told some strange thing that had happened at first hand or second or third hand either to himself or herself or to their fathers or brothers or grandmothers or old servants they were stimulated in eking out these experiences not only by the wildness of the rain without but by the mystery of being shut off from the library into the drawingroom and hall while the preparations for the following night were beginning but weirdness is not inexhaustible even when shared on such propitious terms between a group of young people rapidly advanced in intimacy by a weeks stay under the same roof and at the first yawn a gay dispersion of the votaries ended it all  the yawn came from bushwick who boldly owned when his guilt was brought home to him that he was sleepy and then as he expected to be scared out of a years growth the next night and not be able to sleep for a week afterwards he was now going to bed he shook hands with mrs westangle for goodnight the latest to follow him was verrian who strangely alert and as far from drowsiness as he had ever known himself was yet more roused by realizing that mrs westangle was not letting his hand go at once but unless it was mere absentmindedness was conveying through it the wish to keep him she fluttered a little more closely up to him and twittered out miss shirley wants me to let you know that she has told me about your coming together and everything  oh im very glad verrian said not sure that it was the right thing  i dont know why she feels so but she has a right to do as she pleases about it shes not a guest  no verrian assented  it happens very well though for the ghostseeing that people dont know shes here after that i shall tell them in fact she wants me to for she must be on the lookout for other engagements i am going to do everything i can for her and if you hear of anything  verrian bowed with a sense of something offensive in her words which he could not logically feel since it was a matter of business and was put squarely on a business basis i should be very glad he said noncommittally  she was sure from the first mrs westangle went on as if there were some relation between the fact and her request that you were not the actor she knew you were a writer  oh indeed verrian said  i thought that if you were writing for the newspapers you might know how to help her  im not a newspaper writer verrian answered with a resentment which she seemed to feel for she said with a sort of apology in her tone  oh well i dont suppose it matters she doesnt know im speaking to you about that it just came into my head i like to help in a worthy object you know i hope youll have a good nights rest  she turned and looked round with the air of distraction which she had after speaking to any one and which verrian fancied came as much from a paucity as from a multiplicity of suggestion in her brain and so left him standing but she came back to say of course its all between ourselves till after tomorrow night mr verrian  oh certainly he replied and went vaguely off in the direction of the billiardroom it was light and warm there though the place was empty and he decided upon a cigar as a proximate or immediate solution he sat smoking before the fire till the tobaccos substance had half turned into a wraith of ash and not really thinking of anything very definitely except the question whether he should be able to sleep after he went to bed when he heard a creeping step on the floor he turned quickly with a certain expectance in his nerves and saw nothing more ghostly than bushwick standing at the corner of the table and apparently hesitating how to speak to him  he said hello and at this bushwick said  look here  well verrian asked looking at him  how does it happen youre up so late after everybody else is wrapped in slumber  i might ask the same of you  well i found i wasnt making it a case of sleep exactly and so i got up  well i hadnt gone to bed for much the same reason why couldnt you sleep a realestate broker ought to have a clean conscience  so ought a publisher for that matter what do you think of this ghostdance anyway  it might be amusingif it fails verrian was tempted to add the condition by the opportunity for a cynicism which he did not feel it is one of the privileges of youth to be cynical whether or no  bushwick sat down before the fire and rubbed his shins with his two hands unrestfully drawing in a long breath between his teeth these things get on to my nerves sometimes i shouldnt want the ghostdance to fail  on mrs westangles account  i guess mrs westangle could stand it look here it was rather a customary phrase of his verrian noted as he now used it he looked alertly round at verrian with his hands still on his shins whats the use of our beating round the bush  verrian delayed his answer long enough to decide against the aimless pun of asking what bushwick and merely asked what bush  the bush where the milk in the cocoanut grows you dont pretend that you believe mrs westangle has been getting up all these fairy stunts  verrian returned to his cigar from which the ashen wraith dropped into his lap i guess youll have to be a little clearer but as bushwick continued silently looking at him the thing could not be left at this point and he was obliged to ask of his own initiative how much do you know  bushwick leaned back in his chair with his eyes still on verrians profile as much as miss macroyd could tell me  ah im still in the dark verrian politely regretted but not with a tacit wish to wring miss macroyds neck which he would not have known how to account for  well she says that mrs westangle has a professional assistant whos doing the whole job for her and that she came down on the same train with herself and you  did she say that she grabbed the whole victoria for herself and maid at the station verrian demanded in a burst of rage and left us to get here the best way we could  bushwick grinned she supposed there were other carriages and when she found there werent she hurried the victoria back for you  you think she believes all that im glad she has the decency to be ashamed of her behavior  im not defending her miss macroyd knows how to take care of herself  the matter rather dropped for the moment in which bushwick filled a pipe he took from his pocket and lighted it after the first few whiffs he took it from his mouth and with a droll look across at verrian said who was your fair friend  if verrian was going to talk of this thing he was not going to do it with the burden of any sort of reserve or contrivance on his soul this afternoon bushwick nodded and verrian added that was she then he went on wrathfully shes a girl who has to make her living and shes doing it in a new way that shes invented for herself she has supposed that the stupid rich or the lazy rich who want to entertain people may be willing to pay for ideas and she proposes to supply the ideas for a money consideration shes not a guest in the house and she wont take herself on a society basis at all i dont know what her history is and i dont care shes a lady by training and if she had the accent i should say she was from the south for she has the enterprise of the south that comes north and tries to make its living its all inexpressibly none of my business but i happen to be knowing to so much of the case and if youre knowing to anything else mr bushwick i want you to get it straight thats why im talking of it and not because i think youve any right to know anything about it  thank you bushwick returned unruffled its about what miss macroyd told me thats the reason i dont want the ghostdance to fail  verrian did not notice him he found it more important to say shes so loyal to mrs westangle that she wouldnt have wished in mrs westangles interest to have her presence or her agency in what is going on known but of course if mrs westangle chooses to tell it thats her affair  she would have had to tell it sooner or later mrs westangle would and she only told it to miss macroyd this afternoon on compulsion after miss macroyd and i had seen you in the woodroad and mrs westangle had to account for the young ladys presence there in your company then miss macroyd had to tell me but i assure you my dear fellow the matter hasnt gone any further  oh its quite indifferent to me verrian retorted im nothing but a dispassionate witness of the situation  of course bushwick assented and then he added with a bonhomie really so amiable that a man with even an unreasonable grudge could hardly resist it if you call it dispassionate  verrian could not help laughing well passionate then i dont know why it should be so confoundedly vexatious but somehow i would have chosen miss macroydis she specially dear to you  not the least  i would have chosen her as the last person to have the business which is so inexpressibly none of my business  or mine as i think you remarked bushwick interposed  come out through verrian concluded accepting his interposition with a bow  i see what you mean bushwick said after a moments thought but really i dont think its likely to go further if you want to know i believe miss macroyd feels the distinction of being in the secret so much that shell prefer to hint round till mrs westangle gives the thing away she had to tell me because i was there with her when she saw you with the young lady to keep me from going with my curiosity to you come i do think shes honest about it  dont you think theyre rather more dangerous when theyre honest  well only when theyre obliged to be cheer up i dont believe miss macroyd is one to spoil sport  oh i think i shall live through it verrian said rather stiffening again but he relaxed in rising from his chair and said well goodnight old fellow i believe i shall go to bed now  you wont wait for me till my pipes out  no i think not i seem to be just making it and if i waited i might lose my grip he offered bushwick a friendly hand  do you suppose its been my soothing conversation im like the actor that the doctor advised to go and see himself act i cant talk myself sleepy  you might try it verrian said going out     xviii  the men who had talked of going away on thursday seemed to have found it practicable to stay at any rate they were all there on the saturday night for the ghostseeing and of course none of the women had gone what was more remarkable in a house rather full of girls nobody was sick or at least everybody was well enough to be at dinner and after dinner at the dance which impatiently if a little ironically preceded the supernatural part of the evenings amusement it was the decorum of a woman who might have been expected not to have it that mrs westangle had arranged that the evenings amusement should not pass the bound between saturday night and sunday morning the supper was to be later but that was like other eating and drinking on the sabbath and it was to be a cold supper  at halfpast ten the dancing stopped in the foyer and the drawingroom and by eleven the guests were all seated fronting the closed doors of the library there were not so many of them but that in the handsome space there was interval enough to lend a desired distance to the apparitions and when the doors were slid aside it was applausively found that there was a veil of gauze falling from the roof to the floor which promised its aid in heightening the coming mystery this was again heightened by the universal ignorance as to how the apparitions were to make their advents and on what terms  it was with an access of a certain nervous anxiety that verrian found himself next miss macroyd whose frank goodfellowship first expressed itself in a pleasure at the chance which he did not share and then extended to a confidential sympathy for the success of the enterprise which he did not believe she felt she laughed but sotto voce in bending her head close to his and whispering i hope shell be equal to her mise en scene its really very nice so simple besides the gauze veil there was no preparation except in the stretch of black drapery which hid the bookshelves at the farther wall of the library  mrs westangles note is always simplicity verrian returned  oh yes indeed and you wish to keep up the westangle convention  i dont see any reason for dropping it  oh none in the world she mocked  he determined to push her since she had tried to push him and he asked what reason could there be  now mr verrian asking a woman for a reason i shall begin to think some one else wrote your book too perhaps shell take up supplying ideas to authors as well as hostesses of course i mean mrs westangle  verrian wished he had not tried to push miss macroyd and he was still grinding his teeth in a vain endeavor to get out some fit retort between them when he saw bushwick shuffling to his feet in the front row of the spectators and heard him beginning a sort of speech  ladies and gentlemen mrs westangle has chosen me because a realestate broker is sometimes an auctioneer and may be supposed to have the gift of oratory to make known the conditions on which you may interview the ghosts which you are going to see anybody may do it who will comply with the conditions in the first place you have got to be serious and to think up something that you would really like to know about your past present or future remember this is no joking matter and the only difference between the ghost that you will see here and a real materialization under professional auspices is that the ghost wont charge you anything of course if any lady or gentlemanespecially ladywishes to contribute to any charitable object after a satisfactory interview with the ghost a hat will be found at the halldoor for the purpose and mrs westangle will choose the object i have put in a special plea for my own firm at a season when the realestate business is not at its best by this time bushwick had his audience laughing perhaps the more easily because they were all more or less in a hysterical mood which whether we own it or not is always induced by an approximation to the supernatural he frowned and said no laughing and then they laughed the more when he had waited for them to be quiet he went on gravely the conditions are simply these each person who chooses may interview the ghost keeping a respectful distance but not so far off but that the ghost can distinctly hear a stage whisper the question put must be seriously meant and it must be the question which the questioner would prefer to have answered above everything else at the time being certain questions will be absolutely ruled out such as does maria love me or has reuben ever been engaged before the laughter interrupted the speaker again and verrian hung his head in rage and shame this stupid ass was spoiling the hope of anything beautiful in the spectacle and turning it into a gross burlesque somehow he felt that the girl who had invented it had meant in the last analysis something serious and it was in her behalf that he would have liked to choke bushwick all the time he believed that miss macroyd whose laugh sounded above the others was somehow enjoying his indignation and divining its reason  other questions touching intemperance or divorce the questioner will feel must not be asked though it isnt necessary to more than suggest this i hope it will be left entirely to the good taste and good feeling of theparty we all know what the temptations of south dakota and the rum fiend are and that to err is human and forgive divine he paused having failed to get a laugh but got it by asking confidentially where was i ohhe caught himself upi remember those of you who are in the habit of seeing ghosts need not be told that a ghost never speaks first and those who have never met an apparition before but are in the habit of going to the theatre will recall the fact that in w shakespeares beautiful play of hamlet the play could not have gone on after the first scene if horatio had not spoken to the ghost of hamlets father and taken the chances of being snubbed here there are no chances of that kind the chances are that youll wish the ghost had not been entreated i think that is the phrase  in the laugh that followed a girl on miss macroyds other hand audibly asked her oh isnt he too funny  delicious miss macroyd agreed verrian felt she said it to vex him  now theres just one other point bushwick resumed and then i have done only one question can be allowed to each person but if the questioner is a lady she can ask a question and a half provided she is not satisfied with the answer in this case however she will only get half an answer now i have done and if my arguments have convinced any one within the sound of my voice that our ghost really means business i shall feel fully repaid for the pains and expense of getting up these few impromptu remarks to which i have endeavored to give a humorous character in order that you may all laugh your laugh out and no unseemly mirth may interrupt the subsequent proceedings we will now have a little music and those who can recall my words will be allowed to sing them  in the giggling and chatter which ensued the chords softly played passed into ears that might as well have been deaf but at last there was a general quiescence of expectation in which every ones eyes were strained to pierce through the gauze curtain to the sombre drapery beyond the wait was so long that the tension relaxed and a whispering began and verrian felt a sickness of pity for the girl who was probably going to make a failure of it he asked himself what could have happened to her had she lost courage or had her physical strength not yet fully renewed given way under the stress or had she in sheer disgust for the turn the affair had been given by that brute bushwick thrown up the whole business he looked round for mrs westangle she was not there he conjecturedhe could only conjecturethat she was absent conferring with miss shirley and trying to save the day  a long deeply sighed ohhhh shuddering from many lips made him turn abruptly and he saw glimmering against the pall at the bottom of the darkened library a figure vaguely white in which he recognized a pose a gesture familiar to him for the others the figure was it but for him it was preciously she it was she and she was going to carry it through she was going to triumph and not fail a lump came into his 96 throat and a mist blurred his eyes which when it cleared again left him staring at nothing  a girls young voice uttered the common feeling why is that all  it is till some one asks the ghost a question then it will reappear bushwick rose to say will miss andrews kindly step forward and ask the question nearest her heart  oh no the girl answered with a sincerity that left no one quite free to laugh  some other lady then bushwick suggested no one moved and he added this is a difficulty which had been foreseen some gentleman will step forward and put the question next his heart again no one offered to go forward and there was some muted laughter which bushwick checked this difficulty had been foreseen too i see that i shall have to make the first move and all that i shall require of the audience is that i shall not be supposed to be in collusion with the illusion i hope that after my experience whatever it is some young woman of courage will follow  he passed into the foyer and from that came into the library where he showed against the dark background in an attitude of entreaty slightly burlesqued the ghost reappeared  shall i marry the woman i am thinking of he asked  the phantom seemed to hesitate it wavered like a pale reflection cast against the pall then in the tones which verrian knew the answer came  ask her she will tell you  the phantom had scored a hit and the applause was silenced with difficulty but verrian felt that miss shirley had lost ground it could not have been for the easy cleverness of such a retort that she had planned the affair yet why not he was taking it too seriously it was merely business with her  and i havent even the right to half a question more bushwick lamented in a dramatized dejection and crossed slowly back from the library to his place  why havent you got enough one of the men asked amidst the gay clamor of the women  the ghost was gone again and its evanescence was discussed with ready wonder another of the men went round to tempt his fate and the phantom suddenly reappeared so near him that he got a laugh by his start of dismay i forgot what i was going to ask he faltered  i know what it was the apparition answered you had better sell  but they say it will go to a hundred the man protested  no backtalk rogers bushwick interposed that was the understanding  but we didnt understand one of the girls said coming to the rescue that the ghost was going to answer questions that were not asked that would give us all away  then the only thing is for you to go and ask before it gets a chance to answer bushwick said  well i will the girl returned and she swept round into the library where she encountered the phantom with a little whoop as it started into sight before her im not going to be scared out of it she said defiantly its simply this did the person i suspect really take the ring  the answer came look on the floor under your dressingtable  well if i find it there the girl addressed the company im a spiritualist from this time forth and she came back to her place where she remained for some time explaining to those near how she had lately lost her ring and suspected her maid whom she had dismissed  upon the whole the effect was serious the women having once started needed no more urging one after another they confronted and questioned the oracle with increasing sincerity  miss macroyd asked verrian hadnt you better take your chance and stop this flow of fatuity mr verrian  im afraid i should be fatuous too he said but you  oh thank you i dont believe in ghosts though this seems to be a very pretty onevery graceful i mean i suppose a graceful woman would be graceful even when a disembodied spirit i should think she would be getting a little tried with all this questioning but perhaps were only reading the fatigue into her the ghost may be merely overdone  it might easily be that verrian assented  oh may i ask it something now a girls voice appealed to bushwick it was the voice of that miss andrews who had spoken first and first refused to question the ghost she was the youngest of mrs westangles guests and verrian had liked her with a sense of something precious in the prolongation of a childs unconsciousness into the consciousness of girlhood which he found in her she was always likelier than not to say the thing she thought and felt whether it was silly and absurd or whether as also happened there was a touch of inspired significance in it as there is apt to be in the talk of children she was laughed at but she was liked and the freshness of her soul was pleasant to the girls who were putting on the world as hard as they could she could be trusted to do and say the unexpected but she was considered a little morbid and certainly she had an exaltation of the nerves that was at times almost beyond her control  oh dear miss macroyd whispered what is that strange simpleton going to do i wonder  verrian did not feel obliged to answer a question not addressed to him but he too wondered and doubted  the girl having got her courage together fluttered with it from her place round to the ghosts in a haste that expressed a fear that it might escape her if she delayed to put it to the test the phantom was already there as if it had waited her in the curiosity that followed her they were taking each other seriously the girl and the ghost and if the ghost had been a veridical phantom in which she could have believed with her whole soul the girl could not have entreated it more earnestly more simply  she bent forward in her slim tall figure with her hands outstretched and with her tender voice breaking at times in her entreaty oh i dont know how to begin she said quite as if she and the phantom were alone together and she had forgotten its supernatural awfulness in a sense of its human quality but you will understand wont you youll think it very strange and it is very unlike the others but if im going to be serious  the white figure stood motionless but verrian interpreted its quiet as a kindly intelligence and the girl made a fresh start in a note a little more piteous than before its about thethe truth do you think if sometimes we dont tell it exactly but we wish we had very very much it will come round somehow the same as if we had told it  i dont understand the phantom answered say it againor differently  can our repentance undo it or make the falsehood over into the truth  never the ghost answered with a passion that thrilled to verrians heart  oh dear the girl said and then as if she had been going to continue she stopped  youve still got your halfquestion miss andrews bushwick interposed  even if we didnt mean it to deceive harmfully the girl pursued if it was just on impulse something we couldnt seem to help and we didnt see it in its true light at the time  the ghost made no answer it stood motionless  it is offended bushwick said without knowing the shakespearian words youve asked it three times half a question miss andrews now mr verrian its your turn you can ask it just onequarter of a question miss andrews has used up the rest of your share  verrian rose awkwardly and stood a long moment before his chair then he dropped back again saying dryly i dont think i want to ask it anything  the phantom sank straight down as if sinking through the floor but lay there like a white shawl trailed along the bottom of the dark curtain  and is that all miss macroyd asked verrian i was just getting up my courage to go forward but now i suppose  oh dear miss andrews called out perhaps its fainted hadnt we better  there were formless cries from the women and the men made a crooked rush forward in which verrian did not join he remained where he had risen with miss macroyd beside him  perhaps its only a coup de theatre she said with her laugh better wait  bushwick was gathering the prostrate figure up she has fainted he called get some water somebody     xix  the early monday morning train which brought verrian up to town was so very early that he could sit down to breakfast with his mother only a little later than their usual hour  she had called joyfully to him from her room when she heard the rattling of his key as he let himself into the apartment and after an exchange of greetings shouted back and forth before they saw each other they could come at once to the history of his absence over their coffee you must have had a very good time to stay so long after you wrote that you would not be back thursday i expected it would be saturday till i got your telegram but im glad you stayed you certainly needed the rest  yes if those things are ever a rest he looked down at his cup while he stirred the coffee in it and she studied his attitude since she could not see his face fully for the secret of any vital change that might have come upon him it could be that in the interval since she had seen him he had seen the woman who was to take him from her she was always preparing herself for that knowing that it must come almost as certainly as death and knowing that with all her preparation she should not be ready for it ive got rather a long story to tell you and rather a strange story he said lifting his head and looking round but not so impersonally that his mother did not know well enough to say to the swedish servingwoman  you neednt stay margit ill give mr philip his breakfast well she added when they were alone  well he returned with a smile that she knew he was forcing i have seen the girl that wrote that letter  not jerusha brown  not jerusha brown but the girl all the same  now go on philip and dont miss a single word she commanded him with an imperious breathlessness you know i wont hurry you or interrupt you but you mustyou really musttell me everything dont leave out the slightest detail  i wont he said but she was aware from time to time that she was keeping her word better than he was keeping his in his account of meeting miss shirley and all the following events  you can imagine he said what a sensation the swooning made and the commotion that followed it  yes i can imagine that she answered but she was yet so faithful that she would not ask him to go on  he continued unasked i dont know just how now to account for its coming into my head that it was miss andrews who was my unknown correspondent i suppose ive always unconsciously expected to meet that girl and miss andrewss hypothetical case was psychologically so parallel  yes yes  and ive sometimes been afraid that i judged it too harshlythat it was a mere girlish freak without any sort of serious import  i was sometimes afraid so philip but  and i dont believe now that the hypothetical case brought any intolerable stress of conscience upon miss shirley or that she fainted from any cause but exhaustion from the general ordeal she was still weak from the sickness she had been throughtoo weak to bear the strain of the work she had taken up of course the catastrophe gave the whole surface situation away and i must say that those rather banal young people behaved very humanely about it there was nothing but interest of the nicest kind and if she is going on with her career it will be easy enough for her to find engagements after this  why shouldnt she go on his mother asked with a suspicion which she kept well out of sight  well as well as she could explain afterwards the catastrophe took her work out of the category of business and made her acceptance in it a matter of sentiment  she explained it to you herself  yes the general sympathy had penetrated to mrs westangle though i dont say that she had been more than negatively indifferent to miss shirleys claim on her before as it was she sent for me to her room the next morning and i found miss shirley alone there she said mrs westangle would be down in a moment  now indeed mrs verrian could not govern herself from saying i dont like it philip  i knew you wouldnt it was what i said to myself at the time you were so present with me that i seemed to have you there chaperoning the interview his mother shrugged and he went on she said she wished to tell me something first and then she said i want to do it while i have the courage if its courage perhaps its just desperation i am jerusha brown  his mother began but you said and then stopped herself  i know that i said she wasnt but she explained while i sat there rather mum that there was really another girl and that the other girls name was really jerusha brown she was the daughter of the postmaster in the village where miss shirley was passing the summer in fact miss shirley was boarding in the postmasters family and the girls had become very friendly they were reading my story together and talking about it and trying to guess how it would come out just as the letter said and they simultaneously hit upon the notion of writing to me it seemed to them that it would be a good jokeim not defending it mother and i must say miss shirley didnt defend it eitherto work upon my feelings in the way they tried and they didnt realize what they had done till armigers letter came it almost drove them wild she said but they had a lucid interval and they took the letter to the girls father and told him what they had done he was awfully severe with them for their foolishness and said they must write to armiger at once and confess the fact then they said they had written already and showed him the second letter and explained they had decided to let miss brawn write it in her person alone for the reason she gave in it but miss shirley told him she was ready to take her full share of the blame and if anything came of it she authorized him to put the whole blame on her  verrian made a pause which his mother took for invitation or permission to ask and was he satisfied with that  i dont know i wasnt and its only just to miss shirley to say that she wasnt either she didnt try to justify it to me she merely said she was so frightened that she couldnt have done anything she may have realized more than the brown girl what they had done  the postmaster did he regard it as anything worse than foolishness  i dont believe he did at any rate he was satisfied with what his daughter had done in owning up  well i always liked that girls letter and did they show him your letter  it seems that they did  and what did he say about that  i suppose what i deserved miss shirley wouldnt say explicitly he wanted to answer it but they wouldnt let him i dont know but i should feel better if he had i havent been proud of that letter of mine as time has gone on mother i think i behaved very narrowmindedly very personally in it  you behaved justly  justly i thought you had your doubts of that at any rate i had when it came to hearing the girl accusing herself as if she had been guilty of some monstrous wickedness and i realized that i had made her feel so  she threw herself on your pity  no she didnt mother dont make it impossible for me to tell you just how it was  i wont go on  i dont say she was manly about it that couldnt be but she was certainly not throwing herself on my pity unlessunless  what  unless you call it so for her to say that she wanted to own up to me because she could have no rest till she had done so she couldnt put it behind her till she had acknowledged it she couldnt work she couldnt get well  he saw his mother trying to consider it fairly and in response he renewed his own resolution not to make himself the girls advocate with her but to continue the dispassionate historian of the case at the same time his memory was filled with the vision of how she had done and said the things he was telling with what pathos with what grace with what beauty in her appeal he saw the tears that came into her eyes at times and that she indignantly repressed as she hurried on in the confession which she was voluntarily making for there was no outward stress upon her to say anything he felt again the charm of the situation the sort of warmth and intimacy but he resolved not to let that feeling offset the impartiality of his story  no i dont say she threw herself on your mercy his mother said finally she neednt have told you anything  except for the reason she gavethat she couldnt make a start for herself till she had done so and she has got her own way to make she is poor of course you may say her motive was an obsession and not a reason  theres reality in it whatever it is its a genuine motive mrs verrian conceded  i think so verrian said in a voice which he tried to keep from sounding too grateful  apparently his mother did not find it so she asked what had been the matter with her did she say  in her long sickness oh a nervous fever of some sort  from worrying about that experience  verrian reluctantly admitted she said it made her want to die i dont suppose we can quite realize  we neednt believe everything she said to realize that she suffered but girls exaggerate their sufferings i suppose you told her not to think of it any more  verrian gave an odd laugh well not unconditionally i tried to give her my point of view and i stipulated that she should tell jerusha brown all about it and keep her from having a nervous fever too  that was right you must see that even cowardice couldnt excuse her selfishness in letting that girl take all the chances  and im afraid i was not very unselfish myself in my stipulations verrian said with another laugh i think that i wanted to stand well with the postmaster  there was a note of cynical ease in this which mrs verrian found morally some octaves lower than the pitch of her sons habitual seriousness in what concerned himself but she could not make it a censure to him and you were able to reassure her so that she neednt think of it any more  what would you have wished me to do he returned dryly dont you think she had suffered enough  oh in this sort of thing it doesnt seem the question of suffering if theres wrong done the penalty doesnt right it  the notion struck verrians artistic sense thats true that would make the donnee of a strong story or a play its a drama of fate its greek but i thought we lived under another dispensation  will she try to get more of the kind of thing she was doing for mrs westangle at once or has she some people  no only friends as i understand  where is she from up country  no shes from the south  i dont like southerners  i know you dont mother but you must honor the way they work and get on when they come north and begin doing for themselves besides miss shirleys family went south after the war  oh not even a real southerner  mother  i know im not fair i ought to beg her pardon and i ought to be glad its all over shall you see her again  it might happen but i dont know how or when we parted friends but we parted strangers so far as any prevision of the future is concerned verrian said  his mother drew a long breath which she tried to render inaudible and the girl that asked her the strange questions did you see her again  oh yes she had a curious fascination i should like to tell you about her do you think theres such a thing as a girls being too innocent  it isnt so common as not being innocent enough  but its more difficult  i hope youll never find it so my son mrs verrian said and for the first time she was intentionally personal go on  about miss andrews  whichever you please  she waylaid me in the afternoon as i was coming home from a walk and wanted to talk with me about miss shirley  i suppose miss shirley was the days heroine after what had happened  the halfdays or quarterdays heroine perhaps she left on the church train for town yesterday morning soon after i saw her miss andrews seemed to think i was an authority on the subject and she approached me with a largeeyed awe that was very amusing though it was affecting too i suppose that girls must have many worships for other girls before they have any worship for a man this girl couldnt separate miss shirley on the lookout for another engagement from the psychical part she had played she raved about her she thought she was beautiful and she wanted to know all about her and how she could help her miss andrewss parents are rich but respectable i understand and shes an only child i came in for a share of her awe she had found out that i was not only not verrian the actor but an author of the same name and she had read my story with passionate interest but apparently in that unliterary way of many people without noticing who wrote it she seemed to have thought it was harding davis or henry james she wasnt clear which but it was a good deal to have had her read it at all in that house i dont believe anybody else had except miss shirley and miss macroyd  mrs verrian deferred a matter that would ordinarily have interested her supremely to an immediate curiosity and how came she to think you would know so much about miss shirley  verrian frowned i think from miss macroyd miss macroyd seems to have taken a grandmotherly concern in my affairs through the whole week perhaps she resented having behaved so piggishly at the station the day we came and meant to take it out of miss shirley and myself she had seen us together in the woods one day and she must have told it about mrs westangle wouldnt have spoken of us together because she never speaks of anything unless it is going to count and there was no one else who knew of our acquaintance  why my son if you went walking in the woods with the girl any one might have seen you  i didnt it was quite by accident that we met there miss shirley was anxious to keep her presence in the house a secret from everybody  mrs verrian would not take any but the open way with this she would not deal indirectly with it or in any wise covertly or surreptitiously it seems to me that miss shirley has rather a fondness for secrecy she said  i think she has verrian admitted though in this case it was essential to the success of her final scheme but she is a curious study i suppose that timidity is at the bottom of all fondness for secrecy isnt it  i dont know she doesnt seem to be timid in everything  say it out mother verrian challenged her with a smile youre not timid anyway  she had the courage to join in that letter but not the courage to own her part in it she was brave enough to confess that she had been sick of a nervous fever from the answer you wrote to the brown girl but she wouldnt have been brave enough to confess anything at all if she had believed she would be physically or morally strong enough to keep it  perhaps nobodynobody but you motheris brave in the right time and place  she knew that this was not meant in irony i am glad you say that philip  its only your due but arent you a little too hard upon cowards at times for the sort of person she is if you infer the sort from the worst appearance she has made in the whole business i think she has done pretty well  why had she left the brown girl to take all your resentment alone for the last six or eight months  she may have thought that she was getting her share of the punishment in the fever my resentment brought on  philip do you really believe that her fever if she had one came from that  i think she believes it and theres no doubt but she was badly scared  oh theres no doubt of that  but come mother why should we take her at the worst of course she has a complex nature i see that as clearly as you do i dont believe we look at her diversely in the smallest particular but why shouldnt a complex nature be credited with the same impulses towards the truth as a single nature why shouldnt we allow that miss shirley had the same wish to set herself right with me as miss andrews would have had in her place  i dare say she wished to set herself right with you but not from the same wish that miss andrews would have had miss andrews would not have wished you to know the truth for her own sake her motive would have been directstraight  yes and we will describe her as a straight line and miss shirley as a waving line why shouldnt the waving line at its highest points touch the same altitude as the straight line  it wouldnt touch it all the time and in character or nature as you call it that is the great thing its at the lowest points that the waving line is dangerous  well i dont deny that but im anxious to be just to a person who hasnt experienced a great deal of mercy for what after all wasnt such a very heinous thing as i used to think it you must allow that she wasnt obliged to tell me anything about herself  yes she was philip as i said before she hadnt the physical or moral strength to keep it from you when she was brought face to face with you besides mrs verrian hesitated  out with it mother we at least wont have any concealments  she may have thought she could clinch it in that way  clinch what  you know is she pretty  shesinteresting  that can always be managed is she tall  no i think shes rather out of style there shes rather petite  and whats her face like  well she has no particular complexion but its not thick her eyes are the best of her though there isnt much of them theyre the waters on a starry night sort very sweet and glimmering she has a kind of groundcolored hair and a nice little chin her mouth helps her eyes out it looks best when she speaks its pathetic in the play of the lips  i see mrs verrian said     xx  the following week verrian and his mother were at a show of paintings in the gallery at the rear of a dealers shop and while they were bending together to look at a picture he heard himself called to in a girlish voice oh mr verrian as if his being there was the greatest wonder in the world  his mother and he lifted themselves to encounter a tall slim girl who was stretching her hand towards him and who now cried out joyously oh mr verrian i thought it must be you but i was afraid it wasnt as soon as i spoke oh im so glad to see you i want so much to have you know my mothermr verrian she said presenting him  and i you mine verrian responded in a violent ellipse and introduced his own mother who took in the fact of miss andrewss tall thinness topped with a wide white hat and waving white plumes and her little face irregular and somewhat gaunt but with a charm in the lips and eyes which took the elder womans heart with pathos she made talk with mrs andrews who affected one as having the materials of social severity in her costume and manner  oh i didnt believe i should ever see you again the girl broke out impulsively upon verrian oh i wanted to ask you so about miss shirley have you seen her since you got back  no verrian said i havent seen her  oh i thought perhaps you had ive been to the address that mrs westangle gave me but she isnt there any more shes gone up into harlem somewhere and i havent been able to call again oh i do feel so anxious about her oh i do hope she isnt ill do you think she is  i dont believe so verrian began but she swept over his prostrate remark  oh mr verrian dont you think shes wonderful ive been telling mother about it and i dont feel at all the way she does do you  how does she feel i must know that before i say  why of course i hadnt told you she thinks it was a makeup between miss shirley and that mr bushwick but i say it couldnt have been do you think it could  verrian found the suggestion so distasteful for a reason which he did not quite seize himself that he answered resentfully it could have been but i dont think it was  i will tell her what you say oh may i tell her what you say  i dont see why you shouldnt it isnt very important either way is it  oh dont you think so not if it involved pretending what wasnt true  she bent towards him in such anxious demand that he could not help smiling  the whole thing was a pretence wasnt it he suggested  yes but that would have been a pretence that we didnt know of  it would be incriminating to that extent certainly verrian owned ironically he found the question of miss shirleys blame for the collusion as distasteful as the supposition of the collusion but there was a fascination in the innocence before him and he could not help playing with it  sometimes miss andrews apparently knew that he was playing with her innocence and sometimes she did not but in either case she seemed to like being his jest from which she snatched a fearful joy she was willing to prolong the experience and she drifted with him from picture to picture and kept the talk recurrently to miss shirley and the phenomena of seeing ghosts  her mother and mrs verrian evidently got on together better than either of them at first expected when it came to their parting through mrs andrewss saying that she must be going she shook hands with mrs verrian and said to philip i am so glad to have met you mr verrian will you come and see us  yes thank you he answered taking the hand she now offered him and then taking miss andrewss hand while the girls eyes glowed with pleasure i shall be very glad  oh shall you she said with her transparent sincerity and you wont forget thursdays but any day at five we have tea  thank you verrian said i might forget the thursdays but i couldnt forget all the days of the week  miss andrews laughed and blushed at once then we shall expect you every day  well every day but thursday he promised  when the mother and daughter had gone mrs verrian said she is a great admirer of yours philip shes read your story and i suspect she wants an opportunity to talk with you about it  you mean mrs andrews  yes i suppose the daughter hasnt waited for an opportunity the mother had read that publishers paragraph about your invalid and wanted to know if you had ever heard from her again women are personal in their literary interests  philip asked in dismay you didnt give it away did you mother  certainly not my dear you have brought me up too carefully  of course i didnt imagine you had  then as they could not pretend to look at the pictures any longer they went away too their issue into the open air seemed fraught with novel emotion for mrs verrian well now she said i have seen the woman i would be willing my son should marry  child you mean philip said not pretending that he did not know she meant miss andrews  that girl his mother returned is innocence itself oh philip dear do marry her  well i dont know if her mother is behaving as sagely with her as you are with me the chances are that she wont let me besides i dont know that i want to marry quite so much innocence  she is conscience incarnate his mother uttered perfervidly you could put your very soul in her keeping  then you would be out of a job mother  oh i am not worthy of the job my dear i have always felt that i am too complex and sometimes i cant see the right alone as she could  philip was silent a moment while he lost the personal point of view i suspect we dont see the right when we see it alone we ought to see the wrong too  ah philip dont let your fancy go after that girl  miss andrews i thought  dont you be complex my dear you know i mean miss shirley what has become of her i wonder i heard miss andrews asking you  i wasnt able to tell her do you want me to try telling you  i would rather you never could  philip laughed sardonically now i shall forget thursdays and all the other days too you are a very unwise parent mother  they laughed with each other at each other and treated her enthusiasm for miss andrews as the joke it partly was mrs verrian did not follow him up about her idol and a week or so later she was able to affect a decent surprise when he came in at the end of an afternoon and declined the cup of tea she proposed on the ground that he had been taking a cup of tea with the andrewses you have really been there  didnt you expect me to keep my promise  but i was afraid i had put a stumblingblock in the way  oh i found i could turn the consciousness you created in me into literary material and so i was rather eager to go i have got a point for my new story out of it i shall have my fellow suffer all i didnt suffer in meeting the girl he knows his mother wants him to marry i got on very well with those ladies mrs andrews is the mother of innocence but she isnt innocence she managed to talk of my story without asking about the person who wanted to anticipate the conclusion that was what you call complex she was insincere it was the only thing she wanted to talk about  i dont believe it philip but what did miss andrews talk about  well she is rather an optimistic conscience she talked about books and plays that some people do not think are quite proper i have a notion that where the point involved isnt a fact of her own experience she is not very severe about it you think that would be quite safe for me  philip i dont like your making fun of her  oh she wasnt insipid she was only limpid i really like her and as for reverencing her of course i feel that in a way she is sacred he added after a breath too sacred we none of us can expect to marry eve before the fall now perhaps we have got over wanting to  you are very perverse my dear but you will get over that  dont take away my last defence mother  verrian began to go rather regularly to the andrews house or at least he was accused of doing it by miss macroyd when very irregularly he went one day to see her how did you know it he asked  i didnt say i knew it i only wished to know it now i am satisfied i met another friend of yours on sunday she paused for him to ask who but he did not ask i see you are dying to know what friend mr bushwick  oh hes a goodfellow i wonder i dont run across him  perhaps thats because you never call on miss shirley miss macroyd waited for this to take effect but he kept a glacial surface towards her and she went on  they were walking together in the park at noon i suppose they had been to church together  verrian manifested no more than a polite interest in the fact he managed so well that he confirmed miss macroyd in a tacit conjecture she went on miss shirley was looking quite blooming for her but so was he for that matter why dont you ask if they inquired for you  i thought you would tell me without  i will tell you if he did he was very cordial in his inquiries and i had to pretend to gratify him that you were very well i implied that you came here every tuesday but your thursdays were dedicated to miss andrews  you are a clever woman miss macroyd i should never have thought of so much to say on such an uninteresting subject and miss shirley showed no curiosity  ah she is a clever woman too she showed the prettiest kind of curiosityso perfectly managed she has a studioi dont know just how she puts it to usewith a painter girl in one of those studio apartment houses on the west side the veronese i believe you must go and see her ill let you have next tuesday off tuesdays her day too  you are generosity itself miss macroyd  yes theres nothing mean about me she returned in slang rather older than she ordinarily used if youre not here next tuesday i shall know where you are  then i must take a good many tuesdays off unless i want to give myself away  oh dont do that mr verrian please or else i cant let you have any tuesday off     xxi  upon the whole verrian thought he would go to see miss shirley the next tuesday but he did not say so to miss macroyd now that he knew where the girl was all the peculiar interest she had inspired in him renewed itself it was so vivid that he could not pay his usual thursday call at miss andrewss and it filled his mind to the exclusion of the new story he had begun to write he loafed his mornings away at his club and he lunched there leaving his mother to lunch alone and was dreamily preoccupied in the evenings which he spent at home sitting at his desk with the paper before him unable to coax the thoughts from his brain to its alluring blank but restive under any attempts of hers to talk with him  in his desperation he would have gone to the theatre but the fact that the ass who rightfully called himself verrian was playing at one of them blocked his way through his indignation to all of them by saturday afternoon the tedious time had to be done something with and he decided to go and see what the ass was like  he went early and found himself in the end seat of a long row of many rows of women who were prolonging the time of keeping their hats on till custom obliged them to take them off he gave so much notice to the woman next him as to see that she was deeply veiled as well as widely hatted and then he lapsed into a dreary muse which was broken by the first strains of the overture then he diverted himself by looking round at all those ranks of women lifting their arms to take out them hatpins and dropping them to pin their hats to the seatbacks in front of them or to secure them somehow in their laps upon the whole he thought the manoeuvre graceful and pleasing he imagined a consolation in it for the women who if they were forced by public opinion to put off their charming hats would know how charmingly they did it each turned a little either her body or her head and looked in any case out of the corner of her eyes and he was phrasing it all for a scene in his story when he looked round at his neighbor to see how she had managed or was managing with her veil at the same moment she looked at him and their eyes met  mr verrian  miss shirley  the stress of their voices fell upon different parts of the sentences they uttered but did not commit either of them to a special role  how very strange we should meet here she said with pleasure in her voice do you know i have been wanting to come all winter to see this man on account of his name and to think that i should meet the other mr verrian as soon as i yielded to the temptation  i have just yielded myself verrian said i hope you dont feel punished for yielding  oh dear no it seems a reward  she did not say why it seemed so and he suggested the privilege of comparing the histrionic and the literary verrian  could there be any comparison she came back gayly  i dont know i havent seen the histrionic verrian yet  they were laughing when the curtain rose and the histrionic verrian had his innings for a long long first act when the curtain fell she turned to the literary verrian and said well  he lasted a good while verrian returned  yes didnt he she looked at the little watch in her wristlet a whole hour do you know mr verrian i am going to seem very rude i am going to leave you to settle this question of superiority i know youll be impartial i have an appointmentwith the dressmaker to be specificat halfpast four and its halfpast three now and i couldnt well leave in the middle of the next act so i will say goodbye now  dont he entreated i couldnt bear to be left alone with this dreadful double of mine let me go out with you  can i accept such selfsacrifice well  she had put on her hat and risen and he now stepped out of his place to let her pass and then followed her at the street entrance he suggested a hansom or a simple trolley  i dont know she murmured meditatively looking up the street as if that would settle it if its only halfpast three now i should have time to get home more naturally  oh and will you let me walk with you  why if youre going that way  i will say when i know which way it is  they started on their walk so blithely that they did not sadden in the retrospect of their joint experiences at mrs westangles by the time they reached the park gate at columbus circle they had come so distinctly to the end of their retrospect that she made an offer of letting him leave her a very tacit offer but unmistakable if he chose to take it he interpreted her hesitation as he chose no he said it wont be any longer if we go up through the park  she drew in her breath softly smoothing down her muff with her right hand while she kept her left in it and it will certainly be pleasanter when they were well up the path in that part of it where it deflects from the drive without approaching the street too closely and achieves something of seclusion she said  your speaking of him just now makes me want to tell you something mr verrian you would hear of it very soon anyway and i feel that it is always best to be very frank with you but youll regard it as a secret till it comes out  the currents that had been playing so warmly in and out of verrians heart turned suddenly cold he said with joyless mocking you know im used to keeping your secrets ishall feel honored im sure if you trust me with another  yes she returned pathetically you have always been faithfuleven in your wounds it was their joint tribute to the painful past and they had paid no other she was looking away from him but he knew she was aware of his hanging his head thats all over now she uttered passionately what i wanted to sayto tell youis that i am engaged to mr bushwick  he could have answered that she had no need to tell him the cold currents in and out of his heart stiffened frozenly and ceased to flow his heart itself stood still for an eternal instant it was in this instant that he said he is a fine fellow afterwards amid the wild bounding of his recovered pulse he could add i congratulate him i congratulate you both  thank you she said no one knows as i do how good he ishas been all through probably she had not meant to convey any reproach to verrian by bushwicks praise but he felt reproach in it it only happened last week you do wish me happy dont you no one knows what a winter i have had till now everything seeming to fail  she choked and did not say more he said aimlessly i am sorry  let me sit down a moment she begged and she dropped upon the bench at which she faltered and rested there as if from the exhaustion of running when she could get her breath she began again there is something else i want to tell you  she stopped and he asked to prompt her yes  thank you she answered piteously and she added with superficial inconsequence i shall always think you were very cruel  he did not pretend not to know what she meant and he said i shall always think so too i tried to revenge myself for the hurt your harmless hoax did my vanity of course i made believe at the time that i was doing an act of justice but i never was able to brave it out afterwards  but you wereyou were doing an act of justice i deserved what you said but i didnt deserve what has followed i meant no harmit was a silly prank and i have suffered for it as if it were a crime and the consequences are not ended yet i should think that if there is a moral government of the universe the judge of all the earth would know when to hold his hand and now the worst of it is to come yet she caught verrians arm as if for help  dontdont he besought her what will people think   yes yes she owned releasing him and withdrawing to the other end of the seat  but it almost drives me wild what shall i do you ought to know it is your fault you have frightened me out of daring to tell the truth  had he indeed done that verrian asked himself and it seemed to him that he had done something like it if it was so he must help her over her fear now he answered bluntly harshly you must tell him all about it  but if he wont believe me do you think he will believe me would you believe me  you have nothing to do with that there is nothing for you but to tell him the whole story you mustnt share such a secret with any one but your husband when you tell him it will cease to be my secret  yes yes  well then you must tell him unless  yes she prompted  then they were both silent looking intensely into each others eyes in that moment all else of life seemed to melt and swim away from verrian and leave him stranded upon an awful eminence confronting her  hello hello a gay voice called as if calling to them both what are you two conspiring bushwick as suddenly as if he had fallen from the sky or started up from the earth stood before them and gave a hand to eachhis right to verrian his left to miss shirley how are you verrian how are you miss shirley he mocked her in the formality of his address ive been shadowing you ever since you came into the park but i thought i wouldnt interrupt till you seemed to have got through your conversation may i ask what it was all about it seemed very absorbing from a respectful distance  very absorbing indeed miss shirley said making room for him between them sit down and let me tell you youre to be a partner in the secret  silent partner bushwick suggested  i hope youll always be silent the girl shared in his drolling she began and told the whole story to the last detail sparing neither herself nor verrian who listened as if he were some one else not concerned and kept saying to himself what courage bushwick listened as mutely with a face that to verrians eye seemed to harden from its light jocosity into a severity he had not seen in it before it was something she ended towards bushwick with a catch in her breath that you had to know  yes he answered tonelessly  and nowshe attempted a little forlorn playfulnessdont you think he gave me what i deserved  bushwick rose up and took her hand under his arm keeping his left hand upon hers  he who  mr verrian  i dont know any mr verrian come youll take cold here  he turned his back on verrian who fancied a tremor in her hat as if she would look round at him but then as if she divined bushwicks intention she did not look round and together they left him  it was days before verrian could confess himself of the fact to his mother who listened with the justice instinctive in her she still had not spoken when he ended and he said i have thought it all over and i feel that he did right he did the only thing that a man in love with her could do and i dont wonder hes in love with her yeshe stayed his mother imperativelyand such a man as he though he ground me in the dirt and stamped on me i will say it is worthy of any woman he can believe in a woman and thats the first thing thats needed to make a woman like her true i dont envy his job he was speaking selfcontradictorily irrelevantly illogically as a man thinks he went on in that way getting himself all out she isnt singlehearted but shes faithful shell never betray him now shes never given him any reason to distrust her shes the kind that can keep on straight with any one shes begun straight with she told him all that before me be cause she wanted me to knowto realizethat she had told him it took courage  mrs verrian had thought of generalizing but she seized a single point perhaps not so much courage as you think you mustnt let such bravado impose upon you philip ive no doubt she knew her ground  she took the chance of his casting her off  she knew he wouldnt she knew him and she knew you she knew that if he cast her off  mother dont say it i cant bear it  his mother did not say it or anything more then late at night she came to him are you asleep philip  asleep i  i didnt suppose you were but i have had a note today which i must answer mrs andrews has asked us to dinner on saturday philip if you could see that sweet girl as i do in all her goodness and sincerity  i think i do mother and i wouldnt be guilty of her unhappiness for the world you must decline  well perhaps you are right mrs verrian went away softly sighing as she sealed her reply to mrs andrews she sighed again and made the reflection which a mother seldom makes with regard to her son before his marriage that men do not love women for their goodness    pg editors
