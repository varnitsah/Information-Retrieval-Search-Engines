company ltd st dunstans house fetter lane fleet street ec     preface   there is a sort of fate about writing books of travel which it is impossible to escape it is vain to declare that no inducement will bribe one to do it that there is nothing new to tell and that nobody wants to read the wornout story sooner or later the deed is done and not till the book is safely shelved does peace descend upon the victim of this mysterious doom  the only way in which this affliction may be lightened to a longsuffering public is to make the work as cheerful and as short as possible with this hope the undersigned bore has abstained from giving the dimensions of any church the population of any city or description of famous places as far as in her lay but confined herself to the personal haps and mishaps adventures and experiences of her wanderers  to explain the undue prominence given to miss lavinia it should be stated that she is an old and intimate friend of the compiler of this frivolous work and therefore her views on all subjects though less valuable were easier to obtain than those of the younger and more interesting shawlstrappists

unless we cross in a gale as i did splitting sails every night and standing on our heads most of the way said amanda folding up her maps with an air of calm decision  hurrah what fun cried matilda waving a halffinished dressingcase over her head  but lavinia with one sepulchral groan fell flat upon her bed and lay there dumb with the horrors of such a voyage  just the thing for you my poor old dear think of the balmy airs of sicily the oranges the flowers then a delicious month or two at sorrento with no east winds no slush no spring cleaning we shall be as merry as grigs and get as buxom as dairymaids in a month said the sprightly amanda  you promised to go and if you back out we are lost for we must have a duenna you can lie round in europe just as well as here and i have no doubt it will do you a world of good added matilda  i shall keep my word but you will bury me in the atlantic so make up your minds to it do you suppose that i a poor usedup old invalid who cant look at a sailboat without a qualm can survive thirty days of standing on my head and thirty nights of sailsplitting as we go slamming and lurching across two or three awful oceans demanded lavinia with the energy of despair  before anyone could reply amandas little mercury appeared with a note  the wasp will not take passengers and no other fruitship sails this spring read amanda  oh dear sighed matilda  saved cried lavinia  be calm we shall go sooner or later if i buy a ship and sail her myself with which indomitable remark amanda went forth to grapple with and conquer untoward circumstances  a month of plans vicissitudes and suspense followed during which amanda strove manfully matilda suffered agonies of hope and fear and lavinia remained a passive shuttlecock waiting to be tossed wherever fates battledore chose to send her  exactly two weeks from today we sail with a party of friends in the french steamer lafayette from new york for brest will you be ready demanded amanda after a protracted wrestle with aforesaid adverse circumstances  but that is exactly what we didnt mean to do its expensive and fashionable france and not italy north and not south  thats because im in the party if you take a jonah nothing will go well leave me behind and you will have a charming trip said lavinia who had an oysterlike objection to being torn from her bed  no matter we are going live or die sink or swim and i shall expect to meet you all booted and spurred and fit for the fight april first said the unwavering amanda  a most appropriate day for three lone women to start off on a wildgoose chase after health and pleasure groaned lavinia from among her pillows  very well then i leave you now and shall expect to meet on the appointed day  if im spared answered the sufferer  ill bring her never fear added the sanguine mat as she rattled the trays out of an immense trunk  how they ever did it no one knows but in a week everything was ready and the sisters had nothing left to do but to sit and receive the presents that showered upon them from all quarters how kind everyone was to be sure six fine dressingcases arrived and were hung upon the walls four smellingbottlesone for each nostril bedsocks rigolettes afghans lunchbaskets pocketflasks guidebooks needlecases bouquets in stacks and a great cake with their names on top in red and blue letters three inches long  friendly fingers sewed for them even the gentlemen of the houseand there were eighthad a bee and hemmed handkerchiefs for mat marked towels and one noble being actually took off his coat and packed the trunks in layers of mosaicwork wonderful to behold a supper celebrated the last evening and even the doleful lavinia touched by such kindness emerged from her slough of despond and electrified the ball by dancing a jig with great spirit and grace  devoted beings were up at dawn to share the early breakfast lug trunks fly up and down with last messages cheer heartily as the carriage drove off and then adjourn en masse to the station there to shake hands all round once more and wave and wring handkerchiefs as the train at last bore the jocund mat and the resigned lavinia toward the trystingplace and amanda  all along the route more friends kept bursting into the cars as they stopped at different places more gifts more handshakes and kisses more good wishes and kind prophecies till at last in a chaos of smiles tears smellingbottles luncheon cloaks books and footwarmers the travellers left the last friendly face behind and steamed away to new york  how delicious this is cried the untravelled matilda as they stepped upon the deck of the lafayette and she sniffed the shippy fragrance that caused lavinia to gasp and answer darkly  wait till tomorrow  while mat surveyed the steamer under the care of devoted being no 10 who appeared to see them off lavinia arranged the stateroom stowing away all useless gear and laying forth dressinggowns slippers pockethandkerchiefs with an anguished smile she had crossed the ocean twice and was a wiser sadder woman for it at eight she turned in and ten minutes later amanda came aboard with a flock of gay friends but no temptations of the flesh could lure the wary spinster from her den for the night was rough and cold and the steamer a babel of confusion  its perfectly delightful i wish youd been there livy we had supper and songs and funny stories and all sorts of larks there are quantities of nice people aboard and we shall have a perfectly splendid trip i shall be up bright and early put on my scarlet stockings my new boots and pretty seasuit and go in for a jolly day said the ardent matilda as she came skipping down at midnight and fell asleep full of rosy visions of the joys of a        life on the ocean wave   deluded child sighed lavinia closing her dizzy eyes upon the swaying garments on the wall and feebly wishing she had hung herself along with them  in the gray dawn she was awakened by sounds of woe and peering forth beheld the festive matilda with one red stocking on and one off her blonde locks wildly dishevelled her face of a pale green and her hands clasping lemons cologne and salts as she lay with her brow upon the cool marble of the toilettable  how do you like it dear asked the unfeeling lavinia  oh what is it i feel as if i was dying if somebody would only stop the swing one minute is it seasickness its awful but it will do me good oh yes i hope so ive tried everything and feel worse and worse hold me save me oh i wish i hadnt come  shipmates ahoy how are you my loves and amanda appeared rosy calm and gay with her peajacket on skirts close reefed hat well to windward and everything taut and shipshape for she was a fine sailor and never missed a meal  wails greeted her and faint inquiries as to the state of things in the upper world  blowing a gale rain hail and snowvery dirty weather and we are flying off the coast in fine style was the cheerful reply  have we split any sails asked lavinia not daring to open her eyes  dozens i dare say shipping seas every five minutes all the passengers ill but me and every prospect of a northeaster all the way over continued the lively amanda lurching briskly about the passage with her hands in her pockets  matilda dropped her lemons and her bottles to wring her hands and lavinia softly murmured        lord what fools we mortals be      that we ever go to sea   breakfast ladies cried the pretty french stewardess prancing in with teacups bowls of gruel and piles of toast balanced in some miraculous manner all over her arms  oh take it away i shall never eat again moaned matilda clinging frantically to the marble as the waterpitcher went down the middle with a hairbrush and all the boots and shoes had a grand promenade round the room  dont speak to me dont look at me dont even think of me for three days at least go and enjoy yourself and leave us to our doom with which tragical remark lavinia drew her curtains and was seen no more  great heavens what a week that was rain wind fog creak pitch toss noise smells cold broken sleep by day woe in every variety by night food and drink a delusion and a snare society an affliction life a burden death a faroff blessing not to be had at any price slowly slowly the victims emerge from the lower depths of gloom feebly smile faintly joke pick fearfully but wistfully at oncerejected dishes talk about getting up but dont do it read a little look at their sallow countenances in handglasses and speculate upon the good effects of travel upon the constitution then they suddenly become daring gay and social rise adorn themselves pervade the cabins sniff the odours of engine and kitchen without qualms play games go to table and just as the voyage is over begin to enjoy it  alas for poor lavinia no such resurrection was possible for her long after mat had bravely donned the scarlet hose cocked up her beaver and gone forth to festive scenes her shipmate remained below in chrysalis state fed by faithful marie visited by the evercheerful amanda and enlivened by notes and messages from fellowsufferers in faroff cells  mr and mrs harry walmars jun called and had private theatricals in the passage driedginger parties were held about the invalids berth poems were composed and conundrums circulated a little newspaper was concocted replete with wit and spirit by these secluded ladies and called the sherald to distinguish it from the herald got up by sundry gentlemen whose shining hours were devoted to flirtation cards and wine  perfect gentlemen i assure you my dear for drunk or sober they wear yellow kids from morning till night smoke the best cigars and dance divinely as mrs twaddle said sitting erect in the saloon shrouded in fur and velvet with five diamondrings well displayed as she recounted the diseases she had enjoyed and did the honours of a remarkable workbasket containing eight different sorts of scissors  we shall be in tomorrow so youd better be digging up the treasures you have buried you old magpie said mat appearing to the pensive livy on the eleventh day  the sun is out come on deck and help us get up the last edition of our paper how will this do queryif steamers are named the asia the russia and the scotia why not call one the nausea added amanda popping her head into the den lavinia threw a pillow at her but the undaunted joker continued  also this financialthis being a feminine paper gold is no longer at pa but at ma  good add this argument in favour of the superiority of womenthe sluggard was not told to go to his uncle  thank you and amanda departed to twine with her fortythird bosom friend while lavinia disinterred from holes and corners of her berth money nuts and raisins books biscuits and literary efforts much the worse for deluges of soap and daubs of butter  the cry of land on the morrow caused passengers unseen before to appear like worms after a shower all heroically did up their back hair put on their best suits and walked forth with the delusive hope that no one would know how ill they had been  a french marquis with a sickly little son whose diet of fried potatoes and sour wine accounted for his having the temper of a young fiend appeared and were made much of by dear titleloving americans  a spanish operasinger stout saffroncoloured and imperious likewise emerged from obscurity with a meek little husband who waited on her like a servant and a big bald parrot who swore like a trooper  several nuns languished in corners of the saloon surveying the vanities of life with interest and telling their beads devoutly when they saw anyone looking at them  a mysterious lady in green velvet with many diamonds and a shabby speechless companion sailed about the ship regardless of the rumours told of herdeserted husbands stolen jewellery lovers waiting on the other side and many equally pleasant little tales  the gentlemen with orange gloves and coppercoloured noses got themselves up in the most superb style though few were going to land at brest and took tender farewells of such ladies as did each professing desolation and despair at the termination of a twelve days flirtation  i am not fond of dirt but i could kneel down and kiss this mud so grateful am i to feel solid ground under my feet after leading the life of a fly for so long said lavinia with emotion as the three trudged up the wharf at brest into a sort of barn which served for a customhouse  now let each sit upon her luggage and clamour till some one comes and examines it else it will get whisked away heaven only knows where ordered amanda who was the leader in right of her knowledge of tongues  each perched accordingly on her one big trunk and tried to clamour but nothing came of it save loss of time and temper for no one paid the slightest heed to them and it was maddening to see trunk after trunk passed and sent off followed by its rejoicing owner especially hard to bear was the sight of the greenvelvet sinner who with a smile or two won the sternest official to pass her five trunks without turning a key and sailed away with a scornful glance at the virtuous three planted on their property and feebly beckoning for help  i shall bear this no longer mat sit there and guard the small things while you and i livy charge boldly among these imbeciles and drag them to their duty and amanda marched away to clutch a cockaded victim by the shoulder with an aweinspiring countenance  lavinia picked out a feeble gray officer and dogged him like an indian smiling affably and pointing to her luggage with a persistent mildness that nearly drove the poor man mad  no matter where he went or what he did no matter how thick the crowd about him or how loud the din still like a relentless ghost that mild old lady was ever at his side mutely pointing and affably smiling of course he gave in lifted one tray saw much flannel nearly blew his venerable nose off sniffing at one suspicious bottle and slamming down the lid scrawled a mysterious cross bowed and fled  proudly returning to amanda the victorious one found her friend in a high state of indignation for no officer there would touch her trunk because some american express had put little leaden stamps here and there for some unknown purpose not even in her best french could the irate lady make the thickheaded men understand that it was not a high crime against the nation to undo a strap till some superior officer arrived to take the responsibility of so rash a step  if they had comprehended the dire threats the personal remarks and unmitigated scorn of those three fair travellers the bluecoated imbeciles would have been reduced to submission fortunately the great man came in time to save them from utter rout for the ladies were just trying to decide whether to go and leave the luggage to its fate or to haul it forth and depart vi et armis when a stout old party came saw said it is nothing pass the trunk a thousand pardons madame and peace was restored  instantly the porters who till then had stood back eyeing the innocent black ark as if it was an infernal machine liable to explode at a touch threw themselves upon it bore it forth and heaving it atop of an omnibus returned to demand vast sums for having waited so long  then was amanda sublime then did her comrades for the first time learn the magnitude of her powers and realise the treasure they possessed stowing matilda and the smaller traps in the bus and saying to lavinia stand by me this dauntless maid faced one dozen bluebloused blackbearded vociferous demonstrative frenchmen and calmly offering the proper sum refused to add one sou more  vainly the drivers perjured themselves in behalf of the porters vainly the guard looked on with imposing uniforms and impertinent observations vainly mat cried imploringly pay anything and let us get off before there is a mobstill the indomitable amanda held forth the honest franc and when no one would take it laid it on the post and entering the omnibus drove calmly away  what should we do without you sighed lavinia with fervent gratitude  be cheated right and left and never know it dear responded amanda preparing for another fight with the omnibusdriver  and she had it for unwarned by the fate of the porters this shortsighted man insisted on carrying the ladies to a dirty little hotel to dine though expressly ordered to go at once to the station nothing would induce them to alight though the landlord came out in person and begged them to do so and after a protracted struggle and a drive all over the town they finally reached the depôt  here another demand for double fare was promptly quenched by an appeal to the chef de station who finding that mademoiselle was wide awake crushed the driver and saw justice done  exhausted but triumphant the three at length found themselves rolling slowly towards morlaix through a green and blooming country so unlike the new england they had left behind that they rejoiced like butterflies in the sunshine     ii  brittany   after a late dinner at which their appetites were pretty effectually taken away by seeing dishes of snails passed round and eaten like nuts with large pins to pick out the squirming meat a nights rest somewhat disturbed by the incessant clatter of sabots in the marketplace and a breakfast rendered merry by being served by a garçon whom dickens would have immortalised our travellers went on to caulnesdinan  here began their adventures properly speaking they were obliged to drive fourteen miles to dinan in a ramshackle carriage drawn by three fierce little horses with their tails done up in braided chignons and driven by a humpback this elegant equipage was likewise occupied by a sleepy old priest who smoked his pipe without stopping the whole way also by a large loquacious beery man who talked incessantly informing the company that he was a friend of victor hugo a child of nature aged sixty and obliged to drink much ale because it went to his head and gave him commercial ideas  if it had given him no others it would have done well but after each draught and he took many this child of nature became so friendly that even the free and easy americans were abashed matilda quailed before the languishing glances he gave her and tied her head up like a bundle in a thick veil the scandalised lavinia informing him that she did not understand french assumed the demeanour of a griffin and glared stonily into space when she was not dislocating her neck trying to see if the topheavy luggage had not tumbled off behind  poor amanda was thus left a prey to the beery one for having at first courteously responded to his paternal remarks and expressed an interest in the state of france she could not drop the conversation all at once even when the friend of victor hugo became so disagreeable that it is to be hoped the poet has not many such he recited poems he sung songs he made tender confidences and finished by pressing the hand of mademoiselle to his lips on being told that such demonstrations were not permitted to strangers in america he beat his breast and cried out my god so beautiful and so cold you do not comprehend that i am but a child pardon and smile again i conjure you  but mademoiselle would not smile and folding her hands in her cloak appeared to slumber whereat the grayheaded infant groaned pathetically cast his eyes heavenward and drank more ale muttering to himself and shaking his head as if his emotions could not be entirely suppressed  these proceedings caused lavinia to keep her eye on him being prepared for any outbreak from a bullet all round to proposals to both her charges at once  with this smouldering bombshell inside and the firm conviction that one if not all the trunks were lying in the dust some miles behind it may be inferred that duenna livy did not enjoy that breakneck drive lurching and bumping up hill and down with nothing between them and destruction apparently but the little humpback who drove recklessly  in this style they rattled up to the porte de brest feeling that they had reached dinan only by the grace of god as the beery man expressed it when he bowed and vanished still oppressed with the gloomy discovery that american women did not appreciate him  while amanda made inquiries at an office and matilda had raptures over the massive archway crowned with yellow flowers lavinia was edified by a new example of womans right to labour  close by was a clean rosy old woman whose unusual occupation attracted our spinsters attention whisking off the wheels of a diligence the old lady greased them one by one and put them on again with the skill and speed of a regular blacksmith and then began to pile many parcels into a char apparently waiting for them  she was a brisk cheery old soul with the colour of a winterapple in her face plenty of fire in her quick black eyes and a mouthful of fine teeth though she must have been sixty she was dressed in the costume of the place a linen cap with several sharp gables to it a gay kerchief over her shoulders a blue woollen gown short enough to display a pair of sturdy feet and legs in neat shoes with bunches of ribbons on the instep and black hose a gray apron with pockets and a bib finished her off making a very sensible as well as picturesque costume  she was still hard at it when a big boy appeared and began to heave the trunks into another char but gave out at the second which was large instantly the brisk old woman put him aside hoisted in the big boxes without help and catching up the shafts of the heavily laden cart trotted away with it at a pace which caused the americans who prided themselves on their muscle to stare after her in blank amazement  when next seen she was toiling up a steep street still ahead of the lazy boy who slowly followed with the lighter load it did not suit lavinias ideas of the fitness of things to have an old woman trundle three heavy trunks while she herself carried nothing but a parasol and she would certainly have lent a hand if the vigorous creature had not gone at such a pace that it was impossible to overtake her till she backed her cart up before a door in most scientific style and with a bow a smile and a courteous wave of the hand informed them that here the ladies would behold the excellent madame c  they did behold and also receive a most cordial welcome from the good lady who not only embraced them with effusion but turned her house upside down for their accommodation merely because they came recommended to her hospitality by a former lodger who had won her kind old heart  while she purred over them the luggage was being bumped upstairs the old woman shouldering trunk after trunk and trudging up two steep flights in the most marvellous way but best of all was her surprise and gratitude on receiving a larger fee than usual for the ladies were much interested in this dear old hercules in a cap of seven gables  when she had blessed them all round and trotted briskly away with her carts madame c informed the newcomers that the worthy soul was a widow with many children whom she brought up excellently supporting them by acting as porter at the hotel her strength was wonderful and she was very proud of itfinding no work too hard yet always neat cheery and active asking no help and literally earning her daily bread by the sweat of her brow the ladies often saw her afterward always trotting and tugging smiling and content as if some unseen hands kept well greased the wheels of her own diligence which carried such a heavy load and never broke down  miss lavinia being interested in womans rights and wrongs was much impressed by the new revelations of the capabilities of her sex and soon ceased to be surprised at any demonstration of feminine strength skill and independence for everywhere the women took the lead  they not only kept house reared children and knit every imaginable garment the human frame can wear but kept the shops and the markets tilled the gardens cleaned the streets and bought and sold cattle leaving the men free to enjoy the only pursuits they seemed inclined to followbreaking horses mending roads and getting drunk  the markets seemed entirely in the hands of the women and lively scenes they presented to unaccustomed eyes especially the pigmarket held every week in the square before madame cs house at dawn the squealing began and was kept up till sunset the carts came in from all the neighbouring hamlets with tubs full of infant pigs over which the women watched with maternal care till they were safely deposited among the rows of tubs that stood along the walk facing anne of bretaignes grey old tower and the pleasant promenade which was once the fosse about the city walls  here madame would seat herself and knit briskly till a purchaser applied when she would drop her work dive among the pink innocents and hold one up by its unhappy leg undisturbed by its doleful cries while she settled its price with a bluegowned whitecapped neighbour as sharpwitted and shrilltongued as herself if the bargain was struck they slapped their hands together in a peculiar way and the new owner clapped her purchase into a mealbag slung it over her shoulder and departed with her squirming squealing treasure as calmly as a boston lady with a satchel full of ribbons and gloves  more mature pigs came to market on their own legs and very long feeble legs they were for a more unsightly beast than a breton pig was never seen out of a toy noahs ark tall thin highbacked and sharpnosed these porcine victims tottered to their doom with dismal wailings and not a vestige of spirit till the trials and excitement of the day goaded them to rebellion when their antics furnished fun for the public miss livy observed that the women could manage the pigs when men failed entirely the latter hustled lugged or lashed unmercifully and unsuccessfully the former with that fine tact which helps them to lead nobler animals than pigs would soothe sympathise coax and gently beguile the poor beasts or devise ways of mitigating their bewilderment and woe which did honour to the sex and triumphantly illustrated the power of moral suasion  one amiable lady who had purchased two small pigs and a coop full of fowls attempted to carry them all on one donkey but the piggies rebelled lustily in the bags the ducks remonstrated against their unquiet neighbours and the donkey indignantly refused to stir a step till the unseemly uproar was calmed but the bretonne was equal to the occasion for after a pause of meditation she solved the problem by tying the bags round the necks of the pigs so that they could enjoy the prospect this appeased them at once and produced a general lull for when the pigs stopped squealing the ducks stopped quacking the donkey ceased his bray and the party moved on in dignified silence with the youthful pigs one black one white serenely regarding life from their bags  another time a woman leading a newlybought cow came through the square where the noise alarmed the beast so much that she became unruly and pranced in a most dangerous manner miss livy hung out of the window breathless with interest and ready to fly with brandy and bandages at a minutes notice for it seemed inevitable that the woman would be tossed up among the lindens before the cow was conquered the few men who were lounging about stood with their hands in their pockets watching the struggle without offering to help till the cow scooped the lady up on her horns ready for a toss livy shrieked but madame just held on kicking so vigorously that the cow was glad to set her down when instead of fainting she coolly informed the men who seeing her danger had approached that she could arrange her cow for herself and did not want any help which she proved by tying a big blue handkerchief over the animals eyes producing instant docility and then she was led away by her flushed but triumphant mistress who calmly settled her cap and took a pinch of snuff to refresh herself after a scuffle which would have annihilated most women  when madame cs wood was put in the newcomers were interested in watching the job for it was done in a truly bretonesque manner it arrived in several odd carts each drawn by four great horses with two men to each team and as the carts were clumsy the horses wild and the men stupid the square presented a lively spectacle at one time there were three carts twelve horses and six men all in a snarl while a dozen women stood at their doors and gave advice one was washing a lettuce another dressing her baby a third twirling her distaff and a fourth with her little bowl of soup which she ate in public while gesticulating so frantically that her sabots clattered on the stones  the horses had a free fight and the men swore and shouted in vain till the lady with the baby suddenly went to the rescue planting the naked cherub on the doorstep this energetic matron charged in among the rampant animals and by some magic touch untangled the teams quieted the most fractious a big grey brute prancing like a mad elephant then returned to her baby who was placidly eating dirt and with a polite voilà messieurs she whipped little jean into his shirt while the men sat down to smoke  it took two deliberate men nearly a week to split the gnarled logs and one brisk woman carried them into the cellar and piled them neatly the men stopped about once an hour to smoke drink cider or rest the woman worked steadily from morning till night only pausing at noon for a bit of bread and the soup good coste sent out to her the men got two francs a day the woman half a franc and as nothing was taken out of it for wine or tobacco her ten cents probably went further than their forty  this same capable lady used to come to market with a baby on one arm a basket of fruit on the other leading a pig driving a donkey and surrounded by sheep while her head bore a pannier of vegetables and her hands spun busily with a distaff how she ever got on with these trifling incumbrances was a mystery but there she was busy placid and smiling in the midst of the crowd and at night went home with her shopping well content  the washerwomen were among the happiest of these happy souls and nowhere were seen prettier pictures than they made clustered round the fountains or tanks by the way scrubbing slapping singing and gossiping as they washed or spread their linen on the green hedges and daisied grass in the bright spring weather one envied the cheery faces under the queer caps the stout arms that scrubbed all day and were not too tired to carry home some chubby jean or little marie when night came and most of all the contented hearts in the broad bosoms under the white kerchiefs for no complaint did one hear from these hardworking happy women the same brave spirit seems to possess them now as that which carried them heroically to their fate in the revolution when hundreds of mothers and children were shot at nantes and died without a murmur  but of all the friends the strangers made among them they liked old mère oudon besta shrivelled leaf of a woman who at ninetytwo still supported her old husband of ninetyeight he was nearly helpless and lay in bed most of the time smoking while she peeled willows at a sou a day trudged up and down with herbs cresses or any little thing she could find to sell very proud was she of her master his great age his senses still quite perfect and most of all his strength for now and then the old tyrant left his bed to beat her which token of conjugal regard she seemed to enjoy as a relic of early days and a proof that he would long be spared to her  she kept him exquisitely neat and if anyone gave her a plate of food a little snuff or any small comfort for her patient old age she took it straight to the master and found a double happiness in giving and seeing him enjoy it  she had but one eye her amiable husband having put out the other once on a time as she was leading him home tipsy from market the kind soul bore no malice and always made light of it when forced to tell how the affliction befell her  my yvon was so gay in his young days truly yes a fine man and now most beautiful to see in his clean bed with the new pipe that mademoiselle sent him come then and behold him my superb master who at ninetyeight has still this strength so wonderful  the ladies never cared to see him more than once but often met the truly beautiful old wife as she toiled to and fro finding her faithful love more wonderful than his strength and feeling sure that when she lies at last on her clean bed some good angel will repay these ninetytwo hard years with the youth and beauty happiness and rest which nothing can destroy  not only did the women manage the affairs of this world but had more influence than men with the good powers of heaven a long drought parched france that year and even fertile brittany suffered more than once processions of women led by priests poured through the gates to go to the croix du saint esprit and pray for rain  why dont the men go also miss livy asked  ah they pray to the virgin and she listens best to women was the answer  she certainly seemed to do so for gracious showers soon fell and the little gardens bloomed freshly where the mothers hard hands had planted cabbages onions and potatoes to feed the children through the long winter  nor were these the only tasks the women did the good ladies had a hospital and a neater cheerier place was never seen few invalids but many old people sitting in the sunny gardens or at work in the clean rooms la garaye is in ruins now but the memory of its gentle lady still lives and is preserved in this benevolent institution for the sick the old and poor  a school for girls was kept by the good nuns and the streets at certain hours were full of little damsels with round caps on their braided hair queer long gowns of blue white aprons and handkerchiefs who went clattering by in their wooden shoes bobbing little curtsies to their friends and readily answering any questions inquisitive strangers asked them they learned to read write sew and say the catechism also to sing for often as the ladies passed the little chapel of our lady a chorus of sweet young voices came to us making the flowery garden behind the church of st sauveur a favourite restingplace  in endeavouring to account for the freedom of the women here it was decided that it was owing to anne of brittany the gentle and generous duchesse to whom her husband louis xii allowed the uncontrolled government of the duchy relics of the fière bretonne as louis called her are still treasured everywhere and it was pleasant to know not only that she was an accomplished woman writing tender letters in latin verse to her husband but also a wise and just princess to her people showing herself by spirit and independence to be the most worthy of all her race to wear the ducal crown so three cheers for good duchesse anne and long life to the hardy happy women of brittany  while miss lavinia was making these observations and moralizing upon them the younger ladies were enjoying discoveries and experiences more to their tastes  they had not been in the house half a day before madame c informed them that mademoiselle the so charming miss whom they beheld at dinner was to be married very soon and they should have the rapture of witnessing a wedding the most beautiful  they welcomed the prospect with pleasure for dinan is not a whirl of gaiety at the best of times and that spring the drought rumours of war and fears of smallpox cast a shadow upon the sunny little town so they surveyed mademoiselle pelagie with interest and longed to behold the happy man who was to be blessed with the hand of this little yellowfaced girl with red eyes dirty hands and a frizzled crop so like a wig they never could make up their minds that it was not  madame the mamma a buxom comely widow who breakfasted in black moire with a diadem of glossy braids on her sleek head and many jet ornaments rattling and glistening about her person informed them with voluble affability of the whole affair  my brother m le président had arranged the marriage pelagie was twenty and beautiful as you behold it was time to establish her mon dieu yes though my heart is lacerated to lose my angel i consent i conduct her to a ball that she may be seen by the young man whose parents desire that he should espouse my infant he beholds her he says great heavens i adore her my father i consent he is presented to me we converse she regards him with the angelic modesty of a young girl but speaks not i approve the parents meet it is arranged and jules is betrothed to my pelagie they have not met since but next week he comes for the marriage and he will be permitted to address her in my presence ah yes your customs are not as ours and to us seem of a deplorable freedom pardon that i say it  on inquiring how pelagie regarded her future lord they found that she thought very little about him but was absorbed in her trousseau which she proudly displayed to those accustomed to see and hear of american outfits with their lavish profusion and extravagant elegance poor little pelagies modest stores were not at all imposing half a dozen pretty dresses from paris several amazing hats all rosebuds lace and blue ribbon a good deal of embroidery and a few prophetic capscompleted the outfit  one treasure however she was never tired of displayinga gift from julesa camelshair shawl in a black walnut case on which was carved the clomadoc arms a set of pearls were also from the bridegroom but the shawl was her pride for married women alone could wear such and she seemed to think this right of more importance than any the weddingring could confer upon her  to the young ladies both of whom had known many of the romantic experiences which befall comely american girls the idea of marrying a man whom they had only seen twice seemed horrible and to have but one week of courtship and that in mammas presence was simply an insult and a wrong which they would not bear to think of  but pelagie seemed quite content and brooded over her finery like a true frenchwoman showing very little interest in her jules and only anxious for the time to come when she could wear her shawl and be addressed as madame  while waiting for the grand event the girls amused themselves with gaston the brother of the brideelect he was a languid goodlooking youth of threeandtwenty who assumed blasé airs and attitudinized for their benefit sometimes he was lost in fits of byronic gloom when he frowned over his coffee sighed gustily and clutched his brow regardless of the curls usually in ambrosial order the damsels instead of being impressed by this display of inward agony only laughed at him and soon rallied him out of his heroics then he would try another plan and become all devotion presenting green tulips ancient coins early fruit or sketches of his own so very small that the design was quite obscure if these delicate attentions failed to touch the stony hearts of the blonde americans he would air his entire wardrobe appearing before them one day in full breton costume of white cloth embroidered in gay silks buckled shoes and hat adorned with streaming ribbons and flowers quite arcadian was gaston in this attire and very effective on the croquet ground where sundry english families disported themselves on certain afternoons another time he would get himself up like a parisian dandy bound for a ride in the bois de boulogne and mounting with much difficulty a rampant horse he would caracole about the place st louis to the great delight of the natives  but this proved a failure for one of the fair but cruel strangers donned hat and habit and entirely eclipsed his glories by galloping about the country like an amazon the only time gaston played escort she was nearly the death of him for he seldom did more than amble a mile or two and a hard trot of some six or eight miles reduced our adonis to such a state of exhaustion that he fell into his mothers arms on dismounting and was borne away to bed with much lamentation  after that he contented himself with coming to show himself in full dress whenever he went to a party and as that was nearly every other evening they soon got accustomed to hearing a tap at their door and beholding the comely youth in all the bravery of glossy broadcloth a lavish shirtbosom miraculous tie primrose gloves varnished shoes and curls and moustache anointed and perfumed in the most exquisite style he would bow and say bon soir then stand to be admired with the artless satisfaction of a child after which he would smile complacently wave his crush hat and depart with a flourish  dear dandified vain gaston his great desire was to go to paris and when the war came he had his wish but found sterner work to do than to dress and dance and languish at the feet of ladies i hope it made a man of him and fancy it did for the french fight well and suffer bravely for the country they love in their melodramatic fashion  as the day approached for the advent of the bridegroom great excitement prevailed in the quiet household madame c and her handmaid dear old marie cackled and bustled like a pair of important hens madame f the widow lived at the milliners so to speak and had several dress rehearsals for her own satisfaction gaston mounted guard over his sister lest some enamoured man should rend her from them ere her jules could secure the prize and pelagie placidly ate and slept kept her hair in crimpingpins from morning till night wore out her old clothes and whiled away the time munching bonbons and displaying her shawl  mercy on us i should feel like a lamb being fattened for the sacrifice if i were in her place cried one of the freeborn american citizenesses with an air of unmitigated scorn for french ways of conducting this interesting ceremony  i should feel like a galleyslave said the other for she cant go anywhere without gaston or mamma at her elbow only yesterday she went into a shop alone while gaston waited at the door and when she told it at home as a great exploit all the ladies shrieked with horror at the idea and mamma said wringing her hands mon dieu but they will think thou art a married woman for it is inconceivable that any girl should do so bold a thing and pelagie wept and implored them not to tell jules lest he should discard her  here the americans all groaned over the pathetic absurdity of the whole affair and wondered with unrighteous glee what the decorous ladies below would say to some of their pranks at home but fearing that m le président might feel it his duty to eject them from the town as dangerous persons they shrouded their past sins in the most discreet silence and assumed their primmest demeanour in public  he has come look quick girls cried lavinia as a carriage stopped at the door and a rushing sound as of many agitated skirts was heard in the hall three heads peeped from the window of the blue parlour and three pairs of curious eyes were rewarded by a sight of the bridegroom as he alighted  such a little man such a fierce moustache such a dignified strut and such an imposing uniform as he wore for jules gustave adolphe marie clomadoc was a colonel in some regiment stationed at boulogne out he skipped in he marched and peeping over the banisters they saw him salute madame f with a stately kiss on the hand then escort her up to her salon bowing loftily and twisting his tawny moustache with an air that gave him the effect of being six feet in height and broad in proportion  how he greeted his fiancée they knew not but the murmur of voices came from the room in steady flow for hours and gaston flew in and out with an air of immense importance  at dinner the strangers were proudly presented to m le colonel and received affable bows from the little man who flattered himself that he could talk english and insisted on speaking an unknown tongue evidently wondering at their stupidity in not understanding their own language  he escorted madame down sat between her and pelagie but talked only to her while the girl sat silent and ate her dinner with an appetite which no emotion could diminish it was very funny to see the small warrior do his wooing of the daughter through the mother and the buxom widow played her part so well that an unenlightened observer would have said she was the brideelect she smiled she sighed she discoursed she coquetted and now and then plucked out her handkerchief and wept at the thought of losing the angel who was placidly gnawing bones and wiping up the gravy on her plate with bits of bread  jules responded with spirit talked jested quoted poetry paid compliments right and left and now and then passed the salt filled a glass or offered a napkin to his fiancée with a french shrug and a tender glance  after dinner madame f begged him to recite one of his poems for it appeared this allaccomplished man was beloved of the muse and twanged the lyre as well as wielded the sword with much persuasion and many modest apologies jules at length consented took his place upon the rug thrust one hand into his bosom turned up his eyes and in a tremendous voice declaimed a pensive poem of some twenty stanzas called adieu to my past  the poets friends listened with rapt countenances and frequent bursts of emotion or applause but the americans suffered agonies for the whole thing was so absurdly melodramatic that it was with great difficulty they kept themselves from explosions of laughter when the little man dropped his voice to a hoarse whisper in bidding adieu to the lost loves of his youth tenderhearted old c sobbed in her napkin while livy only saved herself from hysterics by drinking a glass of water and pelagie ate sugar with her round eyes fixed on her lovers face without the slightest expression whatever  when the poet mourned his blighted hopes and asked wildly of all the elements if he should live or die gaston cast reproachful glances at the alien charmer who had nipped his passion in the bud and when jules gave a sudden start slapped his brow and declared that he would live for his country old marie choked in her coffee while madame f clapped her fat hands and cried it is sublime  the poem closed there and the providential appearance of their donkeys gave the ladies an excuse for retiring to their room where they laughed till they could laugh no more  each meal was as good as a play and every glimpse they had of the little pair gave fresh food for mirth everything was so formal and polite so utterly unlike the freeandeasy customs of their native land that they were kept in alternate states of indignation and amusement the whole time jules never was alone with his pelagie for an instant such a breach of etiquette would have shocked the entire town in the walks and drives which the family took together madame was always at the colonels side while gaston escorted his sister looking as if he was fast reaching a state of mind when he would give her away without a pang many guests came and went much kissing and bowing prancing and rustling went on up and down stairs stately old gentlemen called papers were signed fortunes discussed and gifts displayed pelagie went much to mass also to the barbers and the bath agitated milliners flew in and out a great load of trunks arrived from nantes where madame formerly lived and the day before the wedding a whole carriage full of clomadocs appeared and babel seemed to have come again  a great supper was given that evening and the three were banished to their own rooms where however they fared sumptuously for madame c and good old marie ate with them having no place left them but the kitchen madame c was much hurt that she had not been asked to the wedding it seemed the least madame f could do after taking possession of the house and turning its rightful owner out of every room but the attic madame c was a gentlewoman and though a meek old soul this rudeness hurt her very much she said nothing but marie fumed and scolded fiercely and proposed that the neglected ones should all go away on the weddingday and make a fête for themselves somewhere so they decided to drive to dinare enjoy the fine views of the sea and st malo dine and return at dusk leaving the house free for the wedding festivities  the day was fine and the ladies were graciously invited to behold the bride before she left for church she looked as much like a fashionplate as it was possible for a living girl to look and they dutifully kissed her on both cheeks paid their compliments and retired thanking their stars that they were not in her place  mamma was gorgeous to behold in royal purple and black lace gaston was so glossy and beruffled and begemmed that they gazed with awe upon the french adonis but the bridegroom was a sight for gods and men in full regimentals with a big sword so many orders that there was hardly room for them on his little breast and a cocked hat with a forest of feathers in which he extinguished himself at intervals how his tiny boots shone his tawny moustache bristled with importance and his golden epaulets glittered as he shrugged and pranced his honoured papa and mamma were both tall portly people beside whom the manikin looked like a child livy quite longed to see madame clomadoc take little jules on her knee and amuse him with bonbons when he got impatient at the delay of the carriage  the three peeped out of windows and over the banisters and got fine glimpses of the splendours below flocks of elegant ladies went sailing up the narrow stairs gentlemen with orders dandies wonderful to behold and a few children to play with the bridegroom as livy wickedly said adorned the hall and salon every one talked at the top of his or her voice shrieks of rapture groans of despair greeted a fine toilette or a torn glove peals of laughter from the gentlemen and shrill cries from the infants echoed through the once peaceful halls as françoise said it was truly divine  at eleven every one trooped into the carriages again how they ever got so many fulldressed people into one carriage is a mystery to this day but in they piled regardless of trains corpulency or height and coach after coach lumbered away to the church  the brides carriage could not be got very near the door so she tripped out to it leaning on her uncles arm while the devoted gaston bore her train mamma sailed after in a purple cloud and when two young damsels in arsenic green were packed in away they went leaving the bridegroom to follow  then came the catastrophe stout papa and mamma were safely in a friend of jules some six feet high shut himself up like a jackknife and with a farewell wave of the cocked hat the small bridegroom skipped in after them the coachman cracked his whip intending to dash under the arched gateway in fine style but alas the harness was old the big horses clumsy and the road half paved the traces gave way the beasts reared the big coach lurched and dismal wails arose out burst the fierce little hero of the day and the tall friend followed by instalments  great was the excitement as the natives gathered about the carriage with offers of help murmurs of sympathy and unseemly mirth on the part of the boys jules did the swearing and never were heard such big oaths as fell from the lips of this irate little man it really seemed as if he would explode with wrath he dashed the impressive cocked hat upon the stones laid his hand upon his sword tore his hair and clutched his moustache in paroxysms of despair  his bride was gone waiting in agitated suspense for him no other coach could be had as the resources of the town had been exhausted the harness was in a desperate state the men at their wits end how to mend it and time flying fast maire and priest were waiting the whole effect of the wedding was being ruined by this delay and ten thousand devils seemed to possess the awkward coachman  during the flurry papa clomadoc appeared to slumber tranquilly in the recesses of the carriage mamma endeavoured to soothe her boy with cries of tranquillize yourself my cherished son it is nothing come then and reassure papa inhale the odour of my vinaigrette it will compose your lacerated nerves my angel  but the angel wouldnt come and continued to dance and swear and slap his hat about until the damages were repaired when he flung himself exhausted into the carriage and was borne away to his bride  a lively prospect for poor pelagie what a little fiend he is spinsters for ever  with these remarks the ladies ordered their own equipage an infant omnibus much in vogue in dinan where retired army officers english or scotch drive about with their little families of eighteen or twenty one colonel newcome a gravelooking man used to come to church in a bus of this sort with nine daughters and four sons like a patriarch the strangers thought it was a boardingschool till he presented the entire flock with paternal pride as my treasures  madame c in a large leghorn bonnet trembling with yellow bows led the way with an air of lofty indifference as to what became of her house that day marie bore a big basket full of cold fowls salad and wines she also was in a new spring hat of purple which made her rosy old face look like a china aster lavinia reposed upon the other seat and the infants insisted on sharing the drivers seat up aloft that they might enjoy the prospect which freak caused flabeaus boy to beam and blush till his youthful countenance was a deep scarlet  they had a pleasant day for good old madame soon recovered her temper and beguiled the time with lively tales of her mothers trials during the revolution  marie concocted spiced drinks salad that was a thing to dream of not to tell and produced such edible treasures that her big basket seemed bottomless  the frisky damsels explored ruins ran races on the hard beach sniffed the salt breezes and astonished the natives by swarming up and down precipices as they called the rocks  that was a fatal day for flabeaus boy they never knew his name for as if the wedding had flown to his head he lost his youthful heart to one of the lively damsels who invaded his perch such tender glances as his chinablue eyes cast upon her such grins of joy as he gave when she spoke to him such feats of agility as he performed leaping down to gather flowers or hurling himself over thorny hedges to point out a dolmen or a menhir they never could remember which was which alas alas for flabeaus boy deeply was he wounded that day by the unconscious charmer who would as soon have thought of inspiring love in the bosom of the brokennosed saint by the wayside as in the heart that beat under the blue blouse  i regret to say that the infants as madame c always called miss livys charges behaved themselves with less decorum than could have been wished but the proud consciousness that they never could be disposed of as pelagie had been had such an exhilarating effect upon them that they frisked like the lambs in the field  one drove the bus in a retired spot and astonished the stout horses by the way in which she bowled them along the fine hard road the other sang college songs to the intense delight of the old ladies who admired the chants amériques so gay and to the horror of their duenna who knew what they meant a shower came up and they would remain outside so the boy put up a leathern hood and they sat inside in such a merry mood that the silent youth suddenly caught the infection and burst forth into a breton melody which he continued to drone till they got home  the house was a blaze of light when they arrived and françoise the maid came flying out to report sundry breakages and mishaps how the salad had precipitated itself downstairs dish and all how monsieur gaston was so gay so inconceivably gay that he could hardly stand and insisted on kissing her clandestinely that mademoiselle pelagie had wept much because her veil was torn and madame f had made a fresh toilette ravishing to behold would the dear ladies survey the party still at table regard them from the little window in the garden and see if it is not truly a spectacle the most superb  they did regard them and saw the bride at the head of the table eating steadily through the dessert the bridegroom reciting poems with tremendous effect gaston almost invisible behind a barricade of bottles and madame f in violet velvet diamonds plumes and lace more sleek and buxom than ever the ladies all talked at once and the gentlemen drank healths every five minutes a very french and festive scene it was for the room was small and twenty mortals were stowed therein one fat lady sat in the fireplace papa clomadoc leaned his heavy head upon the sideboard and the plump shoulders of madame f were half out of the front window but it was genteel oh i assure you yes as françoise said  how long they kept it up the weary trio did not wait to see but retired to their beds and slumbered peacefully waking only when gaston was borne up to his room chanting the marseillaise at the top of his voice  next day m and madame clomadoc jr made calls and pelagie had the joy of wearing her shawl for three days she astonished the natives by promenading with her lord in a fresh toilette each day on the fourth they all piled into a big carriage and went away to make a round of visits before the young people settled down at boulogne  the americans never thought to hear any more of pelagie but as dear old madame c wrote to them several times after they left the little story may be finished here though the sequel did not actually come till a year later  many were the sage predictions of the three as to the success of this marriageamanda approving of that style of thing matilda objecting fiercely to the entire affair and lavinia firmly believing in the good old doctrine of love as your only firm basis for so solemn a bargain  wagers were laid that the fiery little colonel would shoot some one in a jealous fit or that pelagie would elope or both charcoal themselves to death as the best way out of the predicament but none of them guessed how tragically it would really end  late in the following spring came a letter from madame c telling them that jules had gone to the war and been shot in his first battle that pelagie was with her mother again comforting herself for her loss with a still smaller jules who never saw his father and it is to be hoped did not resemble him so little pelagies brief romance ended and one would fancy that the experiences of that year would make her quite content to remain under mammas wing with no lord and master but the little son to whom she was a very tender mother  pleasant days those were in quaint old dinan for springs soft magic glorified earth and sky and a delicious sense of rest and freedom gave a charm to that quiet life legends of romance and chivalry hung about the ruins of castle and château as green and golden as the ivy and bright wallflowers that tapestried the crumbling walls and waved like banners from the turret tops lovely walks into woods starred with pale primroses and fragrant with wild hyacinths down green lanes leading to quaint cottages or over wide meadows full of pinktipped daisies and dear familiar buttercups the same all the world over  sometimes they took gay donkeydrives to visit a solemn dolmen in a gloomy pinewood with mistletoe hanging from the trees and the ghosts of ancient druids haunting the spot the cavalcade on such occasions was an imposing spectacle matilda being fond of horses likewise affected donkeys or thought she did till she tried to drive one and usually went first in a small vehicle like a chair on wheels drawn by an animal who looked about the size of a mouse when the stately mat in full array yellow parasol long whip campstool and sketchbook sat bolt upright on her perch driving in the most approved manner  the small beast after much whipping would break into a trot and go pattering over the hard white road with his long ears wagging and his tiny hoofs raising a great dust for the benefit of the other turnout just behind  in a double chair sat lavinia bundled up as usual and the amiable amanda both flushed with constant pokings and thrashings of their steed a venerable ass so like an old whitybrown hair trunk as to his body and nick bottoms mask as to his head that he was a constant source of mirth to the ladies mild and venerable as he looked however he was a most incorrigible beast and it took two immortal souls and four arms to get the ancient donkey along  vain all the appeals to his conscience pity or pride nothing but a sharp poke among his ribs a steady shower of blows on his fuzzy old back and frequent yanks of the reins produced any effect it was impossible to turn out for anything and the ladies resigned themselves to the ignominy of sitting still in the middle of the road and letting other carriages drive over or round them  on rare occasions the beast would bolt into the ditch as a vehicle drew near but usually he paused abruptly put his head down and apparently went to sleep  matilda got on better because little bernard du guesclin as she named her mouse was so very small that she could take him up and turn him round bodily when other means failed or pull him half into the chair if danger threatened in front he was a sprightly little fellow and had not yet lost all the ardour of youth or developed the fiendish obstinacy of his kind so he frequently ran little racesnow and then pranced and was not quite dead to the emotion of gratitude in return for bits of bread  truly yes the fair mat with her five feet seven inches and little bernard whose longest ear when most erect did not reach much above her waist were a sweet pair of friends and caused her mates great amusement  i must have some one to play with for i cant improve my mind all the time as mandy does or cuddle and doze like livy ive had experience with young donkeys of all sorts and i give you my word little bernie is much better fun than some ive known with shorter ears and fewer legs  thus matilda regardless of the jeers of her friends when they proposed having the small beast into the salon to beguile the tedium of a rainy day  as the summer came on picnics were introduced and gay parties would pile into and on to flabeaus small omnibus and drive off to hunandaye coétquën la bellière guingamp or some other unpronounceable but most charming spot for a day of sunshine and merrymaking  the hospitable english came out strong on these occasions with ampers of amsandwiches bottled porter and so on dont you know all in fine style even the stout doctor donned his knickerbockers and grey hose unfurled his japanese umbrella and with a pretty niece on either arm disported himself like a boy  but pleasantest of all were the daily strolls through the little town and its environs getting glimpses of breton manners and customs  the houses were usually composed of one room where near the open fire and fixed against the wall stands the bedstead or lit clos of old oak shut in by carved sliding panels often bearing an inscription or some sacred symbol the mattresses and featherbeds are so piled up that there is hardly room to creep in before it is the big chest containing the family wardrobe answering the double purpose of a seat and a step by which to ascend the lofty bed cupboards on each side often have wide shelves where the children sleep settles and a long table complete the furniture the latter often has little wells hollowed out in the top to hold the soup instead of plates over the table suspended by pulleys are two indispensable articles in a breton housea large round basket to cover the bread and a wooden frame to hold the spoons festoons of sausages hams candles onions horseshoes harness and tools all hang from the ceiling the floor is of beaten earth one narrow window lets in the light there are no outhouses and pigs and poultry mingle freely with the family  the gardens are well kept and produce quantities of fruit and vegetables the chief food of the poorer class is bread or porridge of buckwheat with cabbage soup made by pouring hot water over cabbage leaves and adding a bit of butter  they are a homeloving people and pine like the swiss if forced to leave their native land they are brave soldiers and good sailors their vices as a breton writer says are avarice contempt for women and drunkenness their virtues love of home and country resignation to the will of god loyalty to each other and hospitality their motto is en tout chemin loyauté  they are very superstitious and some of their customs are curious at new year pieces of bread and butter are thrown into the fountains and from the way in which they swim the future is foretold if the buttered side turns under it forebodes death if two pieces adhere together it is a sign of sickness and if a piece floats properly it is an assurance of long life and prosperity  girls throw pins into the fountain of saloun to tell by their manner of sinking when they will be married if the pin goes down headforemost there is little hope but if the point goes first it is a sure sign of being married that year  their veneration for healingsprings is very great and though at times forbidden by the church is still felt pounded snails worn in a bag on the neck is believed to be a cure for fever and a certain holy bell rung over the head a cure for headache if we believe in that last remedy what a ceaseless tingling that bell would keep up in america said lavinia when these facts were mentioned to her  in some towns they have in the cemetery a bonehouse or reliquary it is the custom after a certain time to dig up the bones of the dead and preserve the skulls in little square boxes like birdhouses with a heartshaped opening to show the relic within the names and dates of the deceased are inscribed outside  saint ives or yves is a favourite saint and images of him are in all churches and over many doors he was one of the remarkable characters of the thirteenth century he studied law in paris and devoted his talents to defending the poor hence he was called the poor mans advocate and so great is the confidence placed in his justice that even now when a debtor falsely denies his debt a peasant will pay twenty sous for a mass to st ives sure that the saint will cause the faithless creditor to die within the year or pay up  his truthfulness was such that he was called st yves de vérité he was the special patron of lawyers but he does not seem to be their model  the early monks taught the people to work and their motto was the cross and the plough labour and prayer they introduced apples now the principal fruit of brittany much cider is made and drank and in old times they got their wine from france in exchange for wax and honey as they were famous beekeepers great fields of buckwheat still afford food for the yellowbreeched philosophers and in many cottage gardens a row of queerly shaped hives stand in sunny nooks  these monks were the model farmers of those days and their abbeys were fine farms one had twenty piggeries of three hundred pigs each in its forests the monks also reared sheep and horses and bred fish in their ponds  many were also brewers weavers carpenters and so on evidently they lived up to their motto and laboured quite as much as they prayed and doubtless were saved by works as well as by faith  the little place du guesclin with a stumpy statue of the famous knight in the middle and chestnut trees all around was a favourite restingplace of the ladiesespecially when the weekly fair was held and booths of all sorts were raised at one end here amanda bought a remarkable jackknife which would cut nothing but her fingers matilda speculated in curious kinds of cake one sort being made into gigantic jumbles so light that they did excellently for gracehoops another sort being used by these vandals as catchalls so deep and tough were they lavinia examined the various fabrics and got bits of linen as samples also queer earthen pots and pans impossible to carry away  the church of st sauveur a dim and ancient little place with du guesclins heart buried by the side of his wife was another haunt the castle now a prison contained the armchair in which duchess anne sat and the dungeons where were crammed two thousand english prisoners of war in the last century the view from the platform of the keep was magnificent extending to mont dol and the distant sea  the sunny promenade on the fosse that goes half round the town was very charming with the old grey walls on one side and on the other the green valley with its luxuriant gardens and leafy lanes winding up to the ruined château or the undulating hills with picturesque windmills whirling on the heights  on the other side of the town from the high gardens of the church one looked down into the deeper valley of the rance with the airy viaduct striding from hill to hill and the old part of the town nestling at its base  soft and summery fertile and reposeful was the scene and the busy peasants at their work added to the charm pretty english children with breton nurses each in the costume of her native town played under the lindens all abloom with odorous flowers and alive with bees workmen came to these green places to eat the black bread and drink the thin wine that was all their dinner invalids strolled here after their baths at the little house in the rosegarden below pretty girls walked there in the twilight with longhaired lovers in knee breeches and round hats nuns in their grey gowns went to and fro from hospital and the insane asylum or charity school and the beautiful old priest sometimes went feebly by smiling paternally on his flock who rose and uncovered reverently as he passed  flowers were everywherein the gardens of the rich at the windows of the poor the stalls in the market were gay with plumy lilacs splendid tulips roses of every shade and hyacinths heavy with odour all along the borders of the river waved the blossoming grass every green bank about the mills at lehon was yellow with dandelions and the sunny heads of little children welcoming the flower of the poor even the neglected churchyard of the ruined abbey where the tombs of the stately beaumanoirs still stand was bright with cheerful daisies and blueeyed forgetmenots  the willows in the valley were covered with fragrant tassels and the old women and children sat all day on doorstones and by the wayside stripping the long white wands for basketmaking flax fields were blooming in the meadows and acres of buckwheat with its rosy stems and snowy blossoms whitened the uplands with a fair prophecy of bread for all  so garlanded about with early flowers and painted in springs softest freshest colours brittany remains for ever a pleasant picture in the memory of those who have been welcomed to its hospitable homes and found friends among its brave and loyal people     iii  france   girls i have had a scintillation in the night listen and approve said amanda coming into the room where her comrades sat upon the floor in the first stages of despair at the impossibility of getting the accumulated rubbish of three months travel into a couple of immense trunks  blessed girl you always bring a ray of light just at the darkest moment returned lavinia with a sigh of relief while matilda looked over a barricade of sketchbooks bristling with paintbrushes and added anxiously  if you could suggest how i am to work this miracle you will be a public benefactor  behold the amendment i propose began amanda perching herself on one of the arks we have decided to travel slowly and comfortably through france to switzerland stopping where we like and staying as long as we please at any place we fancy being as free as air and having all the world before us where to choose as it were  the route you have laid out is a charming one and i dont see how you can improve it said lavinia who though she was supposed to be the matron guide and protector of the younger girls was in reality nothing but a dummy used for mrs grundys sake and let the girls do just as they pleased only claiming the right to groan and moan as much as she liked when neuralgia her familiar demon claimed her for its own  one improvement remains to be made are these trunks a burden a vexation of spirit a curse demanded amanda tapping one with her carefully cherished fingertips  they are they are groaned the others regarding the monsters with abhorrence  then let us get rid of them and set out with no luggage but a few necessaries in a shawlstrap  we will we will returned the chorus  shall we burn up our rubbish or give it away asked lavinia who liked energetic measures and was ready to cast her garments to the four winds of heaven to save herself from the agonies of packing  i shall never give up my pictures nor my boots cried matilda gathering her idols to her breast in a promiscuous heap  be calm and listen returned the scintillator pack away all but the merest necessaries and we will send the trunk by express to lyons then with our travellingbags and bundles we can follow at our leisure  tis well tis well replied the chorus and they all returned to their packing which was performed in the most characteristic manner  amanda never seemed to have any clothes yet was always well and appropriately dressed so it did not take her long to lay a few garments a book or two a box of romancoin lockets scarabæ brooches and cinquecento rings likewise a swell hat and habit into her vast trunk then lock and label it in the most businesslike and thorough manner  matilda found much difficulty in reconciling paintpots and silk gowns blue hats and statuary french boots and yankee notions but order was at length produced from chaos and the young lady refreshed her weary soul by painting large red ms all over the trunk to mark it for her own  miss lavinia packed and repacked four or five times forgetting needfuls which of course were always at the very bottom at the fifth plunge into the depths her patience gave out and with a vow to be a slave no longer to her treacherous memory she tumbled every thing in performed a solemn jig on the lid till it locked then pasted large but illegible placards in every available spot and rested from her labours with every nerve in a throbbing condition  shawlstraps of the largest strongest sort were next procured and the three bundles made up with much discussion and merriment  into amandas went a volume of shakspeare of great size and weight but as indispensable as a toothbrush to its owner toilettearticles tied up in a handkerchief a few necessary garments and much paperfor amanda was inspired with poetic fire at unexpected moments also had five hundred bosom friends in answering whose epistolary gushings much stationery was consumed a pistol a massive crust of bread and an oval box containing all the dainty appliances for the culture preservation and ornamentation of the fingernails made up her store  matildas bundle consisted of sketchbooks a trifle of haberdashery a curlingstick that was always tumbling out at inopportune moments yards of blue ribbon and a campstool strapped outside in company with a japanese umbrella a gift from the stout doctor destined to be cursed in many languages by the unhappy beings into whose backs eyes and stomachs it was poked before its wanderings ended  lavinia confined herself to a choice collection of bottles and pillboxes fur boots a grey cloud and several french novelsthe solace of wakeful nights a scarlet army blanket with u s in big black letters on it enveloped her travelling medicinechest and lent a cheerful air to the sombre spinster whose black attire and hoarse voice made the sobriquet of raven most appropriate  with these imposing bundles in one hand little pouches slung over the shoulder plain travellingsuits subdued hats and resolute but benign countenances our three errant damsels set forth one bright june day to wander through france at their own sweet will not a fear assailed them for all men were civil all women friendly and the world wore its sunniest aspect not a doubt perplexed them for the gifted amanda spoke many tongues understood all sorts of money could grapple successfully with murray and bradshaw and never got into the wrong corporation when she traced a route with unerring accuracy through the mysteries of an indicator no lord and master in the shape of brother spouse or courier ordered their outgoings and incomings but liberty the most entire was theirs and they enjoyed it heartily wisely and well too for though off the grand route they behaved themselves in public as decorously as if the eyes of all prim boston were upon them and proved by their triumphant success that the unprotected might go where they liked if they conducted themselves with the courtesy and discretion of gentlewomen  how pleasant were the early sail down the ranee from dinan to st malo the comfortable breakfast in the flowery little court of hôtel franklin and the stroll afterward about the quaint old town looking at the churches buying fruit and stoutly resisting the temptations of antique jewelry displayed in the dingy shops lavinia never forgave herself however for not securing a remarkable watch and amanda sighed months afterward for a breton collar and cross of charming antiquity and ugliness  matilda boldly planted her campstool unfurled her umbrella and undaunted by the crowd of roundcapped bluebloused woodenshoed children about her began to draw the church  i intend to study architecture and to sketch all the cathedrals we see said the ardent artstudent struggling manfully with the unruly umbrella the unsavoury odours from the gutter and the garrulous crowd leaning over her shoulder peering under her hatbrim and examining all her belongings with a confiding freedom rather embarrassing  do you know what impertinent things these little scamps are saying to you asked amanda pausing in a lecture on surface drainage which she was delivering to lavinia who was vainly struggling to cram a fat wine bottle a cabbage leaf of strawberries and some remarkable cakes into the lunchbasket  no i dont and that is the advantage of not knowing any language but my own complacently replied matilda who considered all study but that of art as time wasted and made her small store of french answer admirably by talking very loud and fast and saying oui oui oui on all occasions with much gesticulation and bows and smiles of great suavity and sweetness  clear out this rabble or come back to the hotel and wait for the bus we shall have the whole town round us soon and i cant stand it said amanda who had no romantic admiration for the great unwashed  you think i cant do it voilà and rising suddenly to an unexpected height matilda waved the umbrella like a bâton cried allez in a stern voice and the children fled like chaff before the wind  you see how little is needed so dont vex me with learning your old verbs any more and matilda closed her book with an air of calm satisfaction  come home and rest it is so warm here i am fairly melted prayed lavinia who had been longing for summer and of course was not suited when she got it  now do remember one thing dont let us be gregarious we never know who we may pick up if we talk to people and stray acquaintances are sad bores sometimes granny is such a cross old dear she wont say a word to any one if she can help it but you mat cant be trusted if we meet any one who talks english so be on your guard or the peace of this party is lost said amanda impressively  we are not likely to meet any but natives in this wilderness so dont excite yourself mandy dear replied matilda who being of a social turn and an attractive presence was continually making friends to the great annoyance of her more prudent comrades  in the flowery courtyard sat the group that one meets everywhere on the continenteven in the wilds of brittany the father and mother stout tired and rather subdued by the newness of things the son young america personified loud important and inquisitive the daughter pretty affected and overdressed all on the lookout for adventures and titles fellowcountrymen to impress and foreigners eager to get the better of them  seeing the peril from afar amanda buried herself in murray to read up the tomb of chateaubriand the tides population and any other useful bit of history for amanda was a thrifty soul and        gathered honey all the day      from every opening flower   lavinia finding the court damp shrouded herself in the grey cloud put her feet on the red bundle and fortified herself with a turners pill  but matilda guileless girl roamed to and fro patted the horses at the gate picked flowers that no french hand would have dared to touch and studied the effect of light and shade on the red head of the garçon who gazed sentimentally at the blonde mees as he artlessly watered the wine for dinner  the americans had their eye upon her and felt that though the others might be forbidding english women this one could be made to talk so they pounced upon their prey to the dismay of her mates and proceeded to ask fifty questions to the minute poor mat glad to hear the sound of her native tongue fell into the snare and grew more confiding every moment  she is telling the family history whispered lavinia in a tone of despair  now they are asking where we came from added amanda casting down her book in agony  wink at her sighed lavinia  call to her groaned amanda as they heard their treasured secret betrayed and the enemy clamouring for further information about this charming trip  matilda bring me my shawl commanded the dowager  come and see if you dont think we had better go direct to tours said the wary amanda hoping to put the enemy off the track  the victim came and vials of wrath were poured upon her head in one unceasing flow till the omnibus started and the ladies were appeased by finding that the enemy did not follow  promise that you wont talk to any but natives or i decline to lead this expedition said amanda firmly  i promise returned mat with penitent meekness  now weve got her croaked the raven for she will have to learn french or hold her tongue  the language of the eye remains to me and i am a proficient in that maam said mat roused by these efforts to deny her the right of free speech  you are welcome to it dear and amanda departed to buy tickets and despatch the trunks with secret misgivings that they would never be found again  now we are fairly started with no more weighing of luggage fussing over checks or packing of traps to afflict us what a heavenly sense of freedom it gives one to have nothing but an independent shawlstrap said matilda as they settled themselves in a vacant car and stowed away the bundles  what a jolly day that was to be sure whether it was the air the good coffee or the liberty certain it is that three merrier maids never travelled from st malo to le mans on a summers day even the raven forgot her woes and became so exhilarated that she smashed her bromide bottle out of the window declaring herself cured and tried to sing hail columbia in a voice like an asthmatic bagpipe  mat amused herself and her comrades by picking up the different articles that kept tumbling down on her head from her badly built bundle while amanda scintillated to such an extent that the others laughed themselves into hysterics and lay exhausted prone upon the seats  they ate drank sung gossiped slept read and revelled till another passenger got in when propriety clothed them as with a garment and the mirthful damsels became three studious statues  the newcomer was a little priest so rosy and young that they called him the reverend boy he seemed rather dismayed at first but finding the ladies silent and demure he took heart and read diligently in a dingy little prayerbook stealing shy glances now and then from under his broadbrimmed hat at amandas white hands or matildas yellow locks as if these vanities of the flesh had not quite lost their charms for him by and by he fell asleep and leaned in his corner making quite a pretty picture for the ugly hat was off his boyish face as placid as a childs his buckled shoes and neat blackstockinged legs stretched comfortably out his plump hands folded over the dingy book and the little bands lay peacefully on his breast  he was quite at their mercy now so the three women looked as much as they liked wondering if the poor dear boy was satisfied with the life he had chosen and getting tenderly pitiful over the losses he might learn to regret when it was too late his dreams seemed to be pleasant ones however for once he laughed a blithe boyish laugh good to hear and when he woke he rubbed his blue eyes and stared about smiling like a newly roused baby  he got out all too soon was joined by several other clerical youths and disappeared with much touching of big beavers and wafting of cassocks  innocent reverend little boy i wonder what became of him and hope his sleep is as quiet now as thenhis awakening as happy as it seemed that summer day  six oclock saw our damsels at le mans and after dinner a sunset walk took them to the grand old cathedral where they wandered till moonrise pure gothic of the twelfth century rich in stained glass carved screens tombs of kings and queens dim little chapels where devout souls told their beads before shadowy pictures of saints and martyrs while over all the wonderful arches seemed to soar one above the other light and graceful as the natural curves of drooping branches or the rise and fall of some great fountain  we shall not see anything finer than this im sure its a perfect revelation to me said matilda in a calm rapture at the beauty all about her  this is a piousfeeling church and i could say my prayers here with all my soul for it seems as if the religion of centuries had got built into it added lavinia thinking of the ugly imitations at home  you will both turn catholic before we get through prophesied amanda retiring to study the tomb of berengaria coeur de lions wife  the square before the hotel was gay with a market many soldiers lounging about and flocks of people eating ices before the cafés the ladies enjoyed it from the balcony and then slumbered peacefully in a great room with three alcoves much muslin drapery and a bowl and pitcher like a goodsized cup and saucer  another look at the cathedral in the early morning and then away to tours which place they found a big clean handsome city all astir for the fêtedieu  we will stay over sunday and see it was the general vote as the trio headed for the great church and catching sight of it they subsided into a seat by the fountain opposite and sat looking silently at the magnificent pile  how strangely impressive and eloquent it was the evening red touched its grey towers with a mellow light like sunshine on a venerable head lower down flights of rooks circled round the fretted niches quaint windows and grotesque gargoyles while the great steps below swarmed with priests and soldiers gay strangers and blackrobed nuns children and beggars  for an hour our pilgrims sat and studied the wonderful façade or walked round the outside examining the rich carvings that covered every inch of the walls twilight fell before they had thought of entering and feeling that they had seen enough for that night they went thoughtfully home to dream of solemn shadows and saintly faces for the cathedral haunted them still  next day was spent in viewing charlemagnes tower and seeing the grand procession in honour of the day the streets were hung with garlands gay tapestries and banners strewn with fresh boughs and lined with people in festival array as the procession passed women ran out and scattered roseleaves before it and one young mother set her blooming baby on a heap of greenery in the middle of the street leaving it there that the holy ghost under its canopy might pass over it a pretty sight the rosy little creature smiling in the sunshine as it sat playing with its own blue shoes while the golden pageant went by the chanting priests stepping carefully and looking down with sudden benignity in their tired faces as the holy shadow fell on the bright head making baby blessed and saved for ever in its pious mothers eyes  a great band played finely scarlet soldiers followed then the banners of patron saints were borne by children saint agnes and her lamb led a troop of pretty little girls carrying tall white lilies filling the air with their sweetness mary our mother was followed by many orphans with black ribbons crossed over the young hearts that had lost so much saint martin led the charity boys in purple suits of just the colour of the mantle he was dividing with the beggar on the banner a pleasant emblem of the charitable cloak that covers so many  priests in full splendour paced solemnly along with censers swinging candles flickering sweetvoiced boys singing and hundreds kneeling as they passed most impressive figures unless one caught a glimpse of something comically human to disturb the effect of the heavenly pageant lavinia had an eye for the ludicrous and though she dropped a tear over the orphans and with difficulty resisted a strong desire to catch and kiss the pretty baby she scandalized her neighbours by laughing outright the next minute a particularly portly piouslooking priest who was marching with superb dignity and chanting like a devout bumblebee suddenly mislaid his temper and injured the effect by boxing a charity boys ears with his gilded missal and then capped the climax by taking a pinch of snuff with a sonorous satisfaction that convulsed the heretic  the afternoon was spent in the church wandering to and fro each alone to study and enjoy in her own way matilda lost her head entirely and had silent raptures over the old pictures amanda said her prayers looked up her dates and imparted her facts in a proper and decorous manner while lavinia went up and down finding for herself little pictures not painted by hands and reading histories more interesting to her than those of saints and martyrs  in one dim chapel with a single candle lighting up the divine sorrow of the mater dolorosa knelt a woman in deep black weeping and praying all alone in another flowery nook dedicated to the infant jesus a peasant girl was telling her beads over the baby asleep in her lap her sunburnt face refined and beautiful by the tenderness of motherlove in a third chapel a pale wasted old man sat propped in a chair while his rosy old wife prayed heartily to st gratien the patron saint of the church for the recovery of her john anderson and most striking of all was a dark handsome young man welldressed and elegant who was waiting at the door of a confessional with some great trouble in his face as he muttered and crossed himself while his haggard eyes were fixed on the benignant figure of st francis as if asking himself if it were possible for him also to put away the pleasant sins and follies of the world and lead a life like that which embalms the memory of that good man  if we dont go away tomorrow we never shall for this church will bewitch us and make it impossible to leave said amanda when at length they tore themselves away  i give up trying to sketch cathedrals it cant be done and seems impious to try said matilda quite exhausted by something deeper than pleasure  i think the reminiscences of a rook would make a capital story they are longlived birds and could tell tales of the past that would entirely eclipse our modern rubbish said lavinia taking a last look at the solemn towers and the shadowy birds that had haunted them for ages  the ladies agreed to be off early in the morning that they might reach amboise in time for the eleven oclock breakfast amanda was to pay the bill and to make certain enquiries at the office mat to fly out and do a trifle of shopping while lavinia packed up the bundles and mounted guard over them they separated but in halfanhour all met again not in their room according to agreement but before the cathedral which all had decided not to revisit on any account  matilda was there first and as each of the others came stealing round the corner she greeted them with a laugh in which all joined after the first surprise was over  i told you it would bewitch us said amanda and then all took a farewell look which lasted so long that they had to rush back to the hotel in most unseemly haste  now to fresh châteaux and churches new sang lavinia as they rolled away on the fourth stage of their summer journey a very short stage it was and soon they were in an entirely new scene for amboise was a little oldtime village on the banks of the loire looking as if it had been asleep for a hundred years the lion dor was a quaint place so like the inns described in french novels that one kept expecting to see some of dumas heroes come dashing up all boots plumes and pistols with a loveletter for some court beauty in the castle on the hill beyond  queer galleries and stairs led up outside the house to the rooms above the salleàmanger was across a court and every dish came from a kitchen round the corner the garçon a beaming ubiquitous creature trotted perpetually diving down steps darting into dark corners or skipping up ladders producing needfuls from most unexpected places the bread came from the stable soup from the cellar coffee out of a mealchest and napkins from the housetop apparently for adolphe went up among the weathercocks to get them  no one knows us no one can speak a word of english and if we happen to die here it will never be known how romantic and nice it is exclaimed mat in good spirits for the people treated the ladies as if they were duchesses in disguise and the young women liked it  im not so sure that the romance is all it looks we should be in a sweet quandary if anything happened to our sheetanchor here just remember in any danger save amanda first then she will save us but if she is lost all is lost replied lavinia darkly for she always took tragical views of life when her bones ached  up the hill they went after breakfast and balm was found for the old ladys woes in the sight of many angora cats of great size and beauty white as snow with tails like plumes and mild yellow eyes were these charmers at every window sat one on every doorstep sprawled a bunch of down and frequently the eye of the tabbyloving spinster was gladdened by the touching spectacle of a blonde mamma in the bosom of her young family  if i could only carry it id have one of those dears no matter what it cost cried lavinia more captivated by a live cat than by all the dead huguenots that catherine de medicis hung over the castle walls on a certain memorable occasion  well you cant so come on and improve your mind with some good useful history said amanda leading them forward you must remember that charles vii was born here in 1470that anne of brittany married him for her first husband and that he bumped his head against a low door in the garden here above as he was running through to play bowls with his anne and it killed him  which the bump or the bowls asked mat who liked to have things clearly stated  dont be frivolous child here margaret of anjou and her son were reconciled to warwick abdel kader and his family were kept prisoners here and in the garden is a tomb with a crescent on it likewise a pleached walk and a winding drive inside the great tower up which lords and ladies used to ride straight into the hall continued the sage amanda who yearned to enlighten the darkness of her careless friends  a brisk old woman did the honours of the castle showing them mouldy chapels sepulchral halls rickety stairs grubby cells and pitchdark passages till even the romantic matilda was glad to see the light of day and repose in the pleasant gardens while removing the cobwebs from her countenance and the dust from her raiment  a lovely view gladdened their eyes as they stood on the balcony whence the amiable catherine surveyed the walls hung thick and the river choked up with the dead below the broad loire rolled slowly by between its green banks little boys in the costume of cupid were riding great horses in to bathe after the days work the grey roofs of the town nestled to the hillside and far away stretched the summer landscape full of vague suggestions of new scenes and pleasures to the pilgrims  we start for chenonceaux at seven in the morning so ladies i beg that you will be ready punctually was the command issued by amanda as they went to their rooms after a festive dinner of what lavinia called earthworms and cacti not being fond of stewed brains baked eels or thistles and pigweed chopped up in oil  such a droll night as the wanderers spent no locks on the doors and no bells stairs leading straight up the gallery from the courtyard carts going and coming soft footsteps stealing up and down whispers that sounded suspicious though they were only orders to kill chickens and pick salad for the morrow and a ghostly whistle that disturbed lavinia so much she at last draped herself in the green coverlet and went boldly forth upon the balcony to see what it meant  she intended to demand silence in french that would strike terror to the soul of the bravest native but when she saw that poor dear hardworked garçon blacking boots by the light of the moon her heart melted with pity and resolving to give him an extra fee she silently retired to her stonefloored bower and fell asleep in a stuffy little bed whose orange curtains filled her dreams with volcanic eruptions and conflagrations of the most lurid description  at seven an open carriage with a stout pair of horses and a sleepy driver rolled out of the courtyard of the lion dor within it sat three ladies who gazed at one another with cheerful countenances and surveyed the world with an air of bland content beautiful to behold  i am fairly faint with happiness sighed matilda as they drove through fields scarlet with poppies starred with daisies or yellow with buttercups while birds piped gaily and trees wore their early green  you did not eat any breakfast that accounts for it have a crust do said amanda who seldom stirred without a good sweet crust or two for they were easy to carry wholesome to chew and always ready at a moments notice  let us save our entusymusy till we get to the château and enjoy this lovely drive in a peaceful manner said lavinia still a little sleepy after her adventures in the glimpses of the moon  so for an hour or two they rolled along the smooth road luxuriating in the summer sights and sounds about them the wayside cottages with women working in the gardens villages clustered round some tiny picturesque church windmills whirling on the distant hilltops vineyards full of peasants tying up the young vines or trudging by with baskets on their backs heaped with green cuttings for the goats at home old men breaking stone by the roadside touched their red caps to the pilgrims jolly boys shouted at them from the cherry trees and little children peeped from behind the rosebushes blooming everywhere  soon glimpses of the winding cher began to appear then an avenue of stately trees and then standing directly in the river rose the lovely château built for diane de poictiers by her royal lover leaving the carriage at the lodge our sightseers crossed the moat and led by a woodenfaced girl with a lisp entered the famous pleasurehouse which its present owner a pensive man in black velvet who played fitfully on a frenchhorn in a pepperpot tower is carefully restoring to its former splendour  the great picturegallery was the chief attraction and beginning with diane herselfa tall simpering baggage with a bow hounds crescent and a blue sash for draperythey were led through a rapid review of all sorts of worthies and unworthies relics and rubbish without end portraits are always interesting even lavinia who had no soul for art as mat said looked with real pleasure at a bassrelief of agnes of sorel and pictures of montaigne rabelais ninon denclos madame de sévigné and miniatures of la fayette and ben franklin the latter gentleman looked rather out of place in such society but perhaps his good old face preached the dianes and ninons a silent sermon his plain suit certainly was a relief to the eye wearied with periwigged sages and bejewelled sinners  here was the little theatre where rousseaus plays were acted here were the gilded chairs in which kings had sat swords heroes had held books philosophers had pored over mirrors that had reflected famous beauties and painted walls that had looked down on royal revels long ago  the old kitchen had a fireplace big enough for a dozen cooks to have spoiled gallons of broth in queer pots and pans and a handy little window out of which they could fish at any moment for the river ran below  the chapel chambers balconies and terraces were all being repaired for thanks to george sands grandmother who owned the place in the time of the revolution it was spared out of respect to her and is still a charming relic of the past  the ladies went down the mossy steps leading from the gallery to the further shore and lying under the oaks whiled away the noontime by repeopling the spot with the shapes that used to inhabit it a very happy hour it was dreaming there by the little river with the scent of newmown hay in the fresh wind and before them the airy towers and gables of the old château rising from the stream like a vision of departed splendour love and romance  having seen every thing and bought photographs ad libitum of the woodenfaced lisper who cheated awfully the pilgrims drove away satiated with relics royalty and regardez  another night in the stonyhearted orangecoloured rooms with the sleepless garçon sweeping and murmuring outside like a banshee while the hens roosted sociably in the gallery the horses seemed to be champing directly under the bed and the dead huguenots bumping down upon the roof from the castlewalls another curious meal wafted from the bowels of the earth and cooled by all the airs that blowthen the shawlstraps were girded anew the carriage a halfgrown omnibus with the jaundice mounted the farewell bows and adieux received and forth rumbled the duchesses en route for blois  my heart is rent at leaving that lovely château said mat as they crossed the bridge  i mourn the earthworms the cacti and the tireless gossoon added amanda who appreciated french cookery and had enjoyed confidences with adolphe  the cats the cats the cats i could die happy if i had one murmured lavinia and with these laments they left the town behind them  any thing hotter than blois with its half driedup river dusty boulevards and baked streets can hardly be imagined but these indomitable women did the church and the castle without flinching the former was pronounced a failure but the latter was entirely satisfactory the emperor was having it restored in the most splendid manner the interior seemed rather fresh and gay when contrasted with the timeworn exterior but the stamped leathern hangings tiled floors emblazoned beams and carved fireplaces were quite correct dragons and crowns porcupines and salamanders monograms and flowers shone everywhere in a maze of scarlet and gold brown and silver purple and white  here the historical amanda revelled and quenched the meek old guide with a burst of information which caused him to stare humbly at the mad english  regardez my dears the chamber and oratory of catherine de medicis who here plotted the death of the duc de guise this is the cabinet of her son henri iii where he gave the daggers to the gentlemen who were to rid him of his enemy the hero of the barricades this is the salle des gardes where guise was leaning on the chimneypiece when summoned to the king this is the little room at the entrance of which he was set upon in the act of lifting the drapery and stabbed with forty wounds  oh how horrid gasped matilda staring about as if she saw the sanguinary gentlemen approaching  so interesting do go on cried lavinia who was fond of woe and enjoyed horrors  this is the hall where the body lay for two hours covered with a cloak and a cross of straw on the breast cut in amanda as the guide opened his mouth here the king came to look upon the corpse of the once mighty henri le balafré and spurned it with his foot saying i shall not translate it for you matje ne le croyais pas aussi grand and then ordered it to be burnt and the ashes cast into the river remember the date i implore you december 23 1588  as amanda paused for breath the little man took the word and rattled off a jumble of facts and fictions about the window from which marie de medicis lowered herself when imprisoned here by her dutiful son louis xiii  i wish the entire lot had been tossed out after her for i do think kings and queens are a set of rascals cried mat scandalized by the royal iniquities to which she had been listening till the hair stood erect upon her innocent head  the salle des États was being prepared for the trial of the men who had lately attempted the emperors life and a most theatrical display of justice was to be presented to the public the richly carved staircase with francis the firsts salamanders squirming up and down it was a relic worth seeing but the parched pilgrims found the little pots of clotted cream quite as interesting and much more refreshing when they were served up at lunch the pots not the pilgrims each covered with a fresh vineleaf and delicately flavoured with buttercups and clover  amanda won the favour of the stately garçon by praising them warmly and he kept bringing in fresh relays and urging her to eat a third a fourth with a persuasive dignity hard to resist  but yes mademoiselle one more for nowhere else can crême de st gervais be achieved they are desired ardently desired in paris but alas it is impossible to convey them so far such is their exquisite delicacy  how many the appreciative ladies consumed the muse saith not but the susceptible heart of the great garçon was deeply touched and it was with difficulty that they finally escaped from his attentions  on being presented with a castoff campstool and a pair of old boots to dispose of he instantly appropriated them as graceful souvenirs and clasping his hands declared with effusion that he would seat his infant upon the souseful stool and offer the charming boots to madame my wife who would weep for joy at this touching tableau  with this melodramatic valedictory he suffered the guests to depart and the last they saw of him he was still waving a dirty napkin as he stood at the gate big bland and devoted to the end though the drops stood thick upon his manly brow and the sun glared fiercely on his uncovered head  i shall write an article on garçons when i get home said lavinia who was always planning great works and never executing them we have known such a nice variety and all have been so good to us that we owe them a tribute you remember the dear towheaded one at morlaix who insisted on handing us dishes of snails and papers of pins with which to pick out the repulsive delicacy  yes and the gloomy one with black linen sleeves who glowered at us sighed gustily in our ears and anointed us with gravy as he waited at table added amanda  dont forget the dark one with languid spanish eyes and curly hair on the boat going down the rance how picturesque and polite he was to be sure as he kept picking up our beerbottles when they rolled about the deck put in mat who had the dark youth safely in her sketchbook with eyes as big and black as blots  the solemn one at tours who squirted seltzerwater out of window at the beggars without a smile was very funny so was the little one with grubby hands who tottered under the big dishes but insisted on carrying the heaviest  the fasttrotter at amboise won my heart he was so supernaturally lively and so full of hurried amiability a very dear garçon indeed  be sure you remember the superb being at brest whose eyes threatened to fall out of his head at exciting moments also flabots chubby boy who adored mat and languished at her over the onions like a cupid in a blue blouse  i will do justice to everyone and lavinia took copious notes on the spot  orleans was a prim tidy town and after taking a look at the fine statue of the maid and laughing at some funny little soldiers drumming wildly in the place our travellers went on to bourges  this now is a nice dingy old place and we will take our walks abroad directly for it looks like rain and we must make the most of our time and money said amanda        for though on pleasure she was bent      she had a frugal mind   forth they went as soon as dinner was over and found the waters all abroad also for every man was playing away with a hose every woman scrubbing her doorsteps and the children gaily playing leapfrog in the puddles  nasty damp place croaked the raven obscuring her disgusted countenance behind the inevitable grey cloud and gathering her garments about her as they hopped painfully over the wet stones for sidewalks there were none  i find it refreshing after the dust and heat please detach mat from that shop window and come on or we shall see nothing before dark replied the ever amiable amanda  matilda would glue herself to every jewellers window and remain fascinated by the richness there displayed till led away by force on this occasion however her mania led to good results for at the ninth window as her keepers were about to drag her away a ring of peculiar antiquity caught their eyes simultaneously and to mats amazement both plunged into the little shop clamouring to see it a pale emerald surrounded by diamond chippings set in silver with a wide gold band cut in a leafy pattern composed this gem of price  a francis first ring sold by a noble but impoverished family and only a hundred francs madame said the man politely anxious to cheat the fair foreigners out of four times its value  cant afford it and lavinia retired but the shrewd amanda with inimitable shrugs and pensive sighs regretted that it was so costly a sweet ring but alas forty francs is all i have to give  the man was desolated to think that eighty francs was the lowest he was permitted to receive would madame call again and perhaps it might be arranged  ah no madame is forced to depart early to return no more  mon dieu how afflicting in that case sixty would be possible for so rare a relic  madame is abîmé but it is not to be forty is the utmost therefore merci and bonjour  hold where shall it be sent cries the man giving in but not confessing it with awkward frankness  a thousand thanks madame will pay for it at once and laying down the money she sweetly bows herself away with the ring upon her finger  what a people ejaculated lavinia who always felt like a fly in a cobweb when she attempted to deal with the french in her blunt confiding way  it is great fun answered amanda flashing her ring with satisfaction after the skirmish will madame kindly direct me to the house of jacques coeur she added addressing an old woman clattering by in sabots  allez toujours à droit en vous appuyant sur la gauche replied the native beaming and bowing till the streamers of her cap waved in the wind  they followed these directions but failed to find the place and applied to another old woman eating soup on her doorstep  suivez le chemin droit en tombant à gauche was the reply with a wave of the spoon to all the points of the compass  great heavens what a language cried lavinia who had been vainly endeavouring to support herself as she fell in every direction over and into the full gutters  the house was found at last an ancient mysterious place with a very curious window carved to look as if the shutters were half open and from behind one peeped a mans head from the other a womans both so lifelike that it quite startled the strangers murray informed the observers that these servants are supposed to be looking anxiously for their masters return jacques having suddenly disappeared after lending much money to the king who took that mediæval way of paying his debts  service was being held in the church and the ladies went in to rest and listen for the music was fine much red and white drapery gave the sanctuary the appearance of a gay drawingroom and the profane lavinia compared the officiating clergy to a set of red furniture the biggest priest was the sofa four deacons the armchairs and three little boys the footstools all upholstered in crimson silk and neatly covered with lace tidies  as if to rebuke her frivolity a lovely fresh voice from the hidden choir suddenly soared up like a lark singing so wonderfully that a great stillness fell on the listeners and while it lasted the tawdry church and its mummery were quite forgotten as the ear led the heart up that ladder of sweet sounds to heaven even when the others joined in one could still hear that childvoice soaring and singing far above the rest as if some little angel were playing with the echoes among the arches of the roof  a proud native informed the strangers that it was a poor boy whose exquisite voice was the pride of the town and would in time make his fortune as the choirboys came racing down stairs after service pulling off their dingy robes as they ran lavinia tried to pick out the little angel but gave it up in despair for a more uninteresting set of bulletheaded coppercoloured sprigs she never saw  rain drove the wanderers back to the hotel and there they made a night of it ordering a fire in the largest of the three stuffy little cells which they occupied they set about being comfortable for it had turned chilly and a furious wind disported itself in and out through numberless crevices lavinia was inspired to mull some wine and brewed a mild jorum that cheered but did not inebriate amanda produced her shakspeare and read aloud while the simmering and sipping went on matilda sketched the noble commander as she lay upon the sofa with her egyptian profile in fine relief and her aristocratic red slippers gracefully visible a large grey cat of a social turn joined the party and added much to the domesticity of the scene by sitting on the hearth in a cosy bunch and purring blissfully  now it is your turn to propose something for the general amusement mandy said mat when the beakers were drained dry and the montagues and capulets comfortably buried  let us attend to the culture of our nails replied amanda producing her polissoir powder and knife  three cups of tepid water were produced and the company sat eagerly soaking their finger tips for a time after which much pruning and polishing went on to the great bewilderment of puss who poked her own paws into the cups as if trying to test the advantages of this remarkable american custom  what would our blessed mother say if she saw us now said mat proudly examining ten pointed pink nails at the tips of her long fingers  people told us we should get demoralised if we came abroad and this is the first step on the downward road returned lavinia shaking her head over her own backslidings  no its the second step we ate calves brains for dinner and what im sure were frogs legs with mushrooms you know we vowed we wouldnt touch their horrid messes but i really begin to like them confessed mat who had pronounced every dish at dinner delicious  ha i will write a poem cried amanda and leaping from the sofa she grasped her pen flung open her portfolio and in a few brief moments produced these inspired stanzas                  the downward road       two yankee maids of simple mien        and earnest high endeavour      come sailing to the land of france        to escape the winter weather      when first they reached that vicious shore        they scorned the native ways      refused to eat the native grub        or ride in native shays      oh for the puddings of our home        oh for some simple food      these horrid greasy unknown things        how can you think them good      thus to amanda did they say        an uncomplaining maid      who ate in peace and answered not        until one day they said      how can you eat this garbage vile        against all natures laws      how can you eat your nails in points        until they look like claws      then patiently amanda said        my loves just wait a while      the time will come you will not think        the nails or victuals vile      a month has passed and now we see        that prophecy fulfilled      the ardour of those carping maids        is most completely chilled      matilda was the first to fall        lured by the dark gossoon      in awful dishes one by one        she dipped her timid spoon      she promised for one little week        to let her nails grow long      but added in a saving clause        she thought it very wrong      thus did she take the fatal plunge        did compromise with sin      then all was lost from that day forth        french ways were sure to win      lavinia followed in her train        and ran the selfsame road      ate sweetbread first then choppedup brains        eels mushrooms pickled toad      she cries how flat the home cuisine        after this luscious food      puddings and brutal joints of meat        that once we fancied good      and now in all their leisure hours        one resource never fails      morning and noon and night they sit        and polish up their nails      then if in one short fatal month        a change like this appears      oh what will be the next result        when they have stayed for years   tremendous applause greeted this masterly effort and other poems were produced with the rapidity of genius by amanda and lavinia each writing the alternate verse à la beaumont and fletcher which gave a peculiar charm to these effusions  when matilda was called upon for a festive suggestion she promptly replied with a graceful yawn  lets go to bed  the meeting therefore broke up and the younger ladies retired to their cells in good order but the raven excited by the jocund hour continued to rustle and patter about the warm room in a state of inexpressible hilarity most exasperating to the others who desired to sleep not content with upsetting the fireirons occasionally singing to the cat and slamming the furniture about this restless bird kept appearing first at one cell door with a conundrum then at the other with a joke or insisted on telling funny stories in her den till the exhausted victims implored her to take an opium pill and subside before they became furious she obeyed and after a few relapses into wandering and joking finally slumbered  then occurred the one thrilling adventure of this happy journey in the darkest hour before dawn mat awoke heard a suspicious noise in the middle room and asked if lavinia was on the rampage again no reply and listening a low rasping rustling sound was heard  thieves of course our watches and purses are on the table and lavinia has probably forgotten to lock the door i must attend to this and up rose the dauntless matilda who feared neither man nor ghost  grasping her dagger hitherto used as a paper cutter but always eager to be steeped in the gore of brigands robbers or beasts of prey she crept to the door and peeped in the pale glow of the fire showed her a dark figure crouching in the opposite doorway the click of a pistol caught her ear but dodging quickly the heroic girl cried sternly from the shelter of lavinias bedcurtain  come out or ill fire  mio dio is it only you answered a familiar voice as amanda shrouded in a waterproof sprang up and lit a match  what are you prowling about for demanded mat  to blow your brains out apparently answered mandy lowering her arms why are you abroad  to stab you i fancy and mat sheathed her dagger balked of its prey  i heard a noise  so did i  lets see what it is and lighting a candle the fair amazons looked boldly about the shadowy room  lavinia lay wrapt in slumber with only the end of her sarcastic nose visible beyond the misty cloud that enveloped her venerable countenance the outer door was fast and the shutters closed no booted feet appeared below the curtains no living eyes rolled awfully in the portrait of the salmoncoloured saint upon the wall yet the rustling and rasping went on and with one impulse the defenders of sleeping innocence made for the table in the corner  there was the midnight robber at his fell workthe big cat peacefully gnawing the cold chicken and knocking about the treasured crusts dragged from the luncheonbasket carefully packed for an early start  wake and behold the ruin your pet has made  we might be murdered or carried off a dozen times over without her knowing it heres a nice duenna  and the indignant ladies shook pinched and shouted till the hapless sleeper opened one eye and wrathfully demanded what the matter was  they told her with eloquent brevity but instead of praising their prowess and thanking them with fervour the ungrateful woman shut her eye again merely saying with drowsy irascibility  you told me to go to sleep and i went next time fight it out among yourselves but dont wake me  throw the cat out of window and go to bed mat and amanda uncocked her pistol with the resignation of one who had learned not to expect gratitude in this world  touch a hair of that dear creature and ill raise the house cried lavinia roused at once  puss who had viewed the fray sitting bolt upright on the table now settled the vexed question by skipping into lavinias arms feeling with the instinct of her race that her surest refuge was there mat retired in silent disgust and the raven fell asleep soothed by the grateful purring of her furry friend  last nights experiences have given me a longing for adventures said mat as they journeyed on next morning  ive had quite enough of that sort growled lavinia  let us read our papers and wait for time to send us something in the way of a lark and amanda obscured herself in a grove of damp newspapers  lavinia also took one and read bits aloud to mat who was mending her gloves bright yellow fourbuttoned and very dirty  translate as you go alongi do so hate that gabble begged mat who would not improve her mind  so lavinia gave her a free translation which convulsed amanda behind her paper coming to this passage plusieurs faits graves sont arrivés the reader rendered it several made graves have arrived adding dear me what singular customs the french have to be sure a little farther on she read un portrait de feu monsieur mon père adding a fire portrait means a poker sketch i suppose  here a smothered giggle from amanda caused the old lady to say bless you thinking the dear girl had sneezed  i must have some blue cotton to mend my dress with remind me to get some at moulins by the way how do you ask for it in french said mat surveying a rent in her skirts  oh just go in and say avezvous le fils bleu replied lavinia with a superior air  a blue son my precious granny what will you say next murmured amanda faint with suppressed laughter  what are you muttering about asked granny sharply  trying to recall those fine lines in wilhelm meister dont you remember wer nie sein brod mit thränen ass replied amanda polite even at the last gasp  i read my goethe in decent english and dont know anything about training asses returned lavinia severely  that was too much amanda cast her paper down and had her laugh out as the only means of saving herself from suffocation the others gazed upon her in blank amazement till she found breath enough to enlighten them when such peals of merriment arose that the guard popped his head in to see if he had not unwittingly shipped a load of lunatics  that was splendid but now we must sober down for a gorgeous being is about to get in said amanda as they stopped at a station  the gorgeous being entered and found three demure ladies rapt in newspapers they apparently saw nothing but the words before them yet every one of them knew that the handsome young man had bowed in the most superior manner also that he was dressed in brown velvet long gaiters buttoned to the knee a ravishing blue tie buff gloves and pouch and powderhorn slung over his shoulder also that a servant with two dogs and a gun had touched his hat and said oui monsieur le comte as he shut the door  a slight thrill pervaded the statues as this fact was made known and each began to wonder how the elegant aristocrat would behave to say that he stared feebly expresses the fixity of his noble gaze as it rested in turn upon the three faces opposite when satisfied he also produced a paper and began to read but matilda caught a big black eye peering over the sheet more than once as she peered over the top of her own  i dont like him remember we dont speak french whispered the discreet amanda  i can swear that i dont said lavinia with an irrepressible smile as she remembered the blue son  the language of the eye is not forbidden me and i cant sit baking under a newspaper all the way returned matilda whose blond curls had evidently met with the great creatures approval  a slight pucker about the comtes lips caused a thrill of horror to pervade the ladies as amanda murmured under her breath  he may understand english  then we are lost returned the tragic raven  wish he did i really pine for a little attention it gives such a relish to life said matilda thinking regretfully of the devoted beings left behind  the prudent amanda and the stern lavinia steeled their hearts and iced their countenances to the comely gentleman but the social matilda could not refrain from responding to his polite advances with a modest merci monsieur as he drew the curtain for her a smile when he picked up the unruly curlingstick and her best bow as he offered his paper with a soft glance of the black eyes  in vain amanda tried to appal her with awful frowns in vain lavinia trod warningly upon her foot she paid no heed and left them no hope but the saving remembrance that she couldnt talk french  if the man dont get out soon ill tie her up in my shawl and tell him she is mad resolved lavinia whose spinster soul was always scandalised at the faintest approach to a flirtation  if the man does speak english mat will have it all her own way thought amanda remembering the vow imposed upon the reckless girl  alas alas for the anxious twain the man did not get out soon the man did speak english and in ten minutes matilda was off like a colt without a halter the anguish of her keepers added zest to the fun and finding that the gentleman evidently thought her the lady of the party owing to the yellow gloves smartest hat and irreproachable boots and the others in sober gray and black were maid and duenna this reprehensible girl kept up the joke put on airs and enjoyed that flirtatious hour to her hearts content  as if to punish the others for their distrust and to reward mats interest in him m le comte devoted himself to mademoiselle telling her about his hunting his estate and finished by inviting her and her party to call and view his château if they ever paused at the town which had the honour of being his summer residence mat responded to all these courtesies with confiding sweetness and when at length he was desolated at being obliged to tear himself away she        gave sigh for sigh   as he retired with a superb bow a gallant bon voyage mesdames and a wicked twinkle of the black eyes as they rested on the faces of the frozen ladies  i got rather the best of the joke in that little affair didnt i said mat gayly as the brown velvet adonis vanished  you are a disgrace to your party and your nation sternly responded amanda  lavinia spoke not but shook her little sister till the hat flew off her head and she had only breath enough left to declare with unquenched ardour that she would do it again the very next chance she got  lectures laughter and longings for my comte beguiled the remainder of the way and moulang as mat pronounced moulins was reached after a pleasant trip through a green country picturesque with the white cattle of berri there was not much to see but the town was so quaint and quiet that amanda was seized with one of her remarkable projects  let us find a little house somewhere and stay a week or two i fain would rest and ruminate among the white cows for a while have a little washing done and slowly prepare to emerge into the world again lyons is our next point and there we must bid adieu to freedom and shawlstraps  very well dear responded lavinia with resignation having learned that the best way to curb these aberrations of genius was to give in and let circumstances prove their impracticability  so amanda inquired of the landlady if such a rustic cot could be found whereupon the dingy little woman clasped her dingy little hands and declared that she had exactly the charming retreat desired truly yes and she would at once make her toilette order out the carriage and display this lovely villa to the dear ladies  with many misgivings the three squeezed themselves into a square clothesbasket on wheels drawn by an immense bony white horse driven by a striped boy and adorned by madame in a towering bonnet laden with amazing fruit flowers and vegetables lavinia counted three tomatoes a bunch of grapes poppies and pansies wheat ears and blackberryvines a red red rose and one small lettuce with glass dewdrops and green grubs lavishly sprinkled over it a truly superb chapeau and a memorable one  away they trundled through stony streets dusty roads waste grounds marshy meadows and tumbleddown pleasuregardens till the clothesbasket turned down a lane and the bony horse stopped at length before a door in a high red wall  behold cried madame leading them with much clanking of keys into a cabbagegarden a small toolhouse stood among the gardenstuff with brick floors very dirty windows and the atmosphere of a tomb bags of seed wheelbarrows onions and dust cumbered the ground empty bottles stood on the old table cigar ends lay thick upon the hearth and a trifle of gay crockery adorned the mantelpiece  see then here is a salon so cool so calm above is a room with beds and around the garden where the ladies can sit all day a maid can achieve the breakfast here and my carriage can come for them to dine at the hotel is it not charmingly arranged  it is simply awful said mat aghast at the prospect  settle it as you like dear only im afraid i couldnt stay very long on account of the dampness observed lavinia cheerfully as she put a hoehandle under her feet and wiped the blue mould from a threelegged chair  it wont do so ill tell her you are an invalid and very particular said amanda with another inspiration as she led the landlady forth to break the blow tenderly  my neuralgia is useful if it isnt ornamental and what a comfort that is said lavinia as she lightly threw a large cockroach out of window dodged a wasp and crushed a fat spider  and so it was in many ways if the party wanted a car to themselves granny was ordered to lie down and groan dismally which caused other travellers to shun the poor invalid if rooms did not suit suffering madame must have sun or perish late lunches easy carriages extra blankets every sort of comfort was for her whether she wanted them or not  shall i be sick or well was always the first question when an invitation came for my sisters delicate health was the standing excuse when parties palled or best gowns were not getatable  while amanda conferred with the hostess among the cabbages mat discovered that the picturesque white cattle in the field close by were extremely fierce and unsocial that there was no house in sight and the venerable horse and shay would never sustain many trips to and fro to dinner at the hotel lavinia poked about the house and soon satisfied herself that it abounded in every species of what fanny kemble calls entomological inconvenience and an atmosphere admirably calculated to introduce cholera to the inhabitants of moulins  it is all settled let us return said amanda appearing at last with an air of triumph having appeased the old lady by eating green currants and admiring an earwiggy arbour commanding a fine view of a marsh where frogs were piping and cool mists rising as the sun set  the chickens were tough at dinner the wine bitter the bread sour but no one reproached amanda as the cause of this change and when the hostess bowed them out next day without a smile they drove away conscious only of deep gratitude that they were saved from leaving their bones to moulder among the cabbages of moulins  now we return to civilisation good clothes and christian food said lavinia as they surveyed their fine rooms at the grand hotel lyons  likewise letters and luggage added amanda as the maid brought in a bundle of letters and two porters came bumping up with the trunks  well ive enjoyed the trip immensely though nothing very remarkable has happened said mat diving into her private ark with satisfaction  i should like to wander in the wilderness for years if i could hear from my family at intervals said lavinia briskly breaking open the plump travelworn letters  then you consider our trip a success asked amanda pausing in the act of removing the dust from her noble countenance  a perfect success we have done what we planned had no mishaps seen and enjoyed much quarrelled not at all laughed a great deal and been altogether festive thanks to you i shall hang my shawlstrap on the castle wall as a trophy of the prowess of my amanda and the success of the last declaration of american independence replied lavinia  i also said mat opening her bundle for the one hundreth and last time  you do me proud i humbly thank you and with a superb curtsy the commanderinchief modestly retired behind the towel     iv  switzerland   my children listen to the words of wisdom ere it is too late began lavinia as the three sat about in dressinggowns after a busy day in geneva  we listen go on granny replied the irreverent girls  if we stay here a week longer we are ruined firstly this metropole is an expensive hotel also noisy and full of fashionable people whom i hate secondly the allurements of the jewellers shops are too much for us and we had better flee before we spend all our money thirdly if war does break out along the rhine as rumour now predicts geneva will be crammed with people whose plans like ours are upset therefore we had better skip across the lake and secure a comfortable place for ourselves at vevey or montreaux for we shall probably have to winter there  hear hear we will do it and if italy doesnt get over her revolution in time for us to go to rome we must content ourselves with some nook in this refuge for all wanderers on the face of the continent said amanda  but i like geneva so much its such fun to watch the splendid waiters file in at dinner looking like young gentlemen ready for a ball the house is so gay and the shopsnever did i dream of such richness before do stay another week and buy a few more things prayed matilda who spent most of her time gloating over the jewelry and tempting her sister to buy all manner of useless gauds  no we will go tomorrow i know of several good pensions at vevey so we are sure of getting in somewhere pack at once and let us flee returned lavinia who having bought a watch a ring and a locket felt that it was time to go  and go they did settling for a month at bex a little town up the valley of the rhone remarkable for its heat its dirt its lovely scenery and the remarkable perfection to which its inhabitants had brought the goître nearly every one being blessed with an unsightly bunch upon the neck which they decorated with ribbons and proudly displayed to the disgusted traveller  here in the rambling old hôtel des bains with its balconies gardens and little rooms the wanderers reposed for a time a polish countess with her lover daughter and governess conferred distinction upon the house an old hungarian count who laboured under the delusion that he descended in a direct line from zenobia also adorned the scene an artist with two pretty boys named alfred constable landseer reynolds and allston west cuyp vandyke afforded matilda much satisfaction  english mammas with prim daughters of thirty or so still tied to their apronstrings were to be found of course for they are everywhere also wandering french folk raving about the war one minute and tearing their hair over bad coffee the next  amanda read newspapers and talked politics with the old count while lavinia with a paper bag of apricots under one arm and a volume of disraelis novels under the other spent her shining hours wandering from balcony to garden enjoying the heat which gave her a short respite from her woes  while here matilda in company with a kindred soul made the ascent of mount st bernard with the pleasing accompaniments of wind rain thunder and lightning but the irrepressible americans went on in spite of warnings from more prudent travellers who stopped halfway with one mule and a guide for escort the two enthusiasts waded swollen streams with icecold water up to their knees climbed slippery roads faced what seemed a whirlwind at that height and undaunted by the uproar of the elements pressed on to the hospice to the great admiration of moritz the guide who told them he had seldom taken men up in such a storm never ladies  at the hospice the dripping lasses found a hospitable welcome from the handsome monk who does the honours there being provided with dry garments and having much fun over the tall matilda draped in skirts of many colours in the attempt to get any long enough they were fed and warmed by the engaging monk who entertained them as they sat about a roaring fire while the storm raged without with thrilling tales of the travellers they had saved the wild adventures they had known in the dreadful winter time and the gifts bestowed upon them by grateful travellers or generous guests  the prince of wales had sent them a piano and many fine pictures ornamented the walls from famous persons an old english lady who spends her summers up there seemed much amused at the prank of the girls and evidently wondered what their guardians were about  a merry and memorable evening and when on going to their cells they found the beds nicely warmed matilda exclaimed  this is the most delightful of the romantic and the comfortable i ever saw alps and warmingpans taken jintly are delicious  at five next morning they were wakened by the chanting of the invisible brotherhood and went down to the chapel for mass on going out for a clamber on the rocks seven or eight great dogs came baying and leaping about them licking their hands and smelling their garments to see if they were hurt looking into their bright benevolent eyes one could well believe the wonderful tales told of their courage and sagacity though so powerful and large they were gentle as kittens and the dogloving girls were proud to receive and return the caresses of these fourfooted heroes  leaving a grateful souvenir in the box intended to receive whatever guests choose to leave the girls descended in the morning sunshine finding it a very different experience from the ascent all was clear and calm nowbeautiful and grand and only pausing at m to send back a fine engraving to the comely priest who had made a deep impression on their romantic hearts the enfants returned to their anxious friends mildewed rumpled and weary but full of enthusiastic delight over their successful ascent of st bernard  war broke out and alexandre the allaccomplished headwaiter dropped his napkin shouldered his gun and marched away leaving the hôtel des bains desolate being pretty thoroughly baked and very weary of the little town our trio departed to vevey and settled down in the best pension that ever received the weary traveller  standing in its own pretty grounds and looking out upon the lake pension paradis deserves its name clean and cosy within a good table a kindly hostess and the jolliest old host ever seen what more could the human heart desire  vevey was swarming with refugees don carlos or the duke de madrid as he was called was there with his duchess and court plotting heaven knows what up at his villa with the grave shabby men who haunted the town  queen isabella reigned at one hotel and spanish grandees pervaded the place there were several at pension paradis and no one guessed what great creatures they were till a fête day arrived and the grim gray men blossomed out into counts marquises and generals covered with orders stars and crosses splendid to behold  one particularly silent shabby little man with a shaven head and fine black eyes who was never seen to smile became an object of interest on that occasion by appearing in a gorgeous uniform with a great gilt grasshopper hanging down his back from a broad green ribbon who was he what did the grasshopper mean where did he go to in a fine carriage and what was he plotting with the other carlists who dodged in and out of his room at all hours  no one ever knew and all the artful questions put to the young spaniard who played croquet with the girls were unavailing nothing was discovered except that little mirandola had a title and might be sent back to spain any day to lose his life or liberty in some rash plot which circumstance made the blackeyed boy doubly interesting to the freeborn americans lavinia bewailed his hard lot amanda taught him whist and told his fortune and matilda put him in her sketchbook done in the blackest indiaink it is also to be recorded that the doomed little don was never seen to laugh but once and that was when the girls taught him the classical game of muggins the name struck him he went about saying it to himself and on the first occasion of his being mugginsed he was so tickled that he indulged in a hearty boys laugh but immediately recovered himself and never smiled again as if in penance for so forgetting his dignity  a bashful russian who wore remarkably fine broadcloth and had perfect manners was likewise received into the good graces of the ladies who taught him english called him the baron in private and covered him with confusion in public by making him talk at table  but the most amusing of all the family was madame a a handsome widow from lyons with two ugly children and a stout old mamma who wore orange stockings and a curious edifice of black lace encircled with large purple asters the widow had married an italian artist who was mortally jealous of his wife whose blonde beauty attracted much attention at rome in some quarrel with a model the husband was stabbed and the handsome widow left in peace  a tall fair lady with a profile like marie antoinette she dressed in white with violet ribbons and wore much ancient jewelry a loudvoiced energetic woman who bewailed the sack of her house at lyons scolded her children and cursed the germans with equal volubility and spirit when silent she was the picture of a patrician beauty but alas her voice destroyed the charm and her mannersgreat heavens what things that woman did picking her pearly teeth with a hairpin and knocking her darlings into their chairs with one sweep of her elbow when they annoyed her at table were the least of the horrors she perpetrated  but she talked well devoted herself to her family and took misfortune bravely so much may be pardoned her  her infants were only remarkable for their ugliness and curious costumes the little girl usually wore soiled silk gowns and had her hair tied up with bits of twine the boy appeared in a suit of yellow calico spotted with black looking very much like a canary bird who had fallen into an inkstand on festival occasions he wore white cloth raiment with red ribbons stuck here and there and high red boots  but on the whole the old mamma was the queerest of the set for she spent most of her time lumbering up and down stairs which amusement kept the orange hose constantly before the public when not disporting herself in this way she dozed in the salon or consumed much food at table with a devotion that caused her to suck her fingers on every one of which shone an antique ring of price her headgear was a perpetual puzzle to the observing lavinia who could never discover whether it was a cap a bonnet or a natural production for it was never off madame walked out in it wore it all day and very likely slept in it at least lavinia firmly believed so and often beguiled the watches of the night imagining the old soul placidly slumbering with the perennial asters encircling her aged brow like a halo  one other party there was who much amused the rest of the household an american lady with a sickly daughter who would have been pretty but for her affectation and sentimentality the girl was engaged to a fierce dissipated little russian who presented her with a big bouquet every morning followed her about all day like a dog and glared wrathfully at any man who cast an eye upon the languishing damsel in white muslin and flowing curls bedropt with pearls as a romantic lady expressed it  it was evident that the russian without any vowels in his name was going to marry mademoiselle for her money and the weak mamma was full of satisfaction at the prospect to others it seemed a doubtful bargain and much pity was felt for the feeble girl doomed to go to russia with a husband who had tyrant written in every line of his bad blasé little face and figure french polish could not hide the brute nor any quantity of flowers conceal the chain by which he was leading his new serf away to bondage in st petersburg  into the midst of this select society came a countryman of our threea jocund youth fresh from algiers with relics adventures and tales that utterly eclipsed the arabian nights festive times followed for the peri the pet name of aforesaid youth gave them the fruits of his long wanderings sung whole operas heard in paris danced ballets seen in berlin recounted perils among the moors served up gossip from the four corners of the globe and conversed with each member of the household in his or her own language  a cheerful comrade was the peri and a great addition to the party who now spent most of their time sitting about the town eating grapes and listening to the pranks of this sprightly md who seemed to be studying his profession by wandering over europe with a guitar à la troubadour  sounding the lungs of a veiled princess in morocco was the least of his adventures and the treasures he had collected supplied lavinia with materials for unlimited romances cuffbuttons made from bits of marble picked up among the ruins of carthage diamond crescents and earrings bought in toledo so antique and splendid that relicloving amanda raved about them photographs of the belles of constantinople moorish coins and pipes bits of curious indian embroidery and best of all the power of telling how each thing was found in so graphic a manner that eastern bazaars ruins and palaces seemed to rise before the listeners as in the time of the magic storytellers but all too soon he packed his knapsack and promising to bring each of his friends the nose or ear of one of the shattered saints from the great cathedral at strasbourg the peri vanished from paradis and left them all lamenting  the little flurry in italy ending peacefully our travellers after much discussion resolved to cross the alps and spend the winter in rome if possible so with tragic farewells from those they left behind them who hoping to keep them longer predicted all manner of misfortunes the three strongminded ladies rumbled away in the coupé of a diligence to brieg  a lovely days journey up the valley of the rhone and a short nights rest in the queer little town at the foot of the mountains  before light the next morning they were called and after a hurried breakfast in a stony hall went shivering out into the darkness and stumbling through the narrow street came to the startingpoint lanterns were dancing about the square two great diligences loomed up before them horses were tramping men shouting and eager travellers scrambling for places in the dimly lighted office people were clamouring for tickets scolding at the delay or grimly biding their time in corners with one eye asleep and the other sharply watching the conductor  isnt it romantic cried matilda wide awake and in a twitter of excitement  it is frightfully cold and i dont see how we are going for both those caravans are brimful croaked lavinia chafing her purple nose and wishing it had occurred to her to buy a muff before going to sunny italy  i have got through tickets and some one is bound to see us over these snowbanks so trust in providence and the other man and we shall come out right i assure you replied the energetic amanda who had conferred with a spectral being in the darkness and blindly put her faith in him  away lumbered one diligence after the other the first drawn by seven horses the second by five while the carriers little cart with one brought up the rear but still three muffled ladies sat upon a cool stone in the dark square waiting for the spectre to keep his promise  he did like a man for suddenly the doors of an old stable flew open and out rattled a comfortable carriage with a pair of stout little horses jingling their bells and a brisk driver whose voice was pleasant as he touched his hat and invited the ladies to enter assuring them that they would soon overtake and pass the heavy diligences before them  never again will i doubt you my amanda cried the raven packing herself into the dowagers corner with a grateful heart  i hope the top of this carriage opens for i must see everything cried matilda prancing about on the front seat in a chaos of wraps books bottles and lunchbaskets  of course it does and when there is anything to see we will see it it is dark and cold now so wed better all go to sleep again  with which sage remark amanda burrowed into her cloaks and slumbered but not the other two matilda stuck her head out of one window uttering little cries of wonder and delight at all she saw while livy watched the solemn stars pale one by one as the sky brightened and felt as if she were climbing up out of a dark valley of weariness and pain into a new world full of grand repose  slowly winding higher and higher through the damp pine forest softly stirring in the morning wind they saw the sky warm from its cold gray to a rosy glow making ready for the sun to rise as they never saw it rise before        full many a glorious morning have i seen      flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye   but never more wonderfully than on that day long after the distant peaks flamed in the ruddy light they rode in shadow but turning suddenly round a corner the sun came dazzling through a great gorge startling them with the splendour it brought  down went the carriagetop and standing bolt upright three pairs of eager eyes drank in the grandeur and the beauty that makes the crossing of the simplon an experience to live for ever in the memory peak after peak of the bernese oberland rose behind them silver white against a wonderful blue sky before them monte rosa touched with the morning red and all around great glaciers glittering in the sunshine awful gorges with torrents thundering from the heights above relics of landslides and avalanches still visible in uprooted trees boulders tumbled here and there and ruins of shepherds huts in solitary nooks where sheep now feed  the road crept in and out over frail bridges spanning chasms that made one dizzy to look into through tunnels of solid rock or galleries with windows over which poured waterfalls from the treacherous glaciers above this road is a miracle in itself for all nature seems to protest against it and the elements never tire of trying to destroy it only a napoleon would have had the audacity to dream of such a path and it is truly a royal road into a lovely land  passing the diligences the little carriage went rapidly on and soon the three were almost alone out leaped lavinia and matilda and walked along the level way that curved round a great gorge  go on and let me be it is all so magnificent it almost takes my breath away i must just sit a minute like a passive bucket and let it pour into me said lavinia in a solemn tone  mat understood for her own heart and soul were full and with a silent kiss of sympathy walked on leaving her sister to enjoy that early mass in a grander cathedral than any built with hands  in spite of the sunshine it was very cold and when the three met again their noses looked like the eldest miss pecksniffs as if aurora had nipped and tweaked it with her rosy fingers subsiding into their places with pale excited faces they went silently on for a long time with no sound but the chime of the bells on the horses who were covered with a light hoarfrost wrapped up to their eyes like egyptian women sat livy and amanda while matilda having tried to sketch monte rosa and given it up made a capital caricature of them as they ate cold chicken and drank wine in a primitive manner out of the bottle  it was a sudden descent from the sublime to the ridiculous but the feeble human mind cannot bear too much glory at once and is saved by the claims of the prosaic body that will get tired and hungry even atop of the everlasting hills so the enthusiasts picked their chicken bones sipped their wine and felt less exhausted and hysterical a good laugh over the carriers little boy who sniffed the banquet afar off and came running to offer a handful of pale alpine flowers with wistful glances at the lunch did them more good still for the little chap caught and bolted the morsels they gave him with such dexterous rapidity it was as good as juggling  refuges and the hospice came in sight one after the other and while waiting to change horses one had time to wonder how the people living there managed to be such a stolid dirty thriftlesslooking set mountaineers should be intelligent active and hardy but these men were a most ungainly crew and lavinias theories got a sad blow  a bad dinner at simplon would have been an affliction at any other time but with the valley of gondo for dessert no one cared for other food following the wild stream that had worn its way between the immense cliffs they drove rapidly down towards italy feeling that this was a fit gateway to the promised land  at iselle on the frontier they enacted a little farce for the benefit of the customhouse officers lavinia and amanda had old passports and had been told they would be needed mat had none so she was ordered to try the rôle of maid before they arrived she took out her earrings tied up her curls under a dingy veil put on a waterproof and tried to assume the demure air of an abigail  when they alighted she was left to guard the wraps in the carriage while the others went with the luggage expecting to have much trouble for all manner of hindrances had been predicted owing to the unsettled state of the country nothing could be simpler however no passports were demanded a very careless search of luggage and it was all over so matilda threw off her disguise and ascended the diligence in her own character for here alas they left the cozy little carriage with the affable driver and the jingling bells  only two places could be found in the crowded diligences and great was the fuss till amanda was invited up aloft by a friendly gentleman who had a perch behind large enough for two there they discussed theology and politics to their hearts content and at parting the worthy man cut his book in two and gave amanda half that she might refresh herself with a portion of some delightfully dry work on druidical remains protoplasm or the state of the church before the flood  the force of contrast makes the charm of this entry into italy for after the grandeur of the alps and the gloomy wildness of gondo the smiling scene is doubly lovely as one drives down to domo dossola weariness hunger and sleep were quite forgotten and when our travellers came to lago maggiore glimmering in the moonlight they could only sigh for happiness and look and look and look  victory has perched upon our banners so far i am sure for never was a trip more delightful it is not every stranger who is fortunate enough to see sunrise noonday sunset and moonlight in crossing the alps said matilda as she fell into her bed quite exhausted by the excitement of the day  i feel a richer better woman for it and dont believe i shall ever see anything more satisfactory if i stay in italy ten years responded lavinia wrapping the red armyblanket        like a martial cloak around her   wait till the spell of rome is upon you and then see what you will feel my granny predicted amanda who had felt the spell and had not yet escaped from it  dont believe it will suit me half so well persisted livy who would prefer nature to art much to amandas disgust  we shall see observed amanda with the exasperating mildness of superior knowledge  we shall and livy tied her cap in a hard knot as if to settle the matter     v  italy   sleep as deep dreamless and refreshing as if the beneficent spirit of carlo borromeo still haunted the enchanted lake prepared the three for a day of calm delights the morning was spent floating over the lake in a luxuriously cushioned boat with a gay awning and a picturesque rower to visit isola bella everyone knows what a little paradise has been made to blossom on that rock so raptures over the flowers the marbles the panniers of lovely fruit and the dirty pretty children who offered them are unnecessary  in the afternoon having despatched the luggage to florence our travellers sailed away to luini catching last glimpses of monte rosa and enjoying the glories of an italian sunset on an italian lake at luini the girls caused much excitement by insisting on sitting up with the driver instead of sharing the coupé with their decorous duenna we must see the lovely views and the moonlight said amanda and up she went  to sit aloft with a brigandish driver dressed in a scarlet and black uniform with a curly horn slung over his shoulder and to go tearing up hill and down with four frisky horses is irresistible and up skipped matilda  you will both catch your death of cold if you dont break your necks so it will be well to have some one to nurse or bury you and lavinia finding commands and entreaties vain entered the coupé with mournful dignity  with a toot of the horn and cheers from the crowd which the girls gracefully acknowledged away rumbled the diligence with at least two very happy occupants how lovely it was first the soft twilight wrapping everything in mysterious shadow and then the slow uprising of a glorious full moon touching the commonest object with its magical light cries of rapture from the girls atop were answered by exclamations from livy hanging half out of the coupé regardless of night air or raps on the head from overhanging boughs as they went climbing up woody hills or dashing down steep roads that wound so sharply round corners it was a wonder the airy passengers did not fly off at every lurch rattling into quiet little towns with a grand tootletetoo of the horn was an especial delight and to see the people gather so quickly that they seemed to spring from the ground a moments chatter a drink for the horses a soft felice notte another toot and away thundered the diligence for miles more of moonlight summer air and the ecstasy of rapid motion  what that dear brown driver with the red vest the bobtailed buttony coat and the big yellow tassels dancing from his hat brim thought of those two american damsels we shall never know but it may be imagined that after his first bewilderment he enjoyed himself for amanda aired her italian and asked many questions matilda invited him to perform national airs on all occasions and both admired him as openly as if he had been a pretty child  lavinia always cherished a dark suspicion that she narrowly escaped destruction on that eventful night for judging from the frequent melody and the speed of the horses she was sure that either amanda tooted and matilda drove or that both so bewildered the brigand that he lost his head however it was all so delightful that even granny felt the charm and was sure that if they did upset in some romantic spot a doctor antonio would spring up as quickly as a mushroom and mend their bones marry one of her giddy charges and end the affair in the most appropriate manner  nothing happened fortunately and by nine oclock they were safely at lugano and tearing themselves from the dear brigand were taken possession of by a shadowy being who fed them in a marble hall with statues ten feet high glaring at them as they ate then led them to a bower which had pale green doors a red carpet blue walls and yellow bed coversall so gay it was like sleeping in a rainbow  as if another lovely lake under the windows and moonlight ad libitum was not enough they had music also lavinia scorned the idea of sleep and went prowling about the rooms hanging over the balconies and doing the romantic in a style that was a disgrace to her years she it was who made the superb discovery that the music they heard came from across the way and that by opening a closet window they could look into a theatre and see the stage  all rushed at once and beheld an opera in full blast heartily enjoying the unusual advantages of their position for not only could they hear the warblers but see them when the curtain was down what a thing it was to see donna anna do up her black hair don giovanni dance a jig and stately ottavio imbibe refreshment out of a black bottle and the ghostly commander prance like a punchinello as they got him into position  the others soon succumbed to sleep but till long after midnight old livy wandered like a ghost from the front balcony with the lovely lake to the closet window and its dramatic joys feeling that no moment of that memorable night should be lost for what other traveller could boast that she ever went to the opera wrapped in a yellow bedquilt  on the morrow a few pictures of luini before breakfast and then more sailing over lakes and more driving in festive diligences to menaggio where a boat like a market waggon without wheels bore them genteelly to cadenabbia and a week of repose on the banks of lago como  their palace did not lift its marble walls to eternal summer by any means for it rained much and was so cold that some took to their beds for warmth stone floors looking like castilesoap not being just the thing for rheumatism handorgans dancingbears two hotels one villa no road but the lake and an insinuating boatman with one eye who lay in wait among the willows and popped out to grab a passenger when anyone ventured forth are all that remains in the memory regarding cadenabbia  a few extracts from lavinias notebook may be found useful at this point both as a speedy way of getting our travellers to rome and for the bold criticisms on famous places and pictures which they contain  milancathedral like a big weddingcake last supper in the barracksdid not thrill tried to but couldnt as the picture is so dim it can hardly be seen ambrosian librarylock of l borgias hair teacoloured and coarse dont believe in it a bit jolly old books but couldnt touch em fine window to dante saw cathedral illuminated very theatrical and much howling of people over the deputies from rome dont know why they illuminated or why they howled didnt ask men here handsome but rude women wear veils and no bonnetsfat and ugly gloves very goodarch of peacemore peace and less arch would be better for italy  raphaels marriage of the virginstiff and stupid cant like raphael dear pious simple old fra angelico suits me better  to the public garden with a saw a black ostrich with long pink legs who pranced and looked so like an opera dancer that we sat on the fence and shrieked with laughter  paviato the certosa to see the old carthusian convent founded in 1396 cloisters gardens and twentyfour little dwellings with chapel bedroom parlour and yard for each monk who is never to speak and comes out but once a week a nice way for lazy men to spend their lives when there is so much work to be done for the lord and his poor wanted to shake them all round though they did look well in their gowns and cowls gliding about the dim cloisters and church perhaps they are kept for that purpose  parmadome of church frescoed by correggio all heaven upsidedown fat angels turning somersaults saints like butchers and martyrs simpering feebly like cs babies much better heaven cant be painted and theyd better not try madonna by girolamo was lovely room of the abbess with rosy children peeping through the lattice very charming madonna della scodellathe boy christ very charming the old farnese theatre most interesting got a scrap of canvas from a mouldy scene dead old place is parma  bolognadrove in a pelting rain to the academy and saw many pictures a pietà by guido was very striking the desolate mother with her dead son on her knees haunted me long afterwards st jerome and the infant christ by elizabeth sirani i liked raphael wont suit yet sad for me but i cannot admire madonnas with faces like fashionplates or dropsical babies with no baby sweetness about them  florencebought furs nice climate to bring invalids into always did think italy a humbug and i begin to see i was right acres of pictures like about six out of the lot cant bear the venus or titians famous hussy hanging over it like his portraits much busts of roman emperors great fun such bad heads the julias faustinas and agrippinas with hair dressed like a big sponge on the brow were so comical i was never tired of looking at them i see now where the present bedlamite style of coiffure comes from  the philosophers c were very interesting cicero so like wendell phillips that i could hardly help clapping my hands and saying hear hear  gave a a sad blow by saying the campanile looked like an inlaid workbox did not admire it half so much as i did a magnificent stone pine best of all saw in the old monastery of st marco many works of fra angelico i love his pictures for he put his pious heart into them and one sees and feels it and i dont care if his saints do have six joints to their fingers and impossible noses a very dear picture of providenzapoor monks at an empty table and angels bringing bread  angelicos picture of heaven was more to my mind than any i have seen no stern avenging god no silly madonna but happy souls playing like children or singing and piping with devout energy  relics of savonarolahis cell bust beads haircloth shirt and a bit of wood from the pile on which they burnt him i like relics of one man who really lived worked and suffered better than armies of angels or acres of gods and goddesses  pleasant drives saw artists casa guidi windows and a model baby house with dollys name on the door and steps modelled by hands that have made famous statues papas baby house was best of all his works to me a nice little earthquake and a trifle of snow to enhance the charms of this sweet spot  visited parkers grave and was afflicted to find it in such an unlovely crowded cemetery it does not matter after all his best monument is in the hearts that love him and the souls he fed as i stood there a little brown bird hopped among the vines that covered the grave pecked its breakfast from a dry seedpod perched on the headstone with a grateful twitter as grace after meat and flew away leaving me comforted by the little sermon it had preached   i dont wish to hurt your feelings dear but if this is rome i must say it is a very nasty place began lavinia as they went stumbling through the mud and confusion of a big unfinished station on their arrival at the eternal city  people of sense dont judge a place at ten oclock of a pitchdark rainy night especially if they are hungry tired and excuse me love rather cross returned amanda severely as they piled into a carriage and drove to piazzi di spagna  i see a divine fountain a splendid palace now its a statue of some sort i do believe that dark figure was a monk i know i shall like it in spite of everything cried matilda excitedly flattening her nose against the window  she had been much disappointed at not being able to enter rome by daylight so that she might clasp her hands and cry aloud halfstifled with the overpowering emotions of the moment roma roma the eternal city bursts upon my view that was the proper thing to do and it was a blow to make so commonplace and ignoble an entry into the city of her dreams  early next morning livy was roused from slumber by cries of delight and starting up beheld her artist sister wrapped in a dressinggown with dishevelled hair staring out of the window and murmuring incoherently  spanish steps thats where the models sit propaganda famous jesuit school hope i shall see the little students in their funny hats and gowns thats the great monument thing put up to settle the immaculate conception fuss very fine but the apostles look desperately tired of holding it up dear old houses heavens theres a trattoria man with somebodys breakfast on his head dont see any costumes where are the sheepskin suits the red skirts and white headcloths girl with flowers oh how lovely mercy on us theres an officer staring up here and i never saw him  in came the blond head and the blue dressinggown vanished from the eyes of the handsome soldier who had been attitudinizing with his high boots gray and scarlet cloak jingling sword and becoming barrette cap for the especial benefit of the enraptured stranger  livy it is just superb get up and come out at once it is clouding up and i must have one look or lose my mind said matilda flying about with unusual energy  you will have to get used to rain if you stay here long my child returned the raven  and she was right it poured steadily for two months with occasional flurries of snow also thunder likewise hurricanes the tramontàna the sirocco and all the other charming features of an italian winter that nothing might be wanting a nice little inundation was got up for their benefit december 28th  sitting peacefully at breakfast on the morning of that day in their cosey apartment with a fire of cones and olivewood cheerily burning on the hearth jokerella the big cat purring on the rug the little coffeepot proudly perched among bread and butter eggs and fruit while the ladies in dressinggowns and slippers lounged luxuriously in armchairs one red one blue one yellow they the ladies not the chairs were started by agrippina the maid who burst into the room like a bombshell announcing all in one breath that the tiber had risen inundated the whole city and instant death was to be the doom of all  rushing to the window to see if the flood had quite covered the steps and cut off all retreat the friends were comforted to observe no signs of water except that halffrozen in the basin of the fountain above which leaned their favourite old triton with an icicle on the end of his nose  i must go and attend to this the poor will suffer we may be able to help said livy forgetting her bones and beginning to scramble on her fur boots as if the safety of the city depended on her  the others followed suit and leaving jokerella to ravage the table they hurried forth to see what father tiber was up to a most reprehensible prank apparently for the lower parts of the city were under water and many of the great streets already as full of boats as venice  the corso was a deep and rapid stream and the shopkeepers were disconsolately paddling about trying to rescue their property  our dresses our beautiful new dresses where are they now wailed the girls surveying mazzonis grand store with water up to the balcony where many milliners wrung their hands lamenting  the piazza del popolo was a lake with the four stone lions just visible and still spouting water though it was a drug in the market in at the open gate rolled a muddy stream bearing haystacks brushwood and drowned animals along the corso people stood on their balconies wondering what they should do many breakfastless for how could the trattoria boys safely waft their coffeepots across such canals of water carriages splashed about in shallower parts with agitated loads hurrying to drier quarters many were coming down ladders into boats and crowds stood waiting their turn with bundles of valuables in their hands  the soldiers were out in full force working gallantly to save life and property making rafts carrying people on their backs and going through the inundated streets with boatloads of food for the hungry shut up in their illprovided houses usually at such times the priests did this work but now they stood idly looking on and saying it was a judgment on the people for their treatment of the pope the people were troubled because the priests refused to pray for them but otherwise they snapped their fingers at the sullen old gentlemen in the vatican and the brisk brave troops worked for the city quite as well the heretics thought better than the snuffy priests  in the ghetto the disaster was truly terrible for the flood came so suddenly that the whole quarter was under water in an hour the scene was pitiful for here the jews live packed like sardines in a box and being washed out with no warning were utterly destitute in one street a man and woman were seen wading up to their waists in water pushing an old mattress before them on which were three little children all they had saved  later in the day as boats of provisions came along women and children swarmed at the windows crying bread bread and their wants could not be supplied in spite of the care of the city authorities one old woman who had lost everything besought the rescuers to bring her a little snuff for the love of heaven which was very characteristic of the race one poor man in trying to save a sick wife and his little ones in a cart upset them and the babies were drowned at their own door comedy and tragedy side by side  outside the city houses were carried off people lost and bridges swept away so sudden and violent was the flood the heavy rains and warm winds melted the snow on the mountains and swelled the river till it rose higher than at any time since 1805  many strangers who came to rome for the christmas holidays sat in their fine apartments without food fire light or company till taken off in boats or supplied by hoisting stores in at the windows  we can hold out some time as we live on a hill and pina has laid in provisions for several days but if the flood lasts we shall come to want for the woodyards are under water the railroads down and the peasants cant get into the city to bring supplies unless the donkeys swim said amanda reviewing the situation  never mind its so exciting only we must not forget that we engaged to go and see the roastpig aurora today answered matilda who insisted on pronouncing rospigliosi in that improper manner  i like this infinitely better than any of your picturesque refrigerators and it thrills me more to watch one of those dear dirty soldiers save women and babies than to see a dozen dying gladiators gasping for centuries in immortal marble added lavinia who had shocked her artistic friends by sniffing at the famous statue and wishing the man would die and done with it and not lie squirming there  come away mat she has no soul for art and it is all in vain to try and breathe one into her said amanda with the calm pity of one who had read up every great picture studied up every famous statue and knew what to admire when to thrill and just where the various emotions should come in  so they left the outcast perched on a wall waving her muff at them and calling out nater for ever to the great horror of an english lady who would have seen all rome upset without any unseemly excitement  that night the gas gave out and mysterious orders were left at houses for lamps to be kept burning till morning thieves abounded and the ladies prepared their armsone pistol one dagger and a large umbrellathen slept peacefully undisturbed by the commotion in the kitchen where cats live chickens and pinas five grandmothers all lived together rent free  amandas last prediction was that they would find themselves gently floating out at the porta pia about midnight mat wailed for a submerged gallery in which she had hoped to ice herself on the morrow and livy indulged the sinful hope that the pope would get his pontifical petticoats very wet be a little drowned and terribly scared by the flood because he spoilt the christmas festivities and shut up all the cardinals red coaches  next day the water began to abate and people made up their minds that the end of the world was not yet gentlemen paid visits on the backs of stout soldiers ladies went shopping in boats and family dinners were handed in at twostory windows without causing any remark so quickly do people adapt themselves to the inevitable  hardly had the watery excitement subsided when a new event set the city in an uproar  the king was not expected till the tenth of january but the kind soul could not wait and as soon as the road was passable he came with 300000 francs in his hands to see what he could do for his poor romans he arrived at 4 am and though unexpected the news flew through the city and a crowd turned out with torches to escort him to the quirinal  again did the explosive pina burst in upon her mistresses with the news this time in tears of joy for the people began to think the king would never come and therefore were especially touched by this prompt visit in the midst of their trouble the handsome damsel was a spectacle herself so dramatic was she as she shook her fist at the pope and cheered for the king with a ladle in one hand an artichoke in the other her fine eyes flashing and her mellow voice trembling while she talked regardless of the polenta going to destruction in the fryingpan  on went the bonnets out flew the ladies and rushed up to the quirinal where stood a great crowd waiting eagerly for a sight of the king  there was a great bustle among the officials and splendid creatures in new uniforms ran about in all directions grand carriages arrived bringing the high and mighty gaping but loyal to greet their lord general marmoraa thin shabby energetic manwas everywhere for the new order of things seemed a little hitchy dorias and colonnas gladdened plebeian eyes and the people cheered every thing from the commanderinchief to somebodys breakfast borne through the crowd by a stately jeames in livery who graciously acknowledged the homage  for one mortal hour our ladies stood in a pelting rain and then retired feeling that the sacrifice of their best hats was all that could reasonably be expected of freeborn americans they consoled themselves by putting out pinas fine italian banner made in secret and kept ready for her king for the padrona was papalino and supporting it by two little american flags the stars and stripes of which much perplexed the boys and donkeys disporting themselves in the piazza barberini  but the excitement was so infectious that the girls could not resist another run after royalty so while livy consoled herself with the fire and the cat they took a carriage and chased the king till they caught him at the capitol they had a fine view of him as he came down the long steps almost alone and at the peril of his life through a mass of people cheering frantically and whitening the streets with waving handkerchiefs  the enthusiastic damsels mounted up beside the driver and hurrahed with all their hearts and voices as well they might for it certainly was a sight to see the courage of the king in trusting himself in a city full of enemies touched the people quite as much as the kindly motive that brought him there and kept him sacred in their eyes  the girls had a second view of him on the balcony of the quirinal for the populace clamoured so for another sight of il rè that the popes best velvet hangings were hastily spread and victor emmanuel came out and bowed to his people who stood on their heads with joy as amanda expressed it  he was in citizens dress and looked like a stout brown soldierly man not so ugly as the pictures of him but not an apollo by any means  hating ceremony and splendour he would not have the fine apartments prepared for him but chose a plain room saying keep the finery for my son if you like i prefer this  he drove through the ghetto and all the desolated parts of the city to see with his own eyes the ruin made and then desired the city fathers to give to the poor the money they had set apart to make a splendid welcome for him  he only spent one day and returned to florence at night all rome was at the station to see him off ladies with carriages full of flowers troops of soldiers and throngs of poor people blessing him like a saint for this kingly sympathy of his had won all hearts  when he does make his grand entry we will decorate our balcony and have our six windows packed with loyal yankees who will hurrah their best for the honest man as they call victor emmanueland that is high praise for a king  so said the three and while waiting for the event which did not occur in their day however they indulged in all the pastimes modern rome afforded they shivered through endless galleries getting cricks in their necks staring at frescoes and injuring their optic nerves poring over pictures so old that often nothing was visible but a mahoganycoloured leg an oily face or the dim outline of a green saint in a whirlwind of pink angels  they grubbed in catacombs and came up mouldy they picnicked in the tomb of cæcelia metella flirted in the palace of the cæsarsnot in the classical manner howevergot cold by moonlight in the colosseum and went sketching in the baths of caracalla which last amusement generally ended in the gentlemen and ladies drawing each other and returning delighted with the study of art in dear rome  they went to fancy parties where artists got themselves up like their own statues and pictures and set mediæval fashions which it was a pity the rest of the world did not follow they drank much social tea with titled beings as thick as blackberries and better still men and women who had earned noble names for themselves with pencil pen or chisel they paid visits in palaces where the horses lived in the basement rich foreigners on the first floor artists next and princes in the attic  they went to the hunt and saw scarlet coats fine horses bad riding many hounds and no foxes  as a change they got up game parties à la little athens in their own small salon introduced the potatoe pantomime had charades and enacted the immortal jarleys waxworks on one of the seven hills  a true yankee breakfast of fishballs johnnycake and diptoast was given in their honour and its delights much enhanced by its being eaten in a lovely room with reeds and rushes on the palegreen walls shellshaped chairs and coral mirrorframes what a thing it was to consume those familiar viands in a famous palace with guidos cenci downstairs a great sculptor next door three lovely boys as waiters and titian t to head the feast and follow it up with dates from the nile and egyptian sketches that caused the company to vote a speedy adjournment to the land of corkendills and pyramids  these and many other joys they tasted and when all else palled upon them they drove on the campagna and were happy  it is sad to be obliged to record that these quiet drives were the especial delight of the unsocial lavinia whose illregulated mind soon wearied of swell society classical remains and artistic revelry ancient rome would have suited her excellently she thought but modern rome was such a chaos of frivolity and fanaticism poverty and splendour dirt and devilry dead grandeur and living ignorance that she felt as if shut up in a magnificent tomb the bad air of which was poisoning both body and soul  her only consolation was the new freedom that seemed to blow over rome like a wholesome wind old residents lamented the loss of the priestly pageants fêtes and ceremonies but this republican spinster preferred to see rome guarded by her own troops and governed by her own king who ordered streets to be cleaned fountains filled schools opened and all good institutions made possible rather than any amount of papal purple covering poverty ignorance and superstition better than the sight of all the red coaches that ever rumbled was the spectacle of many boys quitting the jesuit college and demanding admittance into the free schools and sweeter than the music of all the silver trumpets that ever blew were the voices of happy men and women singing once forbidden songs of liberty in the streets of rome  these sentiments and others equally unfashionable were only breathed into the ear of sister matilda when the two retired to the campagna to confide to one another the secrets of their soulsa process necessary about once a week for after visiting studios going to parties and telling polite fibs about everything they saw it was impossible to exist without finding a vent of some sort once out among the aqueducts matilda could freely own that she thought genius a rare article in the studios where she expected to learn so much and lavinia could make the awful avowal that parties at which the order of performance was gossip tea musicthen music tea and gossip all togetherwere not her idea of intellectual society their criticisms on pictures and statues cannot be recorded without covering their humble names with infamy and why the sky did not fall upon or the stones rise up and smite these vandals is a mystery to this day  they did enjoy much in their own improper manner but poor amandas sufferings can better be imagined than described so when lavinia early in march proposed to flee to the mountains before they became quite demoralized and learned to steal and stab as well as lie and lounge she readily assented and they retired to albano  the decline and fall of the roman empire was nothing to this and never have i seen such unappreciative women as you two sighed amanda as they rolled away from numero due piazza barberini leaving agrippina sobbing at the top of the stairs and the padrona bobbing little curtsies at the bottom  i am sure the cenci will haunt me all my days and so will many other famous things said matilda while her eye roved fondly from a very brown capuchin monk to a squad of bersaglieri trotting by with jaunty cocks feathers dancing in the wind muskets gleaming and trim boots skipping through the mud with martial regularity  when i get the contents of my head sorted out i shall doubtless rejoice that i have seen rome but just now all that i can clearly recall are the three facts that the pope had a fit our dear man romeo got very tipsy one night and that we went to see the sistine chapel the day the eclipse made it as dark as a pocket yes continued lavinia with an air of decision i am glad to have seen this classical cesspool and still more glad to have got out of it alive she added sniffing the air from the mountains as if the odour of sanctity which pervaded the holy city did not suit her  it blew great guns up at albano and the society consisted chiefly of donkeys but the ladies enjoyed themselves nevertheless and felt better and better every day for early hours much exercise and no æsthetic tea soon set them up after the dissipation of the winter  three pleasing events diversified their stay the first happened the day after they arrived the girls went forth early to look about them and to see if they could find a little apartment where all could be more comfortable than in the breezy rooms at the hotel following the grassy road that winds down the valley below the viaduct they came to a lovely garden and finding the gate open went in a queer old villa was perched on the hill above and a manly form was observed to be leaning from a balcony as if enjoying the fine view from the height  i fancied that house was empty or we wouldnt have come in never mind we wont go back now and if any one comes after us we will apologize and say we lost our way going to ajaccio said amanda as they went calmly forward among the posybeds that lay blooming on the hillside  it was well they prepared themselves for the manly form suddenly disappeared from the balcony and a moment afterwards came swiftly towards them through the shrubs  a comely young gentleman who greeted them with italian grace accepted their apology smiling and begged them to walk in his garden whenever they liked it was always open he said and the peasants often used that path admiring but never hurting a leaf hearing that they were in search of an apartment he instantly begged them to come up and look at some rooms in the villa his father was a refugee from france and desired to let a part of his house come and behold these delightful rooms  so charming was the interest he took in the errant damsels that they could not resist and after rolling up their eyes at one another to express their enjoyment of the adventure they graciously followed the handsome youth into the villa  with confiding hospitality he took them everywhereinto his mothers room the kitchen and nursery in the latter place they found two small boys who bore such a striking resemblance to napoleon i that the girls spoke of it and were enraptured at the reply they received  truly yes we belong to the family my mother is a buonaparte my father count   heres richness and romance what will livy say whispered the girls to one another as their guide left them in the salon and went to find his father  she will scold us for coming here said amanda remembering her own lectures on the proprieties  yes but she will forgive us the minute we say napoleon for that bad little man is one of her heroes added mat pretending to be admiring the view while she privately examined a lady in a bower belowa stout dark lady with all the family traits so strongly marked that there could be no doubt of the young mans assertion  presently he came back with an affable old gentleman who evidently had an eye to the main chance for in spite of his elegance and affability he asked a great price for his rooms and felt that any untitled stranger should be glad to pay well for the honour of living under the roof of a buonaparte  amanda left the decision to her invisible duenna and with a profusion of compliments and thanks they got away being gallantly escorted to the gate by the young count who filled their hands with flowers and gazed pensively after them as if he found the society of two bright american girls very agreeable after that of his lofty parents or the peasantry of the town  home they ran and bounced in upon livy blooming and breathless to pour out their tale and suggest an immediate departure to the blissful spot where counts and crocuses flourished with italian luxuriance  but after the first excitement had subsided lavinia put a wet blanket on the entire plan by declaring that she would never board with any grasping old patrician who would charge for every bow and fall back on his ancestors if he was found cheating she would go and look at the place but not enter it nor be beholden to the resident apollo for so much as a dandelion  so the mourning damsels led the griffin over the viaduct through the dirty little town by the villa on its least attractive side up at the window were the two little napoleonic heads with big black eyes strong chins and dark hair streaked across wide olivecoloured foreheads a vision of papa was visible in the garden pruning a vine with gloves on his aristocratic hands and a shabby velvet coat on his highly connected back also afar off on the balconyoh sight to touch a maidens heartwas the young count gazing wistfully towards albano he did not see the charmers as they crept down the rough road close to the garden wall and went sadly home along the blooming path to the tomb of the four thimbles as livy irreverently called the ruin which has an ornament at each of its corners like a gigantic thimble of stone  a note in amandas most elegant french declining the apartments in the name of madame duenna closed the door of this eden upon the wandering peris who entered never more now and then as they went clattering by on their donkeys to lake nemi or some other picturesque spot        they saw again the crocus bloom      and leaning from that lofty room      sir launcelot with face of gloom            look down to camelot      up flew their veils and floated wide      but livy pinned them to her side      the curse has come upon us cried           the ladies of shalott   the second adventure befell amanda alone and in this wise  going one day to rome on business she found herself shut up in a car with a gorgeous officer and a meek young man who read papers all the way the tall soldier in his gray and silver uniform with a furred frogged and braided jacket not to mention the high boots or the becoming cap was so very polite to the lone lady that she could not remain dumb without positive rudeness so amanda conversed in her most charming manner finding inspiration doubtless in the dark eyes and musical voice of her handsome visàvis for the officers from turin are things of beauty and joys for ever to those who love to look on manly men  among other things the two had a little joke about the baron rothschild who rode about albano on a tiny donkey with two servants behind him also the baroness a painfully plain woman with an ugly dog the image of herself  when they arrived at rome however their joke was turned against them by the discovery that the meek man was the barons secretary who would doubtless repeat their chat at headquarters to see the handsome man slap his brow and then laugh like a boy at the fun was worth a longer journey amanda thought as he put her into a carriage gave her his best martial salute and went clanking away about his own affairs  amanda returned at 4 pm and her emotions may be imagined when the dark face of her officer peered in at the car window and the melodious voice asked if he might be permitted to enter of course he might and as no secretary now spoilt the têteàtête mars became delightfully confidential and poured his woes into the sympathising bosom of amanda  it had been a great affliction to him that his regiment was quartered at albano for some months mio dio so dull was it life had already become a burden but now if the signorina was to be there if she permitted him to make himself known to her party what joys were in store for him the signorina loved to ride behold he had superb horses languishing in the stables that henceforth were dedicated to her use his fellow officers were gentlemen of good family brave as lions and dying of ennui if they might be presented to the ladies life would be worth having and albano a paradise c  to all this devotion the prudent amanda listened with pleasure but promised nothing till signore mars had made the acquaintance of certain american gentleman and married ladies then it would be possible to enjoy the delights of which he spoke the colonel vowed he would instantly devote himself to this task and thus they came to the lonely little station at albano  amanda had ordered the carriage to meet her but it was not there and she was forced to wait till all her fellowpassengers were gone all but the gallant officer who decorously remained outside marching to and fro as if on guard till his servant came with his horse then he begged to be allowed to see why the carriage did not come and amanda consented for night was falling and two miles of mud lay between her and home  away dashed the servant but his master did not follow standing in the doorway he declared that he must remain as the signorinas protector for no trains were due for hours the dépôt man was gone and it was too late for any lady to stay there alone again amanda gratefully consented wondering what would be the end of her adventure and again the stately colonel resumed his march outside singing as he tramped and evidently enjoying the escort duty that gave him so good an opportunity of displaying not only his gallantry but his fine voice and handsome figure  down rattled the carriage at last accompanied to amandas dismay by three of the colonels friends who had evidently received a hint of the affair and had come to have a hand in it  with much bowing of the gentlemen and much prancing of their fine horses amanda was handed to her seat and went lumbering back to the hotel with her splendid escort careering about her to the great edification of the town  when the rescued damsel told the tale to her mates matilda tore her hair and lamented that she had not been there even the stern livy had no lecture for the erring lamb but was as full of interest as either of the girls for anything in the shape of a soldier was dear to her heart  when the ladies rode forth next day three elegant st georges in full rig saluted as these modern unas ambled by on their meek donkeysa performance punctually executed ever afterward whenever the three blue veils appeared much curvetting went on before the hotel door much clanking of spurs and sabres was heard in the little lane on to which the apartment of the ladies looked and splendid officers seemed to spring up like violets in secluded spots where maidens love to stroll  it was all very nice and the girls were beginning to feel that the charms of albano rivalled those of rome when a sad blow upset their castles in the air and desolated the knights over the way  the highly respectable americans who were to serve as the link between the soldiers and the ladies decidedly declined the office objecting to the martial gentleman as being altogether too dangerous to bring into the dovecot so the poor dears sighed in vain and the longing damsels never rode the fine horses that were temptingly paraded before them on all occasions  they did their best but it was soon evident to lavinia that in some unguarded moment the impetuous mat would yield to the spell and go gambading away for a ride sans duenna sans habit sans propriety sans everything amanda likewise seemed losing her head and permitted the darkeyed colonel to talk to her when they met only a momentbut what a perilous moment it waswhen this sixfoot mars leaned over a green hedge and talked about the weather in the softest italian that ever melted a womans heart  im going to venice next week so you may as well make up your minds to it girls i cannot bear this awful responsibility any longer for i am very sure you will both be off to turin with those handsome rascals if we stay much longer my mind is made up and i wont hear a word  thus lavinia with a stern countenance for the romantic old lady felt the charm as much as the girls did and decided that discretion was the better part of valour for the whole party  i should never dare to go home and tell my honoured parents that mat had run away with a man as handsome as jove and as poor as job amandas indignant relatives would rise up and stone me if i let her canter into matrimony with the fascinating colonel who may have a wife and ten children in turin for all we know they must be torn away at once or my character as duenna is lost for ever  having made up her mind livy steeled her heart to all appeals and wrote letters packed trunks and watched her little flock like a vigilant sheepdog  how she would ever have got them through that last week is very uncertain if a providential picnic had not helped her  a fair was held in the town and a delightful surpriseparty was got up among the artists of rome twentyfive came driving over in a big carriage with four gaily decorated horses postilions hampers of lunch flutes and horns and much jollity bottled up for the occasion  a very festive spectacle they made as they drove through the narrow streets with flowers and streamers in their hats singing and joking in true artistic style  they meant to have lunched in the open air but as it was cloudy decided to spread the feast at the hotel such a delightful revel as followed a scene from the decameron modernised would give some idea of it for after the banquet all adjourned to the gardens of the doria villa and there disported themselves as merrily as if all the plagues of life were quite forgotten and death itself among the lost arts flirting and dancing charades and singing stories and statues poems and pictures gossip and gambols absorbed the hours as pleasantly as in the olden time and if the costumes were not as picturesque as those in vedders fine picture the ladies were as lovely the gentlemen as gallant and all much better behaved than those of boccaccios party  a few drops of rain quenched the fun at its height and sent the revellers home as fast as four horses could take them leaving the town gaping after them and our ladies much enlivened by the delights of the day  this third and last event pleasantly ended their sojourn at albano for a day or two later they vanished leaving the dear officers disconsolate till the next batch of travelling ladies came to comfort their despair  a week was spent in venice floating about all day from one delightful old church to another or paying visits to titians and tintorettos buying little turtles photographs or venetian glass eating candied fruit and seeing the doves fed in the square of san marco visiting shops full of dusty antiquities or searching the stalls on the rialto for moorshead rings being rowed to the lido by giacomo in a red sash and lulled to sleep at night by the songs of a chorus that floated under the windows in the moonlight  lavinia never could get used to seeing the butcher the baker and the postman go their rounds in boats matilda was in bliss with a gondola all to herself where she sat surrounded with watercolours trying to paint everything she saw for here the energy she had lost at rome seemed to return to her amanda haunted a certain shop trying to make the man take a reasonable sum for a very ancient and ugly bit of jewellery which she called a sprigalario for want of a better name and after each failure she went off to compose herself with a visit to the doges  of course they all saw the bridge of sighs and the dungeons below with their many horrors likewise a mass at st marks where the patriarch was a fat old soul in red silk even to his shoes and holy pockethandkerchief and the service appeared to consist in six purple priests dressing and undressing him like an old doll while a dozen whitegowned boys droned up in a gold cockloft and many beggars whined on the dirty floor below  do other travellers eat locusts i wonder as ours did one sunny day sitting on church steps and discover that the food of the apostle was not the insect whose zeeing foretells hot weather but the long dry pods of the locusttree sweet to the taste but rather dry fodder as the impious livy remarked after choking herself with a quarter of a yard of it  when the week was up mat implored to be left behind with angela the maid and brio a big poodle possessed of the devil but she was torn away and only consoled by the promise of many new gloves with as many buttons as she pleased when they got to munich  the lakes are the proper entrance into italy and venice a lovely exit one soon tires of it and is ready to leave which is an excellent arrangement though i should prefer to depart in some more cheerful vehicle than a hearse observed lavinia as they left the long black gondola at the steps of the station  havent you a sigh for those lovely lakes a tear for albano a pang of regret for rome asked amanda hoping to wring one moan for italy from the old lady  not a sigh not a tear not a regret i find i like them all better the farther i get from them and by the time i am at home i may be able to say i adore them but i doubt it returned the incorrigible livy and from that moment amanda regarded her granny as one dead to all the dear delusions of antiquity     vi  london   from this moment i cease to be the commanderinchief livy adores england can speak the language understands the money and knows all about london so she shall be leader and i will repose after my long labour with this remark amanda retired from office covered with glory and her mates voted to erect a statue in her honour as a token of their undying gratitude  lavinia took the lead from the moment they landed at st catherines warf and though somewhat demoralized by a rough passage of eighteen hours from antwerp was equal to the occasion she did love england and thought london the most delightful city in the world next to boston its mud and fog were dear to her its beef and beer were nectar and ambrosia after the continental slops and messes its steadygoing respectable citizens beautiful in her eyes and the words home and comfort were not an idle mockery here  therefore the old lady joyfully sniffed the smoky air gazed with tenderness on the grimy houses and cast herself metaphorically speaking into the arms of a stout ruddyfaced porter as if at last she had found a man and a brother  nobly did the burly briton repay her confidence and earn the shilling which in england makes all things possible he bore them to the station got tickets checked luggage put the ladies in a firstclass compartment gave them all necessary directions about the hotel they were after and when the bell rang touched his cap with a smile upon his dear red face which caused lavinia to add a sixpence to the shilling she gave him with a mental blessing  this is truly a decent country see how well one is cared for how civil everybody is how honest how manly began livy as she mounted her hobby and prepared for a canter over the prejudices of her friend for amanda detested england because she knew nothing of it  the cabman cheated us asking double fares replied the dear girl wrapping herself in many cloaks and refusing to admire the fog  not at all cried livy the trunks were immense and youll find we shall have to pay extra for them everywhere it is the same as having them weighed and paying for the pounds only this saves much time and trouble look at the handsome guard in his silverplated harness how much nicer he is than a gabbling italian or a frenchman who compliments you one minute and behaves like a brute the next it does my soul good to see the clean rosy faces and hear good english instead of gibberish  never in my life have i seen such tall finelooking men only they are all fair which isnt my style observed matilda with a secret sigh for the darkeyed heroes from turin  thus conversing they soon came to the g hotel just at the end of the railway and without going out of the station found themselves settled in comfortable rooms  regard if you please these toilette arrangementstwo sorts of bathpan two cans of cold water one of hot two big pitchers much soap and six towels about the size of tablecloths i call that an improvement on the continental cup saucer and napkin accommodation said lavinia proudly displaying a washstand that looked like a dinnertable laid for a dozen such was the display of glass china and napery  the english certainly are a clean people replied amanda softening a little as she remembered her fruitless efforts to find a bathpan in brittany where the people said the drought was caused by the english using so much water  they need more appliances for cleanliness than any other race because they live in such a dirty country began matilda removing the soot from her face in flakes  what more she might have said is unknown for livy closed her mouth with a big sponge and all retired to repose after the trials of the past night  now my dears you shall have food fit for christian women to eat no weak soup no sour wine no veal stewed with raisins nor greasy salad made of all the weeds that grow beef that will make you feel like giants and beer that will cheer the cockles of your hearts not to mention cheese which will make you wink and bread with a little round button atop of the loaf like the grand panjandrum in the old story  thus lavinia enthusiastically as she led her flock of two into the eatingroom at luncheon time being seated at a little table by one of the great windows the old lady continued to sing the praises of britannia while wafting for the repast  isnt this better than a stonefloored café with nine clocks all wrong seven mirrors all cracked much drapery all dirty a flock of garçons who fly about like lunatics and food which i shudder to think of look at this lofty room this grave thick carpet that cheerful coalfire these neat little tables these large clean windows these quiet ministerial waiters who seem to take a paternal interest in your wants and best of all in this simple wholesome wellcooked food  here the arrival of a glorified beefsteak and a shining pintpot of foaming ale give an appropriate finish to livys lecture she fell upon her lunch like a famished woman and was speechless till much meat had vanished and the ale was low in the pot  it is good admitted amanda who took to her beer like a born englishwoman and swallowed some of her prejudices with her delicious beef  its such a comfort to know that i am not eating a calfs brains or a pigs feet that i can enjoy it with a free mind and the sight of those two beautiful old gentlemen gives it an added relish said matilda who had been watching a pair of hale old fellows eat their lunch in a solid leisurely way that would have been impossible to an american  it is so restful to see people take things calmly and not bolt their meals or rush about like runaway steamengines it is this moderation that keeps englishmen so hearty jolly and longlived they dont tear themselves to pieces as we do but take time for rest exercise food and recreation like sensible people as they are it is like reposing on a featherbed to live here and my tired nerves rejoice in it said lavinia eating bread and cheese as if that was her mission in life  a slight amount of haste will be advisable my granny unless we intend to spend all our substance on these restful comforts of yours this hotel is delightfully cosy but expensive so the quicker we go into lodgings the better for us suggested the thrifty amanda seeing that livy was too infatuated to care for cost  ill go the first thing tomorrow and look at the rooms mrs blank recommended to us this afternoon we will rest and write letters unless some one comes to call said livy leading her girls to the readingroom where sleepinviting chairs tables supplied with writingmaterials and groves of newspapers wooed the stranger to repose  hardly were they seated however than jeames brought in the card of a friend who had been told when they would arrive and hastened at once to meet them how pleasant is the first familiar face one sees in a strange land doubly pleasant was mr cs because he brought hospitable invitations from other friends kind welcomes and tickets to several of the art exhibitions then open  hardly had he gone after a halfhours chat than another card was handed and the name it bore caused a slight flutter in the dovecot a friend of miss livys in boston had sent orders to his brother in london to devote himself to the wandering ladies when they came they had never met the poor man didnt care to have his quiet invaded by strange women and to do the honours of london is no small task yet this heroic gentleman obeyed orders without a murmur and leaving his artistic seclusion shouldered his burden with the silent courage of a spartan  a grave dark little man with fine eyes quiet manners and a straightforward way with him that suited blunt livy excellently how he dared to face the three unknown women so calmly listen to their impossible suggestions so politely and offer himself as a slave so cheerfully will for ever remain a mystery to those grateful souls  his first service was to pack them into a cab and bear them safely to the bankers for letters and money and this he followed up by several weeks of servitude which must have been worse than egyptian bondage  two more large ladies joined the party after they were settled in lodgings at kensington but undaunted by the fact this longsuffering man escorted the whole five to galleries and theatres trips into the city and picnics in the country went shopping with them lugged parcels ran errands paid bills and was in fact the sheetanchor of the whole party imagine the emotions of one shy man when called upon to lead a flock of somewhat imposing ladies everywhere to have two cabs full on all occasions to be obliged to support the invalids to follow the caprices of the giddy to gratify the demands of the curious and to hear the gabble of the whole five day after day  bürgers brave man was a coward compared to him for he not only gave his days but his evenings also joining in endless games of whist drinking much weak tea and listening to any amount of twaddle on all subjects  the society was not such as intelligent men enjoy being composed of two egyptian boys and three fussy old ladies one of them was immensely stout wore a bright green cap with halfapint of scarlet cherries bobbing on her brow she talked on all subjects and handed round an album full of her own poems on all occasions the second must have been a sister of mr ts aunt so grim and incoherent was she sitting in the corner she stared at the world around her with an utterly expressionless countenance and when least expected broke out with some startling remark such as if that fence had been painted green we should get to heaven sooner or before i had fits my memory was as good as anybodys but my daughter married a clergyman and took it with her  the third antiquity was the hostess a buxom lady much given to gay attire and reminiscences of past glory before me usband went into public life the strangers innocently supposed the departed mr k to have been an mp at least and were rather taken aback on learning that he had been a pawnbroker  the egyptian youths were handsome dark lads with melodious voices lustrous eyes and such fiery tempers that one never knew whether they were going to pass the bread or stab one with the carvingknife  as a slight mitigation of this slow society the russian from pension paradis appeared with his broadcloth more resplendent than ever the ladies had seen him in rome but the fever scared him away and he was now fleeing from another lodginghouse where the hostess evidently intended to marry him to her daughter in the macstinger fashion  in this varied circle did the devoted being aforementioned pass many hours after the days hard labour was happily over and when anyone pitied him for leading the life of a galleyslave he hid his anguish and answered with a smile  my brother told me to do it and i never disobey tom in fact i find i rather like it  that last fib was truly sublime and the name of cassabianca pales before that of one who obeyed fraternal commands to the letter and tried to love his duty heavy as it was if as has been sometimes predicted england had gone under just then it might truly have been said        though prince and peer and poet rare        were sunk among the piles      the noblest man who perished there        was faithful w ns   the sightseeing fever raged fiercely at first and the flock of americans went from windsor castle to the tower of london from westminster abbey to madame taussauds waxwork show with a vigour that appalled the natives they would visit two or three galleries in the morning lunch at dollys the dark little chophouse which johnson goldsmith and the other worthies used to frequent in the good old times go to richmond in the afternoon and dine at the star and garter or to greenwich and eat white baits fish as the russian called that celebrated dish and finish off the evening at some theatre getting home at midnight in a procession of two cabs and a hansom  when the first excitement was over lavinia and matilda took a turn at society having friends in london amanda could not conquer her prejudices sufficiently to accompany them and falling back on the climate as her excuse stayed at home and improved her mind  i feel now like girls in novels you are the duchess of devonshire and i am lady maud plantagenet going to a ball at buckingham palace i know that i was made to sit in the lap of luxury it agrees with me so well said matilda as the two rolled away to aubrey house in a brougham all lamps glass and satin her long blue train lay piled up before her the light flashed on her best roman earrings her curls were in their most picturesque array andcrowning joy of allcreamcoloured gloves with six buttons covered her arms and filled her soul with happiness because they were so elegant and cost so little being bought in rome just after the flood  dowager livy responded gravely from the depths of her silvergrey silk enlivened with pink azaleas  my child thank your stars that you are a freeborn yankee and have no great name or state to keep up buckingham palace is all very well and i shouldnt mind calling on mrs guelph or saxe coburg whichever it is but i much prefer to be going to the house of a radical mp who is lending a hand to all good works mrs t is a far more interesting woman to me than victoria for her life is spent in helping her fellowcreatures i consider her a model englishwomansimple sincere and accomplished full of good sense intelligence and energy her house is open to all friend and stranger black and white rich and poor great men and earnest women meet there mazzini and frances power cobbe john bright and jean ingelow rossetti the poet and elizabeth garrett the brave little doctor though wealthy and living in an historical mansion the host is the most unassuming man in it and the hostess the simplest dressed lady their money goes in other ways and the chief ornament of that lovely spot is a school where poor girls may get an education mrs t gave a piece of her own garden for it and teaches there herself aided by her friends who serve the poor girls like mothers and sisters and help to lift them up from the slough of despond in which so many sink that beats anything youll find in buckingham palace sister mat  if they want a drawingteacher ill offer myself for i think that is regularly splendid said matilda warmly as livy paused for breath after her harangue  with these new ideas in her head lady maud enjoyed her party while the duchess revelled in radicals to her hearts content for aubrey house was their headquarters and all were out in full force it was cheering to our spinster to find that things had moved a good deal since a former visit five or six years before when mill had carried into the house of commons a womans rights petition that filled both arms people laughed then and the stouthearted women laughed also but said our next petition shall be so big it will have to go in a wheelbarrow now the same people talked over the question soberly and began to think something besides fun might come of it the pioneers rejoiced over several hardwon battles and the scoffers came to see that the truest glory was won by those who did the hard work and stood by a good cause when most unpopular not by those who kept out of the field till the fight was over and then came in to wave the flags and beat the drums over victories they had not helped to win  it seems to me that these englishwomen make less noise and do more work than we americans i shouldnt dare to say so in public but their quiet orderly ways suits me better than the more demonstrative performances of my friends at home slow coaches as we call them i should not be surprised if they got the suffrage before we did as the tortoise won in the fable was lavinias secret thought as they drove away after a very charming evening  perhaps the fact that reforms of all sorts had been poured into her ears till her head was like a hive of bees may account for this unpatriotic thought or it may be the pleasant effect of the healthful aspect of these english workers old or young all seemed to have cheerful wellbalanced minds in strong healthy bodies no one complained of her nerves or let them unconsciously put a sharp edge to her tongue give a blue tinge to the world or sour the milk of human kindness in her heart less quick and bright perhaps than the ladies over the sea but more womanly and full of a quiet tenacity of purpose better than eloquence  miss livys tastes being of a peculiar sort and pictures having palled upon her to such a degree that she couldnt even look at an ornamental signboard without disgust she often left her more artistic friends and went forth on excursions of her own as she never used either map or guide book it was a wonder how she found her way and the infants were often on the point of sending for the city crier if there is such a functionary to find the lost duenna but old livy always turned up at last mud to the eyes tired out and more deeply impressed than ever with the charms of london  one day she set forth to hear spurgeon being told that lambeth was a wretched quarter of the city that the tabernacle was two or three miles away and very difficult to enter when found only added zest to the thing and she departed sure of finding adventures if not spurgeon  if an omnibus conductor had not befriended her she would probably have found herself at hampstead or chelsea for london busses are as bewildering as london streets thanks to this amiable man who evidently felt that the stranger in his gates needed all his care the old lady safely reached the elephant and castle and was dismissed with a moss rosebud from the lips of her friend a reassuring pat on the shoulder and a paternal ere yer are my dear which unexpected attentions caused her to depart with speed  there certainly was need of a tabernacle in that quarter for the poverty and wickedness were very dreadful boys not yet in their teens staggered by halftipsy or lounged at the doors of ginshops bonnetless girls roamed about singing and squabbling forlorn babies played in the gutter and men and women in every stage of raggedness and degradation marred the beauty of that fair sunday morning  crowds were swarming into the tabernacle but thanks to the order a friend had given her miss livy was handed to a comfortable seat with a haggard magdalen on one side and a palsystricken old man on the other staring about her she saw an immense building with two galleries extending round three sides and a double sort of platform behind and below the pulpit which was a little pen lifted high that all might see and hear  every seat aisle windowledge step and doorway was packed with a strange congregation all nations all colours all ages and nearly all bearing the sad marks of poverty or sin they all sung cried out if anything affected or pleased them in the sermon and listened with interest to the plain yet fervent words of the man who has gathered together this flock of black sheep and is so faithful a shepherd to them  every one knows how spurgeon looks in pictures but in the pulpit he reminded livy of martin luther a square florid face stout figure a fine keen eye and a natural decided manner very impressive a strong clear voice of much dramatic power and a way of walking the pulpit like father taylor  his sermon was on small temptations and he illustrated it by facts and examples taken from real life pointing out several of his congregation and calling them by name which original proceeding seemed to find favour with his people he used no notes but talked rather than preached and leaning over the railing urged argued prayed and sang with a hearty eloquence very effective and decidedly refreshing after high church mummery abroad and drowsy unitarianism at home now and then he stopped to give directions for the comfort of his flock in a free and easy manner which called up irresistible smiles on the faces of strangers  mrs flacker youd better take that child into the anteroom hes tired come this way friends theres plenty of room open all the windows manning its very warm and when a sad sort of cry interrupted him he looked down at an old woman shaking with epilepsy and mildly remarked dont be troubled brethren our sister is subject to fits and preached tranquilly on  for two hours he held that great gathering in spite of heat discomfort and other afflictions of the flesh and ended by saying in a paternal way  now remember what ive said through the week and next sunday show me that i havent talked in vain  he read a list of meetings for every night in the week one especially struck livy as it was for mothers to meet and talk over with him the best ways of teaching and training their children spurgeon evidently does not spare his own time and strength and whatever his creed may be he is a good christian in loving his neighbour better than himself and doing the work his hand finds to do with all his might  that is a better church than most of those i enter where respectable saints have the best seats and there is no place for sinners said livy when she got home spurgeons congregation preached more eloquently to me than he did the magdalen cried as if her heart was broken and i am sure those tears washed some of her sins away the feeble old man looked as if he had found a staff for his trembling hands to lay hold upon and the forlorn souls all about me for a time at least laid down their burdens and found rest and comfort in their fathers house it did me more good than the preaching of all the bishops in london or the finest pageant at st pauls and i am truly glad i went though the saucy conductor did smirk at me over the rosebud  in contrast to this serious expedition the old lady had a very jolly one not long afterward a certain congenial professor asked her one day what person place or thing in london she most desired to see  clasping her hands with the energy of deep emotion she replied  the home of the immortal sairy gamp long ago i made a vow if i ever came to london id visit that spot let me keep my vow  you shall responded the professor with a responsive ardour which caused livy to dive into her waterproof without another word  away they went in a pouring rain and what people thought of the damp but enthusiastic couple who pervaded the city that day i cant say i only know a merrier pair of pilgrims never visited those grimy shrines they met several old friends and passed several familiar spots by the way major bagstock and cousin phenix stared at them from a clubhouse window tigg montagues cab dashed by them in regent street more gorgeous than ever the brothers cheeryble went trotting cityward arm in arm with a smile and hapenny for all the beggars they met and the micawber family passed them in a bus going i suppose to accompany the blighted wilkins to gaol  in a certain grimly genteel street they paused to stare up at a row of grimly respectable houses for though the name wasnt on any of the doors they were sure mr dombey still lived there a rough dog lay on one of the doorsteps and a curtain fluttered at an open upper window poor di was growling in his sleep and above there little paul was watching for the golden water on the wall while faithful florence sung to him and susan nipper put away derisive sniffs and winks in closets and behind doors for the benefit of them pipchinses  coming to a poorer part of the city they met tiny tim tapping along on his little crutch passed toby veck at a windy streetcorner and saw all the little tetterbys playing in the mud  come down this street and take a glimpse at st giless the worst part of london said the professor and following livy saw misery enough in five minutes to make her heart ache for the day a policeman kept near them saying it wasnt safe to go far there alone  vice poverty dirt and suffering reigned supreme within a stones throw of one of the great thoroughfares and made alsatia dangerous ground for respectable feet here too they saw familiar phantoms poor jo perpetually moving on and little oliver led by nancy with a shawl over her head and a black eye bill sykes lounging in a doorway looking more ruffianly than ever and the artful dodger who kept his eye on them as two hopeful plants with profitable pockets ready for him  they soon had enough of this and hurried on along high holborn till they came to kingsgate street so like the description that i am sure dickens must have been there and taken notes they knew the house in a moment there were the two dingy windows over the birdshop the checked curtains were drawn but of course the bottomless bandboxes the wooden pippins green umbrella and portrait of miss harris were all behind them it seemed so real that they quite expected to see a red snuffy old face appear and to hear a drowsy voice exclaim drat that bell im a coming dont tell me its mrs wilkins without even a pincushion prepared  while livy stood gazing in silent satisfaction merely regretting that the name on the door was pendergast not sweedlepipes the professor turned to a woman and asked with admirable gravity can you tell me where mrs gamp lives  whats her business demanded the matron with interest  a nurse maam  is she a little fat woman  fat decidedly and old returned the professor without a smile on his somewhat cherubic countenance  well she lives no 5 round the corner  on receiving this unexpected reply they looked at one another in comic dismay but would certainly have gone to no 5 and taken a look at the modern sairy if the woman hadnt called out as they moved on  i blieve that nusss name is britiain not gamp but you can ask  murmuring a hasty thank you they fled precipitately round the corner and there enjoyed a glorious laugh under an umbrella to the great amazement of all beholders  being on a dickens pilgrimage they went to furnivals inn where he wrote pickwick in a threestory room and read it to the old porter the same old porter told them all about it and quite revelled in the remembrance it did ones heart good to see the stiff driedup old fellow thaw and glow with the recollection of the handsome young man who was kind to him long ago before the world had found him out  did you think the book would be famous when he read it to you in 1834 as you say asked the professor beaming at him in a way that would have melted the heart of the stifftailed lion of the northumberlands if hed possessed such an organ  o dear yes sir i felt sure it would be summat good it made me laugh so he didnt think much of it but i know a good thing when i see it and the old man gave an important nod as if all the credit of the blessed pickwick belonged to him he married miss hogarth while livin here and you can see the room if you like he added with a burst of hospitality as the almighty sixpence touched his palm  up they went over the worn stairs and finding the door locked solemnly touched the brass knob read the name ed peck on the plate and wiped their feet on a very dirty mat it was ridiculous of course but heroworship is not the worst of modern follies and when ones hero has won from the world some of its heartiest smiles and tears one may be forgiven for a little sentiment in a dark entry  next they went to the saracens head where mr squeers stopped when in london the odd old place looked as if it hadnt changed a particle there was the wooden gallery outside where the chambermaids stood to see the coach off the archway under which poor nicholas drove that cold morning the office or bar where the miserable little boys shivered while they took alternate sips out of one mug and bolted hunches of bread and butter as squeers nagged them in private and talked to them like a father in public livy was tempted to bring away a little porterpot hanging outside the door as a trophy but fearing squeerss squint eye was upon her she refrained and took a muddy pebble instead  they took a peep at the temple and its garden the fountain was not playing but it looked very pleasant nevertheless and as they stood there the sun came out as if anxious that they should see it at its best it was all very well to know that shakespeares twelfth night was played in middle temple hall that the york and lancaster roses grew here that dr johnson lived no 1 inner temple lane and that goldsmith died no 2 brick court middle temple these actual events and people seemed far less real than the scenes between pendennis and fanny john westlock and little ruth pinch for their sakes livy went to see the place and for their sakes she still remembers that green spot in the heart of london with the june sunshine falling on it as it fell that day  the pilgrimage ended with a breathless climb up the monument whence they got a fine view of london and better still of todgerses livy found the house by instinct and saw cherry pecksniff now a sharpnosed old woman sitting at the back window a gaunt anxiouslooking lady in a massive bonnet crossed the yard with a basket in her hand and the professor said at once thats mrs todgers and the amount of gravy single gentlemen eat is still weighing heavy on her mind as if to make the thing quite perfect they discovered fitful glimpses of a tousledlooking boy cleaning knives or boots in a cellarkitchen and all the lawyers in london couldnt have argued them out of their firm belief that it was young bailey undergoing his daily torment in company with the black beetles and the mouldy bottles  that nothing might be wanting to finish off the rainyday ramble in an appropriate manner when livys companion asked what shed have for lunch she boldly replied  weal pie and a pot of porter  as she was not fond of either it was a sure proof of the sincerity of her regard for the persons who have made them immortal they went into an eatinghouse and ordered the lunch finding themselves objects of interest to the other guests but though a walking doormat in point of mud and somewhat flushed and excited by the hustling climbing and adoring it is certain there wasnt a happier spinster in this piljin projess of a wale than the one who partook of weal pie in memory of sam weller and drank a modest quencher to the health of dick swiveller at the end of that delightful dickens day  much might be written about the domestic pleasures of english people but as the compiler of this interesting work believes in the sacredness of private life and has a holy horror of the dreadful people who outrage hospitality by basely reporting all they have seen and heard she will practise what she preaches and firmly resist the temptation to describe the delights of country strolls with poets cosey fiveoclock teas in famous drawingrooms and interviews with persons whose names are household words  this virtuous reticence leaves the best untold and brings the story of two of our travellers to a speedy end matilda decided to remain and study art spending her days copying turner at the national gallery and her evenings in the society of the eight agreeable gentlemen who adorned the house where she abode  amanda hurried home with friends to enjoy a festive summer among the verdant plains of cape cod with deep regret did her mates bid her adieu and nothing but the certainty of soon embracing her again would have reconciled livy to the parting for in amanda she had found that rare and precious treasure a friend  addio my beloved granny take care of your dear bones and come home soon said amanda in the little back entry while her luggage was being precipitated downstairs  heaven bless and keep you safe my own possum i shall not stay long because i cant possibly get on without you moaned livy clinging to the departing treasure as diogenes might have clung to his honest man if he ever found him for with better luck than the old philosopher livy had searched long years for a friend to her mind and got one at last  dont be sentimental girls said matilda with tears in her eyes as she hugged her mandy and bore her to the cab  rome and raphael for ever cried amanda as a cheerful parting salute  london and turner shouted matilda with her answering warcry  boston and emerson sobbed lavinia true to her idols even in the deepest woe  then three damp pockethandkerchiefs waved wildly till the dingy cab with the dear egyptian nose at the window and the little bathpan clattering frantically up aloft vanished round the corner leaving a void behind that all europe could not fill  a few weeks later livy followed leaving mat to enjoy the liberty with which american girls may be trusted when they have a purpose or a profession to keep them steady and so ended the travels of the trio travels which had filled a year with valuable experiences memorable days and that culture which a larger knowledge of the world our fellowmen and ourselves gives to the fortunate souls to whom this pleasure is permitted  one point was satisfactorily proved by the successful issue of this partnership for in spite of many prophecies to the contrary three women utterly unlike in every respect had lived happily together for twelve long months had travelled unprotected safely over land and sea had experienced two revolutions an earthquake an eclipse and a flood yet met with no loss no mishap no quarrel and no disappointment worth mentioning  with this triumphant statement as a moral to our tale we would respectfully advise all timid sisters now lingering doubtfully on the shore to strap up their bundles in light marching order and push boldly off they will need no protector but their own courage no guide but their own good sense and yankee wit and no interpreter if that womans best gift the tongue has a little french polish on it  dear amandas matildas and lavinias why delay wait on no man but take your little store and invest it in something far better than paris finery geneva jewellery or roman relics bring home empty trunks if you will but heads full of new and larger ideas hearts richer in the sympathy that makes the whole world kin hands readier to help on the great work god gives humanity and souls elevated by the wonders of art and the diviner miracles of nature  leave ennui and discontent frivolity and feebleness among the ruins of the old world and bring home to the new the grace the culture and the health which will make american women what now they just fail of being the bravest brightest happiest and handsomest women in the world   printed by spottiswoode and co
