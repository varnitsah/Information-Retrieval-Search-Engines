50017672	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                        a virtuosos collection    the other day having a leisure hour at my disposal i stepped into a new museum to which my notice was casually drawn by a small and unobtrusive sign to be seen here a virtuosos collection  such was the simple yet not altogether unpromising announcement that turned my steps aside for a little while from the sunny sidewalk of our principal thoroughfare  mounting a sombre staircase i pushed open a door at its summit and found myself in the presence of a person who mentioned the moderate sum that would entitle me to admittance  three shillings massachusetts tenor said he  no i mean half a dollar as you reckon in these days  while searching my pocket for the coin i glanced at the doorkeeper the marked character and individuality of whose aspect encouraged me to expect something not quite in the ordinary way  he wore an oldfashioned greatcoat much faded within which his meagre person was so completely enveloped that the rest of his attire was undistinguishable  but his visage was remarkably windflushed sunburnt and weatherworn and had a most unquiet nervous and apprehensive expression  it seemed as if this man had some allimportant object in view some point of deepest interest to be decided some momentous question to ask might he but hope for a reply  as it was evident however that i could have nothing to do with his private affairs i passed through an open doorway which admitted me into the extensive hall of the museum  directly in front of the portal was the bronze statue of a youth with winged feet  he was represented in the act of flitting away from earth yet wore such a look of earnest invitation that it impressed me like a summons to enter the hall  it is the original statue of opportunity by the ancient sculptor lysippus said a gentleman who now approached me  i place it at the entrance of my museum because it is not at all times that one can gain admittance to such a collection  the speaker was a middleaged person of whom it was not easy to determine whether he had spent his life as a scholar or as a man of action in truth all outward and obvious peculiarities had been worn away by an extensive and promiscuous intercourse with the world  there was no mark about him of profession individual habits or scarcely of country although his dark complexion and high features made me conjecture that he was a native of some southern clime of europe at all events he was evidently the virtuoso in person  with your permission said he as we have no descriptive catalogue i will accompany you through the museum and point out whatever may be most worthy of attention  in the first place here is a choice collection of stuffed animals  nearest the door stood the outward semblance of a wolf exquisitely prepared it is true and showing a very wolfish fierceness in the large glass eyes which were inserted into its wild and crafty head still it was merely the skin of a wolf with nothing to distinguish it from other individuals of that unlovely breed  how does this animal deserve a place in your collection inquired i  it is the wolf that devoured little red riding hood answered the virtuoso and by his sidewith a milder and more matronly look as you perceivestands the shewolf that suckled romulus and remus  ah indeed exclaimed i  and what lovely lamb is this with the snowwhite fleece which seems to be of as delicate a texture as innocence itself  methinks you have but carelessly read spenser replied my guide or you would at once recognize the milkwhite lamb which una led but i set no great value upon the lamb  the next specimen is better worth our notice  what cried i this strange animal with the black head of an ox upon the body of a white horse  were it possible to suppose it i should say that this was alexanders steed bucephalus  the same said the virtuoso  and can you likewise give a name to the famous charger that stands beside him  next to the renowned bucephalus stood the mere skeleton of a horse with the white bones peeping through his illconditioned hide but if my heart had not warmed towards that pitiful anatomy i might as well have quitted the museum at once  its rarities had not been collected with pain and toil from the four quarters of the earth and from the depths of the sea and from the palaces and sepulchres of ages for those who could mistake this illustrious steed  it is rosinante exclaimed i with enthusiasm  and so it proved  my admiration for the noble and gallant horse caused me to glance with less interest at the other animals although many of them might have deserved the notice of cuvier himself  there was the donkey which peter bell cudgelled so soundly and a brother of the same species who had suffered a similar infliction from the ancient prophet balaam  some doubts were entertained however as to the authenticity of the latter beast  my guide pointed out the venerable argus that faithful dog of ulysses and also another dog for so the skin bespoke it which though imperfectly preserved seemed once to have had three heads  it was cerberus  i was considerably amused at detecting in an obscure corner the fox that became so famous by the loss of his tail  there were several stuffed cats which as a dear lover of that comfortable beast attracted my affectionate regards  one was dr johnsons cat hodge and in the same row stood the favorite cats of mahomet gray and walter scott together with puss in boots and a cat of very noble aspectwho had once been a deity of ancient egypt  byrons tame bear came next  i must not forget to mention the eryruanthean boar the skin of st georges dragon and that of the serpent python and another skin with beautifully variegated hues supposed to have been the garment of the spirited sly snake which tempted eve against the walls were suspended the horns of the stag that shakespeare shot and on the floor lay the ponderous shell of the tortoise which fell upon the head of aeschylus  in one row as natural as life stood the sacred bull apis the cow with the crumpled horn and a very wildlooking young heifer which i guessed to be the cow that jumped over the moon  she was probably killed by the rapidity of her descent  as i turned away my eyes fell upon an indescribable monster which proved to be a griffin  i look in vain observed i for the skin of an animal which might well deserve the closest study of a naturalistthe winged horse pegasus  he is not yet dead replied the virtuoso but he is so hard ridden by many young gentlemen of the day that i hope soon to add his skin and skeleton to my collection  we now passed to the next alcove of the hall in which was a multitude of stuffed birds  they were very prettily arranged some upon the branches of trees others brooding upon nests and others suspended by wires so artificially that they seemed in the very act of flight  among them was a white dove with a withered branch of oliveleaves in her mouth  can this be the very dove inquired i that brought the message of peace and hope to the tempestbeaten passengers of the ark  even so said my companion  and this raven i suppose continued i is the same that fed elijah in the wilderness  the raven  no said the virtuoso it is a bird of modern date he belonged to one barnaby rudge and many people fancied that the devil himself was disguised under his sable plumage but poor grip has drawn his last cork and has been forced to say die at last this other raven hardly less curious is that in which the soul of king george i  revisited his ladylove the duchess of kendall  my guide next pointed out minervas owl and the vulture that preyed upon the liver of prometheus  there was likewise the sacred ibis of egypt and one of the stymphalides which hercules shot in his sixth labor  shelleys skylark bryants waterfowl and a pigeon from the belfry of the old south church preserved by n p willis were placed on the same perch  i could not but shudder on beholding coleridges albatross transfixed with the ancient mariners crossbow shaft  beside this bird of awful poesy stood a gray goose of very ordinary aspect  stuffed goose is no such rarity observed i  why do you preserve such a specimen in your museum  it is one of the flock whose cackling saved the roman capitol answered the virtuoso  many geese have cackled and hissed both before and since but none like those have clamored themselves into immortality  there seemed to be little else that demanded notice in this department of the museum unless we except robinson crusoes parrot a live phoenix a footless bird of paradise and a splendid peacock supposed to be the same that once contained the soul of pythagoras i therefore passed to the next alcove the shelves of which were covered with a miscellaneous collection of curiosities such as are usually found in similar establishments one of the first things that took my eye was a strangelooking cap woven of some substance that appeared to be neither woollen cotton nor linen  is this a magicians cap i asked  no replied the virtuoso it is merely dr franklins cap of asbestos  but here is one which perhaps may suit you better it is the wishingcap of fortunatus  will you try it on  by no means answered i putting it aside with my hand  the day of wild wishes is past with me  i desire nothing that may not come in the ordinary course of providence  then probably returned the virtuoso you will not be tempted to rub this lamp  while speaking he took from the shelf an antique brass lamp curiously wrought with embossed figures but so covered with verdigris that the sculpture was almost eaten away  it is a thousand years said he since the genius of this lamp constructed aladdins palace in a single night  but he still retains his power and the man who rubs aladdins lamp has but to desire either a palace or a cottage  i might desire a cottage replied i but i would have it founded on sure and stable truth not on dreams and fantasies  i have learned to look for the real and the true  my guide next showed me prosperos magic wand broken into three fragments by the hand of its mighty master  on the same shelf lay the gold ring of ancient gyges which enabled the wearer to walk invisible  on the other side of the alcove was a tall lookingglass in a frame of ebony but veiled with a curtain of purple silk through the rents of which the gleam of the mirror was perceptible  this is cornelius agrippas magic glass observed the virtuoso draw aside the curtain and picture any human form within your mind and it will be reflected in the mirror  it is enough if i can picture it within my mind answered i why should i wish it to be repeated in the mirror  but indeed these works of magic have grown wearisome to me  there are so many greater wonders in the world to those who keep their eyes open and their sight undimmed by custom that all the delusions of the old sorcerers seem flat and stale  unless you can show me something really curious i care not to look further into your museum  ah well then said the virtuoso composedly perhaps you may deem some of my antiquarian rarities deserving of a glance  he pointed out the iron mask now corroded with rust and my heart grew sick at the sight of this dreadful relic which had shut out a human being from sympathy with his race  there was nothing half so terrible in the axe that beheaded king charles nor in the dagger that slew henry of navarre nor in the arrow that pierced the heart of william rufusall of which were shown to me  many of the articles derived their interest such as it was from having been formerly in the possession of royalty  for instance here was charlemagnes sheepskin cloak the flowing wig of louis quatorze the spinningwheel of sardanapalus and king stephens famous breeches which cost him but a crown  the heart of the bloody mary with the word calais worn into its diseased substance was preserved in a bottle of spirits and near it lay the golden case in which the queen of gustavus adolphus treasured up that heros heart among these relics and heirlooms of kings i must not forget the long hairy ears of midas and a piece of bread which had been changed to gold by the touch of that unlucky monarch  and as grecian helen was a queen it may here be mentioned that i was permitted to take into my hand a lock of her golden hair and the bowl which a sculptor modelled from the curve of her perfect breast here likewise was the robe that smothered agamemnon neros fiddle the czar peters brandybottle the crown of semiramis and canutes sceptre which he extended over the sea  that my own land may not deem itself neglected let me add that i was favored with a sight of the skull of king philip the famous indian chief whose head the puritans smote off and exhibited upon a pole  show me something else said i to the virtuoso  kings are in such an artificial position that people in the ordinary walks of life cannot feel an interest in their relics  if you could show me the straw hat of sweet little nell i would far rather see it than a kings golden crown  there it is said my guide pointing carelessly with his staff to the straw hat in question  but indeed you are hard to please here are the sevenleague boots  will you try them on  our modern railroads have superseded their use answered i and as to these cowhide boots i could show you quite as curious a pair at the transcendental community in roxbury  we next examined a collection of swords and other weapons belonging to different epochs but thrown together without much attempt at arrangement  here was arthurs sword excalibar and that of the cid campeader and the sword of brutus rusted with caesars blood and his own and the sword of joan of arc and that of horatius and that with which virginius slew his daughter and the one which dionysius suspended over the head of damocles here also was arrias sword which she plunged into her own breast in order to taste of death before her husband  the crooked blade of saladins cimeter next attracted my notice  i know not by what chance but so it happened that the sword of one of our own militia generals was suspended between don quixotes lance and the brown blade of hudibras  my heart throbbed high at the sight of the helmet of miltiades and the spear that was broken in the breast of epaminondas  i recognized the shield of achilles by its resemblance to the admirable cast in the possession of professor felton nothing in this apartment interested me more than major pitcairns pistol the discharge of which at lexington began the war of the revolution and was reverberated in thunder around the land for seven long years the bow of ulysses though unstrung for ages was placed against the wall together with a sheaf of robin hoods arrows and the rifle of daniel boone  enough of weapons said i at length although i would gladly have seen the sacred shield which fell from heaven in the time of numa  and surely you should obtain the sword which washington unsheathed at cambridge  but the collection does you much credit let us pass on  in the next alcove we saw the golden thigh of pythagoras which had so divine a meaning and by one of the queer analogies to which the virtuoso seemed to be addicted this ancient emblem lay on the same shelf with peter stuyvesants wooden leg that was fabled to be of silver  here was a remnant of the golden fleece and a sprig of yellow leaves that resembled the foliage of a frostbitten elm but was duly authenticated as a portion of the golden branch by which aeneas gained admittance to the realm of pluto  atalantas golden apple and one of the apples of discord were wrapped in the napkin of gold which rampsinitus brought from hades and the whole were deposited in the golden vase of bias with its inscription to the wisest  and how did you obtain this vase said i to the virtuoso  it was given me long ago replied he with a scornful expression in his eye because i had learned to despise all things  it had not escaped me that though the virtuoso was evidently a man of high cultivation yet he seemed to lack sympathy with the spiritual the sublime and the tender  apart from the whim that had led him to devote so much time pains and expense to the collection of this museum he impressed me as one of the hardest and coldest men of the world whom i had ever met  to despise all things repeated i  this at best is the wisdom of the understanding  it is the creed of a man whose soul whose better and diviner part has never been awakened or has died out of him  i did not think that you were still so young said the virtuoso should you live to my years you will acknowledge that the vase of bias was not ill bestowed  without further discussion of the point he directed my attention to other curiosities  i examined cinderellas little glass slipper and compared it with one of dianas sandals and with fanny elsslers shoe which bore testimony to the muscular character of her illustrious foot  on the same shelf were thomas the rhymers green velvet shoes and the brazen shoe of empedocles which was thrown out of mount aetna  anacreons drinkingcup was placed in apt juxtaposition with one of tom moores wineglasses and circes magic bowl  these were symbols of luxury and riot but near them stood the cup whence socrates drank his hemlock and that which sir philip sidney put from his deathparched lips to bestow the draught upon a dying soldier next appeared a cluster of tobaccopipes consisting of sir walter raleighs the earliest on record dr parrs charles lambs and the first calumet of peace which was ever smoked between a european and an indian  among other musical instruments i noticed the lyre of orpheus and those of homer and sappho dr franklins famous whistle the trumpet of anthony van corlear and the flute which goldsmith played upon in his rambles through the french provinces  the staff of peter the hermit stood in a corner with that of good old bishop jewel and one of ivory which had belonged to papirius the roman senator  the ponderous club of hercules was close at hand  the virtuoso showed me the chisel of phidias claudes palette and the brush of apelles observing that he intended to bestow the former either on greenough crawford or powers and the two latter upon washington allston there was a small vase of oracular gas from delphos which i trust will be submitted to the scientific analysis of professor silliman i was deeply moved on beholding a vial of the tears into which niobe was dissolved nor less so on learning that a shapeless fragment of salt was a relic of that victim of despondency and sinful regretslots wife  my companion appeared to set great value upon some egyptian darkness in a blackingjug  several of the shelves were covered by a collection of coins among which however i remember none but the splendid shilling celebrated by phillips and a dollars worth of the iron money of lycurgus weighing about fifty pounds  walking carelessly onward i had nearly fallen over a huge bundle like a peddlers pack done up in sackcloth and very securely strapped and corded  it is christians burden of sin said the virtuoso  o pray let us open it cried i  for many a year i have longed to know its contents  look into your own consciousness and memory replied the virtuoso you will there find a list of whatever it contains  as this was all undeniable truth i threw a melancholy look at the burden and passed on  a collection of old garments banging on pegs was worthy of some attention especially the shirt of nessus caesars mantle josephs coat of many colors the vicar of brays cassock goldsmiths peachbloom suit a pair of president jeffersons scarlet breeches john randolphs red baize huntingshirt the drab smallclothes of the stout gentleman and the rags of the man all tattered and torn  george foxs hat impressed me with deep reverence as a relic of perhaps the truest apostle that has appeared on earth for these eighteen hundred years  my eye was next attracted by an old pair of shears which i should have taken for a memorial of some famous tailor only that the virtuoso pledged his veracity that they were the identical scissors of atropos  he also showed me a broken hourglass which had been thrown aside by father time together with the old gentlemans gray forelock tastefully braided into a brooch  in the hourglass was the handful of sand the grains of which had numbered the years of the cumeean sibyl  i think it was in this alcove that i saw the inkstand which luther threw at the devil and the ring which essex while under sentence of death sent to queen elizabeth  and here was the bloodincrusted pen of steel with which faust signed away his salvation  the virtuoso now opened the door of a closet and showed me a lamp burning while three others stood unlighted by its side  one of the three was the lamp of diogenes another that of guy fawkes and the third that which hero set forth to the midnight breeze in the high tower of ahydos  see said the virtuoso blowing with all his force at the lighted lamp  the flame quivered and shrank away from his breath but clung to the wick and resumed its brilliancy as soon as the blast was exhausted  it is an undying lamp from the tomb of charlemagne observed my guide  that flame was kindled a thousand years ago  how ridiculous to kindle an unnatural light in tombs exclaimed i we should seek to behold the dead in the light of heaven but what is the meaning of this chafingdish of glowing coals  that answered the virtuoso is the original fire which prometheus stole from heaven  look steadfastly into it and you will discern another curiosity  i gazed into that firewhich symbolically was the origin of all that was bright and glorious in the soul of manand in the midst of it behold a little reptile sporting with evident enjoyment of the fervid heat  it was a salamander  what a sacrilege cried i with inexpressible disgust  can you find no better use for this ethereal fire than to cherish a loathsome reptile in it  yet there are men who abuse the sacred fire of their own souls to as foul and guilty a purpose  the virtuoso made no answer except by a dry laugh and an assurance that the salamander was the very same which benvenuto cellini had seen in his fathers household fire  he then proceeded to show me other rarities for this closet appeared to be the receptacle of what he considered most valuable in his collection  there said he is the great carbuncle of the white mountains  i gazed with no little interest at this mighty gem which it had been one of the wild projects of my youth to discover  possibly it might have looked brighter to me in those days than now at all events it had not such brilliancy as to detain me long from the other articles of the museum  the virtuoso pointed out to me a crystalline stone which hung by a gold chain against the wall  that is the philosophers stone said he  and have you the elixir vita which generally accompanies it inquired i  even so this urn is filled with it he replied  a draught would refresh you  here is hebes cup will you quaff a health from it  my heart thrilled within me at the idea of such a reviving draught for methought i had great need of it after travelling so far on the dusty road of life  but i know not whether it were a peculiar glance in the virtuosos eye or the circumstance that this most precious liquid was contained in an antique sepulchral urn that made me pause  then came many a thought with which in the calmer and better hours of life i had strengthened myself to feel that death is the very friend whom in his due season even the happiest mortal should be willing to embrace  no i desire not an earthly immortality said i  were man to live longer on the earth the spiritual would die out of him  the spark of ethereal fire would be choked by the material the sensual  there is a celestial something within us that requires after a certain time the atmosphere of heaven to preserve it from decay and ruin  i will have none of this liquid  you do well to keep it in a sepulchral urn for it would produce death while bestowing the shadow of life  all this is unintelligible to me responded my guide with indifference  lifeearthly lifeis the only good  but you refuse the draught  well it is not likely to be offered twice within one mans experience  probably you have griefs which you seek to forget in death  i can enable you to forget them in life will you take a draught of lethe  as he spoke the virtuoso took from the shelf a crystal vase containing a sable liquor which caught no reflected image from the objects around  not for the world exclaimed i shrinking back  i can spare none of my recollections not even those of error or sorrow they are all alike the food of my spirit  as well never to have lived as to lose them now  without further parley we passed to the next alcove the shelves of which were burdened with ancient volumes and with those rolls of papyrus in which was treasured up the eldest wisdom of the earth perhaps the most valuable work in the collection to a bibliomaniac was the book of hermes  for my part however i would have given a higher price for those six of the sibyls books which tarquin refused to purchase and which the virtuoso informed me he had himself found in the cave of trophonius doubtless these old volumes contain prophecies of the fate of rome both as respects the decline and fall of her temporal empire and the rise of her spiritual one not without value likewise was the work of anaxagoras on nature hitherto supposed to be irrecoverably lost and the missing treatises of longinus by which modern criticism might profit and those books of livy for which the classic student has so long sorrowed without hope among these precious tomes i observed the original manuscript of the koran and also that of the mormon bible in joe smiths authentic autograph  alexanders copy of the iliad was also there enclosed in the jewelled casket of darius still fragrant of the perfumes which the persian kept in it  opening an ironclasped volume bound in black leather i discovered it to be cornelius agrippas book of magic and it was rendered still more interesting by the fact that many flowers ancient and modern were pressed between its leaves  here was a rose from eves bridal bower and all those red and white roses which were plucked in the garden of the temple by the partisans of york and lancaster here was hallecks wild rose of alloway cowper had contributed a sensitive plant and wordsworth an eglantine and burns a mountain daisy and kirke white a star of bethlehem and longfellow a sprig of fennel with its yellow flowers  james russell lowell had given a pressed flower but fragrant still which had been shadowed in the rhine  there was also a sprig from southeys holly tree  one of the most beautiful specimens was a fringed gentian which had been plucked and preserved for immortality by bryant  from jones very a poet whose voice is scarcely heard among us by reason of its depth there was a wind flower and a columbine  as i closed cornelius agrippas magic volume an old mildewed letter fell upon the floor  it proved to be an autograph from the flying dutchman to his wife  i could linger no longer among books for the afternoon was waning and there was yet much to see  the bare mention of a few more curiosities must suffice the immense skull of polyphemus was recognizable by the cavernous hollow in the centre of the forehead where once had blazed the giants single eye the tub of diogenes medeas caldron and psyches vase of beauty were placed one within another pandoras box without the lid stood next containing nothing but the girdle of venus which had been carelessly flung into it  a bundle of birchrods which had been used by shenstones schoolmistress were tied up with the countess of salisburys garter  i know not which to value most a rocs egg as big as an ordinary hogshead or the shell of the egg which columbus set upon its end  perhaps the most delicate article in the whole museum was queen mabs chariot which to guard it from the touch of meddlesome fingers was placed under a glass tumbler  several of the shelves were occupied by specimens of entomology feeling but little interest in the science i noticed only anacreons grasshopper and a bumblebee which had been presented to the virtuoso by ralph waldo emerson  in the part of the hall which we had now reached i observed a curtain that descended from the ceiling to the floor in voluminous folds of a depth richness and magnificence which i had never seen equalled  it was not to be doubted that this splendid though dark and solemn veil concealed a portion of the museum even richer in wonders than that through which i had already passed but on my attempting to grasp the edge of the curtain and draw it aside it proved to be an illusive picture  you need not blush remarked the virtuoso for that same curtain deceived zeuxis  it is the celebrated painting of parrhasius  in a range with the curtain there were a number of other choice pictures by artists of ancient days  here was the famous cluster of grapes by zeuxis so admirably depicted that it seemed as if the ripe juice were bursting forth  as to the picture of the old woman by the same illustrious painter and which was so ludicrous that he himself died with laughing at it i cannot say that it particularly moved my risibility  ancient humor seems to have little power over modern muscles  here also was the horse painted by apelles which living horses neighed at his first portrait of alexander the great and his last unfinished picture of venus asleep  each of these works of art together with others by parrhasius timanthes polygnotus apollodorus pausias and pamplulus required more time and study than i could bestow for the adequate perception of their merits  i shall therefore leave them undescribed and uncriticised nor attempt to settle the question of superiority between ancient and modern art  for the same reason i shall pass lightly over the specimens of antique sculpture which this indefatigable and fortunate virtuoso had dug out of the dust of fallen empires  here was aetions cedar statue of aesculapius much decayed and alcons iron statue of hercules lamentably rusted  here was the statue of victory six feet high which the jupiter olympus of phidias had held in his hand  here was a forefinger of the colossus of rhodes seven feet in length  here was the venus urania of phidias and other images of male and female beauty or grandeur wrought by sculptors who appeared never to have debased their souls by the sight of any meaner forms than those of gods or godlike mortals  but the deep simplicity of these great works was not to be comprehended by a mind excited and disturbed as mine was by the various objects that had recently been presented to it  i therefore turned away with merely a passing glance resolving on some future occasion to brood over each individual statue and picture until my inmost spirit should feel their excellence  in this department again i noticed the tendency to whimsical combinations and ludicrous analogies which seemed to influence many of the arrangements of the museum  the wooden statue so well known as the palladium of troy was placed in close apposition with the wooden head of general jackson which was stolen a few years since from the bows of the frigate constitution  we had now completed the circuit of the spacious hall and found ourselves again near the door  feeling somewhat wearied with the survey of so many novelties and antiquities i sat down upon cowpers sofa while the virtuoso threw himself carelessly into rabelaiss easychair  casting my eyes upon the opposite wall i was surprised to perceive the shadow of a man flickering unsteadily across the wainscot and looking as if it were stirred by some breath of air that found its way through the door or windows  no substantial figure was visible from which this shadow might be thrown nor had there been such was there any sunshine that would have caused it to darken upon the wall  it is peter schlemihls shadow observed the virtuoso and one of the most valuable articles in my collection  methinks a shadow would have made a fitting doorkeeper to such a museum said i although indeed yonder figure has something strange and fantastic about him which suits well enough with many of the impressions which i have received here  pray who is he  while speaking i gazed more scrutinizingly than before at the antiquated presence of the person who had admitted me and who still sat on his bench with the same restless aspect and dim confused questioning anxiety that i had noticed on my first entrance  at this moment he looked eagerly towards us and half starting from his seat addressed me  i beseech you kind sir said he in a cracked melancholy tone have pity on the most unfortunate man in the world  for heavens sake answer me a single question  is this the town of boston  you have recognized him now said the virtuoso  it is peter rugg the missing man  i chanced to meet him the other day still in search of boston and conducted him hither and as he could not succeed in finding his friends i have taken him into my service as doorkeeper  he is somewhat too apt to ramble but otherwise a man of trust and integrity  and might i venture to ask continued i to whom am i indebted for this afternoons gratification  the virtuoso before replying laid his hand upon an antique dart or javelin the rusty steel head of winch seemed to have been blunted as if it had encountered the resistance of a tempered shield or breastplate  my name has not been without its distinction in the world for a longer period than that of any other man alive answered he yet many doubt of my existence perhaps you will do so tomorrow  this dart which i hold in my hand was once grim deaths own weapon  it served him well for the space of four thousand years but it fell blunted as you see when he directed it against my breast  these words were spoken with the calm and cold courtesy of manner that had characterized this singular personage throughout our interview  i fancied it is true that there was a bitterness indefinably mingled with his tone as of one cut off from natural sympathies and blasted with a doom that had been inflicted on no other human being and by the results of which he had ceased to be human  yet withal it seemed one of the most terrible consequences of that doom that the victim no longer regarded it as a calamity but had finally accepted it as the greatest good that could have befallen him  you are the wandering jew  exclaimed i  the virtuoso bowed without emotion of any kind for by centuries of custom he had almost lost the sense of strangeness in his fate and was but imperfectly conscious of the astonishment and awe with which it affected such as are capable of death  your doom is indeed a fearful one  said i with irrepressible feeling and a frankness that afterwards startled me yet perhaps the ethereal spirit is not entirely extinct under all this corrupted or frozen mass of earthly life  perhaps the immortal spark may yet be rekindled by a breath of heaven  perhaps you may yet be permitted to die before it is too late to live eternally you have my prayers for such a consummation farewell  your prayers will be in vain replied he with a smile of cold triumph  my destiny is linked with the realities of earth  you are welcome to your visions and shadows of a future state but give me what i can see and touch and understand and i ask no more  it is indeed too late thought i  the soul is dead within him  struggling between pity and horror i extended my hand to which the virtuoso gave his own still with the habitual courtesy of a man of the world but without a single heartthrob of human brotherhood the touch seemed like ice yet i know not whether morally or physically  as i departed he bade me observe that the inner door of the hall was constructed with the ivory leaves of the gateway through which aeneas and the sibyl had been dismissed from hades
