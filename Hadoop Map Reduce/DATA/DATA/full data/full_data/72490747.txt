72490747	captains all  by ww jacobs    the four pigeons  illustration the four pigeons  the old man took up his mug and shifted along the bench until he was in the shade of the elms that stood before the cauliflower  the action also had the advantage of bringing him opposite the two strangers who were refreshing themselves after the toils of a long walk in the sun  my hearing aint wot it used to be he said tremulously  when you asked me to have a mug o ale i ardly heard you and if you was to ask me to ave another i mightnt hear you at all  one of the men nodded  not over there piped the old man  thats why i come over here he added after a pause  it ud be rude like to take no notice if you was to ask me  he looked round as the landlord approached and pushed his mug gently in his direction  the landlord obeying a nod from the second stranger filled it  it puts life into me said the old man raising it to his lips and bowing  it makes me talk  time we were moving jack said the first traveller  the second assenting to this as an abstract proposition expressed however a determination to finish his pipe first  i heard you saying something about shooting continued the old man and that reminds me of some shooting we ad here once in claybury  weve always ad a lot o game in these parts and if it wasnt for a low poaching fellow named bob prettyclayburys disgrace i call imwed ave a lot more  it happened in this way  squire rockett was going abroad to foreign parts for a year and he let the hall to a gentleman from london named sutton  a real gentleman e was openanded and free and just about october he ad a lot of is friends come down from london to elp im kill the pheasants  the first day they frightened more than they killed but they enjoyed theirselves all right until one gentleman who adnt shot a single thing all day shot pore bill chambers wot was beating with about a dozen more  bill got most of it in the shoulder and a little in the cheek but the row he see fit to make youd ha thought hed been killed  he laid on the ground groaning with is eyes shut and everybody thought e was dying till henery walker stooped down and asked im whether e was hurt  it took four men to carry bill ome and he was that particular you wouldnt believe  they ad to talk in whispers and when peter gubbins forgot imself and began to whistle he asked him where his art was when they walked fast he said they jolted im and when they walked slow e asked em whether theyd gone to sleep or wot  bill was in bed for nearly a week but the gentleman was very nice about it and said that it was his fault  he was a very pleasantspoken gentleman and arter sending dr green to him and saying hed pay the bill e gave bill chambers ten pounds to make up for is sufferings  bill ad intended to lay up for another week and the doctor wot ad been calling twice a day said he wouldnt be responsible for is life if he didnt but the ten pounds was too much for im and one evening just a week arter the accident he turned up at this cauliflower publicouse and began to spend is money  his face was bandaged up and when e come in he walked feeblelike and spoke in a faint sort o voice  smith the landlord got im a easychair and a couple of pillers out o the parlour and bill sat there like a king telling us all his sufferings and wot it felt like to be shot  i always have said wot a good thing beer is and it done bill more good than doctors medicine  when he came in he could ardly crawl and at nine oclock e was out of the easychair and dancing on the table as well as possible  he smashed three mugs and upset about two pints o beer but he just put his and in his pocket and paid for em without a word  theres plenty more where that came from he ses pulling out a handful o money  peter gubbins looked at it ardly able to speak  its worth while being shot to ave all that money he ses at last  dont you worry yourself peter ses bob pretty theres plenty more of you asll be shot afore them gentlemen at the hall as finished bills the fust but e wont be the lastnot by a long chalk  theyre more careful now ses dicky weed the tailor  all right ave it your own way ses bob nastylike  i dont know much about shooting being ony a pore labourin man  all i know is i shouldnt like to go beating for them  im too fond o my wife and family  there wont be no more shot ses sam jones  were too careful ses peter gubbins  bob pretty dont know everything ses dicky weed  ill bet you what you like therell be some more of you shot ses bob pretty in a temper  now then  ow muchll you bet bob ses sam jones with a wink at the others i can see you winking sam jones ses bob pretty but ill do more than bet  the last bet i won is still owing to me  now look ere ill pay you sixpence a week all the time youre beating if you promise to give me arf of wot you get if youre shot  i cant say fairer than that  will you give me sixpence a week too ses henery walker jumping up  i will ses bob and anybody else that likes  and wots more ill pay in advance  fust sixpences now  claybury men ave never been backward when theres been money to be made easy and they all wanted to join bob prettys club as he called it but fust of all e asked for a pen and ink and then he got smith the landlord being a scholard to write out a paper for them to sign henery walker was the fust to write is name and then sam jones peter gubbins ralph thomson jem hall and walter bell wrote theirs  bob stopped em then and said six ud be enough to go on with and then e paid up the sixpences and wished em luck  wot they liked amost as well as the sixpences was the idea o getting the better o bob pretty  as i said afore he was a poacher and that artful that up to that time nobody ad ever got the better of im  they made so much fun of im the next night that bob turned sulky and went off ome and for two or three nights he ardly showed his face and the next shoot they ad he went off to wickham and nobody saw im all day  that very day henery walker was shot  several gentlemen fired at a rabbit that was started and the next thing they knew henery walker was lying on the ground calling out that is leg ad been shot off  he made more fuss than bill chambers amost specially when they dropped im off a hurdle carrying him ome and the things he said to dr green for rubbing his ands as he came into the bedroom was disgraceful  the fust bob pretty eard of it was up at the cauliflower at eight oclock that evening and he set down is beer and set off to see henery as fast as is legs could carry im  henery was asleep when e got there and do all he could bob pretty couldnt wake im till he sat down gentle on is bad leg  illustration the fust bob pretty eard of it was up at the cauliflower at eight oclock that evening  its ony me old pal he ses smiling at im as henery woke up and shouted at im to get up  henery walker was going to say something bad but e thought better of it and he lay there arf busting with rage and watching bob out of the corner of one eye  i quite forgot you was on my club till smith reminded me of it ses bob  dont you take a farthing less than ten pounds henery  henery walker shut his eyes again  i forgot to tell you i made up my mind this morning not to belong to your club any more bob he ses  why didnt you come and tell me henery instead of leaving it till it was too late ses bob shaking his ead at im  i shall want all that money ses henery in a weak voice  i might ave to have a wooden leg bob  dont meet troubles arf way henery ses bob in a kind voice  ive no doubt mr suttonll throw in a wooden leg if you want it and look here if he does i wont trouble you for my arf of it  he said goodnight to henery and went off and when mrs walker went up to see ow henery was getting on he was carrying on that alarming that she couldnt do nothing with im  he was laid up for over a week though its my opinion he wasnt much hurt and the trouble was that nobody knew which gentleman ad shot im mr sutton talked it over with them and at last arter a good deal o trouble and henery pulling up is trousers and showing them is leg till they was fair sick of the sight of it they paid im ten pounds the same as they ad bill  it took bob pretty two days to get his arf but he kept very quiet about it not wishing to make a fuss in the village for fear mr sutton should get to hear of the club  at last he told henery walker that e was going to wickham to see is lawyer about it and arter smith the landlord ad read the paper to henery and explained ow hed very likely ave to pay more than the whole ten pounds then e gave bob his arf and said he never wanted to see im again as long as he lived  bob stood treat up at the cauliflower that night and said ow bad hed been treated  the tears stood in is eyes amost and at last e said that if e thought there was going to be any more fuss of that kind hed wind up the club  its the best thing you can do ses sam jones im not going to belong to it any longer so i give you notice  if so be as i get shot i want the money for myself  me too ses peter gubbins it ud fair break my art to give bob pretty five pounds  id sooner give it to my wife  all the other chaps said the same thing but bob pointed out to them that they ad taken their sixpences ony the night afore and they must stay in for the week  he said that was the law  some of em talked about giving im is sixpences back but bob said if they did they must pay up all the sixpences they had ad for three weeks  the end of it was they said theyd stay in for that week and not a moment longer  the next day sam jones and peter gubbins altered their minds  sam found a couple o shillings that his wife ad hidden in her sunday bonnet and peter gubbins opened is boys moneybox to see ow much there was in it they came up to the cauliflower to pay bob their eighteenpences but he wasnt there and when they went to his ouse mrs pretty said as ow hed gone off to wickham and wouldnt be back till saturday  so they ad to spend the money on beer instead  that was on tuesday and things went on all right till friday when mr sutton ad another shoot  the birds was getting scarce and the gentlemen that anxious to shoot them there was no olding them  once or twice the keepers spoke to em about carefulness and said wot large families theyd got but it wasnt much good  they went on blazing away and just at the corner of the wood sam jones and peter gubbins was both hit sam in the leg and peter in the arm  the noise that was made was awfuleverybody shouting that they adnt done it and all speaking at once and mr sutton was dancing about amost beside imself with rage  pore sam and peter was elped along by the others sam being carried and peter led and both of em with the idea of getting all they could out of it making such orrible noises that mr sutton couldnt hear imself calling his friends names  there seems to be wounded men calling out all over the place he ses in a temper  i think there is another one over there sir ses one o the keepers pointing  sam jones and peter gubbins both left off to listen and then they all heard it distinctly  a dreadful noise it was and when mr sutton and one or two more follered it up they found poor walter bell lying on is face in a bramble  wots the matter ses mr sutton shouting at im  ive been shot from behind ses walter  id got something in my boot and i was just stooping down to fasten it up agin when i got it  but there oughtnt to be anybody ere ses mr sutton to one of the keepers  they get all over the place sir ses the keeper scratching his ead i fancied i eard a gun go off here a minute or two arter the others was shot  i believe hes done it imself says mr sutton stamping his foot  i dont see ow he could sir ses the keeper touching his cap and looking at walter as was still lying with is face on is arms  they carried walter ome that way on a hurdle and dr green spent all the rest o that day picking shots out o them three men and telling em to keep still  he ad to do sam jones by candlelight with mrs jones olding the candle with one hand and crying with the other  twice the doctor told her to keep it steady and poor sam ad only just passed the remark how ot it was for october when they discovered that the bed was on fire  the doctor said that sam was no trouble  he got off of the bed by imself and when it was all over and the fire put out the doctor found him sitting on the stairs with the leg of a broken chair in is hand calling for is wife  of course there was a terrible todo about it in claybury and up at the hall too  all of the gentlemen said as ow they hadnt done it and mr sutton was arf crazy with rage  he said that they ad made im the laughingstock of the neighbourhood and that they oughtnt to shoot with anything but popguns  they got to such high words over it that two of the gentlemen went off ome that very night  there was a lot of talk up at the cauliflower too and more than one pointed out ow lucky bob pretty was in getting four men out of the six in his club  as i said afore bob was away at the time but he came back the next night and we ad the biggest row here you could wish for to see  henery walker began it  i spose youve eard the dreadful news bob pretty he ses looking at im  i ave ses bob and my art bled for em  i told you wot those gentlemen was like didnt i  but none of you would believe me  now you can see as i was right  its very strange ses henery walker looking round its very strange that all of us wots been shot belonged to bob prettys precious club  its my luck henery ses bob always was lucky from a child  and i spose you think youre going to ave arf of the money they get ses henery walker  dont talk about money while them pore chaps is suffering ses bob im surprised at you henery  you wont ave a farthing of it ses henery walker and wots more bob pretty im going to ave my five pounds back  dont you believe it henery ses bob smiling at im  im going to ave my five pounds back ses henery and you know why i know wot your club was for now and we was all a pack o silly fools not to see it afore  speak for yourself henery ses john biggs who thought henery was looking at im  ive been putting two and two together ses henery looking round and its as plain as the nose on your face  bob pretty hid up in the wood and shot us all himself  for a moment you might ave heard a pin drop and then there was such a noise nobody could hear theirselves speak  everybody was shouting his ardest and the ony quiet one there was bob pretty imself  poor henery hes gorn mad he ses shaking his ead  youre a murderer ses ralph thomson shaking is fist at him  henery walkers gorn mad ses bob agin  why i aint been near the place  theres a dozen menll swear that i was at wickham each time these misfortunate accidents appened  men like you theyd swear anything for a pot o beer ses henery but im not going to waste time talking to you bob pretty  im going straight off to tell mr sutton  i shouldnt do that if i was you henery ses bob  i dessay ses henery walker but then you see i am  i thought youd gorn mad henery ses bob taking a drink o beer that somebody ad left on the table by mistake and now im sure of it  why if you tell mr sutton that it wasnt his friends that shot them pore fellers he wont pay them anything  taint likely e would is it  henery walker wot ad been standing up looking fierce at im sat down agin struck all of a heap  and he might want your ten pounds back henery said bob in a soft voice  and seeing as ow you was kind enough to give five to me and spent most of the other it ud come ard on you wouldnt it  always think afore you speak henery  i always do  henery walker got up and tried to speak but e couldnt and he didnt get is breath back till bob said it was plain to see that he adnt got a word to say for imself  then he shook is fist at bob and called im a low thieving poaching murderer  youre not yourself henery ses bob  when you come round youll be sorry for trying to take away the character of a pore labourin man with a ailing wife and a large family  but if you take my advice you wont say anything more about your wicked ideas if you do these pore fellers wont get a farthing  and youd better keep quiet about the club mates for their sakes  other people might get the same crazy ideas in their silly eads as henery  keepers especially  that was ony common sense but as john biggs said it did seem ard to think as ow bob pretty should be allowed to get off scotfree and with henery walkers five pounds too  theres one thing he ses to bob you wont ave any of these other pore chaps money and if theyre men they ought to make it up to henery walker for the money he as saved em by finding you out  theyve got to pay me fust ses bob  im a pore man but ill stick up for my rights  as for me shooting em theyd ha been urt a good deal more if id done itespecially mr henery walker  why theyre hardly urt at all  dont answer im henery ses john biggs  you save your breath to go and tell sam jones and the others about it  itll cheer em up  and tell em about my arf in case they get too cheerful and go overdoing it ses bob pretty stopping at the door  goodnight all  nobody answered im and arter waiting a little bit henery walker set off to see sam jones and the others  john biggs was quite right about its making em cheerful but they see as plain as bob imself that it ad got to be kept quiet  till weve spent the money at any rate ses walter bell then praps mr sutton might get bob locked up for it  mr sutton went down to see em all a day or two afterwards  the shootingparty was broken up and gone ome but they left some money behind em  ten pounds each they was to ave same as the others but mr sutton said that he ad heard ow the other money was wasted at the cauliflower and e was going to give it out to em ten shillings a week until the money was gorn  he ad to say it over and over agin afore they understood im and walter bell ad to stuff the bedcloes in is mouth to keep civil  peter gubbins with is arm tied up in a sling was the fust one to turn up at the cauliflower and he was that downarted about it we couldnt do nothing with im  he ad expected to be able to pull out ten golden sovereigns and the disappintment was too much for im  i wonder ow they heard about it ses dicky weed  i can tell you ses bob pretty wot ad been sitting up in a corner by himself nodding and smiling at peter wot wouldnt look at im  a friend o mine at wickham wrote to him about it  he was so disgusted at the way bill chambers and henery walker come up ere wasting their ardearned money that he sent im a letter signed a friend of the working man telling im about it and advising im what to do  a friend o yours ses john biggs staring at im  what for  i dont know ses bob hes a wunnerful good scholard and he likes writin letters  hes going to write another tomorrer unless i go over and stop im  another ses peter who ad been tellin everybody that e wouldnt speak to im agin as long as he lived  wot about  about the idea that i shot you all ses bob  i want my character cleared  o course they cant prove anything against meive got my witnesses  but taking one thing with another i see now that it does look suspicious and i dont suppose any of youll get any more of your money  mr sutton is so sick o being laughed at hell jump at anything  you dursnt do it bob ses peter all of a tremble  it aint me peter old pal ses bob its my friend  but i dont mind stopping im for the sake of old times if i get my arf  hed listen to me i feel sure  at fust peter said he wouldnt get a farthing out of im if his friend wrote letters till doomsday but byandby he thought better of it and asked bob to stay there while he went down to see sam and walter about it  when e came back hed got the fust weeks money for bob pretty but he said he left walter bell carrying on like a madman and as for sam jones he was that upset e didnt believe hed last out the night
