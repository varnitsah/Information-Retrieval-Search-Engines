70707291	the adventure of the dying detective   by  sir arthur conan doyle     mrs hudson the landlady of sherlock holmes was a longsuffering woman  not only was her firstfloor flat invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must have sorely tried her patience his incredible untidiness his addiction to music at strange hours his occasional revolver practice within doors his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made him the very worst tenant in london  on the other hand his payments were princely i have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price which holmes paid for his rooms during the years that i was with him  the landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to interfere with him however outrageous his proceedings might seem  she was fond of him too for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women  he disliked and distrusted the sex but he was always a chivalrous opponent knowing how genuine was her regard for him i listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to which my poor friend was reduced  hes dying dr watson said she  for three days he has been sinking and i doubt if he will last the day  he would not let me get a doctor  this morning when i saw his bones sticking out of his face and his great bright eyes looking at me i could stand no more of it with your leave or without it mr holmes i am going for a doctor this very hour said i  let it be watson then said he  i wouldnt waste an hour in coming to him sir or you may not see him alive  i was horrified for i had heard nothing of his illness  i need not say that i rushed for my coat and my hat  as we drove back i asked for the details  there is little i can tell you sir  he has been working at a case down at rotherhithe in an alley near the river and he has brought this illness back with him  he took to his bed on wednesday afternoon and has never moved since  for these three days neither food nor drink has passed his lips  good god  why did you not call in a doctor  he wouldnt have it sir  you know how masterful he is  i didnt dare to disobey him  but hes not long for this world as youll see for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him  he was indeed a deplorable spectacle  in the dim light of a foggy november day the sick room was a gloomy spot but it was that gaunt wasted face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill to my heart his eyes had the brightness of fever there was a hectic flush upon either cheek and dark crusts clung to his lips the thin hands upon the coverlet twitched incessantly his voice was croaking and spasmodic  he lay listlessly as i entered the room but the sight of me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes  well watson we seem to have fallen upon evil days said he in a feeble voice but with something of his old carelessness of manner  my dear fellow i cried approaching him  stand back  stand right back said he with the sharp imperiousness which i had associated only with moments of crisis if you approach me watson i shall order you out of the house  but why  because it is my desire  is that not enough  yes mrs hudson was right  he was more masterful than ever  it was pitiful however to see his exhaustion  i only wished to help i explained  exactly  you will help best by doing what you are told  certainly holmes  he relaxed the austerity of his manner  you are not angry he asked gasping for breath  poor devil how could i be angry when i saw him lying in such a plight before me  its for your own sake watson he croaked  for my sake  i know what is the matter with me  it is a coolie disease from sumatraa thing that the dutch know more about than we though they have made little of it up to date  one thing only is certain  it is infallibly deadly and it is horribly contagious  he spoke now with a feverish energy the long hands twitching and jerking as he motioned me away  contagious by touch watsonthats it by touch  keep your distance and all is well  good heavens holmes  do you suppose that such a consideration weighs with me of an instant  it would not affect me in the case of a stranger  do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so old a friend  again i advanced but he repulsed me with a look of furious anger  if you will stand there i will talk  if you do not you must leave the room  i have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of holmes that i have always deferred to his wishes even when i least understood them  but now all my professional instincts were aroused  let him be my master elsewhere i at least was his in a sick room  holmes said i you are not yourself  a sick man is but a child and so i will treat you  whether you like it or not i will examine your symptoms and treat you for them  he looked at me with venomous eyes  if i am to have a doctor whether i will or not let me at least have someone in whom i have confidence said he  then you have none in me  in your friendship certainly  but facts are facts watson and after all you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience and mediocre qualifications  it is painful to have to say these things but you leave me no choice  i was bitterly hurt  such a remark is unworthy of you holmes  it shows me very clearly the state of your own nerves  but if you have no confidence in me i would not intrude my services  let me bring sir jasper meek or penrose fisher or any of the best men in london  but someone you must have and that is final  if you think that i am going to stand here and see you die without either helping you myself or bringing anyone else to help you then you have mistaken your man  you mean well watson said the sick man with something between a sob and a groan  shall i demonstrate your own ignorance what do you know pray of tapanuli fever  what do you know of the black formosa corruption  i have never heard of either  there are many problems of disease many strange pathological possibilities in the east watson  he paused after each sentence to collect his failing strength  i have learned so much during some recent researches which have a medicocriminal aspect  it was in the course of them that i contracted this complaint  you can do nothing  possibly not  but i happen to know that dr ainstree the greatest living authority upon tropical disease is now in london  all remonstrance is useless holmes i am going this instant to fetch him i turned resolutely to the door  never have i had such a shock  in an instant with a tigerspring the dying man had intercepted me  i heard the sharp snap of a twisted key the next moment he had staggered back to his bed exhausted and panting after his one tremendous outflame of energy  you wont take the key from me by force watson ive got you my friend  here you are and here you will stay until i will otherwise but ill humour you  all this in little gasps with terrible struggles for breath between  youve only my own good at heart  of course i know that very well  you shall have your way but give me time to get my strength  not now watson not now  its four oclock at six you can go  this is insanity holmes  only two hours watson  i promise you will go at six  are you content to wait  i seem to have no choice  none in the world watson  thank you i need no help in arranging the clothes  you will please keep your distance  now watson there is one other condition that i would make  you will seek help not from the man you mention but from the one that i choose  by all means  the first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered this room watson  you will find some books over there i am somewhat exhausted i wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a nonconductor  at six watson we resume our conversation  but it was destined to be resumed long before that hour and in circumstances which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his spring to the door  i had stood for some minutes looking at the silent figure in the bed  his face was almost covered by the clothes and he appeared to be asleep  then unable to settle down to reading i walked slowly round the room examining the pictures of celebrated criminals with which every wall was adorned  finally in my aimless perambulation i came to the mantelpiece  a litter of pipes tobaccopouches syringes penknives revolvercartridges and other debris was scattered over it  in the midst of these was a small black and white ivory box with a sliding lid  it was a neat little thing and i had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely when  it was a dreadful cry that he gavea yell which might have been heard down the street  my skin went cold and my hair bristled at that horrible scream  as i turned i caught a glimpse of a convulsed face and frantic eyes  i stood paralyzed with the little box in my hand  put it down  down this instant watsonthis instant i say his head sank back upon the pillow and he gave a deep sigh of relief as i replaced the box upon the mantelpiece  i hate to have my things touched watson  you know that i hate it  you fidget me beyond endurance you a doctoryou are enough to drive a patient into an asylum  sit down man and let me have my rest  the incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind  the violent and causeless excitement followed by this brutality of speech so far removed from his usual suavity showed me how deep was the disorganization of his mind  of all ruins that of a noble mind is the most deplorable  i sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time had passed  he seemed to have been watching the clock as well as i for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the same feverish animation as before  now watson said he  have you any change in your pocket  yes  any silver  a good deal  how many halfcrowns  i have five  ah too few  too few  how very unfortunate watson  however such as they are you can put them in your watchpocket  and all the rest of your money in your left trouser pocket  thank you it will balance you so much better like that  this was raving insanity  he shuddered and again made a sound between a cough and a sob  you will now light the gas watson but you will be very careful that not for one instant shall it be more than half on  i implore you to be careful watson  thank you that is excellent no you need not draw the blind  now you will have the kindness to place some letters and papers upon this table within my reach thank you  now some of that litter from the mantelpiece excellent watson  there is a sugartongs there  kindly raise that small ivory box with its assistance  place it here among the papers  good  you can now go and fetch mr culverton smith of 13 lower burke street  to tell the truth my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened for poor holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous to leave him  however he was as eager now to consult the person named as he had been obstinate in refusing  i never heard the name said i  possibly not my good watson  it may surprise you to know that the man upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man but a planter  mr culverton smith is a wellknown resident of sumatra now visiting london  an outbreak of the disease upon his plantation which was distant from medical aid caused him to study it himself with some rather farreaching consequences  he is a very methodical person and i did not desire you to start before six because i was well aware that you would not find him in his study  if you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique experience of this disease the investigation of which has been his dearest hobby i cannot doubt that he could help me  i gave holmess remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt to indicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those clutchings of his hands which indicated the pain from which he was suffering  his appearance had changed for the worse during the few hours that i had been with him  those hectic spots were more pronounced the eyes shone more brightly out of darker hollows and a cold sweat glimmered upon his brow he still retained however the jaunty gallantry of his speech to the last gasp he would always be the master  you will tell him exactly how you have left me said he  you will convey the very impression which is in your own minda dying mana dying and delirious man  indeed i cannot think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters so prolific the creatures seem  ah i am wandering  strange how the brain controls the brain what was i saying watson  my directions for mr culverton smith  ah yes i remember  my life depends upon it  plead with him watson  there is no good feeling between us  his nephew watsoni had suspicions of foul play and i allowed him to see it  the boy died horribly  he has a grudge against me  you will soften him watson beg him pray him get him here by any means  he can save meonly he  i will bring him in a cab if i have to carry him down to it  you will do nothing of the sort  you will persuade him to come and then you will return in front of him  make any excuse so as not to come with him  dont forget watson  you wont fail me you never did fail me  no doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the creatures  you and i watson we have done our part  shall the world then be overrun by oysters no no horrible  youll convey all that is in your mind  i left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling like a foolish child  he had handed me the key and with a happy thought i took it with me lest he should lock himself in  mrs hudson was waiting trembling and weeping in the passage  behind me as i passed from the flat i heard holmess high thin voice in some delirious chant  below as i stood whistling for a cab a man came on me through the fog  how is mr holmes sir he asked  it was an old acquaintance inspector morton of scotland yard dressed in unofficial tweeds  he is very ill i answered  he looked at me in a most singular fashion  had it not been too fiendish i could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed exultation in his face  i heard some rumour of it said he  the cab had driven up and i left him  lower burke street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the vague borderland between notting hill and kensington  the particular one at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure respectability in its oldfashioned iron railings its massive foldingdoor and its shining brasswork  all was in keeping with a solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted electrical light behind him  yes mr culverton smith is in  dr watson  very good sir i will take up your card  my humble name and title did not appear to impress mr culverton smith through the halfopen door i heard a high petulant penetrating voice  who is this person  what does he want  dear me staples how often have i said that i am not to be disturbed in my hours of study  there came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the butler  well i wont see him staples  i cant have my work interrupted like this  i am not at home  say so  tell him to come in the morning if he really must see me  again the gentle murmur  well well give him that message  he can come in the morning or he can stay away  my work must not be hindered  i thought of holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness and counting the minutes perhaps until i could bring help to him  it was not a time to stand upon ceremony  his life depended upon my promptness  before the apologetic butler had delivered his message i had pushed past him and was in the room  with a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside the fire  i saw a great yellow face coarsegrained and greasy with heavy doublechin and two sullen menacing gray eyes which glared at me from under tufted and sandy brows  a high bald head had a small velvet smokingcap poised coquettishly upon one side of its pink curve the skull was of enormous capacity and yet as i looked down i saw to my amazement that the figure of the man was small and frail twisted in the shoulders and back like one who has suffered from rickets in his childhood  whats this he cried in a high screaming voice  what is the meaning of this intrusion  didnt i send you word that i would see you tomorrow morning  i am sorry said i but the matter cannot be delayed  mr sherlock holmes  the mention of my friends name had an extraordinary effect upon the little man  the look of anger passed in an instant from his face  his features became tense and alert  have you come from holmes he asked  i have just left him  what about holmes  how is he  he is desperately ill  that is why i have come  the man motioned me to a chair and turned to resume his own  as he did so i caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece  i could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and abominable smile  yet i persuaded myself that it must have been some nervous contraction which i had surprised for he turned to me an instant later with genuine concern upon his features  i am sorry to hear this said he  i only know mr holmes through some business dealings which we have had but i have every respect for his talents and his character  he is an amateur of crime as i am of disease  for him the villain for me the microbe there are my prisons he continued pointing to a row of bottles and jars which stood upon a side table among those gelatine cultivations some of the very worst offenders in the world are now doing time  it was on account of your special knowledge that mr holmes desired to see you  he has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the one man in london who could help him  the little man started and the jaunty smokingcap slid to the floor  why he asked  why should mr homes think that i could help him in his trouble  because of your knowledge of eastern diseases  but why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is eastern  because in some professional inquiry he has been working among chinese sailors down in the docks  mr culverton smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smokingcap  oh thats itis it said he  i trust the matter is not so grave as you suppose  how long has he been ill  about three days  is he delirious  occasionally  tut tut  this sounds serious  it would be inhuman not to answer his call  i very much resent any interruption to my work dr watson but this case is certainly exceptional  i will come with you at once  i remembered holmess injunction  i have another appointment said i  very good  i will go alone  i have a note of mr holmess address you can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most  it was with a sinking heart that i reentered holmess bedroom for all that i knew the worst might have happened in my absence to my enormous relief  he had improved greatly in the interval his appearance was as ghastly as ever but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in a feeble voice it is true but with even more than his usual crispness and lucidity  well did you see him watson  yes he is coming  admirable watson  admirable  you are the best of messengers  he wished to return with me  that would never do watson  that would be obviously impossible  did he ask what ailed me  i told him about the chinese in the east end  exactly  well watson you have done all that a good friend could you can now disappear from the scene  i must wait and hear his opinion holmes  of course you must  but i have reasons to suppose that this opinion would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are alone  there is just room behind the head of my bed watson  my dear holmes  i fear there is no alternative watson  the room does not lend itself to concealment which is as well as it is the less likely to arouse suspicion  but just there watson i fancy that it could be done suddenly he sat up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard face there are the wheels watson  quick man if you love me  and dont budge whatever happenswhatever happens do you hear  dont speak dont move  just listen with all your ears  then in an instant his sudden access of strength departed and his masterful purposeful talk droned away into the low vague murmurings of a semidelirious man  from the hidingplace into which i had been so swiftly hustled i heard the footfalls upon the stair with the opening and the closing of the bedroom door  then to my surprise there came a long silence broken only by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man  i could imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and looking down at the sufferer  at last that strange hush was broken  holmes he cried  holmes in the insistent tone of one who awakens a sleeper  cant you hear me holmes  there was a rustling as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder  is that you mr smith  holmes whispered  i hardly dared hope that you would come  the other laughed  i should imagine not he said  and yet you see i am here coals of fire holmescoals of fire  it is very good of youvery noble of you  i appreciate your special knowledge  our visitor sniggered  you do  you are fortunately the only man in london who does do you know what is the matter with you  the same said holmes  ah  you recognize the symptoms  only too well  well i shouldnt be surprised holmes  i shouldnt be surprised if it were the same  a bad lookout for you if it is poor victor was a dead man on the fourth daya strong hearty young fellow  it was certainly as you said very surprising that he should have contracted an outoftheway asiatic disease in the heart of londona disease too of which i had made such a very special study  singular coincidence holmes  very smart of you to notice it but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect  i knew that you did it  oh you did did you  well you couldnt prove it anyhow  but what do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that and then crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble  what sort of a game is thateh  i heard the rasping laboured breathing of the sick man  give me the water he gasped  youre precious near your end my friend but i dont want you to go till i have had a word with you  thats why i give you water  there dont slop it about  thats right  can you understand what i say  holmes groaned  do what you can for me  let bygones be bygones he whispered ill put the words out of my headi swear i will  only cure me and ill forget it  forget what  well about victor savages death  you as good as admitted just now that you had done it  ill forget it  you can forget it or remember it just as you like  i dont see you in the witnessbox  quite another shaped box my good holmes i assure you  it matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died its not him we are talking about  its you  yes yes  the fellow who came for meive forgotten his namesaid that you contracted it down in the east end among the sailors  i could only account for it so  you are proud of your brains holmes are you not  think yourself smart dont you  you came across someone who was smarter this time now cast your mind back holmes  can you think of no other way you could have got this thing  i cant think  my mind is gone  for heavens sake help me  yes i will help you  ill help you to understand just where you are and how you got there  id like you to know before you die  give me something to ease my pain  painful is it  yes the coolies used to do some squealing towards the end  takes you as cramp i fancy  yes yes it is cramp  well you can hear what i say anyhow  listen now  can you remember any unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms began  no no nothing  think again  im too ill to think  well then ill help you  did anything come by post  by post  a box by chance  im faintingim gone  listen holmes  there was a sound as if he was shaking the dying man and it was all that i could do to hold myself quiet in my hidingplace  you must hear me  you shall hear me  do you remember a boxan ivory box  it came on wednesday  you opened itdo you remember  yes yes i opened it  there was a sharp spring inside it some joke  it was no joke as you will find to your cost  you fool you would have it and you have got it  who asked you to cross my path  if you had left me alone i would not have hurt you  i remember holmes gasped  the spring  it drew blood  this boxthis on the table  the very one by george  and it may as well leave the room in my pocket  there goes your last shred of evidence  but you have the truth now holmes and you can die with the knowledge that i killed you  you knew too much of the fate of victor savage so i have sent you to share it  you are very near your end holmes i will sit here and i will watch you die  holmess voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper  what is that said smith  turn up the gas  ah the shadows begin to fall do they  yes i will turn it up that i may see you the better he crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened  is there any other little service that i can do you my friend  a match and a cigarette  i nearly called out in my joy and my amazement  he was speaking in his natural voicea little weak perhaps but the very voice i knew there was a long pause and i felt that culverton smith was standing in silent amazement looking down at his companion  whats the meaning of this i heard him say at last in a dry rasping tone  the best way of successfully acting a part is to be it said holmes i give you my word that for three days i have tasted neither food nor drink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water but it is the tobacco which i find most irksome  ah here are some cigarettes  i heard the striking of a match  that is very much better  halloa halloa  do i hear the step of a friend  there were footfalls outside the door opened and inspector morton appeared  all is in order and this is your man said holmes  the officer gave the usual cautions  i arrest you on the charge of the murder of one victor savage he concluded  and you might add of the attempted murder of one sherlock holmes remarked my friend with a chuckle  to save an invalid trouble inspector mr culverton smith was good enough to give our signal by turning up the gas  by the way the prisoner has a small box in the righthand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove thank you  i would handle it gingerly if i were you  put it down here it may play its part in the trial  there was a sudden rush and a scuffle followed by the clash of iron and a cry of pain  youll only get yourself hurt said the inspector  stand still will you  there was the click of the closing handcuffs  a nice trap cried the high snarling voice  it will bring you into the dock holmes not me  he asked me to come here to cure him  i was sorry for him and i came  now he will pretend no doubt that i have said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane suspicions you can lie as you like holmes  my word is always as good as yours  good heavens cried holmes  i had totally forgotten him  my dear watson i owe you a thousand apologies  to think that i should have overlooked you  i need not introduce you to mr culverton smith since i understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening have you the cab below  i will follow you when i am dressed for i may be of some use at the station  i never needed it more said holmes as he refreshed himself with a glass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet however as you know my habits are irregular and such a feat means less to me than to most men  it was very essential that i should impress mrs hudson with the reality of my condition since she was to convey it to you and you in turn to him  you wont be offended watson  you will realize that among your many talents dissimulation finds no place and that if you had shared my secret you would never have been able to impress smith with the urgent necessity of his presence which was the vital point of the whole scheme  knowing his vindictive nature i was perfectly certain that he would come to look upon his handiwork  but your appearance holmesyour ghastly face  three days of absolute fast does not improve ones beauty watson for the rest there is nothing which a sponge may not cure  with vaseline upon ones forehead belladonna in ones eyes rouge over the cheekbones and crusts of beeswax round ones lips a very satisfying effect can be produced malingering is a subject upon which i have sometimes thought of writing a monograph  a little occasional talk about halfcrowns oysters or any other extraneous subject produces a pleasing effect of delirium  but why would you not let me near you since there was in truth no infection  can you ask my dear watson  do you imagine that i have no respect for your medical talents  could i fancy that your astute judgment would pass a dying man who however weak had no rise of pulse or temperature  at four yards i could deceive you  if i failed to do so who would bring my smith within my grasp  no watson i would not touch that box  you can just see if you look at it sideways where the sharp spring like a vipers tooth emerges as you open it  i dare say it was by some such device that poor savage who stood between this monster and a reversion was done to death  my correspondence however is as you know a varied one and i am somewhat upon my guard against any packages which reach me  it was clear to me however that by pretending that he had really succeeded in his design i might surprise a confession  that pretence i have carried out with the thoroughness of the true artist  thank you watson you must help me on with my coat  when we have finished at the policestation i think that something nutritious at simpsons would not be out of place
