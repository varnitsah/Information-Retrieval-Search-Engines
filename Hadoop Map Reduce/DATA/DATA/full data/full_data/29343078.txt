29343078	chapter i  a redhaired girl  the residence of mr peter pett the wellknown financier on riverside drive is one of the leading eyesores of that breezy and expensive boulevard as you pass by in your limousine or while enjoying ten cents worth of fresh air on top of a green omnibus it jumps out and bites at you architects confronted with it reel and throw up their hands defensively and even the lay observer has a sense of shock the place resembles in almost equal proportions a cathedral a suburban villa a hotel and a chinese pagoda many of its windows are of stained glass and above the porch stand two terracotta lions considerably more repulsive even than the complacent animals which guard new yorks public library it is a house which is impossible to overlook and it was probably for this reason that mrs pett insisted on her husband buying it for she was a woman who liked to be noticed  through the rich interior of this mansion mr pett its nominal proprietor was wandering like a lost spirit the hour was about ten of a fine sunday morning but the sabbath calm which was upon the house had not communicated itself to him there was a look of exasperation on his usually patient face and a muttered oath picked up no doubt on the godless stock exchange escaped his lips  darn it  he was afflicted by a sense of the pathos of his position it was not as if he demanded much from life he asked but little here below at that moment all that he wanted was a quiet spot where he might read his sunday paper in solitary peace and he could not find one intruders lurked behind every door the place was congested  this sort of thing had been growing worse and worse ever since his marriage two years previously there was a strong literary virus in mrs petts system she not only wrote voluminously herselfthe name nesta ford pett is familiar to all lovers of sensational fictionbut aimed at maintaining a salon starting in pursuance of this aim with a single specimenher nephew willie partridge who was working on a new explosive which would eventually revolutionise warshe had gradually added to her collections until now she gave shelter beneath her terracotta roof to no fewer than six young and unrecognised geniuses six brilliant youths mostly novelists who had not yet started and poets who were about to begin cluttered up mr petts rooms on this fair june morning while he clutching his sunday paper wandered about finding like the dove in genesis no rest it was at such times that he was almost inclined to envy his wifes first husband a business friend of his named elmer ford who had perished suddenly of an apoplectic seizure and the pity which he generally felt for the deceased tended to shift its focus  marriage had certainly complicated life for mr pett as it frequently does for the man who waits fifty years before trying it in addition to the geniuses mrs pett had brought with her to her new home her only son ogden a fourteenyearold boy of a singularly unloveable type years of grownup society and the absence of anything approaching discipline had given him a precocity on which the earnest efforts of a series of private tutors had expended themselves in vain they came full of optimism and selfconfidence to retire after a brief interval shattered by the boys stodgy resistance to education in any form or shape to mr pett never at his ease with boys ogden ford was a constant irritant he disliked his stepsons personality and he more than suspected him of stealing his cigarettes it was an additional annoyance that he was fully aware of the impossibility of ever catching him at it  mr pett resumed his journey he had interrupted it for a moment to listen at the door of the morningroom but a remark in a high tenor voice about the essential christianity of the poet shelley filtering through the oak he had moved on  silence from behind another door farther down the passage encouraged him to place his fingers on the handle but a crashing chord from an unseen piano made him remove them swiftly he roamed on and a few minutes later the process of elimination had brought him to what was technically his own private librarya large soothing room full of old books of which his father had been a great collector mr pett did not read old books himself but he liked to be among them and it is proof of his pessimism that he had not tried the library first to his depressed mind it had seemed hardly possible that there could be nobody there  he stood outside the door listening tensely he could hear nothing he went in and for an instant experienced that ecstatic thrill which only comes to elderly gentlemen of solitary habit who in a house full of their juniors find themselves alone at last then a voice spoke shattering his dream of solitude  hello pop  ogden ford was sprawling in a deep chair in the shadows  come in pop come in lots of room  mr pett stood in the doorway regarding his stepson with a sombre eye he resented the boys tone of easy patronage all the harder to endure with philosophic calm at the present moment from the fact that the latter was lounging in his favourite chair even from an aesthetic point of view the sight of the bulging child offended him ogden ford was round and blobby and looked overfed he had the plethoric habit of one to whom wholesome exercise is a stranger and the sallow complexion of the confirmed candyfiend even now a bare half hour after breakfast his jaws were moving with a rhythmical champing motion  what are you eating boy demanded mr pett his disappointment turning to irritability  candy  i wish you would not eat candy all day  mother gave it to me said ogden simply as he had anticipated the shot silenced the enemys battery mr pett grunted but made no verbal comment ogden celebrated his victory by putting another piece of candy in his mouth  got a grouch this morning havent you pop  i will not be spoken to like that  i thought you had said his stepson complacently i can always tell i dont see why you want to come picking on me though ive done nothing  mr pett was sniffing suspiciously  youve been smoking  me  smoking cigarettes  no sir  there are two butts in the ashtray  i didnt put them there  one of them is warm  its a warm day  you dropped it there when you heard me come in  no sir ive only been here a few minutes i guess one of the fellows was in here before me theyre always swiping your coffinnails you ought to do something about it pop you ought to assert yourself  a sense of helplessness came upon mr pett for the thousandth time he felt himself baffled by this calm goggleeyed boy who treated him with such supercilious coolness  you ought to be out in the open air this lovely morning he said feebly  all right lets go for a walk i will if you will  ii have other things to do said mr pett recoiling from the prospect  well this freshair stuff is overrated anyway wheres the sense of having a home if you dont stop in it  when i was your age i would have been out on a morning like thiserbowling my hoop  and look at you now  what do you mean  martyr to lumbago  i am not a martyr to lumbago said mr pett who was touchy on the subject  have it your own way all i know is  never mind  im only saying what mother     be quiet  ogden made further researches in the candy box  have some pop  no  quite right got to be careful at your age  what do you mean  getting on you know not so young as you used to be come in pop if youre coming in theres a draft from that door  mr pett retired fermenting he wondered how another man would have handled this situation the ridiculous inconsistency of the human character infuriated him why should he be a totally different man on riverside drive from the person he was in pine street why should he be able to hold his own in pine street with grown menwhiskered squarejawed financiersand yet be unable on riverside drive to eject a fourteenyearold boy from an easy chair it seemed to him sometimes that a curious paralysis of the will came over him out of business hours  meanwhile he had still to find a place where he could read his sunday paper  he stood for a while in thought then his brow cleared and he began to mount the stairs reaching the top floor he walked along the passage and knocked on a door at the end of it from behind this door as from behind those below sounds proceeded but this time they did not seem to discourage mr pett it was the tapping of a typewriter that he heard and he listened to it with an air of benevolent approval he loved to hear the sound of a typewriter it made home so like the office  come in called a girls voice  the room in which mr pett found himself was small but cosy and its cosinessoddly considering the sex of its ownerhad that peculiar quality which belongs as a rule to the dens of men a large bookcase almost covered one side of it its reds and blues and browns smiling cheerfully at whoever entered the walls were hung with prints judiciously chosen and arranged through a window to the left healthfully open at the bottom the sun streamed in bringing with it the pleasantly subdued whirring of automobiles out on the drive at a desk at right angles to this window her vivid redgold hair rippling in the breeze from the river sat the girl who had been working at the typewriter she turned as mr pett entered and smiled over her shoulder  ann chester mr petts niece looked her best when she smiled although her hair was the most obviously striking feature of her appearance her mouth was really the most individual thing about her it was a mouth that suggested adventurous possibilities in repose it had a look of having just finished saying something humorous a kind of demure appreciation of itself when it smiled a row of white teeth flashed out or if the lips did not part a dimple appeared on the right cheek giving the whole face an air of mischievous geniality it was an enterprising swashbuckling sort of mouth the mouth of one who would lead forlorn hopes with a jest or plot whimsically lawless conspiracies against convention in its corners and in the firm line of the chin beneath it there lurked too more than a hint of imperiousness a physiognomist would have gathered correctly that ann chester liked having her own way and was accustomed to get it  hello uncle peter she said whats the trouble  am i interrupting you ann  not a bit im only copying out a story for aunt nesta i promised her i would would you like to hear some of it  mr pett said he would not  youre missing a good thing said ann turning the pages im all worked up over it its called at dead of night and its full of crime and everything you would never think aunt nesta had such a feverish imagination there are detectives and kidnappers in it and all sorts of luxuries i suppose its the effect of reading it but you look to me as if you were trailing something youve got a sort of purposeful air  mr petts amiable face writhed into what was intended to be a bitter smile  im only trailing a quiet place to read in i never saw such a place as this house it looks big enough outside for a regiment yet when youre inside theres a poet or something in every room  what about the library isnt that sacred to you  the boy ogdens there  what a shame  wallowing in my best chair said mr pett morosely smoking cigarettes  smoking i thought he had promised aunt nesta he wouldnt smoke  well he said he wasnt of course but i know he had been i dont know what to do with that boy its no good my talking to him hehe patronises me concluded mr pett indignantly sits there on his shoulder blades with his feet on the table and talks to me with his mouth full of candy as if i were his grandson  little brute  ann was sorry for mr pett for many years now ever since the death of her mother they had been inseparable her father who was a traveller explorer biggame hunter and general sojourner in the lonelier and wilder spots of the world and paid only infrequent visits to new york had left her almost entirely in mr petts care and all her pleasantest memories were associated with him mr chesters was in many ways an admirable character but not a domestic one and his relations with his daughter were confined for the most part to letters and presents in the past few years she had come almost to regard mr pett in the light of a father hers was a nature swiftly responsive to kindness and because mr pett besides being kind was also pathetic she pitied as well as loved him there was a lingering boyishness in the financier the boyishness of the boy who muddles along in an unsympathetic world and can never do anything right and this quality called aloud to the youth in her she was at the valiant age when we burn to right wrongs and succour the oppressed and wild rebel schemes for the reformation of her small world came readily to her from the first she had been a smouldering spectator of the trials of her uncles married life and if mr pett had ever asked her advice and bound himself to act on it he would have solved his domestic troubles in explosive fashion for ann in her moments of maiden meditation had frequently devised schemes to that end which would have made his grey hair stand erect with horror  ive seen a good many boys she said but ogden is in a class by himself he ought to be sent to a strict boardingschool of course  he ought to be sent to singsing amended mr pett  why dont you send him to school  your aunt wouldnt hear of it shes afraid of his being kidnapped it happened last time he went to school you cant blame her for wanting to keep her eye on him after that  ann ran her fingers meditatively over the keys  ive sometimes thought     yes  oh nothing i must get on with this thing for aunt nesta  mr pett placed the bulk of the sunday paper on the floor beside him and began to run an appreciative eye over the comic supplement that lingering boyishness in him which endeared him to ann always led him to open his sabbath reading in this fashion greyheaded though he was he still retained both in art and in real life a taste for the slapstick no one had ever known the pure pleasure it had given him when raymond green his wifes novelist protege had tripped over a loose stairrod one morning and fallen an entire flight  from some point farther down the corridor came a muffled thudding ann stopped her work to listen  theres jerry mitchell punching the bag  eh said mr pett  i only said i could hear jerry mitchell in the gymnasium  yes hes there  ann looked out of the window thoughtfully for a moment then she swung round in her swivelchair  uncle peter  mr pett emerged slowly from the comic supplement  eh  did jerry mitchell ever tell you about that friend of his who keeps a dogs hospital down on long island somewhere i forget his name smithers or smethurst or something peopleold ladies you know and peoplebring him their dogs to be cured when they get sick he has an infallible remedy jerry tells me he makes a lot of money at it  money pett the student became pett the financier at the magic word there might be something in that if one got behind it dogs are fashionable there would be a market for a really good medicine  im afraid you couldnt put mr smethursts remedy on the market it only works when the dog has been overeating himself and not taking any exercise  well thats all these fancy dogs ever have the matter with them it looks to me as if i might do business with this man ill get his address from mitchell  its no use thinking of it uncle peter you couldnt do business with himin that way all mr smethurst does when any one brings him a fat unhealthy dog is to feed it next to nothingjust the simplest kind of food you knowand make it run about a lot and in about a week the dogs as well and happy and nice as he can possibly be  oh said mr pett disappointed  ann touched the keys of her machine softly  why i mentioned mr smethurst she said it was because we had been talking of ogden dont you think his treatment would be just what ogden needs  mr petts eyes gleamed  its a shame he cant have a week or two of it  ann played a little tune with her fingertips on the desk  it would do him good wouldnt it  silence fell upon the room broken only by the tapping of the typewriter mr pett having finished the comic supplement turned to the sporting section for he was a baseball fan of no lukewarm order the claims of business did not permit him to see as many games as he could wish but he followed the national pastime closely on the printed page and had an admiration for the napoleonic gifts of mr mcgraw which would have gratified that gentleman had he known of it  uncle peter said ann turning round again  eh  its funny you should have been talking about ogden getting kidnapped this story of aunt nestas is all about an angelchildi suppose its meant to be ogdenbeing stolen and hidden and all that its odd that she should write stories like this you wouldnt expect it of her  your aunt said mr pett lets her mind run on that sort of thing a good deal she tells me there was a time not so long ago when half the kidnappers in america were after him she sent him to school in englandor rather her husband did they were separated thenand as far as i can follow the story they all took the next boat and besieged the place  its a pity somebody doesnt smuggle him away now and keep him till hes a better boy  ah said mr pett wistfully  ann looked at him fixedly but his eyes were once more on his paper she gave a little sigh and turned to her work again  its quite demoralising typing aunt nestas stories she said they put ideas into ones head  mr pett said nothing he was reading an article of medical interest in the magazine section for he was a man who ploughed steadily through his sunday paper omitting nothing the typewriter began tapping again  great godfrey  ann swung round and gazed at her uncle in concern he was staring blankly at the paper  whats the matter  the page on which mr petts attention was concentrated was decorated with a fanciful picture in bold lines of a young man in evening dress pursuing a young woman similarly clad along what appeared to be a restaurant suppertable an enjoyable time was apparently being had by both across the page this legend ran              piccadilly jim once more              the recent adventures of young mr crocker              of new york and london  it was not upon the title however nor upon the illustration that mr petts fascinated eye rested what he was looking at was a small reproduction of a photograph which had been inserted in the body of the article it was the photograph of a woman in the early forties rather formidably handsome beneath which were printed the words              mrs nesta ford pett              wellknown society leader and authoress  ann had risen and was peering over his shoulder she frowned as she caught sight of the heading of the page then her eye fell upon the photograph  good gracious why have they got aunt nestas picture there  mr pett breathed a deep and gloomy breath  theyve found out shes his aunt i was afraid they would i dont know what she will say when she sees this  dont let her see it  she has the paper downstairs shes probably reading it now  ann was glancing through the article  it seems to be much the same sort of thing that they have published before i cant understand why the chronicle takes such an interest in jimmy crocker  well you see he used to be a newspaper man and the chronicle was the paper he worked for  ann flushed  i know she said shortly  something in her tone arrested mr petts attention  yes yes of course he said hastily i was forgetting  there was an awkward silence mr pett coughed the matter of young mr crockers erstwhile connection with the new york chronicle was one which they had tacitly decided to refrain from mentioning  i didnt know he was your nephew uncle peter  nephew by marriage corrected mr pett a little hurriedly nestas sister eugenia married his father  i suppose that makes me a sort of cousin  a distant cousin  it cant be too distant for me  there was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door mrs pett entered holding a paper in her hand she waved it before mr petts sympathetic face  i know my dear he said backing ann and i were just talking about it  the little photograph had not done mrs pett justice seen lifesize she was both handsomer and more formidable than she appeared in reproduction she was a large woman with a fine figure and bold and compelling eyes and her personality crashed disturbingly into the quiet atmosphere of the room she was the type of woman whom small diffident men seem to marry instinctively as unable to help themselves as cockleshell boats sucked into a maelstrom  what are you going to do about it she demanded sinking heavily into the chair which her husband had vacated  this was an aspect of the matter which had not occurred to mr pett he had not contemplated the possibility of actually doing anything nature had made him out of office hours essentially a passive organism and it was his tendency when he found himself in a sea of troubles to float plaintively not to take arms against it to pick up the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and fling them back was not a habit of his he scratched his chin and said nothing he went on saying nothing  if eugenia had had any sense she would have foreseen what would happen if she took the boy away from new york where he was working too hard to get into mischief and let him run loose in london with too much money and nothing to do but if she had had any sense she would never have married that impossible crocker man as i told her  mrs pett paused and her eyes glowed with reminiscent fire she was recalling the scene which had taken place three years ago between her sister and herself when eugenia had told her of her intention to marry an obscure and middleaged actor named bingley crocker mrs pett had never seen bingley crocker but she had condemned the proposed match in terms which had ended definitely and forever her relations with her sister eugenia was not a woman who welcomed criticism of her actions she was cast in the same formidable mould as mrs pett and resembled her strikingly both in appearance and character  mrs pett returned to the present the past could look after itself the present demanded surgery  one would have thought it would have been obvious even to eugenia that a boy of twentyone needed regular work  mr pett was glad to come out of his shell here he was the apostle of work and this sentiment pleased him  thats right he said every boy ought to have work  look at this young crockers record since he went to live in london he is always doing something to make himself notorious there was that breachofpromise case and that fight at the political meeting and his escapades at monte carlo andand everything and he must be drinking himself to death i think eugenias insane she seems to have no influence over him at all  mr pett moaned sympathetically  and now the papers have found out that i am his aunt and i suppose they will print my photograph whenever they publish an article about him  she ceased and sat rigid with just wrath mr pett who always felt his responsibilities as chorus keenly during these wifely monologues surmised that a remark from him was indicated  its tough he said  mrs pett turned on him like a wounded tigress  what is the use of saying that its no use saying anything  no no said mr pett prudently refraining from pointing out that she had already said a good deal  you must do something  ann entered the conversation for the first time she was not very fond of her aunt and liked her least when she was bullying mr pett there was something in mrs petts character with which the imperiousness which lay beneath anns cheerful attitude towards the world was ever at war  what can uncle peter possibly do she inquired  why get the boy back to america and make him work its the only possible thing  but is it possible  of course it is  assuming that jimmy crocker would accept an invitation to come over to america what sort of work could he do here he couldnt get his place on the chronicle back again after dropping out for all these years and making a public pest of himself all that while and outside of newspaper work what is he fit for  my dear child dont make difficulties  im not these are readymade  mr pett interposed he was always nervously apprehensive of a clash between these two ann had red hair and the nature which generally goes with red hair she was impulsive and quick of tongue andas he remembered her father had always beena little too ready for combat she was usually as quickly remorseful as she was quickly pugnacious like most persons of her colour her offer to type the story which now lay on her desk had been the amende honourable following on just such a scene with her aunt as this promised to be mr pett had no wish to see the truce thus consummated broken almost before it had had time to operate  i could give the boy a job in my office he suggested  giving young men jobs in his office was what mr pett liked doing best there were six brilliant youths living in his house and bursting with his food at that very moment whom he would have been delighted to start addressing envelopes downtown  notably his wifes nephew willie partridge whom he looked on as a specious loafer he had a stubborn disbelief in the explosive that was to revolutionise war he knew as all the world did that willies late father had been a great inventor but he did not accept the fact that willie had inherited the dead mans genius he regarded the experiments on partridgite as it was to be called with the profoundest scepticism and considered that the only thing willie had ever invented or was likely to invent was a series of ingenious schemes for living in fatted idleness on other peoples money  exactly said mrs pett delighted at the suggestion the very thing  will you write and suggest it said mr pett basking in the sunshine of unwonted commendation  what would be the use of writing eugenia would pay no attention besides i could not say all i wished to in a letter no the only thing is to go over to england and see her i shall speak very plainly to her i shall point out what an advantage it will be to the boy to be in your office and to live here     ann started  you dont mean live herein this house  of course there would be no sense in bringing the boy all the way over from england if he was to be allowed to run loose when he got here  mr pett coughed deprecatingly  i dont think that would be very pleasant for ann dear  why in the name of goodness should ann object  ann moved towards the door  thank you for thinking of it uncle peter youre always a dear but dont worry about me do just as you want to in any case im quite certain that you wont be able to get him to come over here you can see by the paper hes having far too good a time in london you can call jimmy crockers from the vasty deep but will they come when you call for them  mrs pett looked at the door as it closed behind her then at her husband  what do you mean peter about ann why wouldnt it be pleasant for her if this crocker boy came to live with us  mr pett hesitated  well its like this nesta i hope you wont tell her i told you shes sensitive about it poor girl it all happened before you and i were married ann was much younger then you know what schoolgirls are kind of foolish and sentimental it was my fault really i ought to have     good heavens peter what are you trying to tell me  she was only a child  mrs pett rose in slow horror  peter tell me dont try to break it gently  ann wrote a book of poetry and i had it published for her  mrs pett sank back in her chair  oh she saidit would have been hard to say whether with relief or disappointment whatever did you make such a fuss for why did you want to be so mysterious  it was all my fault really proceeded mr pett i ought to have known better all i thought of at the time was that it would please the child to see the poems in print and be able to give the book to her friends she did give it to her friends he went on ruefully and ever since shes been trying to live it down ive seen her bite a young fellows head off when he tried to make a grandstand play with her by quoting her poems which hed found in his sisters bookshelf  but in the name of goodness what has all this to do with young crocker  why it was this way most of the papers just gave anns book a mention among volumes received or a couple of lines that didnt amount to anything but the chronicle saw a sunday feature in it as ann was going about a lot then and was a wellknown society girl they sent this crocker boy to get an interview from her all about her methods of work and inspirations and what not we never suspected it wasnt the straight goods why that very evening i mailed an order for a hundred copies to be sent to me when the thing appeared and pinkness came upon mr pett at the recollection it was just a josh from start to finish the young hound made a joke of the poems and what ann had told him about her inspirations and quoted bits of the poems just to kid the life out of them    i thought ann would never get over it well it doesnt worry her any moreshes grown out of the schoolgirl stagebut you can bet she isnt going to get up and give three cheers and a tiger if you bring young crocker to live in the same house  utterly ridiculous said mrs pett i certainly do not intend to alter my plans because of a trivial incident that happened years ago we will sail on wednesday  very well my dear said mr pett resignedly  just as you say erjust you and i  and ogden of course  mr pett controlled a facial spasm with a powerful effort of the will he had feared this  i wouldnt dream of leaving him here while i went away after what happened when poor dear elmer sent him to school in england that time the late mr ford had spent most of his married life either quarrelling with or separated from his wife but since death he had been canonised as poor dear elmer besides the sea voyage will do the poor darling good he has not been looking at all well lately  if ogdens coming id like to take ann  why  she can he sought for a euphemism  keep in order was the expression he wished to avoid to his mind ann was the only known antidote for ogden but he felt it would be impolitic to say solook after him on the boat he concluded you know you are a bad sailor  very well bring annoh peter that reminds me of what i wanted to say to you which this dreadful thing in the paper drove completely out of my mind lord wisbeach has asked ann to marry him  mr pett looked a little hurt she didnt tell me ann usually confided in him  she didnt tell me either lord wisbeach told me he said ann had promised to think it over and give him his answer later meanwhile he had come to me to assure himself that i approved i thought that so charming of him  mr pett was frowning  she hasnt accepted him  not definitely  i hope she doesnt  dont be foolish peter it would be an excellent match  mr pett shuffled his feet  i dont like him theres something too darned smooth about that fellow  if you mean that his manners are perfect i agree with you i shall do all in my power to induce ann to accept him  i shouldnt said mr pett with more decision than was his wont you know what ann is if you try to force her to do anything she gets her ears back and wont budge her father is just the same when we were boys together sometimes  dont be absurd peter as if i should dream of trying to force ann to do anything  we dont know anything of this fellow two weeks ago we didnt know he was on the earth  what do we need to know beyond his name  mr pett said nothing but he was not convinced the lord wisbeach under discussion was a pleasantspoken and presentable young man who had called at mr petts office a short while before to consult him about investing some money he had brought a letter of introduction from hammond chester anns father whom he had met in canada where the latter was at present engaged in the comparatively mild occupation of bassfishing with their business talk the acquaintance would have begun and finished if mr pett had been able to please himself for he had not taken a fancy to lord wisbeach but he was an american with an americans sense of hospitality and the young man being a friend of hammond chester he had felt bound to invite him to riverside drivewith misgivings which were now he felt completely justified  ann ought to marry said mrs pett she gets her own way too much now however it is entirely her own affair and there is nothing that we can do she rose i only hope she will be sensible  she went out leaving mr pett gloomier than she had found him he hated the idea of ann marrying lord wisbeach who even if he had had no faults at all would be objectionable in that he would probably take her to live three thousand miles away in his own country the thought of losing ann oppressed mr pett sorely  ann meanwhile had made her way down the passage to the gymnasium which mr pett in the interests of his health had caused to be constructed in a large room at the end of the housea room designed by the original owner who had had artistic leanings for a studio the taptaptap of the leather bag had ceased but voices from within told her that jerry mitchell mr petts private physical instructor was still there she wondered who was his companion and found on opening the door that it was ogden the boy was leaning against the wall and regarding jerry with a dull and supercilious gaze which the latter was plainly finding it hard to bear  yes sir ogden was saying as ann entered i heard biggs asking her to come for a joyride  i bet she turned him down said jerry mitchell sullenly  i bet she didnt why should she biggs is an awful goodlooking fellow  what are you talking about ogden said ann  i was telling him that biggs asked celestine to go for a ride in the car with him  ill knock his block off muttered the incensed jerry  ogden laughed derisively  yes you will mother would fire you if you touched him she wouldnt stand for having her chauffeur beaten up  jerry mitchell turned an appealing face to ann ogdens revelations and especially his eulogy of biggs personal appearance had tormented him he knew that in his wooing of mrs petts maid celestine he was handicapped by his looks concerning which he had no illusions no adonis to begin with he had been so edited and reedited during a long and prosperous ring career by the gloved fists of a hundred foes that in affairs of the heart he was obliged to rely exclusively on moral worth and charm of manner he belonged to the old school of fighters who looked the part and in these days of pugilists who resemble matinee idols he had the appearance of an anachronism he was a stocky man with a round solid head small eyes an undershot jaw and a nose which illtreatment had reduced to a mere scenario a narrow strip of forehead acted as a kind of bufferstate separating his front hair from his eyebrows and he bore beyond hope of concealment the badge of his late employment the cauliflower ear yet was he a man of worth and a good citizen and ann had liked him from their first meeting as for jerry he worshipped ann and would have done anything she asked him ever since he had discovered that ann was willing to listen to and sympathise with his outpourings on the subject of his troubled wooing he had been her slave  ann came to the rescue in characteristically direct fashion  get out ogden she said  ogden tried to meet her eye mutinously but failed why he should be afraid of ann he had never been able to understand but it was a fact that she was the only person of his acquaintance whom he respected she had a bright eye and a calm imperious stare which never failed to tame him  why he muttered youre not my boss  be quick ogden  whats the big ideaordering a fellow  and close the door gently behind you said ann she turned to jerry as the order was obeyed  has he been bothering you jerry  jerry mitchell wiped his forehead  say if that kid dont quit butting in when im working in the gymyou heard what he was saying about maggie miss ann  celestine had been born maggie otoole a name which mrs pett stoutly refused to countenance in any maid of hers  why on earth do you pay any attention to him jerry you must have seen that he was making it all up he spends his whole time wandering about till he finds some one he can torment and then he enjoys himself maggie would never dream of going out in the car with biggs  jerry mitchell sighed a sigh of relief  its great for a fellow to have you in his corner miss ann  ann went to the door and opened it she looked down the passage then satisfied as to its emptiness returned to her seat  jerry i want to talk to you i have an idea something i want you to do for me  yes miss ann  weve got to do something about that child ogden hes been worrying uncle peter again and im not going to have it i warned him once that if he did it again awful things would happen to him but he didnt believe me i suppose jerrywhat sort of a man is your friend mr smethurst  do you mean smithers miss ann  i knew it was either smithers or smethurst the dog man i mean is he a man you can trust  with my last buck ive known him since we were kids  i dont mean as regards money i am going to send ogden to him for treatment and i want to know if i can rely on him to help me  for the love of mike  jerry mitchell after an instant of stunned bewilderment was looking at her with worshipping admiration he had always known that miss ann possessed a mind of no common order but this he felt was genius for a moment the magnificence of the idea took his breath away  do you mean that youre going to kidnap him miss ann  yes that is to say you areif i can persuade you to do it for me  sneak him away and send him to bud smithers doghospital  for treatment i like mr smithers methods i think they would do ogden all the good in the world  jerry was enthusiastic  why bud would make him parthuman but say isnt it taking big chances kidnappings a penitentiary offence  this isnt that sort of kidnapping  well its mighty like it  i dont think you need be afraid of the penitentiary i cant see aunt nesta prosecuting when it would mean that she would have to charge us with having sent ogden to a dogs hospital she likes publicity but it has to be the right kind of publicity no we do run a risk but it isnt that one you run the risk of losing your job here and i should certainly be sent to my grandmother for an indefinite sentence youve never seen my grandmother have you jerry shes the only person in the world im afraid of she lives miles from anywhere and has family prayers at seventhirty sharp every morning well im ready to risk her if youre ready to risk your job in such a good cause you know youre just as fond of uncle peter as i am and ogden is worrying him into a breakdown surely you wont refuse to help me jerry  jerry rose and extended a calloused hand  when do we start  ann shook the hand warmly  thank you jerry youre a jewel i envy maggie well i dont think we can do anything till they come back from england as aunt nesta is sure to take ogden with her  whos going to england  uncle peter and aunt nesta were talking just now of sailing to try and persuade a young man named crocker to come back here  crocker jimmy crocker piccadilly jim  yes why do you know him  i used to meet him sometimes when he was working on the chronicle here looks as if he was cutting a wide swathe in dear old london did you see the paper today  yes thats what made aunt nesta want to bring him over of course there isnt the remotest chance that she will be able to make him come why should he come  last time i saw jimmy crocker said jerry it was a couple of years ago when i went over to train eddie flynn for his go with porky jones at the national i bumped into him at the n s c he was a good deal tanked  hes always drinking i believe  he took me to supper at some swell joint where they all had the soupandfish on but me i felt like a dirty deuce in a clean deck he used to be a regular fellow jimmy crocker but from what you read in the papers it begins to look as if he was hitting it up too swift its always the way with those boys when you take them off a steady job and let them run around loose with their jeans full of mazuma  thats exactly why i want to do something about ogden if hes allowed to go on as he is at present he will grow up exactly like jimmy crocker  aw jimmy crocker aint in ogdens class protested jerry  yes he is theres absolutely no difference between them  say youve got it in for jim havent you miss ann jerry looked at her wonderingly whats your kick against him  ann bit her lip i object to him on principle she said i dont like his type    well im glad weve settled this about ogden jerry i knew i could rely on you but i wont let you do it for nothing uncle peter shall give you something for itenough to start that healthfarm you talk about so much then you can marry maggie and live happily ever afterwards  gee is the boss in on this too  not yet im going to tell him now hush theres some one coming  mr pett wandered in he was still looking troubled  oh anngood morning mitchellyour aunt has decided to go to england i want you to come too  you want me to help interview jimmy crocker  no no just to come along and be company on the voyage youll be such a help with ogden ann you can keep him in order how you do it i dont know you seem to make another boy of him  ann stole a glance at jerry who answered with an encouraging grin ann was constrained to make her meaning plainer than by the language of the eye  would you mind just running away for half a moment jerry she said winningly i want to say something to uncle peter  sure sure  ann turned to mr pett as the door closed  youd like somebody to make ogden a different boy wouldnt you uncle peter  i wish it was possible  hes been worrying you a lot lately hasnt he asked ann sympathetically  yes sighed mr pett  then thats all right said ann briskly i was afraid that you might not approve but if you do ill go right ahead  mr pett started violently there was something in anns voice and as he looked at her something in her face which made him fear the worst her eyes were flashing with an inspired light of a highly belligerent nature and the sun turned the red hair to which she owed her deplorable want of balance to a mass of flame there was something in the air mr pett sensed it with every nerve of his apprehensive person he gazed at ann and as he did so the years seemed to slip from him and he was a boy again about to be urged to lawless courses by the superior will of his boyhoods hero hammond chester in the boyhood of nearly every man there is a single outstanding figure some one youthful hypnotic napoleon whose will was law and at whose bidding his better judgment curled up and died in mr petts life anns father had filled this role he had dominated mr pett at an age when the mind is most malleable and nowso true is it that though time may blunt our boyish memories the traditions of boyhood live on in us and an emotional crisis will bring them to the surface as an explosion brings up the fish that lurk in the nethermost mudit was as if he were facing the youthful hammond chester again and being irresistibly impelled to some course of which he entirely disapproved but which he knew that he was destined to undertake he watched ann as a trapped man might watch a ticking bomb bracing himself for the explosion and knowing that he is helpless she was hammond chesters daughter and she spoke to him with the voice of hammond chester she was her fathers child and she was going to start something  ive arranged it all with jerry said ann hes going to help me smuggle ogden away to that friend of his i told you about who keeps the doghospital and the friend is going to keep him until he reforms isnt it a perfectly splendid idea  mr pett blanched the frightfulness of reality had exceeded anticipation  but ann  the words came from him in a strangled bleat his whole being was paralysed by a clammy horror this was beyond the uttermost limit of his fears and to complete the terror of the moment he knew even while he rebelled against the insane lawlessness of her scheme that he was going to agree to it andworst of allthat deep deep down in him there was a feeling toward it which did not dare to come to the surface but which he knew to be approval  of course jerry would do it for nothing said ann but i promised him that you would give him something for his trouble you can arrange all that yourselves later  but ann    but ann    suppose your aunt finds out who did it  well there will be a tremendous row said ann composedly and you will have to assert yourself it will be a splendid thing for you you know you are much too kind to every one uncle peter i dont think theres any one who would put up with what you do father told me in one of his letters that he used to call you patient pete as a boy  mr pett started not for many a day had a nickname which he considered the most distasteful of all possible nicknames risen up from its grave to haunt him patient pete he had thought the repulsive title buried forever in the same tomb as his dead youth patient pete the first faint glimmer of the flame of rebellion began to burn in his bosom  patient pete  patient pete said ann inexorably  but annthere was pathos in mr petts voicei like a peaceful life  youll never have one if you dont stand up for yourself you know quite well that father is right you do let every one trample on you do you think father would let ogden worry him and have his house filled with affected imitation geniuses so that he couldnt find a room to be alone in  but ann your father is different he likes fusses ive known your father contradict a man weighing two hundred pounds out of sheer exuberance theres a lot of your father in you ann ive often noticed it  there is thats why im going to make you put your foot down sooner or later youre going to turn all these loafers out of the house and first of all youre going to help us send ogden away to mr smithers  there was a long silence  its your red hair said mr pett at length with the air of a man who has been solving a problem its your red hair that makes you like this ann your father has red hair too  ann laughed  its not my fault that i have red hair uncle peter its my misfortune  mr pett shook his head  other peoples misfortune too he said    chapter ii  the exiled fan  london brooded under a grey sky there had been rain in the night and the trees were still dripping presently however there appeared in the laden haze a watery patch of blue and through this crevice in the clouds the sun diffidently at first but with gradually increasing confidence peeped down on the fashionable and exclusive turf of grosvenor square stealing across the square its rays reached the massive stone walls of drexdale house until recently the london residence of the earl of that name then passing through the window of the breakfastroom played lightly on the partially bald head of mr bingley crocker late of new york in the united states of america as he bent over his morning paper mrs bingley crocker busy across the table reading her mail the rays did not touch had they done so she would have rung for bayliss the butler to come and lower the shade for she endured liberties neither from man nor from nature  mr crocker was about fifty years of age cleanshaven and of a comfortable stoutness he was frowning as he read his smooth goodhumoured face wore an expression which might have been disgust perplexity or a blend of both his wife on the other hand was looking happy she extracted the substance from her correspondence with swift glances of her compelling eyes just as she would have extracted guilty secrets from bingley if he had had any this was a woman who like her sister nesta had been able all her life to accomplish more with a glance than other women with recrimination and threat it had been a popular belief among his friends that her late husband the wellknown pittsburg millionaire g g van brunt had been in the habit of automatically confessing all if he merely caught the eye of her photograph on his dressing table  from the growing pile of opened envelopes mrs crocker looked up a smile softening the firm line of her lips  a card from lady corstorphine bingley for her athome on the twentyninth  mr crocker still absorbed snorted absently  one of the most exclusive hostesses in england    she has influence with the right sort of people her brother the duke of devizes is the premiers oldest friend  uh  the duchess of axminster has written to ask me to look after a stall at her bazaar for the indigent daughters of the clergy  huh  bingley you arent listening what is that you are reading  mr crocker tore himself from the paper  this oh i was looking at a report of that cricket game you made me go and see yesterday  oh i am glad you have begun to take an interest in cricket it is simply a social necessity in england why you ever made such a fuss about taking it up i cant think you used to be so fond of watching baseball and cricket is just the same thing  a close observer would have marked a deepening of the look of pain on mr crockers face women say this sort of thing carelessly with no wish to wound but that makes it none the less hard to bear  from the hall outside came faintly the sound of the telephone then the measured tones of bayliss answering it mr crocker returned to his paper  bayliss entered  lady corstorphine desires to speak to you on the telephone madam  halfway to the door mrs crocker paused as if recalling something that had slipped her memory  is mr james getting up bayliss  i believe not madam i am informed by one of the housemaids who passed his door a short time back that there were no sounds  mrs crocker left the room bayliss preparing to follow her example was arrested by an exclamation from the table  say  his masters voice  say bayliss come here a minute want to ask you something  the butler approached the table it seemed to him that his employer was not looking quite himself this morning there was something a trifle wild a little haggard about his expression he had remarked on it earlier in the morning in the servants hall  as a matter of fact mr crockers ailment was a perfectly simple one he was suffering from one of those acute spasms of homesickness which invariably racked him in the earlier summer months ever since his marriage five years previously and his simultaneous removal from his native land he had been a chronic victim to the complaint the symptoms grew less acute in winter and spring but from may onward he suffered severely  poets have dealt feelingly with the emotions of practically every variety except one they have sung of ruth of israel in bondage of slaves pining for their native africa and of the miners dream of home but the sorrows of the baseball bug compelled by fate to live three thousand miles away from the polo grounds have been neglected in song bingley crocker was such a one and in summer his agonies were awful he pined away in a country where they said well played sir when they meant ataboy  bayliss do you play cricket  i am a little past the age sir in my younger days     do you understand it  yes sir i frequently spend an afternoon at lords or the oval when there is a good match  many who enjoyed a merely casual acquaintance with the butler would have looked on this as an astonishingly unexpected revelation of humanity in bayliss but mr crocker was not surprised to him from the very beginning bayliss had been a man and a brother who was always willing to suspend his duties in order to answer questions dealing with the thousand and one problems which the social life of england presented mr crockers mind had adjusted itself with difficulty to the niceties of class distinction and while he had cured himself of his early tendency to address the butler as bill he never failed to consult him as man to man in his moments of perplexity bayliss was always eager to be of assistance he liked mr crocker true his manner might have struck a more sensitive man than his employer as a shade too closely resembling that of an indulgent father towards a son who was not quite right in the head but it had genuine affection in it  mr crocker picked up his paper and folded it back at the sporting page pointing with a stubby forefinger  well what does all this mean ive kept out of watching cricket since i landed in england but yesterday they got the poison needle to work and took me off to see surrey play kent at that place lords where you say you go sometimes  i was there yesterday sir a very exciting game  exciting how do you make that out i sat in the bleachers all afternoon waiting for something to break loose doesnt anything ever happen at cricket  the butler winced a little but managed to smile a tolerant smile this man he reflected was but an american and as such more to be pitied than censured he endeavoured to explain  it was a sticky wicket yesterday sir owing to the rain  eh  the wicket was sticky sir  come again  i mean that the reason why the game yesterday struck you as slow was that the wicketi should say the turfwas stickythat is to say wet sticky is the technical term sir when the wicket is sticky the batsmen are obliged to exercise a great deal of caution as the stickiness of the wicket enables the bowlers to make the ball turn more sharply in either direction as it strikes the turf than when the wicket is not sticky  thats it is it  yes sir  thanks for telling me  not at all sir  mr crocker pointed to the paper  well now this seems to be the boxscore of the game we saw yesterday if you can make sense out of that go to it  the passage on which his finger rested was headed final score and ran as follows                  surrey               first innings      hayward c wooley b carr  67     hobbs run out  0     hayes st huish b fielder  12     ducat b fielder  33     harrison not out  11     sandham not out  6     extras  10      total for four wickets  139  bayliss inspected the cipher gravely  what is it you wish me to explain sir  why the whole thing whats it all about  its perfectly simple sir surrey won the toss and took first knock hayward and hobbs were the opening pair hayward called hobbs for a short run but the latter was unable to get across and was thrown out by midon hayes was the next man in he went out of his ground and was stumped ducat and hayward made a capital stand considering the stickiness of the wicket until ducat was bowled by a good length offbreak and hayward caught at second slip off a googly then harrison and sandham played out time  mr crocker breathed heavily through his nose  yes he said yes i had an idea that was it but i think id like to have it once again slowly start with these figures what does that sixtyseven mean opposite haywards name  he made sixtyseven runs sir  sixtyseven in one game  yes sir  why homerun baker couldnt do it  i am not familiar with mr baker sir  i suppose youve never seen a ballgame  ballgame sir  a baseball game  never sir  then bill said mr crocker reverting in his emotion to the bad habit of his early london days you havent lived see here  whatever vestige of respect for class distinctions mr crocker had managed to preserve during the opening stages of the interview now definitely disappeared his eyes shone wildly and he snorted like a warhorse he clutched the butler by the sleeve and drew him closer to the table then began to move forks spoons cups and even the contents of his plate about the cloth with an energy little short of feverish  bayliss  sir  watch said mr crocker with the air of an excitable high priest about to initiate a novice into the mysteries  he removed a roll from the basket  you see this roll thats the home plate this spoon is first base where im putting this cup is second this piece of bacon is third theres your diamond for you very well then these lumps of sugar are the infielders and the outfielders now were ready batter up he stands here catcher behind him umps behind catcher  umps i take it sir is what we would call the umpire  call him anything you like its part of the game now heres the box where ive put this dab of marmalade and heres the pitcher winding up  the pitcher would be equivalent to our bowler  i guess so though why you should call him a bowler gets past me  the box then is the bowlers wicket  have it your own way now pay attention play ball pitchers winding up put it over mike put it over some speed kid here it comes right in the groove bing batter slams it and streaks for first outfielderthis lump of sugarboots it bonehead batter touches second third no get back cant be done play it safe stick around the sack old pal second batter up pitcher getting something on the ball now besides the cover whiffs him back to the bench cyril third batter up see him rub his hands in the dirt watch this kid hes good he lets two alone then slams the next right on the nose whizzes around to second first guy the one we left on second comes home for one run thats a game take it from me bill thats a game  somewhat overcome with the energy with which he had flung himself into his lecture mr crocker sat down and refreshed himself with cold coffee  quite an interesting game said bayliss but i find now that you have explained it sir that it is familiar to me though i have always known it under another name it is played a great deal in this country  mr crocker started to his feet  it is and ive been five years here without finding it out whens the next game scheduled  it is known in england as rounders sir children play it with a soft ball and a racquet and derive considerable enjoyment from it i had never heard of it before as a pastime for adults  two shocked eyes stared into the butlers face  children the word came in a whisper  a racquet  yes sir  youyou didnt say a soft ball  yes sir  a sort of spasm seemed to convulse mr crocker he had lived five years in england but not till this moment had he realised to the full how utterly alone he was in an alien land fate had placed him bound and helpless in a country where they called baseball rounders and played it with a soft ball  he sank back into his chair staring before him and as he sat the wall seemed to melt and he was gazing upon a green field in the centre of which a man in a grey uniform was beginning a salome dance watching this person with a cold and suspicious eye stood another uniformed man holding poised above his shoulder a sturdy club two masked marvels crouched behind him in attitudes of watchful waiting on wooden seats all around sat a vast multitude of shirtsleeved spectators and the air was full of voices  one voice detached itself from the din  peanuts get yr peanuts  something that was almost a sob shook bingley crockers ample frame bayliss the butler gazed down upon him with concern he was sure the master was unwell  the case of mr bingley crocker was one that would have provided an admirable instance for a preacher seeking to instil into an impecunious and sceptical flock the lesson that money does not of necessity bring with it happiness and poetry has crystallised his position in the following stanza      an exile from home splendour dazzles in vain     oh give me my lowly thatched cottage again     the birds singing gaily that came at my call     give me them and that peace of mind dearer than all  mr crocker had never lived in a thatched cottage nor had his relations with the birds of his native land ever reached the stage of intimacy indicated by the poet but substitute lambs club for the former and members for the latter and the parallel becomes complete  until the time of his second marriage bingley crocker had been an actor a snapperup of whatever small characterparts the gods provided he had an excellent disposition no money and one son a young man of twentyone for fortyfive years he had lived a handtomouth existence in which his next meal had generally come as a pleasant surprise and then on an atlantic liner he met the widow of g g van brunt the sole heiress to that magnates immense fortune  what mrs van brunt could have seen in bingley crocker to cause her to single him out from all the world passes comprehension but the eccentricities of cupid are commonplace it were best to shun examination into first causes and stick to results the swift romance began and reached its climax in the ten days which it took one of the smaller atlantic liners to sail from liverpool to new york mr crocker was on board because he was returning with a theatrical company from a failure in london mrs van brunt because she had been told that the slow boats were the steadiest they began the voyage as strangers and ended it as an engaged couplethe affair being expedited no doubt by the fact that even if it ever occurred to bingley to resist the onslaught on his bachelor peace he soon realised the futility of doing so for the cramped conditions of shipboard intensified the always overwhelming effects of his future brides determined nature  the engagement was received in a widely differing spirit by the only surviving bloodrelations of the two principals jimmy mr crockers son on being informed that his father had plighted his troth to the widow of a prominent millionaire displayed the utmost gratification and enthusiasm and at a little supper which he gave by way of farewell to a few of his newspaper comrades and which lasted till six in the morning when it was broken up by the flying wedge of waiters for which the selected restaurant is justly famous joyfully announced that work and he would from then on be total strangers he alluded in feeling terms to the providence which watches over good young men and saves them from the blighting necessity of offering themselves in the flower of their golden youth as human sacrifices to the moloch of capitalistic greed and having commiserated with his guests in that a similar stroke of luck had not happened to each of them advised them to drown their sorrows in drink which they did  far different was the attitude of mrs crockers sister nesta pett she entirely disapproved of the proposed match at least the fact that in her final interview with her sister she described the bridegroomtobe as a wretched mummer a despicable fortunehunter a brokendown tramp and a sneaking grafting confidencetrickster lends colour to the supposition that she was not a warm supporter of it she agreed wholeheartedly with mrs crockers suggestion that they should never speak to each other again as long as they lived and it was immediately after this that the latter removed husband bingley stepson jimmy and all her other goods and chattels to london where they had remained ever since whenever mrs crocker spoke of america now it was in tones of the deepest dislike and contempt her friends were english and every year more exclusively of englands aristocracy she intended to become a leading figure in london society and already her progress had been astonishing she knew the right people lived in the right square said the right things and thought the right thoughts and in the spring of her third year had succeeded in curing bingley of his habit of beginning his remarks with the words say lemme tell ya something her progress in short was beginning to assume the aspect of a walkover  against her complete contentment and satisfaction only one thing militated that was the behaviour of her stepson jimmy  it was of jimmy that she spoke when having hung the receiver on its hook she returned to the breakfastroom bayliss had silently withdrawn and mr crocker was sitting in sombre silence at the table  a most fortunate thing has happened bingley she said it was most kind of dear lady corstorphine to ring me up it seems that her nephew lord percy whipple is back in england he has been in ireland for the past three years on the staff of the lord lieutenant and only arrived in london yesterday afternoon lady corstorphine has promised to arrange a meeting between him and james i particularly want them to be friends  eugenia said mr crocker in a hollow voice do you know they call baseball rounders over here and children play it with a soft ball  james is becoming a serious problem it is absolutely necessary that he should make friends with the right kind of young men  and a racquet said mr crocker  please listen to what i am saying bingley i am talking about james there is a crude american strain in him which seems to grow worse instead of better i was lunching with the delafields at the carlton yesterday and there only a few tables away was james with an impossible young man in appalling clothes it was outrageous that james should have been seen in public at all with such a person the man had a broken nose and talked through it he was saying in a loud voice that made everybody turn round something about his leftscissors hookwhatever that may have been i discovered later that he was a low professional pugilist from new yorka man named spike dillon i think captain wroxton said and jimmy was giving him lunchat the carlton  mr crocker said nothing constant practice had made him an adept at saying nothing when his wife was talking  james must be made to realise his responsibilities i shall have to speak to him i was hearing only the other day of a most deserving man extremely rich and lavishly generous in his contributions to the party funds who was only given a knighthood simply because he had a son who had behaved in a manner that could not possibly be overlooked the present court is extraordinarily strict in its views james cannot be too careful a certain amount of wildness in a young man is quite proper in the best set provided that he is wild in the right company every one knows that young lord datchet was ejected from the empire musichall on boatrace night every year during his residence at oxford university but nobody minds the family treats it as a joke but james has such low tastes professional pugilists i believe that many years ago it was not unfashionable for young men in society to be seen about with such persons but those days are over i shall certainly speak to james he cannot afford to call attention to himself in any way that breachofpromise case of his three years ago is i hope and trust forgotten but the slightest slip on his part might start the papers talking about it again and that would be fatal the eventual successor to a title must be quite as careful as  it was not as has been hinted above the usual practice of mr crocker to interrupt his wife when she was speaking but he did it now  say  mrs crocker frowned  i wish bingleyand i have told you so oftenthat you would not begin your sentences with the word say it is such a revolting americanism suppose some day when you are addressing the house of lords you should make a slip like that the papers would never let you hear the end of it  mr crocker was swallowing convulsively as if testing his larynx with a view to speech like saul of tarsus he had been stricken dumb by the sudden bright light which his wifes words had caused to flash upon him frequently during his sojourn in london he had wondered just why eugenia had settled there in preference to her own country it was not her wont to do things without an object yet until this moment he had been unable to fathom her motives even now it seemed almost incredible and yet what meaning would her words have other than the monstrous one which had smitten him as a blackjack  sayi mean eugeniayou dont wantyou arent tryingyou arent working toyou havent any idea of trying to get them to make me a lord have you  it is what i have been working for all these years  butbut why why thats what i want to know why  mrs crockers fine eyes glittered  i will tell you why bingley just before we were married i had a talk with my sister nesta she was insufferably offensive she referred to you in terms which i shall never forgive she affected to look down on you to think that i was marrying beneath me so i am going to make you an english peer and send nesta a newspaper clipping of the birthday honours with your name in it if i have to keep working till i die now you know  silence fell mr crocker drank cold coffee his wife stared with gleaming eyes into the glorious future  do you mean that i shall have to stop on here till they make me a lord said mr crocker limply  yes  never go back to america  not till we have succeeded  oh gee oh gosh oh hell said mr crocker bursting the bonds of years  mrs crocker though resolute was not unkindly she made allowances for her husbands state of mind she was willing to permit even american expletives during the sinkingin process of her great idea much as a broadminded cowboy might listen indulgently to the squealing of a mustang during the branding process docility and obedience would be demanded of him later but not till the first agony had abated she spoke soothingly to him  i am glad we have had this talk bingley it is best that you should know it will help you to realise your responsibilities and that brings me back to james thank goodness lord percy whipple is in town he is about james age and from what lady corstorphine tells me will be an ideal friend for him you understand who he is of course the second son of the duke of devizes the premiers closest friend the man who can practically dictate the birthday honours if james and lord percy can only form a close friendship our battle will be as good as won it will mean everything lady corstorphine has promised to arrange a meeting in the meantime i will speak to james and warn him to be more careful  mr crocker had produced a stump of pencil from his pocket and was writing on the tablecloth      lord crocker     lord bingley crocker     lord crocker of crocker     the marquis of crocker     baron crocker     bingley first viscount crocker  he blanched as he read the frightful words a sudden thought stung him  eugenia  well  what will the boys at the lambs say  i am not interested replied his wife in the boys at the lambs  i thought you wouldnt be said the future baron gloomily    chapter iii  family jars  it is a peculiarity of the human mind that with whatever apprehension it may be regarding the distant future it must return after a while to face the minor troubles of the future that is immediate the prospect of a visit to the dentist this afternoon causes us to forget for the moment the prospect of total ruin next year mr crocker therefore having tortured himself for about a quarter of an hour with his meditations on the subject of titles was jerked back to a more imminent calamity than the appearance of his name in the birthday honoursthe fact that in all probability he would be taken again this morning to watch the continuation of that infernal cricketmatch and would be compelled to spend the greater part of today as he had spent the greater part of yesterday bored to the verge of dissolution in the pavilion at lords  one gleam of hope alone presented itself like baseball this pastime of cricket was apparently affected by rain if there had been enough of it he had an idea that there had been a good deal of rain in the night but had there been sufficient to cause the teams of surrey and kent to postpone the second instalment of their serial struggle he rose from the table and went out into the hall it was his purpose to sally out into grosvenor square and examine the turf in its centre with the heel of his shoe in order to determine the stickiness or nonstickiness of the wicket he moved towards the front door hoping for the best and just as he reached it the bell rang  one of the bad habits of which his wife had cured mr crocker in the course of the years was the habit of going and answering doors he had been brought up in surroundings where every man was his own doorkeeper and it had been among his hardest tasks to learn the lesson that the perfect gentleman does not open doors but waits for the appropriate menial to come along and do it for him he had succeeded at length in mastering this great truth and nowadays seldom offended but this morning his mind was clouded by his troubles and instinct allaying itself with opportunity was too much for him his fingers had been on the handle when the ring came so he turned it  at the top of the steps which connect the main entrance of drexdale house with the sidewalk three persons were standing one was a tall and formidably handsome woman in the early forties whose appearance seemed somehow oddly familiar the second was a small fat blobby bulging boy who was chewing something the third lurking diffidently in the rear was a little man of about mr crockers own age greyhaired and thin with brown eyes that gazed meekly through rimless glasses  nobody could have been less obtrusive than this person yet it was he who gripped mr crockers attention and caused that homesick sufferers heart to give an almost painful leap for he was clothed in one of those roomy suits with square shoulders which to the seeing eye are as republican as the stars and stripes his blunttoed yellow shoes sang gaily of home and his hat was not so much a hat as an effusive greeting from gotham a long time had passed since mr crocker had set eyes upon a biped so exhilaratingly american and rapture held him speechless as one who after long exile beholds some landmark of his childhood  the female member of the party took advantage of his dumbnesswhich as she had not unnaturally mistaken him for the butler she took for a silent and respectful query as to her business and wishesto open the conversation  is mrs crocker at home please tell her that mrs pett wishes to see her  there was a rush and scurry in the corridors of mr crockers brain as about six different thoughts tried to squash simultaneously into that main chamber where there is room for only one at a time he understood now why this womans appearance had seemed familiar she was his wifes sister and that same nesta who was some day to be pulverised by the sight of his name in the birthday honours he was profoundly thankful that she had mistaken him for the butler a chill passed through him as he pictured what would have been eugenias reception of the information that he had committed such a bourgeois solecism as opening the front door to mrs pett of all people who already despised him as a low vulgarian there had been trouble enough when she had found him opening it a few weeks before to a mere collector of subscriptions for a charity he perceived with a clarity remarkable in view of the fact that the discovery of her identity had given him a feeling of physical dizziness that at all costs he must foster this misapprehension on his sisterinlaws part  fortunately he was in a position to do so he knew all about what butlers did and what they said on these occasions for in his innocently curious way he had often pumped bayliss on the subject he bowed silently and led the way to the morningroom followed by the drove of petts then opening the door stood aside to allow the procession to march past the given point  i will inform mrs crocker that you are here madam  mrs pett shepherding the chewing child before her passed into the room in the light of her outspoken sentiments regarding her brotherinlaw it is curious to reflect that his manner at this their first meeting had deeply impressed her after many months of smouldering revolt she had dismissed her own butler a day or so before sailing for england and for the first time envy of her sister eugenia gripped her she did not covet eugenias other worldly possessions but she did grudge her this supreme butler  mr pett meanwhile had been trailing in the rear with a hunted expression on his face he wore the unmistakable look of a man about to be present at a row between women and only a wet cat in a strange backyard bears itself with less jauntiness than a man faced by such a prospect a millionaire several times over mr pett would cheerfully have given much of his wealth to have been elsewhere at that moment such was the agitated state of his mind that when a hand was laid lightly upon his arm as he was about to follow his wife into the room he started so violently that his hat flew out of his hand he turned to meet the eyes of the butler who had admitted him to the house fixed on his in an appealing stare  whos leading in the pennant race said this strange butler in a feverish whisper  it was a question coming from such a source which in another than mr pett might well have provoked a blank stare of amazement such however is the almost superhuman intelligence and quickness of mind engendered by the study of americas national game that he answered without the slightest hesitation  giants  wow said the butler  no sense of anything strange or untoward about the situation came to mar the perfect joy of mr pett the overmastering joy of the baseball fan who in a strange land unexpectedly encounters a brother he thrilled with a happiness which he had never hoped to feel that morning  no signs of them slumping enquired the butler  no but you never can tell its early yet ive seen those boys lead the league till the end of august and then be nosed out  true enough said the butler sadly  mattys in shape  he is the old souper working well  like a machine he shut out the cubs the day before i sailed  fine  at this point an appreciation of the unusualness of the proceedings began to steal upon mr pett he gaped at this surprising servitor  how on earth do you know anything about baseball he demanded  the other seemed to stiffen a change came over his whole appearance he had the air of an actor who has remembered his part  i beg your pardon sir i trust i have not taken a liberty i was at one time in the employment of a gentleman in new york and during my stay i became extremely interested in the national game i picked up a few of the american idioms while in the country he smiled apologetically they sometimes slip out  let em slip said mr pett with enthusiasm youre the first thing thats reminded me of home since i left say  sir  got a good place here  eroh yes sir  well heres my card if you ever feel like making a change theres a job waiting for you at that address  thank you sir mr crocker stooped  your hat sir  he held it out gazing fondly at it the while it was like being home again to see a hat like that he followed mr pett as he went into the morningroom with an affectionate eye  bayliss was coming along the hall hurrying more than his wont the ring at the front door had found him deep in an extremely interesting piece of news in his halfpenny morning paper and he was guiltily aware of having delayed in answering it  bayliss said mr crocker in a cautious undertone go and tell mrs crocker that mrs pett is waiting to see her shes in the morningroom if youre asked say you let her in get me  yes sir said bayliss grateful for this happy solution  oh bayliss  sir  is the wicket at lords likely to be too sticky for them to go on with that game today  i hardly think it probable that there will be play sir there was a great deal of rain in the night  mr crocker passed on to his den with a lighter heart                                            it was mrs crockers habit acquired after years of practice and a sedulous study of the best models to conceal beneath a mask of wellbred indifference any emotion which she might chance to feel her dealings with the aristocracy of england had shown her that while the men occasionally permitted themselves an outburst the women never did and she had schooled herself so rigorously that nowadays she seldom even raised her voice her bearing as she approached the morningroom was calm and serene but inwardly curiosity consumed her it was unbelievable that nesta could have come to try to effect a reconciliation yet she could think of no other reason for her visit  she was surprised to find three persons in the morningroom bayliss delivering his message had mentioned only mrs pett to mrs crocker the assemblage had the appearance of being a sort of old home week of petts a kind of pett family mobscene her sisters second marriage having taken place after their quarrel she had never seen her new brotherinlaw but she assumed that the little man lurking in the background was mr pett the guess was confirmed  good morning eugenia said mrs pett  peter this is my sister eugenia my husband  mrs crocker bowed stiffly she was thinking how hopelessly american mr pett was how baggy his clothes looked what absurdly shaped shoes he wore how appalling his hat was how little hair he had and how deplorably he lacked all those graces of repose culture physical beauty refinement dignity and mental alertness which raise men above the level of the common cockroach  mr pett on his side receiving her cold glance squarely between the eyes felt as if he were being disembowelled by a clumsy amateur he could not help wondering what sort of a man this fellow crocker was whom this sisterinlaw of his had married he pictured him as a handsome powerful robust individual with a strong jaw and a loud voice for he could imagine no lesser type of man consenting to link his lot with such a woman he sidled in a circuitous manner towards a distant chair and having lowered himself into it kept perfectly still pretending to be dead like an opossum he wished to take no part whatever in the coming interview  ogden of course you know said mrs pett  she was sitting so stiffly upright on a hard chair and had so much the appearance of having been hewn from the living rock that every time she opened her mouth it was as if a statue had spoken  i know ogden said mrs crocker shortly will you please stop him fidgeting with that vase it is valuable  she directed at little ogden who was juggling aimlessly with a handsome objet dart of the early chinese school a glance similar to that which had just disposed of his stepfather but ogden required more than a glance to divert him from any pursuit in which he was interested he shifted a deposit of candy from his right cheek to his left cheek inspected mrs crocker for a moment with a pale eye and resumed his juggling mrs crocker meant nothing in his young life  ogden come and sit down said mrs pett  dont want to sit down  are you making a long stay in england nesta asked mrs crocker coldly  i dont know we have made no plans  indeed  she broke off ogden who had possessed himself of a bronze paperknife had begun to tap the vase with it the ringing note thus produced appeared to please his young mind  if ogden really wishes to break that vase said mrs crocker in a detached voice let me ring for the butler to bring him a hammer  ogden said mrs pett  oh gee a fellow cant do a thing muttered ogden and walked to the window he stood looking out into the square a slight twitching of the ears indicating that he still made progress with the candy  still the same engaging child murmured mrs crocker  i did not come here to discuss ogden said mrs pett  mrs crocker raised her eyebrows not even mrs otho lanners from whom she had learned the art could do it more effectively  i am still waiting to find out why you did come nesta  i came here to talk to you about your stepson james crocker  the discipline to which mrs crocker had subjected herself in the matter of the display of emotion saved her from the humiliation of showing surprise she waved her hand graciouslyin the manner of the duchess of axminster a supreme handwaverto indicate that she was all attention  your stepson james crocker repeated mrs pett what is it the new york papers call him peter  mr pett the human opossum came to life he had contrived to create about himself such a defensive atmosphere of nonexistence that now that he reentered the conversation it was as if a corpse had popped out of its tomb like a jackinthebox  obeying the voice of authority he pushed the tombstone to one side and poked his head out of the sepulchre  piccadilly jim he murmured apologetically  piccadilly jim said mrs crocker it is extremely impertinent of them  in spite of his misery a wan smile appeared on mr petts deathmask at this remark  they should worry about  peter  mr pett died again greatly respected  why should the new york papers refer to james at all said mrs crocker  explain peter  mr pett emerged reluctantly from the cerements he had supposed that nesta would do the talking  well hes a newsitem  why  well heres a boy thats been a regular fellowraised in americadone work on a newspapersuddenly taken off to england to become a london dudemixing with all the dukes playing pinochle with the kingnaturally theyre interested in him  a more agreeable expression came over mrs crockers face  of course that is quite true one cannot prevent the papers from printing what they wish so they have published articles about james doings in english society  doings said mr pett is right  something has got to be done about it said mrs pett  mr pett endorsed this  nestas going to lose her health if these stories go on he said  mrs crocker raised her eyebrows but she had hard work to keep a contented smile off her face  if you are not above petty jealousy nesta     mrs pett laughed a sharp metallic laugh  it is the disgrace i object to  the disgrace  what else would you call it eugenia wouldnt you be ashamed if you opened your sunday paper and came upon a full page article about your nephew having got intoxicated at the races and fought a bookmakerhaving broken up a political meetinghaving been sued for breachofpromise by a barmaid     mrs crocker preserved her wellbred calm but she was shaken the episodes to which her sister had alluded were ancient history horrors of the longdead past but it seemed that they still lived in print there and then she registered the resolve to talk to her stepson james when she got hold of him in such a manner as would scourge the offending adam out of him for once and for all  and not only that continued mrs pett that would be bad enough in itself but somehow the papers have discovered that i am the boys aunt two weeks ago they printed my photograph with one of these articles i suppose they will always do it now that is why i have come to you it must stop and the only way it can be made to stop is by taking your stepson away from london where he is running wild peter has most kindly consented to give the boy a position in his office it is very good of him for the boy cannot in the nature of things be of any use for a very long time but we have talked it over and it seems the only course i have come this morning to ask you to let us take james crocker back to america with us and keep him out of mischief by giving him honest work what do you say  mrs crocker raised her eyebrows  what do you expect me to say it is utterly preposterous i have never heard anything so supremely absurd in my life  you refuse  of course i refuse  i think you are extremely foolish  indeed  mr pett cowed in his chair he was feeling rather like a nervous and peaceloving patron of a wild western saloon who observes two cowboys reach for their hippockets neither his wife nor his sisterinlaw paid any attention to him the concluding exercises of a duel of the eyes was in progress between them after some silent agelong moments mrs crocker laughed a light laugh  most extraordinary she murmured  mrs pett was in no mood for anglicisms  you know perfectly well eugenia she said heatedly that james crocker is being ruined here for his sake if not for mine  mrs crocker laughed another light laugh one of those offensive rippling things which cause so much annoyance  dont be so ridiculous nesta ruined really it is quite true that a long while ago when he was much younger and not quite used to the ways of london society james was a little wild but all that sort of thing is over now he knowsshe paused setting herself as it were for the punchhe knows that at any moment the government may decide to give his father a peerage     the blow went home a quite audible gasp escaped her stricken sister  what  mrs crocker placed two ringed fingers before her mouth in order not to hide a languid yawn  yes didnt you know but of course you live so out of the world oh yes it is extremely probable that mr crockers name will appear in the next honours list he is very highly thought of by the powers so naturally james is quite aware that he must behave in a suitable manner he is a dear boy he was handicapped at first by getting into the wrong set but now his closest friend is lord percy whipple the second son of the duke of devizes who is one of the most eminent men in the kingdom and a personal friend of the premier  mrs pett was in bad shape under this rain of titles but she rallied herself to reply in kind  indeed she said i should like to meet him i have no doubt he knows our great friend lord wisbeach  mrs crocker was a little taken aback she had not supposed that her sister had even this small shot in her locker  do you know lord wisbeach she said  oh yes replied mrs pett beginning to feel a little better we have been seeing him every day he always says that he looks on my house as quite a home he knows so few people in new york it has been a great comfort to him i think knowing us  mrs crocker had had time now to recover her poise  poor dear wizzy she said languidly  mrs pett started  what  i suppose he is still the same dear stupid shiftless fellow he left here with the intention of travelling round the world and he has stopped in new york how like him  do you know lord wisbeach demanded mrs pett  mrs crocker raised her eyebrows  know him why i suppose after lord percy whipple he is james most intimate friend  mrs pett rose she was dignified even in defeat she collected ogden and mr pett with an eye which even ogden could see was not to be trifled with she uttered no word  must you really go said mrs crocker it was sweet of you to bother to come all the way from america like this so strange to meet any one from america nowadays most extraordinary  the cortege left the room in silence mrs crocker had touched the bell but the mourners did not wait for the arrival of bayliss they were in no mood for the formalities of polite society they wanted to be elsewhere and they wanted to be there quick the front door had closed behind them before the butler reached the morningroom  bayliss said mrs crocker with happy shining face send for the car to come round at once  very good madam  is mr james up yet  i believe not madam  mrs crocker went upstairs to her room if bayliss had not been within earshot she would probably have sung a bar or two her amiability extended even to her stepson though she had not altered her intention of speaking eloquently to him on certain matters when she could get hold of him that however could wait for the moment she felt in vein for a gentle drive in the park  a few minutes after she had disappeared there was a sound of slow footsteps on the stairs and a young man came down into the hall bayliss who had finished telephoning to the garage for mrs crockers limousine and was about to descend to those lower depths where he had his being turned and a grave smile of welcome played over his face  good morning mr james he said    chapter iv  jimmys disturbing news  jimmy crocker was a tall and wellknit young man who later on in the day would no doubt be at least passably goodlooking at the moment an unbecoming pallor marred his face and beneath his eyes were marks that suggested that he had slept little and ill he stood at the foot of the stairs yawning cavernously  bayliss he said have you been painting yourself yellow  no sir  strange your face looks a bright gamboge to me and your outlines wobble bayliss never mix your drinks i say this to you as a friend is there any one in the morningroom  no mr james  speak softly bayliss for i am not well i am conscious of a strange weakness lead me to the morningroom then and lay me gently on a sofa these are the times that try mens souls  the sun was now shining strongly through the windows of the morningroom bayliss lowered the shades jimmy crocker sank onto the sofa and closed his eyes  bayliss  sir  a conviction is stealing over me that i am about to expire  shall i bring you a little breakfast mr james  a strong shudder shook jimmy  dont be flippant bayliss he protested try to cure yourself of this passion for being funny at the wrong time your comedy is good but tact is a finer quality than humour perhaps you think i have forgotten that morning when i was feeling just as i do today and you came to my bedside and asked me if i would like a nice rasher of ham i havent and i never shall you may bring me a brandyandsoda not a large one a couple of bathtubs full will be enough  very good mr james  and now leave me bayliss for i would be alone i have to make a series of difficult and exhaustive tests to ascertain whether i am still alive  when the butler had gone jimmy adjusted the cushions closed his eyes and remained for a space in a state of coma he was trying as well as an exceedingly severe headache would permit to recall the salient events of the previous night at present his memories refused to solidify they poured about in his brain in a fluid and formless condition exasperating to one who sought for hard facts  it seemed strange to jimmy that the shadowy and inchoate vision of a combat a fight a brawl of some kind persisted in flitting about in the recesses of his mind always just far enough away to elude capture the absurdity of the thing annoyed him a man has either indulged in a fight overnight or he has not indulged in a fight overnight there can be no middle course that he should be uncertain on the point was ridiculous yet try as he would he could not be sure there were moments when he seemed on the very verge of settling the matter and then some invisible person would meanly insert a redhot corkscrew in the top of his head and begin to twist it and this would interfere with calm thought he was still in a state of uncertainty when bayliss returned bearing healing liquids on a tray  shall i set it beside you sir  jimmy opened one eye  indubitably no mean word that bayliss for the morning after try it yourself next time bayliss who let me in this morning  let you in sir  precisely i was out and now i am in obviously i must have passed the front door somehow this is logic  i fancy you let yourself in mr james with your key  that would seem to indicate that i was in a state of icy sobriety yet if such is the case how is it that i cant remember whether i murdered somebody or not last night it isnt the sort of thing your sober man would lightly forget have you ever murdered anybody bayliss  no sir  well if you had you would remember it next morning  i imagine so mr james  well its a funny thing but i cant get rid of the impression that at some point in my researches into the night life of london yestreen i fell upon some person to whom i had never been introduced and committed mayhem upon his person  it seemed to bayliss that the time had come to impart to mr james a piece of news which he had supposed would require no imparting he looked down upon his young masters recumbent form with a grave commiseration it was true that he had never been able to tell with any certainty whether mr james intended the statements he made to be taken literally or not but on the present occasion he seemed to have spoken seriously and to be genuinely at a loss to recall an episode over the printed report of which the entire domestic staff had been gloating ever since the arrival of the halfpenny morning paper to which they subscribed  do you really mean it mr james he enquired cautiously  mean what  you have really forgotten that you were engaged in a fracas last night at the six hundred club  jimmy sat up with a jerk staring at this omniscient man then the movement having caused a renewal of the operations of the redhot corkscrew he fell back again with a groan  was i how on earth did you know why should you know all about it when i cant remember a thing it was my fault not yours  there is quite a long report of it in todays daily sun mr james  a report in the sun  half a column mr james would you like me to fetch the paper i have it in my pantry  i should say so trot a quick heat back with it this wants looking into  bayliss retired to return immediately with the paper jimmy took it gazed at it and handed it back  i overestimated my powers it cant be done have you any important duties at the moment bayliss  no sir  perhaps you wouldnt mind reading me the bright little excerpt then  certainly sir  it will be good practice for you i am convinced i am going to be a confirmed invalid for the rest of my life and it will be part of your job to sit at my bedside and read to me by the way does the paper say who the party of the second part was who was the citizen with whom i went to the mat  lord percy whipple mr james  lord who  lord percy whipple  never heard of him carry on bayliss  jimmy composed himself to listen yawning    chapter v  the morning after  bayliss took a spectaclecase from the recesses of his costume opened it took out a pair of goldrimmed glasses dived into the jungle again came out with a handkerchief polished the spectacles put them on his nose closed the case restored it to its original position replaced the handkerchief and took up the paper  why the hesitation bayliss why the coyness enquired jimmy lying with closed eyes begin  i was adjusting my glasses sir  all set now  yes sir shall i read the headlines first  read everything  the butler cleared his throat  good heavens bayliss moaned jimmy starting dont gargle have a heart go on  bayliss began to read           fracas in fashionable nightclub               sprigs of nobility brawl  jimmy opened his eyes interested  am i a sprig of nobility  it is what the paper says sir  we live and learn carry on  the butler started to clear his throat but checked himself           sensational international contest                     battling percy                       england                           v                      cyclone jim                       america             full description by our expert  jimmy sat up  bayliss youre indulging that distorted sense of humour of yours again that isnt in the paper  yes sir very large headlines  jimmy groaned  bayliss ill give you a piece of advice which may be useful to you when you grow up never go about with newspaper men it all comes back to me out of pure kindness of heart i took young bill blake of the sun to supper at the six hundred last night this is my reward i suppose he thinks it funny newspaper men are a low lot bayliss  shall i go on sir  most doubtless let me hear all  bayliss resumed he was one of those readers who whether their subject be a murder case or a funny anecdote adopt a measured and sepulchral delivery which gives a suggestion of tragedy and horror to whatever they read at the church which he attended on sundays of which he was one of the most influential and respected members children would turn pale and snuggle up to their mothers when bayliss read the lessons young mr blakes account of the overnight proceedings at the six hundred club he rendered with a gloomy gusto more marked even than his wont it had a topical interest for him which urged him to extend himself  at an early hour this morning when our myriad readers were enjoying that refreshing and brainrestoring sleep so necessary to the proper appreciation of the daily sun at the breakfast table one of the most interesting sporting events of the season was being pulled off at the six hundred club in regent street where after three rounds of fast exchanges james b crocker the wellknown american welterweight scrapper succeeded in stopping lord percy whipple second son of the duke of devizes better known as the pride of old england once again the superiority of the american over the english style of boxing was demonstrated battling percy has a kind heart but cyclone jim packs the punch  the immediate cause of the encounter had to do with a disputed table which each gladiator claimed to have engaged in advance over the telephone  i begin to remember said jimmy meditatively a pill with buttercoloured hair tried to jump my claim honeyed words proving fruitless i soaked him on the jaw it may be that i was not wholly myself i seem to remember an animated session at the empire earlier in the evening which may have impaired my selfcontrol proceed  one word leading to others which in their turn led to several more cyclone jim struck battling percy on what our rude forefathers were accustomed to describe as the mazzard and the gong sounded for                  round one  both men came up fresh and eager to mix things though it seems only too probable that they had already been mixing more things than was good for them battling percy tried a right swing which got home on a waiter cyclone jim put in a rapid onetwo punch which opened a large gash in the atmosphere both men sparred cautiously being hampered in their movements by the fact which neither had at this stage of the proceedings perceived that they were on opposite sides of the disputed table a clever fitzsimmons shift on the part of the battler removed this obstacle and some brisk work ensued in neutral territory percy landed twice without a return the battlers round by a shade                  round two  the cyclone came out of his corner with a rush getting home on the battlers shirtfront and following it up with a right to the chin percy swung wildly and upset a bottle of champagne on a neighbouring table a good rally followed both men doing impressive infighting the cyclone landed three without a return the cyclones round                  round three  percy came up weak seeming to be overtrained the cyclone waded in using both hands effectively the battler fell into a clinch but the cyclone broke away and measuring his distance picked up a haymaker from the floor and put it over percy down and out  interviewed by our representative after the fight cyclone jim said the issue was never in doubt i was handicapped at the outset by the fact that i was under the impression that i was fighting three twinbrothers and i missed several opportunities of putting over the winning wallop by attacking the outside ones it was only in the second round that i decided to concentrate my assault on the one in the middle when the affair speedily came to a conclusion i shall not adopt pugilism as a profession the prizes are attractive but it is too much like work  bayliss ceased and silence fell upon the room  is that all  that is all sir  and about enough  very true sir  you know bayliss said jimmy thoughtfully rolling over on the couch life is peculiar not to say odd you never know what is waiting for you round the corner you start the day with the fairest prospects and before nightfall everything is as rocky and dingbasted as stig tossed full of doodlegammon why is this bayliss  i couldnt say sir  look at me i go out to spend a happy evening meaning no harm to any one and i come back all blue with the blood of the aristocracy we now come to a serious point do you think my lady stepmother has read that sporting chronicle  i fancy not mr james  on what do you base these words of comfort  mrs crocker does not read the halfpenny papers sir  true she does not i had forgotten on the other hand the probability that she will learn about the little incident from other sources is great i think the merest prudence suggests that i keep out of the way for the time being lest i be fallen upon and questioned i am not equal to being questioned this morning i have a headache which starts at the soles of my feet and gets worse all the way up where is my stepmother  mrs crocker is in her room mr james she ordered the car to be brought round at once it should be here at any moment now sir i think mrs crocker intends to visit the park before luncheon  is she lunching out  yes sir  then if i pursue the excellent commonsense tactics of the lesser sandeel which as you doubtless know buries itself tail upwards in the mud on hearing the baying of the eelhounds and remains in that position till the danger is past i shall be able to postpone an interview should you be questioned as to my whereabouts inflate your chest and reply in a clear and manly voice that i have gone out you know not where may i rely on your benevolent neutrality bayliss  very good mr james  i think i will go and sit in my fathers den a man may lie hid there with some success as a rule  jimmy heaved himself painfully off the sofa blinked and set out for the den where his father in a deep armchair was smoking a restful pipe and reading the portions of the daily papers which did not deal with the game of cricket  mr crockers den was a small room at the back of the house it was not luxurious and it looked out onto a blank wall but it was the spot he liked best in all that vast pile which had once echoed to the tread of titled shoes for as he sometimes observed to his son it had the distinction of being the only room on the ground floor where a fellow could move without stubbing his toe on a countess or an honourable in this peaceful backwater he could smoke a pipe put his feet up take off his coat and generally indulge in that liberty and pursuit of happiness to which the constitution entitles a freeborn american nobody ever came there except jimmy and himself  he did not suspend his reading at his sons entrance he muttered a welcome through the clouds but he did not raise his eyes jimmy took the other armchair and began to smoke silently it was the unwritten law of the den that soothing silence rather than aimless chatter should prevail it was not until a quarter of an hour had passed that mr crocker dropped his paper and spoke  say jimmy i want to talk to you  say on you have our ear  seriously  continuealways however keeping before you the fact that i am a sick man last night was a wild night on the moors dad  its about your stepmother she was talking at breakfast about you shes sore at you for giving spike dillon lunch at the carlton you oughtnt to have taken him there jimmy thats what got her goat she was there with a bunch of swells and they had to sit and listen to spike talking about his halfscissors hook  whats their kick against spikes halfscissors hook its a darned good one  she said she was going to speak to you about it i thought id let you know  thanks dad but was that all  all  all that she was going to speak to me about sure there was nothing else  she didnt say anything about anything else  then she doesnt know fine  mr crockers feet came down from the mantelpiece with a crash  jimmy you havent been raising cain again  no no dad nothing serious highspirited young patrician stuff the sort of thing thats expected of a fellow in my position  mr crocker was not to be comforted  jimmy youve got to pull up honest you have i dont care for myself i like to see a boy having a good time but your stepmother says youre apt to queer us with the people up top the way youre going on lord knows i wouldnt care if things were different but ill tell you exactly how i stand i didnt get wise till this morning your stepmother sprang it on me suddenly ive often wondered what all this stuff was about this living in london and trailing the swells i couldnt think what was your stepmothers idea now i know jimmy shes trying to get them to make me a peer  what  just that and she says  but dad this is rich this is comedy of a high order a peer good heavens if it comes off what shall i be this title business is all so complicated i know i should have to change my name to hon rollo cholmondeley or the hon aubrey marjoribanks but what i want to know is which i want to be prepared for the worst  and you see jimmy these people up top the guys who arrange the giving of titles are keeping an eye on you because you would have the title after me and naturally they dont want to get stung i gathered all that from your stepmother say jimmy im not asking a lot of you but there is just one thing you can do for me without putting yourself out too much  ill do it dad if it kills me slip me the info  your stepmothers friend lady corstorphines nephew     its not the sort of story to ask a man with a headache to follow i hope it gets simpler as it goes along  your stepmother wants you to be a good fellow and make friends with this boy you see his father is in right with the premier and has the biggest kind of a pull when it comes to handing out titles  is that all you want leave it to me inside of a week ill be playing kissinthering with him the whole force of my sunny personality shall be directed towards making him love me whats his name  lord percy whipple  jimmys pipe fell with a clatter  dad pull yourself together reflect you know you dont seriously mean lord percy whipple  eh  jimmy laid a soothing hand on his fathers shoulder  dad prepare yourself for the big laugh this is where you throw your head back and roar with honest mirth i met lord percy whipple last night at the six hundred club words ensued i fell upon percy and beat his block off how it started except that we both wanted the same table i couldnt say why that i cannot tell said he but twas a famous victory if i had known dad nothing would have induced me to lay a hand upon perce save in the way of kindness but not even knowing who he was it would appear from contemporary accounts of the affair that i just naturally sailed in and expunged the poor dear boy  the stunning nature of this information had much the same effect on mr crocker as the announcement of his ruin has upon the good old man in melodrama he sat clutching the arms of his chair and staring into space saying nothing dismay was written upon his anguished countenance  his collapse sobered jimmy for the first time he perceived that the situation had another side than the humorous one which had appealed to him he had anticipated that mr crocker who as a general thing shared his notions of what was funny and could be relied on to laugh in the right place would have been struck like himself by the odd and pleasing coincidence of his having picked on for purposes of assault and battery the one young man with whom his stepmother wished him to form a firm and lasting friendship he perceived now that his father was seriously upset neither jimmy nor mr crocker possessed a demonstrative nature but there had always existed between them the deepest affection jimmy loved his father as he loved nobody else in the world and the thought of having hurt him was like a physical pain his laughter died away and he set himself with a sinking heart to try to undo the effect of his words  im awfully sorry dad i had no idea you would care i wouldnt have done a fool thing like that for a million dollars if id known isnt there anything i can do gee whiz ill go right round to percy now and apologise ill lick his boots dont you worry dad ill make it all right  the whirl of words roused mr crocker from his thoughts  it doesnt matter jimmy dont worry yourself its only a little unfortunate because your stepmother says she wont think of our going back to america till these people here have given me a title she wants to put one over on her sister thats all thats troubling me the thought that this affair will set us back this lord percy being in so strong with the guys who give the titles i guess it will mean my staying on here for a while longer and id liked to have seen another ballgame jimmy do you know they call baseball rounders in this country and children play it with a soft ball  jimmy was striding up and down the little room remorse had him in its grip  what a damned fool i am  never mind jimmy its unfortunate but it wasnt your fault you couldnt know  it was my fault nobody but a fool like me would go about beating people up but dont worry dad its going to be all right ill fix it im going right round to this fellow percy now to make things all right i wont come back till ive squared him dont you bother yourself about it any longer dad its going to be all right    chapter vi  jimmy abandons piccadilly  jimmy removed himself sorrowfully from the doorstep of the duke of devizes house in cleveland row his mission had been a failure in answer to his request to be permitted to see lord percy whipple the butler had replied that lord percy was confined to his bed and was seeing nobody he eyed jimmy on receiving his name with an interest which he failed to conceal for he too like bayliss had read and heartily enjoyed bill blakes spirited version of the affair of last night which had appeared in the daily sun indeed he had clipped the report out and had been engaged in pasting it in an album when the bell rang  in face of this repulse jimmys campaign broke down he was at a loss to know what to do next he ebbed away from the dukes front door like an army that has made an unsuccessful frontal attack on an impregnable fortress he could hardly force his way in and search for lord percy  he walked along pall mall deep in thought it was a beautiful day the rain which had fallen in the night and relieved mr crocker from the necessity of watching cricket had freshened london up  the sun was shining now from a turquoise sky a gentle breeze blew from the south jimmy made his way into piccadilly and found that thoroughfare aroar with happy automobilists and cheery pedestrians their gaiety irritated him he resented their apparent enjoyment of life  jimmys was not a nature that lent itself readily to introspection but he was putting himself now through a searching selfexamination which was revealing all kinds of unsuspected flaws in his character he had been having too good a time for years past to have leisure to realise that he possessed any responsibilities he had lived each day as it came in the spirit of the monks of thelema but his fathers reception of the news of last nights escapade and the few words he had said had given him pause life had taken on of a sudden a less simple aspect dimly for he was not accustomed to thinking along these lines he perceived the numbing truth that we human beings are merely as many pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and that our every movement affects the fortunes of some other piece just so faintly at first and taking shape by degrees must the germ of civic spirit have come to prehistoric man we are all individualists till we wake up  the thought of having done anything to make his father unhappy was bitter to jimmy crocker they had always been more like brothers than father and son hard thoughts about himself surged through jimmys mind with a dejectedness to which it is possible that his headache contributed he put the matter squarely to himself his father was longing to return to americahe jimmy by his idiotic behaviour was putting obstacles in the way of that returnwhat was the answer the answer to jimmys way of thinking was that all was not well with james crocker that when all the evidence was weighed james crocker would appear to be a fool a worm a selfish waster and a hopeless lowdown skunk  having come to this conclusion jimmy found himself so low in spirit that the cheerful bustle of piccadilly was too much for him he turned and began to retrace his steps arriving in due course at the top of the haymarket he hesitated then turned down it till he reached cockspur street here the transatlantic steamship companies have their offices and so it came about that jimmy chancing to look up as he walked perceived before him riding gallantly on a cardboard ocean behind a plateglass window the model of a noble vessel he stopped conscious of a curious thrill there is a superstition in all of us when an accidental happening chances to fit smoothly in with a mood seeming to come as a direct commentary on that mood we are apt to accept it in defiance of our pure reason as an omen jimmy strode to the window and inspected the model narrowly the sight of it had started a new train of thought his heart began to race hypnotic influences were at work on him  why not could there be a simpler solution of the whole trouble  inside the office he would see a man with whiskers buying a ticket for new york the simplicity of the process fascinated him all you had to do was to walk in bend over the counter while the clerk behind it made dabs with a pencil at the illustrated plate of the ships interior organs and hand over your money a child could do it if in funds at this thought his hand strayed to his trouserpocket a musical crackling of banknotes proceeded from the depths his quarterly allowance had been paid to him only a short while before and though a willing spender he still retained a goodly portion of it he rustled the notes again there was enough in that pocket to buy three tickets to new york should he    or on the other handalways look on both sides of the questionshould he not  it would certainly seem to be the best thing for all parties if he did follow the impulse by remaining in london he was injuring everybody himself included    well there was no harm in making enquiries probably the boat was full up anyway    he walked into the office  have you anything left on the atlantic this trip  the clerk behind the counter was quite the wrong sort of person for jimmy to have had dealings with in his present mood what jimmy needed was a grave sensible man who would have laid a hand on his shoulder and said do nothing rash my boy the clerk fell short of this ideal in practically every particular he was about twentytwo and he seemed perfectly enthusiastic about the idea of jimmy going to america he beamed at jimmy  plenty of room he said very few people crossing give you excellent accommodation  when does the boat sail  eight tomorrow morning from liverpool boattrain leaves paddington six tonight  prudence came at the eleventh hour to check jimmy this was not a matter he perceived to be decided recklessly on the spur of a sudden impulse above all it was not a matter to be decided before lunch an empty stomach breeds imagination he had ascertained that he could sail on the atlantic if he wished to the sensible thing to do now was to go and lunch and see how he felt about it after that he thanked the clerk and started to walk up the haymarket feeling hardheaded and practical yet with a strong premonition that he was going to make a fool of himself just the same  it was halfway up the haymarket that he first became conscious of the girl with the red hair  plunged in thought he had not noticed her before and yet she had been walking a few paces in front of him most of the way she had come out of panton street walking briskly as one going to keep a pleasant appointment she carried herself admirably with a jaunty swing  having become conscious of this girl jimmy ever a warm admirer of the sex began to feel a certain interest stealing over him with interest came speculation he wondered who she was he wondered where she had bought that excellently fitting suit of tailormade grey he admired her back and wondered whether her face if seen would prove a disappointment thus musing he drew near to the top of the haymarket where it ceases to be a street and becomes a whirlpool of rushing traffic and here the girl having paused and looked over her shoulder stepped off the sidewalk as she did so a taxicab rounded the corner quickly from the direction of coventry street  the agreeable surprise of finding the girls face fully as attractive as her back had stimulated jimmy so that he was keyed up for the exhibition of swift presenceofmind he jumped forward and caught her arm and swung her to one side as the cab rattled past its driver thinking hard thoughts to himself the whole episode was an affair of seconds  thank you said the girl  she rubbed the arm which he had seized with rather a rueful expression she was a little white and her breath came quickly  i hope i didnt hurt you said jimmy  you did very much but the taxi would have hurt me more  she laughed she looked very attractive when she laughed she had a small piquant vivacious face jimmy as he looked at it had an odd feeling that he had seen her beforewhen and where he did not know that mass of redgold hair seemed curiously familiar somewhere in the hinterland of his mind there lurked a memory but he could not bring it into the open as for the girl if she had ever met him before she showed no signs of recollecting it jimmy decided that if he had seen her it must have been in his reporter days she was plainly an american and he occasionally had the feeling that he had seen every one in america when he had worked for the chronicle  thats right he said approvingly always look on the bright side  i only arrived in london yesterday said the girl and i havent got used to your keepingtotheleft rules i dont suppose i shall ever get back to new york alive perhaps as you have saved my life you wouldnt mind doing me another service can you tell me which is the nearest and safest way to a restaurant called the regent grill  its just over there at the corner of regent street as to the safest way if i were you i should cross over at the top of the street there and then work round westward otherwise you will have to cross piccadilly circus  i absolutely refuse even to try to cross piccadilly circus thank you very much i will follow your advice i hope i shall get there it doesnt seem at all likely  she gave him a little nod and moved away jimmy turned into that drugstore at the top of the haymarket at which so many londoners have found healing and comfort on the morning after and bought the pink drink for which his system had been craving since he rose from bed he wondered why as he drained it he should feel ashamed and guilty  a few minutes later he found himself with mild surprise going down the steps of the regent grill it was the last place he had had in his mind when he had left the steamship companys offices in quest of lunch he had intended to seek out some quiet restful nook where he could be alone with his thoughts if anybody had told him then that five minutes later he would be placing himself of his own free will within the range of a restaurant orchestra playing my little grey home in the westand the orchestra at the regent played little elsehe would not have believed him  restaurants in all large cities have their ups and downs at this time the regent grill was enjoying one of those bursts of popularity for which restaurateurs pray to whatever strange gods they worship the more prosperous section of londons bohemia flocked to it daily when jimmy had deposited his hat with the robberband who had their cave just inside the main entrance and had entered the grillroom he found it congested there did not appear to be a single unoccupied table  from where he stood he could see the girl of the redgold hair her back was towards him and she was sitting at a table against one of the pillars with a little man with eyeglasses a handsome woman in the forties and a small stout boy who was skirmishing with the olives as jimmy hesitated the vigilant headwaiter who knew him well perceived him and hurried up  in one moment mister crockaire he said and began to scatter commands among the underlings i will place a table for you in the aisle  next to that pillar please said jimmy  the underlings had produced a small tableapparently from up their sleeves and were draping it in a cloth jimmy sat down and gave his order ordering was going on at the other table the little man seemed depressed at the discovery that corn on the cob and softshelled crabs were not to be obtained and his wifes reception of the news that clams were not included in the regents billoffare was so indignant that one would have said that she regarded the fact as evidence that great britain was going to pieces and would shortly lose her place as a world power  a selection having finally been agreed upon the orchestra struck up my little grey home in the west and no attempt was made to compete with it when the last lingering strains had died away and the violinistleader having straightened out the kinks in his person which the rendition of the melody never failed to produce had bowed for the last time a clear musical voice spoke from the other side of the pillar  jimmy crocker is a worm  jimmy spilled his cocktail it might have been the voice of conscience  i despise him more than any one on earth i hate to think that hes an american  jimmy drank the few drops that remained in his glass partly to make sure of them partly as a restorative it is an unnerving thing to be despised by a redhaired girl whose life you have just saved to jimmy it was not only unnerving it was uncanny this girl had not known him when they met on the street a few moments before how then was she able to display such intimate acquaintance with his character now as to describe himjustly enoughas a worm mingled with the mystery of the thing was its pathos the thought that a girl could be as pretty as this one and yet dislike him so much was one of the saddest things jimmy had ever come across it was like one of those things which make me weep in this great city so dear to the hearts of the sobwriters of his late newspaper  a waiter bustled up with a highball jimmy thanked him with his eyes he needed it he raised it to his lips  hes always drinking  he set it down hurriedly  and making a disgraceful exhibition of himself in public i always think jimmy crocker  jimmy began to wish that somebody would stop this girl why couldnt the little man change the subject to the weather or that stout child start prattling about some general topic surely a boy of that age newly arrived in london must have all sorts of things to prattle about but the little man was dealing strenuously with a breaded cutlet while the stout boy grimly silent surrounded fishpie in the forthright manner of a starving python as for the elder woman she seemed to be wrestling with unpleasant thoughts beyond speech  i always think that jimmy crocker is the worst case i know of the kind of american young man who spends all his time in europe and tries to become an imitation englishman most of them are the sort any country would be glad to get rid of but he used to work once so you cant excuse him on the ground that he hasnt the sense to know what hes doing hes deliberately chosen to loaf about london and make a pest of himself he went to pieces with his eyes open hes a perfect utter hopeless worm  jimmy had never been very fond of the orchestra at the regent grill holding the view that it interfered with conversation and made for an unhygienic rapidity of mastication but he was profoundly grateful to it now for bursting suddenly into la boheme the loudest item in its repertory under cover of that protective din he was able to toy with a steaming dish which his waiter had brought probably that girl was saying all sorts of things about him still but he could not hear them  the music died away for a moment the tortured air quivered in comparative silence then the girls voice spoke again she had however selected another topic of conversation  ive seen all i want to of england she said ive seen westminster abbey and the houses of parliament and his majestys theatre and the savoy and the cheshire cheese and ive developed a frightful homesickness why shouldnt we go back tomorrow  for the first time in the proceedings the elder woman spoke she cast aside her mantle of gloom long enough to say yes then wrapped it round her again the little man who had apparently been waiting for her vote before giving his own said that the sooner he was on board a new yorkbound boat the better he would be pleased the stout boy said nothing he had finished his fishpie and was now attacking jam roll with a sort of morose resolution  theres certain to be a boat said the girl there always is youve got to say that for englandits an easy place to get back to america from she paused what i cant understand is how after having been in america and knowing what it was like jimmy crocker could stand living     the waiter had come to jimmys side bearing cheese but jimmy looked at it with dislike and shook his head in silent negation he was about to depart from this place his capacity for absorbing hometruths about himself was exhausted he placed a noiseless sovereign on the table caught the waiters eye registered renunciation and departed softfooted down the aisle the waiter a man who had never been able to bring himself to believe in miracles revised the views of a lifetime he looked at the sovereign then at jimmy then at the sovereign again then he took up the coin and bit it furtively  a few minutes later a hatcheck boy untipped for the first time in his predatory career was staring at jimmy with equal intensity but with far different feelings speechless concern was limned on his young face  the commissionaire at the piccadilly entrance of the restaurant touched his hat ingratiatingly with the smug confidence of a man who is accustomed to getting sixpence a time for doing it  taxi mr crocker  a worm said jimmy  beg pardon sir  always drinking explained jimmy and making a pest of himself  he passed on the commissionaire stared after him as intently as the waiter and the hatcheck boy he had sometimes known mr crocker like this after supper but never before during the luncheon hour  jimmy made his way to his club in northumberland avenue for perhaps half an hour he sat in a condition of coma in the smokingroom then his mind made up he went to one of the writingtables he sat awaiting inspiration for some minutes then began to write  the letter he wrote was to his father   dear dad  i have been thinking over what we talked about this morning and it seems to me the best thing i can do is to drop out of sight for a brief space if i stay on in london i am likely at any moment to pull some boner like last nights which will spill the beans for you once more the least i can do for you is to give you a clear field and not interfere so i am off to new york by tonights boat  i went round to percys to try to grovel in the dust before him but he wouldnt see me its no good grovelling in the dust of the front steps for the benefit of a man whos in bed on the second floor so i withdrew in more or less good order i then got the present idea mark how all things work together for good when they come to you and say no title for you your son slugged our pal percy all you have to do is to come back at them with i know my son slugged percy and believe me i didnt do a thing to him i packed him off to america within twentyfour hours get me right boys im antijimmy and propercy to which their reply will be oh well in that case arise lord crocker or whatever they say when slipping a title to a deserving guy so you will see that by making this getaway i am doing the best i can to put things straight i shall give this to bayliss to give to you i am going to call him up on the phone in a minute to have him pack a few simple toothbrushes and so on for me on landing in new york i shall instantly proceed to the polo grounds to watch a game of rounders and will cable you the full score well i think thats about all so goodbyeor even farewellfor the present  j  ps i know youll understand dad im doing what seems to me the only possible thing dont worry about me i shall be all right ill get back my old job and be a terrific success all round you go ahead and get that title and then meet me at the entrance of the polo grounds ill be looking for you  pps im a worm   the young clerk at the steamship offices appeared rejoiced to see jimmy once more with a sunny smile he snatched a pencil from his ear and plunged it into the vitals of the atlantic  how about e a hundred and eight  suits me  youre too late to go in the passengerlist of course  jimmy did not reply he was gazing rigidly at a girl who had just come in a girl with red hair and a friendly smile  so youre sailing on the atlantic too she said with a glance at the chart on the counter how odd we have just decided to go back on her too theres nothing to keep us here and were all homesick well you see i wasnt run over after i left you  a delicious understanding relieved jimmys swimming brain as thunder relieves the tense and straining air the feeling that he was going mad left him as the simple solution of his mystery came to him this girl must have heard of him in new yorkperhaps she knew people whom he knew and it was on hearsay not on personal acquaintance that she based that dislike of him which she had expressed with such freedom and conviction so short a while before at the regent grill she did not know who he was  into this soothing stream of thought cut the voice of the clerk  what name please  jimmys mind rocked again why were these things happening to him today of all days when he needed the tenderest treatment when he had a headache already  the clerk was eyeing him expectantly he had laid down his pencil and was holding aloft a pen jimmy gulped every name in the english language had passed from his mind and then from out of the dark came inspiration  bayliss he croaked  the girl held out her hand  then we can introduce ourselves at last my name is ann chester how do you do mr bayliss  how do you do miss chester  the clerk had finished writing the ticket and was pressing labels and a pink paper on him the paper he gathered dully was a form and had to be filled up he examined it and found it to be a searching document some of its questions could be answered offhand others required thought  height simple five foot eleven  hair simple brown  eyes simple again blue  next queries of a more offensive kind  are you a polygamist  he could answer that decidedly no one wife would be ampleprovided she had redgold hair browngold eyes the right kind of mouth and a dimple whatever doubts there might be in his mind on other points on that one he had none whatever  have you ever been in prison  not yet  and then a very difficult one are you a lunatic  jimmy hesitated the ink dried on his pen he was wondering                                in the dim cavern of paddington station the boattrain snorted impatiently varying the process with an occasional sharp shriek the hands of the station clock pointed to ten minutes to six the platform was a confused mass of travellers porters baggage trucks boys with buns and fruits boys with magazines friends relatives and bayliss the butler standing like a faithful watchdog beside a large suitcase to the human surf that broke and swirled about him he paid no attention he was looking for the young master  jimmy clove the crowd like a oneman flyingwedge two fruit and bun boys who impeded his passage drifted away like leaves on an autumn gale  good man he possessed himself of the suitcase i was afraid you might not be able to get here  the mistress is dining out mr james i was able to leave the house  have you packed everything i shall want  within the scope of a suitcase yes sir  splendid oh by the way give this letter to my father will you  very good sir  im glad you were able to manage i thought your voice sounded doubtful over the phone  i was a good deal taken aback mr james your decision to leave was so extremely sudden  so was columbus you know about him he saw an egg standing on its head and whizzed off like a jackrabbit  if you will pardon the liberty mr james is it not a little rash  dont take the joy out of life bayliss i may be a chump but try to forget it use your willpower  good evening mr bayliss said a voice behind them they both turned the butler was gazing rather coyly at a vision in a grey tailormade suit  good evening miss he said doubtfully  ann looked at him in astonishment then broke into a smile  how stupid of me i meant this mr bayliss your son we met at the steamship offices and before that he saved my life so we are old friends  bayliss gaping perplexedly and feeling unequal to the intellectual pressure of the conversation was surprised further to perceive a warning scowl on the face of his mr james jimmy had not foreseen this thing but he had a quick mind and was equal to it  how are you miss chester my father has come down to see me off this is miss chester dad  a british butler is not easily robbed of his poise but bayliss was frankly unequal to the sudden demand on his presence of mind he lowered his jaw an inch or two but spoke no word  dads a little upset at my going whispered jimmy confidentially hes not quite himself  ann was a girl possessed not only of ready tact but of a kind heart she had summed up mr bayliss at a glance every line of him proclaimed him a respectable upper servant no girl on earth could have been freer than she of snobbish prejudice but she could not check a slight thrill of surprise and disappointment at the discovery of jimmys humble origin she understood everything and there were tears in her eyes as she turned away to avoid intruding on the last moments of the parting of father and son  ill see you on the boat mr bayliss she said  eh said bayliss  yes yes said jimmy goodbye till then  ann walked on to her compartment she felt as if she had just read a whole long novel one of those chunky youngerenglishnovelist things she knew the whole story as well as if it had been told to her in detail she could see the father the honest steady butler living his life with but one aim to make a gentleman of his beloved only son year by year he had saved probably he had sent the son to college and now with a fathers blessing and the remains of a fathers savings the boy was setting out for the new world where dollarbills grew on trees and no one asked or cared who any one elses father might be  there was a lump in her throat bayliss would have been amazed if he could have known what a figure of pathetic fineness he seemed to her and then her thoughts turned to jimmy and she was aware of a glow of kindliness towards him his father had succeeded in his lifes ambition he had produced a gentleman how easily and simply without a trace of snobbish shame the young man had introduced his father there was the right stuff in him he was not ashamed of the humble man who had given him his chance in life she found herself liking jimmy amazingly     the hands of the clock pointed to three minutes to the hour porters skimmed to and fro like waterbeetles  i cant explain said jimmy it wasnt temporary insanity it was necessity  very good mr james i think you had better be taking your seat now  quite right i had it would spoil the whole thing if they left me behind bayliss did you ever see such eyes such hair look after my father while i am away dont let the dukes worry him oh and baylissjimmy drew his hand from his pocketas one pal to another  bayliss looked at the crackling piece of paper  i couldnt mr james i really couldnt a fivepound note i couldnt  nonsense be a sport  begging your pardon mr james i really couldnt you cannot afford to throw away your money like this you cannot have a great deal of it if you will excuse me for saying so  i wont do anything of the sort grab it oh lord the trains starting goodbye bayliss  the engine gave a final shriek of farewell the train began to slide along the platform pursued to the last by optimistic boys offering buns for sale it gathered speed jimmy leaning out the window was amazed at a spectacle so unusual as practically to amount to a modern miraclethe spectacled bayliss running the butler was not in the pink of condition but he was striding out gallantly he reached the door of jimmys compartment and raised his hand  begging your pardon mr james he panted for taking the liberty but i really couldnt  he reached up and thrust something into jimmys hand something crisp and crackling then his mission performed fell back and stood waving a snowy handkerchief the train plunged into the tunnel  jimmy stared at the fivepound note he was aware like ann farther along the train of a lump in his throat he put the note slowly into his pocket  the train moved on    chapter vii  on the boatdeck  rising waters and a fine flying scud that whipped stingingly over the side had driven most of the passengers on the atlantic to the shelter of their staterooms or to the warm stuffiness of the library it was the fifth evening of the voyage for five days and four nights the ship had been racing through a placid ocean on her way to sandy hook but in the early hours of this afternoon the wind had shifted to the north bringing heavy seas darkness had begun to fall now the sky was a sullen black the white crests of the rollers gleamed faintly in the dusk and the wind sang in the ropes  jimmy and ann had had the boatdeck to themselves for half an hour jimmy was a good sailor it exhilarated him to fight the wind and to walk a deck that heaved and dipped and shuddered beneath his feet but he had not expected to have anns company on such an evening but she had come out of the saloon entrance her small face framed in a hood and her slim body shapeless beneath a great cloak and joined him in his walk  jimmy was in a mood of exaltation he had passed the last few days in a condition of intermittent melancholy consequent on the discovery that he was not the only man on board the atlantic who desired the society of ann as an alleviation of the tedium of an ocean voyage the world when he embarked on this venture had consisted so exclusively of ann and himself that until the ship was well on its way to queenstown he had not conceived the possibility of intrusive males forcing their unwelcome attentions on her and it had added bitterness to the bitter awakening that their attentions did not appear to be at all unwelcome almost immediately after breakfast on the very first day a creature with a small black moustache and shining teeth had descended upon ann and vocal with surprise and pleasure at meeting her againhe claimed damn him to have met her before at palm beach bar harbor and a dozen other placeshad carried her off to play an idiotic game known as shuffleboard nor was this an isolated case it began to be borne in upon jimmy that ann whom he had looked upon purely in the light of an eve playing opposite his adam in an exclusive garden of eden was an extremely wellknown and popular character the clerk at the shippingoffice had lied absurdly when he had said that very few people were crossing on the atlantic this voyage the vessel was crammed till its sides bulged it was loaded down in utter defiance of the plimsoll law with rollos and clarences and dwights and twombleys who had known and golfed and ridden and driven and motored and swum and danced with ann for years a ghastly being entitled edgar something or teddy something had beaten jimmy by a short head in the race for the decksteward the prize of which was the placing of his deckchair next to anns jimmy had been driven from the promenade deck by the spectacle of this beastly creature lying swathed in rugs reading bestsellers to her  he had scarcely seen her to speak to since the beginning of the voyage when she was not walking with rolly or playing shuffleboard with twombley she was down below ministering to the comfort of a chronically seasick aunt referred to in conversation as poor aunt nesta sometimes jimmy saw the little manpresumably her unclein the smokingroom and once he came upon the stout boy recovering from the effects of a cigar in a quiet corner of the boatdeck but apart from these meetings the family was as distant from him as if he had never seen ann at alllet alone saved her life  and now she had dropped down on him from heaven they were alone together with the good clean wind and the bracing scud rollo clarence dwight and twombley not to mention edgar or possibly teddy were down belowhe hoped dying they had the world to themselves  i love rough weather said ann lifting her face to the wind her eyes were very bright she was beyond any doubt or question the only girl on earth poor aunt nesta doesnt she was bad enough when it was quite calm but this storm has finished her ive just been down below trying to cheer her up  jimmy thrilled at the picture always fascinating ann seemed to him at her best in the role of ministering angel he longed to tell her so but found no words they reached the end of the deck and turned ann looked up at him  ive hardly seen anything of you since we sailed she said she spoke almost reproachfully tell me all about yourself mr bayliss why are you going to america  jimmy had had an impassioned indictment of the rollos on his tongue but she had closed the opening for it as quickly as she had made it in face of her direct demand for information he could not hark back to it now after all what did the rollos matter they had no part in this little windswept world they were where they belonged in some nether hell on the c or d deck moaning for death  to make a fortune i hope he said  ann was pleased at this confirmation of her diagnosis she had deduced this from the evidence at paddington station  how pleased your father will be if you do  the slight complexity of jimmys affairs caused him to pause for a moment to sort out his fathers but an instants reflection told him that she must be referring to bayliss the butler  yes  hes a dear old man said ann i suppose hes very proud of you  i hope so  you must do tremendously well in america so as not to disappoint him what are you thinking of doing  jimmy considered for a moment  newspaper work i think  oh why have you had any experience  a little  ann seemed to grow a little aloof as if her enthusiasm had been damped  oh well i suppose its a good enough profession im not very fond of it myself ive only met one newspaper man in my life and i dislike him very much so i suppose that has prejudiced me  who was that  you wouldnt have met him he was on an american paper a man named crocker  a sudden gust of wind drove them back a step rendering talk impossible it covered a gap when jimmy could not have spoken the shock of the information that ann had met him before made him dumb this thing was beyond him it baffled him  her next words supplied a solution they were under shelter of one of the boats now and she could make herself heard  it was five years ago and i only met him for a very short while but the prejudice has lasted  jimmy began to understand five years ago it was not so strange then that they should not recognise each other now he stirred up his memory nothing came to the surface not a gleam of recollection of that early meeting rewarded him and yet something of importance must have happened then for her to remember it surely his mere personality could not have been so unpleasant as to have made such a lasting impression on her  i wish you could do something better than newspaper work said ann i always think the splendid part about america is that it is such a land of adventure there are such millions of chances its a place where anything may happen havent you an adventurous soul mr bayliss  no man lightly submits to a charge even a hinted charge of being deficient in the capacity for adventure  of course i have said jimmy indignantly im game to tackle anything that comes along  im glad of that  her feeling of comradeship towards this young man deepened she loved adventure and based her estimate of any member of the opposite sex largely on his capacity for it she moved in a set when at home which was more polite than adventurous and had frequently found the atmosphere enervating  adventure said jimmy is everything  he paused or a good deal he concluded weakly  why qualify it like that it sounds so tame adventure is the biggest thing in life  it seemed to jimmy that he had received an excuse for a remark of a kind that had been waiting for utterance ever since he had met her often and often in the watches of the night smoking endless pipes and thinking of her he had conjured up just such a vision as thisthey two walking the deserted deck alone and she innocently giving him an opening for some lowvoiced tender speech at which she would start look at him quickly and then ask him haltingly if the words had any particular application and after thatoh well all sorts of things might happen and now the moment had come it was true that he had always pictured the scene as taking place by moonlight and at present there was a halfgale blowing out of an inky sky also on the present occasion anything in the nature of a lowvoiced speech was absolutely out of the question owing to the uproar of the elements still taking these drawbacks into consideration the chance was far too good to miss such an opening might never happen again he waited till the ship had steadied herself after an apparently suicidal dive into an enormous roller then staggering back to her side spoke  love is the biggest thing in life he roared  what is shrieked ann  love bellowed jimmy  he wished a moment later that he had postponed this statement of faith for their next steps took them into a haven of comparative calm where some dimly seen portion of the vessels anatomy jutted out and formed a kind of nook where it was possible to hear the ordinary tones of the human voice he halted here and ann did the same though unwillingly she was conscious of a feeling of disappointment and of a modification of her mood of comradeship towards her companion she held strong views which she believed to be unalterable on the subject under discussion  love she said it was too dark to see her face but her voice sounded unpleasantly scornful i shouldnt have thought that you would have been so conventional as that you seemed different  eh said jimmy blankly  i hate all this talk about love as if it were something wonderful that was worth everything else in life put together every book you read and every song that you see in the shopwindows is all about love its as if the whole world were in a conspiracy to persuade themselves that theres a wonderful something just round the corner which they can get if they try hard enough and they hypnotise themselves into thinking of nothing else and miss all the splendid things of life  thats shaw isnt it said jimmy  what is shaw  what you were saying its out of one of bernard shaws things isnt it  it is not a note of acidity had crept into anns voice it is perfectly original  im certain ive heard it before somewhere  if you have that simply means that you must have associated with some sensible person  jimmy was puzzled  but why the grouch he asked  i dont understand you  i mean why do you feel that way about it  ann was quite certain now that she did not like this young man nearly as well as she had supposed it is trying for a strongminded clearthinking girl to have her philosophy described as a grouch  because ive had the courage to think about it for myself and not let myself be blinded by popular superstition the whole world has united in making itself imagine that there is something called love which is the most wonderful happening in life the poets and novelists have simply hounded them on to believe it its a gigantic swindle  a wave of tender compassion swept over jimmy he understood it all now naturally a girl who had associated all her life with the rollos clarences dwights and twombleys would come to despair of the possibility of falling in love with any one  you havent met the right man he said she had of course but only recently and anyway he could point that out later  there is no such thing as the right man said ann resolutely if you are suggesting that there is a type of man in existence who is capable of inspiring what is called romantic love i believe in marriage     good work said jimmy well satisfied      but not as the result of a sort of delirium i believe in it as a sensible partnership between two friends who know each other well and trust each other the right way of looking at marriage is to realise first of all that there are no thrills no romances and then to pick out some one who is nice and kind and amusing and full of life and willing to do things to make you happy  ah said jimmy straightening his tie well thats something  how do you meanthats something are you shocked at my views  i dont believe they are your views youve been reading one of these stern soured fellows who analyse things  ann stamped the sound was inaudible but jimmy noticed the movement  cold he said lets walk on  anns sense of humour reasserted itself it was not often that it remained dormant for so long she laughed  i know exactly what you are thinking she said you believe that i am posing that those arent my real opinions  they cant be but i dont think you are posing its getting on for dinnertime and youve got that wan sinking feeling that makes you look upon the world and find it a hollow fraud the bugle will be blowing in a few minutes and half an hour after that you will be yourself again  im myself now i suppose you cant realise that a pretty girl can hold such views  jimmy took her arm  let me help you he said theres a knothole in the deck watch your step now listen to me im glad youve brought up this subjecti mean the subject of your being the prettiest girl in the known world  i never said that  your modesty prevented you but its a fact nevertheless im glad i say because i have been thinking a lot along those lines myself and i have been anxious to discuss the point with you you have the most glorious hair i have ever seen  do you like red hair  redgold  it is nice of you to put it like that when i was a child all except a few of the other children called me carrots  they have undoubtedly come to a bad end by this time if bears were sent to attend to the children who criticised elijah your little friends were in line for a troupe of tigers but there were some of a finer fibre there were a few who didnt call you carrots  one or two they called me bricktop  they have probably been electrocuted since your eyes are perfectly wonderful  ann withdrew her arm an extensive acquaintance of young men told her that the topic of conversation was now due to be changed  you will like america she said  we are not discussing america  i am it is a wonderful country for a man who wants to succeed if i were you i should go out west  do you live out west  no  then why suggest my going there where do you live  i live in new york  i shall stay in new york then  ann was wary but amused proposals of marriageand jimmy seemed to be moving swiftly towards onewere no novelty in her life in the course of several seasons at bar harbor tuxedo palm beach and in new york itself she had spent much of her time foiling and discouraging the ardour of a series of sentimental youths who had laid their unwelcome hearts at her feet  new york is open for staying in about this time i believe  jimmy was silent he had done his best to fight a tendency to become depressed and had striven by means of a light tone to keep himself resolutely cheerful but the girls apparently total indifference to him was too much for his spirits one of the young men who had had to pick up the heart he had flung at anns feet and carry it away for repairs had once confided to an intimate friend after the sting had to some extent passed that the feelings of a man who made love to ann might be likened to the emotions which hot chocolate might be supposed to entertain on contact with vanilla icecream jimmy had the comparison been presented to him would have endorsed its perfect accuracy the wind from the sea until now keen and bracing had become merely infernally cold the song of the wind in the rigging erstwhile melodious had turned into a damned depressing howling  i used to be as sentimental as any one a few years ago said ann returning to the dropped subject just after i left college i was quite maudlin i dreamed of moons and junes and loves and doves all the time then something happened which made me see what a little fool i was it wasnt pleasant at the time but it had a very bracing effect i have been quite different ever since it was a man of course who did it his method was quite simple he just made fun of me and nature did the rest  jimmy scowled in the darkness murderous thoughts towards the unknown brute flooded his mind  i wish i could meet him he growled  you arent likely to said ann he lives in england his name is crocker jimmy crocker i spoke about him just now  through the howling of the wind cut the sharp notes of a bugle ann turned to the saloon entrance  dinner she said brightly how hungry one gets on board ship she stopped arent you coming down mr bayliss  not just yet said jimmy thickly    chapter viii  painful scene in a cafe  the noonday sun beat down on park row hurrying mortals released from a thousand offices congested the sidewalks their thoughts busy with the vision of lunch up and down the canyon of nassau street the crowds moved more slowly candyselling aliens jostled newsboys and huge drayhorses endeavoured to the best of their ability not to grind the citizenry beneath their hooves eastward pressing on to the city hall surged the usual dense army of happy lovers on their way to buy marriagelicenses men popped in and out of the subway entrances like rabbits it was a stirring bustling scene typical of this nervecentre of new yorks vast body  jimmy crocker standing in the doorway watched the throngs enviously there were men in that crowd who chewed gum there were men who wore white satin ties with imitation diamond stickpins there were men who having smoked seventenths of a cigar were eating the remainder but there was not one with whom he would not at that moment willingly have exchanged identities for these men had jobs and in his present frame of mind it seemed to him that no further ingredient was needed for the recipe of the ultimate human bliss  the poet has said some very searching and unpleasant things about the man whose heart has neer within him burned as home his footsteps he has turned from wandering on some foreign strand but he might have excused jimmy for feeling just then not so much a warmth of heart as a cold and clammy sensation of dismay he would have had to admit that the words high though his titles proud his name boundless his wealth as wish can claim did not apply to jimmy crocker the latter may have been concentred all on self but his wealth consisted of one hundred and thirtythree dollars and forty cents and his name was so far from being proud that the mere sight of it in the files of the new york sunday chronicle the recordroom of which he had just been visiting had made him consider the fact that he had changed it to bayliss the most sensible act of his career  the reason for jimmys lack of enthusiasm as he surveyed the portion of his native land visible from his doorway is not far to seek the atlantic had docked on saturday night and jimmy having driven to an excellent hotel and engaged an expensive room therein had left instructions at the desk that breakfast should be served to him at ten oclock and with it the sunday issue of the chronicle five years had passed since he had seen the dear old rag for which he had reported so many fires murders streetaccidents and weddings and he looked forward to its perusal as a formal taking seisin of his longneglected country nothing could be more fitting and symbolic than that the first morning of his return to america should find him propped up in bed reading the good old chronicle among his final meditations as he dropped off to sleep was a gentle speculation as to who was city editor now and whether the comic supplement was still featuring the sprightly adventures of the doughnut family  a wave of not unmanly sentiment passed over him on the following morning as he reached out for the paper the skyline of new york seen as the boat comes up the bay has its points and the rattle of the elevated trains and the quaint odour of the subway extend a kindly welcome but the thing that really convinces the returned traveller that he is back on manhattan island is the first sunday paper jimmy like every one else began by opening the comic supplement and as he scanned it a chilly discomfort almost a premonition of evil came upon him the doughnut family was no more he knew that it was unreasonable of him to feel as if he had just been informed of the death of a dear friend for pa doughnut and his associates had been having their adventures five years before he had left the country and even the toughest comic supplementary hero rarely endures for a decade but nevertheless the shadow did fall upon his morning optimism and he derived no pleasure whatever from the artificial rollickings of a degraded creature called old pop dillpickle who was offered as a substitute  but this he was to discover almost immediately was a trifling disaster it distressed him but it did not affect his material welfare tragedy really began when he turned to the magazine section scarcely had he started to glance at it when this headline struck him like a bullet              piccadilly jim at it again  and beneath it his own name  nothing is so capable of diversity as the emotion we feel on seeing our name unexpectedly in print we may soar to the heights or we may sink to the depths jimmy did the latter a mere cursory first inspection of the article revealed the fact that it was no eulogy with an unsparing hand the writer had muckraked his eventful past the text on which he hung his remarks being that illfated encounter with lord percy whipple at the six hundred club this the scribe had recounted at a length and with a boisterous vim which outdid even bill blakes effort in the london daily sun bill blake had been handicapped by consideration of space and the fact that he had turned in his copy at an advanced hour when the paper was almost made up the present writer was shackled by no restrictions he had plenty of room to spread himself in and he had spread himself so liberal had been the editors views in the respect that in addition to the letterpress the pages contained an unspeakably offensive picture of a burly young man in an obviously advanced condition of alcoholism raising his fist to strike a monocled youth in evening dress who had so little chin that jimmy was surprised that he had ever been able to hit it the only gleam of consolation that he could discover in this repellent drawing was the fact that the artist had treated lord percy even more scurvily than himself among other things the second son of the duke of devizes was depicted as wearing a coroneta thing which would have excited remark even in a london nightclub  jimmy read the thing through in its entirety three times before he appreciated a nuance which his disordered mind had at first failed to graspto wit that this charactersketch of himself was no mere isolated outburst but apparently one of a series in several places the writer alluded unmistakeably to other theses on the same subject  jimmys breakfast congealed on its tray untouched that boon which the gods so seldom bestow of seeing ourselves as others see us had been accorded to him in full measure by the time he had completed his third reading he was regarding himself in a purely objective fashion not unlike the attitude of a naturalist towards some strange and loathesome manifestation of insect life so this was the sort of fellow he was he wondered they had let him in at a reputable hotel  the rest of the day he passed in a state of such humility that he could have wept when the waiters were civil to him on the monday morning he made his way to park row to read the files of the chroniclea morbid enterprise akin to the eccentric behaviour of those priests of baal who gashed themselves with knives or of authors who subscribe to pressclipping agencies  he came upon another of the articles almost at once in an issue not a month old then there was a gap of several weeks and hope revived that things might not be as bad as he had fearedonly to be crushed by another trenchant screed after that he set about his excavations methodically resolved to know the worst he knew it in just under two hours there it all washis row with the bookie his bad behaviour at the political meeting his breachofpromise case it was a complete biography  and the name they called him piccadilly jim ugh  he went out into park row and sought a quiet doorway where he could brood upon these matters  it was not immediately that the practical or financial aspect of the affair came to scourge him for an appreciable time he suffered in his selfesteem alone it seemed to him that all these bustling persons who passed knew him that they were casting sidelong glances at him and laughing derisively that those who chewed gum chewed it sneeringly and that those who ate their cigars ate them with thinlyveiled disapproval and scorn then the passage of time blunting sensitiveness he found that there were other and weightier things to consider  as far as he had had any connected plan of action in his sudden castingoff of the fleshpots of london he had determined as soon as possible after landing to report at the office of his old paper and apply for his ancient position so little thought had he given to the minutiae of his future plans that it had not occurred to him that he had anything to do but walk in slap the gang on the back and announce that he was ready to work work on the staff of a paper whose chief diversion appeared to be the satirising of his escapades even had he possessed the moral courageor gallto make the application what good would it be he was a byword in a world where he had once been a worthy citizen what paper would trust piccadilly jim with an assignment what paper would consider piccadilly jim even on space rates a chill dismay crept over him he seemed to hear the grave voice of bayliss the butler speaking in his car as he had spoken so short a while before at paddington station  is it not a little rash mr james  rash was the word here he stood in a country that had no possible use for him a country where competition was keen and jobs for the unskilled infrequent what on earth was there that he could do  well he could go home    no he couldnt his pride revolted at that solution prodigal son stuff was all very well in its way but it lost its impressiveness if you turned up again at home two weeks after you had left a decent interval among the husks and swine was essential besides there was his father to consider he might be a poor specimen of a fellow as witness the sunday chronicle passim but he was not so poor as to come slinking back to upset things for his father just when he had done the only decent thing by removing himself no that was out of the question  what remained the air of new york is bracing and healthy but a man cannot live on it obviously he must find a job but what job  what could he do  a gnawing sensation in the region of the waistcoat answered the question the solutionwhich it put forward was it was true but a temporary one yet it appealed strongly to jimmy he had found it admirable at many crises he would go and lunch and it might be that food would bring inspiration  he moved from his doorway and crossed to the entrance of the subway he caught a timely express and a few minutes later emerged into the sunlight again at grand central he made his way westward along fortysecond street to the hotel which he thought would meet his needs he had scarcely entered it when in a chair by the door he perceived ann chester and at the sight of her all his depression vanished and he was himself again  why how do you do mr bayliss are you lunching here  unless there is some other place that you would prefer said jimmy i hope i havent kept you waiting  ann laughed she was looking very delightful in something soft and green  im not going to lunch with you im waiting for mr ralstone and his sister do you remember him he crossed over with us his chair was next to mine on the promenade deck  jimmy was shocked when he thought how narrowly she had escaped poor girl from lunching with that insufferable pill teddyor was it edgarhe felt quite weak recovering himself he spoke firmly  when were they to have met you  at one oclock  it is now five past you are certainly not going to wait any longer come with me and we will whistle for cabs  dont be absurd  come along i want to talk to you about my future  i shall certainly do nothing of the kind said ann rising she went with him to the door teddy would never forgive me she got into the cab its only because you have appealed to me to help you discuss your future she said as they drove off nothing else would have induced me     i know said jimmy i felt that i could rely on your womanly sympathy where shall we go  where do you want to go oh i forget that you have never been in new york before by the way what are your impressions of our glorious country  most gratifying if only i could get a job  tell him to drive to delmonicos its just around the corner on fortyfourth street  there are some things round the corner then  that sounds cryptic what do you mean  youve forgotten our conversation that night on the ship you refused to admit the existence of wonderful things just round the corner you said some very regrettable things that night about love if you remember  you cant be going to talk about love at one oclock in the afternoon talk about your future  love is inextricably mixed up with my future  not with your immediate future i thought you said that you were trying to get a job have you given up the idea of newspaper work then  absolutely  well im rather glad  the cab drew up at the restaurant door and the conversation was interrupted when they were seated at their table and jimmy had given an order to the waiter of absolutely inexcusable extravagance ann returned to the topic  well now the thing is to find something for you to do  jimmy looked round the restaurant with appreciative eyes the summer exodus from new york was still several weeks distant and the place was full of prosperouslooking lunchers not one of whom appeared to have a care or an unpaid bill in the world the atmosphere was redolent of substantial bankbalances solvency shone from the closely shaven faces of the men and reflected itself in the dresses of the women jimmy sighed  i suppose so he said though for choice id like to be one of the idle rich to my mind the ideal profession is strolling into the office and touching the old dad for another thousand  ann was severe  you revolt me she said i never heard anything so thoroughly disgraceful you need work  one of these days said jimmy plaintively i shall be sitting by the roadside with my dinnerpail and you will come by in your limousine and i shall look up at you and say you hounded me into this how will you feel then  very proud of myself  in that case there is no more to be said id much rather hang about and try to get adopted by a millionaire but if you insist on my workingwaiter  what do you want asked ann  will you get me a classified telephone directory said jimmy  what for asked ann  to look for a profession there is nothing like being methodical  the waiter returned bearing a red book jimmy thanked him and opened it at the as  the boy what will he become he said he turned the pages how about an auditor what do you think of that  do you think you could audit  that i could not say till i had tried i might turn out to be very good at it how about an adjuster  an adjuster of what  the book doesnt say it just remarks broadlyin a sort of spacious wayadjuster i take it that having decided to become an adjuster you then sit down and decide what you wish to adjust one might for example become an asparagus adjuster  a what  surely you know asparagus adjusters are the fellows who sell those ropeandpulley affairs by means of which the smart set lower asparagus into their mouthsor rather francis the footman does it for them of course the diner leans back in his chair and the menial works the apparatus in the background it is entirely superseding the oldfashioned method of picking the vegetable up and taking a snap at it but i suspect that to be a successful asparagus adjuster requires capital we now come to awning crank and spring rollers i dont think i should like that rolling awning cranks seems to me a sorry way of spending lifes springtime lets try the bs  lets try this omelette it looks delicious jimmy shook his head  i will toy with itbut absently and in a distrait manner as becomes a man of affairs theres nothing in the bs i might devote my ardent youth to barroom glassware and bottlers supplies on the other hand i might not similarly while there is no doubt a bright future for somebody in celluloid fiberloid and other factitious goods instinct tells me that there is none for he pulled up on the verge of saying james braithwaite crocker and shuddered at the nearness of the pitfall for he hesitated againfor algernon bayliss he concluded  ann smiled delightedly it was so typical that his father should have called him something like that time had not dimmed her regard for the old man she had seen for that brief moment at paddington station he was an old dear and she thoroughly approved of this latest manifestation of his supposed pride in his offspring  is that really your namealgernon  i cannot deny it  i think your father is a darling said ann inconsequently  jimmy had buried himself in the directory again  the ds he said is it possible that posterity will know me as bayliss the dermatologist or as bayliss the drop forger i dont quite like that last one it may be a respectable occupation but it sounds rather criminal to me the sentence for forging drops is probably about twenty years with hard labour  i wish you would put that book away and go on with your lunch said ann  perhaps said jimmy my grandchildren will cluster round my knee some day and say in their piping childish voices tell us how you became the elastic stocking king grandpa what do you think  i think you ought to be ashamed of yourself you are wasting your time when you ought to be either talking to me or else thinking very seriously about what you mean to do  jimmy was turning the pages rapidly  i will be with you in a moment he said try to amuse yourself somehow till i am at leisure ask yourself a riddle tell yourself an anecdote think of life no its no good i dont see myself as a fan importer a glass beveller a hotel broker an insect exterminator a junk dealer a kalsomine manufacturer a laundryman a mausoleum architect a nurse an oculist a paperhanger a quilt designer a roofer a ship plumber a tinsmith an undertaker a veterinarian a wig maker an xray apparatus manufacturer a yeast producer or a zinc spelter he closed the book there is only one thing to do i must starve in the gutter tell meyou know new york better than i dowhere is there a good gutter  at this moment there entered the restaurant an immaculate person he was a young man attired in faultlessly fitting clothes with shoes of flawless polish and a perfectly proportioned floweret in his buttonhole he surveyed the room through a monocle he was a pleasure to look upon but jimmy catching sight of him started violently and felt no joy at all for he had recognised him it was a man he knew well and who knew him wella man whom he had last seen a bare two weeks ago at the bachelors club in london few things are certain in this world but one was that if bartlingsuch was the visions nameshould see him he would come over and address him as crocker he braced himself to the task of being bayliss the whole bayliss and nothing but bayliss it might be that stout denial would carry him through after all reggie bartling was a man of notoriously feeble intellect who could believe in anything  the monocle continued its sweep it rested on jimmys profile  by gad said the vision  reginald bartling had landed in new york that morning and already the loneliness of a strange city had begun to oppress him he had come over on a visit of pleasure his suitcase stuffed with letters of introduction but these he had not yet used there was a feeling of homesickness upon him and he ached for a pal and there before him sat jimmy crocker one of the best he hastened to the table  i say crocker old chap i didnt know you were over here when did you arrive  jimmy was profoundly thankful that he had seen this pest in time to be prepared for him suddenly assailed in this fashion he would undoubtedly have incriminated himself by recognition of his name but having anticipated the visitation he was able to say a whole sentence to ann before showing himself aware that it was he who was addressed  i say jimmy crocker  jimmy achieved one of the blankest stares of modern times he looked at ann then he looked at bartling again  i think theres some mistake he said my name is bayliss  before his stony eye the immaculate bartling wilted it was a perfectly astounding likeness but it was apparent to him when what he had ever heard and read about doubles came to him he was confused he blushed it was deuced bad form going up to a perfect stranger like this and pretending you knew him probably the chappie thought he was some kind of a confidence johnnie or something it was absolutely rotten he continued to blush till one could have fancied him scarlet to the ankles he backed away apologising in ragged mutters jimmy was not insensible to the pathos of his suffering acquaintances position he knew reggie and his devotion to good form sufficiently well to enable him to appreciate the others horror at having spoken to a fellow to whom he had never been introduced but necessity forbade any other course however reggies soul might writhe and however sleepless reggies nights might become as a result of this encounter he was prepared to fight it out on those lines if it took all summer and anyway it was darned good for reggie to get a jolt like that every once in a while kept him bright and lively  so thinking he turned to ann again while the crimson bartling tottered off to restore his nerve centres to their normal tone at some other hostelry he found ann staring amazedly at him eyes wide and lips parted  odd that he observed with a light carelessness which he admired extremely and of which he would not have believed himself capable i suppose i must be somebodys double what was the name he said  jimmy crocker cried ann  jimmy raised his glass sipped and put it down  oh yes i remember so it was its a curious thing too that it sounds familiar ive heard the name before somewhere  i was talking about jimmy crocker on the ship that evening on deck  jimmy looked at her doubtfully  were you oh yes of course ive got it now he is the man you dislike so  ann was still looking at him as if he had undergone a change into something new and strange  i hope you arent going to let the resemblance prejudice you against me said jimmy some are born jimmy crockers others have jimmy crockers thrust upon them i hope youll bear in mind that i belong to the latter class  its such an extraordinary thing  oh i dont know you often hear of doubles there was a man in england a few years ago who kept getting sent to prison for things some genial stranger who happened to look like him had done  i dont mean that of course there are doubles but it is curious that you should have come over here and that we should have met like this at just this time you see the reason i went over to england at all was to try to get jimmy crocker to come back here  what  i dont mean that i did i mean that i went with my uncle and aunt who wanted to persuade him to come and live with them  jimmy was now feeling completely out of his depth  your uncle and aunt why  i ought to have explained that they are his uncle and aunt too my aunts sister married his father  but  its quite simple though it doesnt sound so perhaps you havent read the sunday chronicle lately it has been publishing articles about jimmy crockers disgusting behaviour in londonthey call him piccadilly jim you know  in print that name had shocked jimmy spoken and by ann it was loathly remorse for his painful past tore at him  there was another one printed yesterday  i saw it said jimmy to avert description  oh did you well just to show you what sort of a man jimmy crocker is the lord percy whipple whom he attacked in the club was his very best friend his stepmother told my aunt so he seems to be absolutely hopeless she smiled youre looking quite sad mr bayliss cheer up you may look like him but you arent him hehimno he is right the soul is what counts if youve got a good virtuous algernonish soul it doesnt matter if youre so like jimmy crocker that his friends come up and talk to you in restaurants in fact its rather an advantage really im sure that if you were to go to my aunt and pretend to be jimmy crocker who had come over after all in a fit of repentance she would be so pleased that there would be nothing she wouldnt do for you you might realise your ambition of being adopted by a millionaire why dont you try it i wont give you away  before they found me out and hauled me off to prison i should have been near you for a time i should have lived in the same house with you spoken to you jimmys voice shook  ann turned her head to address an imaginary companion  you must listen to this my dear she said in an undertone he speaks wonderfully they used to call him the boy orator in his hometown sometimes that and sometimes eloquent algernon  jimmy eyed her fixedly he disapproved of this frivolity  one of these days you will try me too high  oh you didnt hear what i was saying to my friend did you she said in concern but i meant it every word i love to hear you talk you have such feeling  jimmy attuned himself to the key of the conversation  have you no sentiment in you he demanded  i was just warming up too in another minute you would have heard something worth while youve damped me now lets talk about my lifework again  have you thought of anything  id like to be one of those fellows who sit in offices and sign checks and tell the officeboy to tell mr rockerfeller they can give him five minutes but of course i should need a checkbook and i havent got one oh well i shall find something to do all right now tell me something about yourself lets drop the future for awhile                                          an hour later jimmy turned into broadway he walked pensively for he had much to occupy his mind how strange that the petts should have come over to england to try to induce him to return to new york and how galling that now that he was in new york this avenue to a prosperous future was closed by the fact that something which he had done five years agothat he could remember nothing about it was quite maddeninghad caused ann to nurse this abiding hatred of him he began to dream tenderly of ann bumping from pedestrian to pedestrian in a gentle trance  from this trance the seventh pedestrian aroused him by uttering his name the name which circumstances had compelled him to abandon  jimmy crocker  surprise brought jimmy back from his dreams to the hard world surprise and a certain exasperation it was ridiculous to be incognito in a city which he had not visited in five years and to be instantly recognised in this way by every second man he met he looked sourly at the man the other was a sturdy squareshouldered battered young man who wore on his homely face a grin of recognition and regard jimmy was not particularly good at remembering faces but this persons was of a kind which the poorest memory might have recalled it was as the advertisements say distinctively individual the broken nose the exiguous forehead and the enlarged ears all clamoured for recognition the last time jimmy had seen jerry mitchell had been two years before at the national sporting club in london and placing him at once he braced himself as a short while ago he had braced himself to confound immaculate reggie  hello said the battered one  hello indeed said jimmy courteously in what way can i brighten your life  the grin faded from the others face he looked puzzled  youre jimmy crocker aint you  no my name chances to be algernon bayliss  jerry mitchell reddened  scuse me my mistake  he was moving off but jimmy stopped him parting from ann had left a large gap in his life and he craved human society  i know you now he said youre jerry mitchell i saw you fight kid burke four years ago in london  the grin returned to the pugilists face wider than ever he beamed with gratification  gee think of that ive quit since then im working for an old guy named pett funny thing hes jimmy crockers uncle that i mistook you for say youre a dead ringer for that guy i could have sworn it was him when you bumped into me say are you doing anything  nothing in particular  come and have a yarn theres a place i know just round by here  delighted  they made their way to the place  whats yours said jerry mitchell im on the wagon myself he said apologetically  so am i said jimmy its the only way no sense in always drinking and making a disgraceful exhibition of yourself in public  jerry mitchell received this homily in silence it disposed definitely of the lurking doubt in his mind as to the possibility of this man really being jimmy crocker though outwardly convinced by the others denial he had not been able to rid himself till now of a nebulous suspicion but this convinced him jimmy crocker would never have said a thing like that nor would have refused the offer of alcohol he fell into pleasant conversation with him his mind eased    chapter ix  mrs pett is shocked  at five oclock in the afternoon some ten days after her return to america mrs pett was at home to her friends in the house on riverside drive the proceedings were on a scale that amounted to a reception for they were not only a sort of official notification to new york that one of its most prominent hostesses was once more in its midst but were also designed to entertain and impress mr hammond chester anns father who had been spending a couple of days in the metropolis preparatory to departing for south america on one of his frequent trips he was very fond of ann in his curious detached way though he never ceased in his private heart to consider it injudicious of her not to have been born a boy and he always took in new york for a day or two on his way from one wild and lonely spot to another if he could manage it  the large drawingroom overlooking the hudson was filled almost to capacity with that strange mixture of humanity which mrs pett chiefly affected she prided herself on the bohemian element in her parties and had become during the past two years a human dragnet scooping genius from its hidingplace and bringing it into the open at different spots in the room stood the six resident geniuses to whose presence in the home mr pett had such strong objections and in addition to these she had collected so many more of a like breed from the environs of washington square that the air was clamorous with the hoarse cries of futurist painters esoteric buddhists vers libre poets interior decorators and stage reformers sifted in among the more conventional members of society who had come to listen to them men with new religions drank tea with women with new hats apostles of free love expounded their doctrines to persons who had been practising them for years without realising it all over the room throats were being strained and minds broadened  mr chester standing near the door with ann eyed the assemblage with the genial contempt of a large dog for a voluble pack of small ones he was a massive weatherbeaten man who looked very like ann in some ways and would have looked more like her but for the misfortune of having had some of his face clawed away by an irritable jaguar with whom he had had a difference some years back in the jungles of peru  do you like this sort of thing he asked  i dont mind it said ann  well i shall be very sorry to leave you ann but im glad im pulling out of here this evening who are all these people  ann surveyed the gathering  thats ernest wisden the playwright over there talking to lora delane porter the feminist writer thats clara whatshername the sculptor with the bobbed hair next to her  mr chester cut short the catalogue with a stifled yawn  wheres old pete doesnt he come to these jamborees  ann laughed  poor uncle peter if he gets back from the office before these people leave he will sneak up to his room and stay there till its safe to come out the last time i made him come to one of these parties he was pounced on by a woman who talked to him for an hour about the morality of finance and seemed to think that millionaires were the scum of the earth  he never would stand up for himself mr chesters gaze hovered about the room and paused whos that fellow i believe ive seen him before somewhere  a constant eddying swirl was animating the multitude whenever the mass tended to congeal something always seemed to stir it up again this was due to the restless activity of mrs pett who held it to be the duty of a good hostess to keep her guests moving from the moment when the room began to fill till the moment when it began to empty she did not cease to plough her way to and fro in a manner equally reminiscent of a hawk swooping on chickens and an earnest collegian bucking the line her guests were as a result perpetually forming new ententes and combinations finding themselves bumped about like those little moving figures which one sees in shopwindows on broadway which revolve on a metal disc until urged by impact with another little figure they scatter to regroup themselves elsewhere it was a fascinating feature of mrs petts athomes and one which assisted that mental broadening process already alluded to that one never knew when listening to a discussion on the sincerity of oscar wilde whether it would not suddenly change in the middle of a sentence to an argument on the inner meaning of the russian ballet  plunging now into a group dominated for the moment by an angular woman who was saying loud and penetrating things about the suffrage mrs pett had seized and removed a tall blonde young man with a mild vacuous face for the past few minutes this young man had been sitting bolt upright on a chair with his hands on his knees so exactly in the manner of an endman at a minstrel show that one would hardly have been surprised had he burst into song or asked a conundrum  ann followed her fathers gaze  do you mean the man talking to aunt nesta there theyve gone over to speak to willie partridge do you mean that one  yes who is he  well i like that said ann considering that you introduced him to us thats lord wisbeach who came to uncle peter with a letter of introduction from you you met him in canada  i remember now i ran across him in british columbia we camped together one night id never seen him before and i didnt see him again he said he wanted a letter to old pete for some reason so i scribbled him one in pencil on the back of an envelope ive never met any one who played a better game of draw poker he cleaned me out theres a lot in that fellow in spite of his looking like a musical comedy dude hes clever  ann looked at him meditatively  its odd that you should be discovering hidden virtues in lord wisbeach father ive been trying to make up my mind about him he wants me to marry him  he does i suppose a good many of these young fellows here want the same thing dont they ann mr chester looked at his daughter with interest her growingup and becoming a beauty had always been a perplexity to him he could never rid himself of the impression of her as a longlegged child in short skirts i suppose youre refusing them all the time  every day from ten to four with an hour off for lunch i keep regular office hours admission on presentation of visiting card  and how do you feel about this lord wisbeach  i dont know said ann frankly hes very nice andwhat is more importanthes different most of the men i know are all turned out of the same mould lord wisbeachand one other manare the only two ive met who might not be the brothers of all the rest  whos the other  a man i hardly know i met him on board ship  mr chester looked at his watch  its up to you ann he said theres one comfort in being your fatheri dont mean that exactly i mean that it is a comfort to me as your fatherto know that i need feel no paternal anxiety about you i dont have to give you advice youve not only got three times the sense that i have but youre not the sort of girl who would take advice youve always known just what you wanted ever since you were a kid    well if youre going to take me down to the boat wed better be starting wheres the car  waiting outside arent you going to say goodbye to aunt nesta  good god no exclaimed mr chester in honest concern what plunge into that pack of coyotes and fight my way through to her id be torn to pieces by wild poets besides it seems silly to make a fuss saying goodbye when im only going to be away a short time i shant go any further than colombia this trip  youll be able to run back for weekends said ann  she paused at the door to cast a fleeting glance over her shoulder at the fairhaired lord wisbeach who was now in animated conversation with her aunt and willie partridge then she followed her father down the stairs she was a little thoughtful as she took her place at the wheel of her automobile it was not often that her independent nature craved outside support but she was half conscious of wishing at the present juncture that she possessed a somewhat less casual father she would have liked to ask him to help her decide a problem which had been vexing her for nearly three weeks now ever since lord wisbeach had asked her to marry him and she had promised to give him his answer on her return from england she had been back in new york several days now but she had not been able to make up her mind this annoyed her for she was a girl who liked swift decisiveness of thought and action both in others and in herself she was fond of mr chester in much the same unemotional detached way that he was fond of her but she was perfectly well aware of the futility of expecting counsel from him she said goodbye to him at the boat fussed over his comfort for awhile in a motherly way and then drove slowly back for the first time in her life she was feeling uncertain of herself when she had left for england she had practically made up her mind to accept lord wisbeach and had only deferred actual acceptance of him because in her cool way she wished to reexamine the position at her leisure second thoughts had brought no revulsion of feeling she had not wavered until her arrival in new york then for some reason which baffled her the idea of marrying lord wisbeach had become vaguely distasteful and now she found herself fluctuating between this mood and her former one  she reached the house on riverside drive but did not slacken the speed of the machine she knew that lord wisbeach would be waiting for her there and she did not wish to meet him just yet she wanted to be alone she was feeling depressed she wondered if this was because she had just departed from her father and decided that it was his swift entrances into and exits from her life always left her temporarily restless she drove on up the river she meant to decide her problem one way or the other before she returned home  lord wisbeach meanwhile was talking to mrs pett and willie its inventor about partridgite willie on hearing himself addressed had turned slowly with an air of absent selfimportance the air of a great thinker disturbed in midthought he always looked like that when spoken to and there were thosemr pett belonged to this school of thoughtwho held that there was nothing to him beyond that look and that he had built up his reputation as a budding mastermind on a foundation that consisted entirely of a vacant eye a mop of hair through which he could run his fingers and the fame of his late father  willie partridge was the son of the great inventor dwight partridge and it was generally understood that the explosive partridgite was to be the result of a continuation of experiments which his father had been working upon at the time of his death that dwight partridge had been trying experiments in the direction of a new and powerful explosive during the last year of his life was common knowledge in those circles which are interested in such things foreign governments were understood to have made tentative overtures to him but a sudden illness ending fatally had finished the budding career of partridgite abruptly and the world had thought no more of it until an interview in the sunday chronicle that storehouse of information about interesting people announced that willie was carrying on his fathers experiments at the point where he had left off since then there had been vague rumours of possible sensational developments which willie had neither denied nor confirmed he preserved the mysterious silence which went so well with his appearance  having turned slowly so that his eyes rested on lord wisbeachs ingenuous countenance willie paused and his face assumed the expression of his photograph in the chronicle  ah wisbeach he said  lord wisbeach did not appear to resent the patronage of his manner he plunged cheerily into talk he had a pleasant simple way of comporting himself which made people like him  i was just telling mrs pett he said that i shouldnt be surprised if you were to get an offer for your stuff from our fellows at home before long i saw a lot of our war office men when i was in england dont you know several of them mentioned the stuff  willie resented partridgite as being referred to as the stuff but he made allowance all englishmen talked that way he supposed  indeed he said  of course said mrs pett willie is a patriot and would have to give our own authorities the first chance  rather  but you know what officials are all over the world they are so sceptical and they move so slowly  i know our men at home are just the same as a rule ive got a pal who invented somethingorother i forget what but it was a most decent little contrivance and very useful and all that and he simply cant get them to say yes or no about it but all the same i wonder you didnt have some of them trying to put out feelers to you when you were in london  oh we were only in london a few hours by the way lord wisbeach my sistermrs pett paused she disliked to have to mention her sister or to refer to this subject at all but curiosity impelled hermy sister said that you are a great friend of her stepson james crocker i didnt know that you knew him  lord wisbeach seemed to hesitate for a moment  hes not coming over is he pity it would have done him a world of good yes jimmy crocker and i have always been great pals hes a bit of a nut of course    i beg your pardon    i mean    he broke off confusedly and turned to willie again to cover himself how are you getting on with the jolly old stuff he asked  if willie had objected to partridgite being called the stuff he was still less in favour of its being termed the jolly old stuff he replied coldly  i have ceased to get along with the jolly old stuff  struck a snag enquired lord wisbeach sympathetically  on the contrary my experiments have been entirely successful i have enough partridgite in my laboratory to blow new york to bits  willie exclaimed mrs pett why didnt you tell me before you know i am so interested  i only completed my work last night  he moved off with an important nod he was tired of lord wisbeachs society there was something about the young man which he did not like he went to find more congenial company in a group by the window  lord wisbeach turned to his hostess the vacuous expression had dropped from his face like a mask a pair of keen and intelligent eyes met mrs petts  mrs pett may i speak to you seriously  mrs petts surprise at the alteration in the man prevented her from replying much as she liked lord wisbeach she had never given him credit for brains and it was a man with brains and keen ones who was looking at her now she nodded  if your nephew has really succeeded in his experiments you should be awfully careful that stuff ought not to lie about in his laboratory though no doubt he has hidden it as carefully as possible it ought to be in a safe somewhere in that safe in your library news of this kind moves like lightning at this very moment there may be people watching for a chance of getting at the stuff  every nerve in mrs petts body every cell of a brain which had for years been absorbing and giving out sensational fiction quivered irrepressibly at these words spoken in a low tense voice which gave them additional emphasis never had she misjudged a man as she had misjudged lord wisbeach  spies she quavered  they wouldnt call themselves that said lord wisbeach secret service agents every country has its men whose only duty it is to handle this sort of work  they would try to steal willies mrs petts voice failed  they would not look on it as stealing their motives would be patriotic i tell you mrs pett i have heard stories from friends of mine in the english secret service which would amaze you perfectly straight men in private life but absolutely unscrupulous when at work they stick at nothingnothing if i were you i should suspect every one especially every stranger he smiled engagingly you are thinking that that is odd advice from one who is practically a stranger like myself never mind suspect me too if you like be on the safe side  i would not dream of doing such a thing lord wisbeach said mrs pett horrified i trust you implicitly even supposing such a thing were possible would you have warned me like this if you had been  thats true said lord wisbeach i never thought of that well let me say suspect everybody but me he stopped abruptly mrs pett he whispered dont look round for a moment wait the words were almost inaudible who is that man behind you he has been listening to us turn slowly  with elaborate carelessness mrs pett turned her head at first she thought her companion must have alluded to one of a small group of young men who very improperly in such surroundings were discussing with raised voices the prospects of the clubs competing for the national league baseball pennant then extending the sweep of her gaze she saw that she had been mistaken midway between her and this group stood a single figure the figure of a stout man in a swallowtail suit who bore before him a tray with cups on it as she turned this man caught her eye gave a guilty start and hurried across the room  you saw said lord wisbeach he was listening who is that man your butler apparently what do you know of him  he is my new butler his name is skinner  ah your new butler he hasnt been with you long then  he only arrived from england three days ago  from england how did he get in here i mean on whose recommendation  mr pett offered him the place when we met him at my sisters in london we went over there to see my sister eugeniamrs crocker this man was the butler who admitted us he asked mr pett something about baseball and mr pett was so pleased that he offered him a place here if he wanted to come over the man did not give any definite answer then but apparently he sailed on the next boat and came to the house a few days after we had returned  lord wisbeach laughed softly  very smart of course they had him planted there for the purpose  what ought i to do asked mrs pett agitatedly  do nothing there is nothing that you can do for the present except keep your eyes open watch this man skinner see if he has any accomplices it is hardly likely that he is working alone suspect everybody believe me     at this moment apparently from some upper region there burst forth an uproar so sudden and overwhelming that it might well have been taken for a premature testing of a large sample of partridgite until a moment later it began to resemble more nearly the shrieks of some partially destroyed victim of that deathdealing invention it was a bellow of anguish and it poured through the house in a cascade of sound advertising to all beneath the roof the twin facts that some person unknown was suffering and that whoever the sufferer might be he had excellent lungs  the effect on the gathering in the drawingroom was immediate and impressive conversation ceased as if it had been turned off with a tap twelve separate and distinct discussions on twelve highly intellectual topics died instantaneously it was as if the last trump had sounded futurist painters stared pallidly at vers libre poets speech smitten from their lips and stage performers looked at esoteric buddhists with a wild surmise  the sudden silence had the effect of emphasising the strange noise and rendering it more distinct thus enabling it to carry its message to one at least of the listeners mrs pett after a moment of strained attention in which time seemed to her to stand still uttered a wailing cry and leaped for the door  ogden she shrilled and passed up the stairs two at a time gathering speed as she went a boys best friend is his mother    chapter x  instruction in deportment  while the feast of reason and flow of soul had been in progress in the drawingroom in the gymnasium on the top floor jerry mitchell awaiting the coming of mr pett had been passing the time in improving with strenuous exercise his already impressive physique if mrs petts guests had been less noisily concentrated on their conversation they might have heard the muffled taptaptap that proclaimed that jerry mitchell was punching the bag upstairs  it was not until he had punched it for perhaps five minutes that desisting from his labours he perceived that he had the pleasure of the company of little ogden ford the stout boy was standing in the doorway observing him with an attentive eye  what are you doing enquired ogden  jerry passed a gloved fist over his damp brow  punchin the bag  he began to remove his gloves eyeing ogden the while with a disapproval which he made no attempt to conceal an extremist on the subject of keeping in condition the spectacle of the bulbous stripling was a constant offence to him ogden in pursuance of his invariable custom on the days when mrs pett entertained had been lurking on the stairs outside the drawingroom for the past hour levying toll on the foodstuffs that passed his way he wore a congested look and there was jam about his mouth  why he said retrieving a morsel of jam from his right cheek with the tip of his tongue  to keep in condition  why do you want to keep in condition  jerry flung the gloves into their locker  fade he said wearily fade  huh  beat it  huh much pastry seemed to have clouded the boys mind  run away  dont want to run away  the annoyed pugilist sat down and scrutinised his visitor critically  you never do anything you dont want to i guess  no said ogden simply youve got a funny nose he added dispassionately what did you do to it to make it like that  mr mitchell shifted restlessly on his chair he was not a vain man but he was a little sensitive about that particular item in his makeup  lizzie says its the funniest nose she ever saw she says its something out of a comic supplement  a dull flush such as five minutes with the bag had been unable to produce appeared on jerry mitchells peculiar countenance it was not that he looked on lizzie murphy herself no lillian russell as an accepted authority on the subject of facial beauty but he was aware that in this instance she spoke not without reason and he was vexed moreover as many another had been before him by the note of indulgent patronage in ogdens voice his fingers twitched a little eagerly and he looked sullenly at his tactless junior  get out  huh  get outa here  dont want to get out of here said ogden with finality he put his hand in his trouserpocket and pulled out a sticky mass which looked as if it might once have been a creampuff or a meringue he swallowed it contentedly id forgotten i had that he explained mary gave it to me on the stairs mary thinks youve a funny nose too he proceeded as one relating agreeable gossip  can it can it exclaimed the exasperated pugilist  im only telling you what i heard her say  mr mitchell rose convulsively and took a step towards his persecutor breathing noisily through the criticised organ he was a chivalrous man a warm admirer of the sex but he was conscious of a wish that it was in his power to give mary what he would have described as hers she was one of the parlourmaids a homely woman with a hard eye and it was part of his grievance against her that his maggie alias celestine mrs petts maid had formed an enthusiastic friendship with her he had no evidence to go on but he suspected mary of using her influence with celestine to urge the suit of his leading rival for the latters hand biggs the chauffeur he disliked mary intensely even on general grounds ogdens revelation added fuel to his aversion for a moment he toyed with the fascinating thought of relieving his feelings by spanking the boy but restrained himself reluctantly at the thought of the inevitable ruin which would ensue he had been an inmate of the house long enough to know with a completeness which would have embarrassed that gentleman what a cipher mr pett was in the home and how little his championship would avail in the event of a clash with mrs pett and to give ogden that physical treatment which should long since have formed the main plank in the platform of his education would be to invite her wrath as nothing else could he checked himself and reached out for the skippingrope hoping to ease his mind by further exercise  ogden chewing the remains of the creampuff eyed him with languid curiosity  what are you doing that for  mr mitchell skipped grimly on  what are you doing that for i thought only girls skipped  mr mitchell paid no heed ogden after a moments silent contemplation returned to his original train of thought  i saw an advertisement in a magazine the other day of a sort of machine for altering the shape of noses you strap it on when you go to bed you ought to get pop to blow you to one  jerry mitchell breathed in a laboured way  you want to look nice about the place dont you well then theres no sense in going around looking like that if you dont have to is there i heard mary talking about your nose to biggs and celestine she said she had to laugh every time she saw it  the skippingrope faltered in its sweep caught in the skippers legs and sent him staggering across the room ogden threw back his head and laughed merrily he liked free entertainments and this struck him as a particularly enjoyable one  there are moments in the life of every man when the impulse attacks him to sacrifice his future to the alluring gratification of the present the strong man resists such impulses jerry mitchell was not a weak man but he had been sorely tried the annoyance of ogdens presence and conversation had sapped his selfrestraint as dripping water will wear away a rock a short while before he had fought down the urgent temptation to massacre this exasperating child but now despised love adding its sting to that of injured vanity he forgot the consequences bounding across the room he seized ogden in a powerful grip and the next instant the latters education in the true sense of the word so long postponed had begun and with it that avalanche of sound which rolling down into the drawingroom hurled mrs pett so violently and with such abruptness from the society of her guests  disposing of the last flight of stairs with the agility of the chamois which leaps from crag to crag of the snowtopped alps mrs pett finished with a fine burst of speed along the passage on the top floor and rushed into the gymnasium just as jerrys avenging hand was descending for the eleventh time    chapter xi  jimmy decides to be himself  it was less than a quarter of an hour latersuch was the speed with which nemesis usually slow had overtaken himthat jerry mitchell carrying a grip and walking dejectedly emerged from the back premises of the pett home and started down riverside drive in the direction of his boardinghouse a cheap clean and respectable establishment situated on ninetyseventh street between the drive and broadway his usually placid nervous system was ruffled and aquiver from the events of the afternoon and his cauliflower ears still burned reminiscently at the recollection of the uncomplimentary words shot at them by mrs pett before she expelled him from the house moreover he was in a mild panic at the thought of having to see ann later on and try to explain the disaster to her he knew how the news would affect her she had set her heart on removing ogden to more disciplinary surroundings and she could not possibly do it now that her ally was no longer an inmate of the house he was an essential factor in the scheme and now to gratify the desire of the moment he had eliminated himself long before he reached the brownstone house which looked exactly like all the other brownstone houses in all the other sidestreets of uptown new york the first fine careless rapture of his mad outbreak had passed from jerry mitchell leaving nervous apprehension in its place ann was a girl whom he worshipped respectfully but he feared her in her wrath  having entered the boardinghouse jerry seeking company in his hour of sorrow climbed the stairs till he reached a door on the second floor sniffing and detecting the odour of tobacco he knocked and was hidden to enter  hello bayliss he said sadly having obeyed the call  he sat down on the end of the bed and heaved a deep sigh  the room which he had entered was airy but small so small indeed that the presence of any furniture in it at all was almost miraculous for at first sight it seemed incredible that the bed did not fill it from side to side there were however a few vacant spots and in these had been placed a washstand a chest of drawers and a midget rockingchair the window which the thoughtful architect had designed at least three sizes too large for the room and which admitted the evening air in pleasing profusion looked out onto a series of forlorn backyards in boardinghouses it is only the windows of the rich and haughty that face the street  on the bed a corncob pipe between his teeth lay jimmy crocker he was shoeless and in his shirtsleeves there was a crumpled evening paper on the floor beside the bed he seemed to be taking his rest after the labours of a trying day  at the sound of jerrys sigh he raised his head but finding the attitude too severe a strain on the muscles of the neck restored it to the pillow  whats the matter jerry you seem perturbed you have the aspect of one whom fate has smitten in the spiritual solar plexus or of one who has been searching for the leak in lifes gaspipe with a lighted candle whats wrong  curtains  jimmy through long absence from his native land was not always able to follow jerrys thoughts when concealed in the wrappings of the peculiar dialect which he affected  i get you not friend supply a few footnotes  ive been fired  jimmy sat up this was no imaginary trouble no mere malaise of the temperament it was concrete and called for sympathy  im awfully sorry he said no wonder you arent rollicking how did it happen  that halfportion bill taft came joshing me about my beezer till it got something fierce explained jerry william j bryan couldnt have stood for it  once again jimmy lost the thread the wealth of political allusion baffled him  whats taft been doing to you  it wasnt taft he only looks like him it was that kid ogden up where i work he came butting into the gym joshing me aboutmakin persnal remarks till i kind of lost my goat and the next thing i knew i was giving him his a faint gleam of pleasure lightened the gloom of his face i certnly give him his the gleam faded and after thatwell here i am  jimmy understood now he had come to the boardinghouse the night of his meeting with jerry mitchell on broadway and had been there ever since and frequent conversations with the pugilist had put him abreast of affairs at the pett home he was familiar with the personnel of the establishment on riverside drive and knew precisely how great was the crime of administering correction to ogden ford no matter what the cause nor did he require explanation of the phenomenon of mrs pett dismissing one who was in her husbands private employment jerry had his sympathy freely  you appear he said to have acted in a thoroughly capable and praiseworthy manner the only point in your conduct which i would permit myself to criticise is your omission to slay the kid that however was due i take it to the fact that you were interrupted we will now proceed to examine the future i cannot see that it is altogether murky you have lost a good job but there are others equally good for a man of your calibre new york is crammed with dyspeptic millionaires who need an efficient physical instructor to look after them cheer up cuthbert for the sun is still shining  jerry mitchell shook his head he refused to be comforted  its miss ann he said what am i going to say to her  what has she got to do with it asked jimmy interested  for a moment jerry hesitated but the desire for sympathy and advice was too strong for him and after all there was no harm in confiding in a good comrade like jimmy  its like this he said miss ann and me had got it all fixed up to kidnap the kid  what  say i dont mean ordinary kidnapping its this way miss ann come to me and we agree that the kids a pest that had ought to have some strongarm keep him in order so we decide to get him away to a friend of mine who keeps a dogs hospital down on long island bud smithers is the guy to handle that kid you ought to see him take hold of a dog thats all grouch and ugliness and make it over into a dog that its a pleasure to have around i thought a few weeks with bud was what the doctor ordered for ogden and miss ann guessed i was right so we had it all framed and now this happens and balls everything up she cant do nothing with a husky kid like that without me to help her and how am i going to help her if im not allowed in the house  jimmy was conscious of a renewed admiration for a girl whom he had always considered a queen among women how rarely in this world did one find a girl who combined every feminine charm of mind and body with a resolute determination to raise cain at the slightest provocation  what an absolutely corking idea  jerry smirked modestly at the approbation but returned instantly to his gloom  you get me now what am i to say to her shell be sore  the problem jimmy had begun is one which as you suggest presents certain when there was a knock at the door and the head of the boardinghouses maidofallwork popped in  mr bayliss is mr mitchell oh say mr mitchell theres a lady down below wants to see you says her names chester  jerry looked at jimmy appealingly  whatll i do  do nothing said jimmy rising and reaching for his shoes ill go down and see her i can explain for you  its mighty good of you  it will be a pleasure rely on me  ann who had returned from her drive shortly after the ogden disaster and had instantly proceeded to the boardinghouse had been shown into the parlour jimmy found her staring in a rapt way at a statuette of the infant samuel which stood near a bowl of wax fruit on the mantelpiece she was feeling aggrieved with fate and extremely angry with jerry mitchell and she turned at the sound of the opening door with a militant expression in her eyes which changed to one of astonishment on perceiving who it was that had come in  mr bayliss  good evening miss chester we so to speak meet again i have come as an intermediary to be brief jerry mitchell darent face you so i offered to come down instead  but howbut why are you here  i live here he followed her gaze it rested on a picture of cows in a field late american school he said attributed to the landladys niece a graduate of the wissahickon pa correspondence school of pictorial art said to be genuine  you live here repeated ann she had been brought up all her life among the carefully thought out effects of eminent interior decorators and the room seemed more dreadful to her than it actually was what an awful room  awful you must be overlooking the piano cant you see the handsome plush cover from where you are standing move a little to the southeast and shade your eyes we get music here of an eveningwhen we dont see it coming and sidestep  why in the name of goodness do you live here mr bayliss  because miss chester i am infernally hard up because the bayliss bankroll has been stricken with a wasting sickness  ann was looking at him incredulously  butbutthen did you really mean all that at lunch the other day i thought you were joking i took it for granted that you could get work whenever you wanted to or you wouldnt have made fun of it like that cant you really find anything to do  plenty to do but im not paid for it i walk a great number of blocks and jump into a great number of cars and dive into elevators and dive out again and open doors and say good morning when people tell me they havent a job for me my days are quite full but my pocketbook isnt  ann had forgotten all about her errand in her sympathy  im so sorry why its terrible i should have thought you could have found something  i thought the same till the employers of new york in a body told me i couldnt men of widely differing views on religion politics and a hundred other points they were unanimous on that the nearest i came to being a financial titan was when i landed a job in a store on broadway demonstrating a patent collarclip at ten dollars a week for awhile all nature seemed to be shouting ten per ten per than which there are few sweeter words in the language but i was fired halfway through the second day and nature changed her act  but why  it wasnt my fault just fate this contrivance was called klipstones kute kollarklip and it was supposed to make it easy for you to fasten your tie my job was to stand in the window in my shirtsleeves gnashing my teeth and registering baffled rage when i tried the old obsolete method and beaming on the multitude when i used the klip unfortunately i got the cards mixed i beamed when i tried the old obsolete method and nearly burst myself with baffled fury just after i had exhibited the card bearing the words i will now try klipstones kute klip i couldnt think what the vast crowd outside the window was laughing at till the boss who chanced to pause on the outskirts of the gathering on his way back from lunch was good enough to tell me nothing that i could say would convince him that i was not being intentionally humorous i was sorry to lose the job though it did make me feel like a goldfish but talking of being fired brings us back to jerry mitchell  oh never mind jerry mitchell now  on the contrary let us discuss his case and the points arising from it with care and concentration jerry mitchell has told me all  ann was startled  what do you mean  the word all said jimmy is slang for everything you see in me a confidant in a word i am hep  you know  everything a colloquialism explained jimmy for all about ogden you know the scheme the plot the enterprise  ann found nothing to say  i am thoroughly in favour of the plan so much so that i propose to assist you by taking jerrys place  i dont understand  do you remember at lunch that day after that remarkable person had mistaken me for jimmy crocker you suggested in a light casual way that if i were to walk into your uncles office and claim to be jimmy crocker i should be welcomed without a question im going to do it then once aboard the luggeronce in the house i am at your orders use me exactly as you would have used jerry mitchell  butbut  jerry said jimmy scornfully cant i do everything that he could have done and more a bonehead like jerry would have been certain to have bungled the thing somehow i know him well a good fellow but in matters requiring intellect and swift thought dead from the neck up its a very lucky thing he is out of the running i love him like a brother but his dome is of ivory this job requires a man of tact sense shrewdness initiative esprit and verve he paused me he concluded  but its ridiculous its out of the question  not at all i must be extraordinarily like jimmy crocker or that fellow at the restaurant wouldnt have taken me for him leave this in my hands i can get away with it  i shant dream of allowing you  at nine oclock tomorrow morning said jimmy firmly i present myself at mr petts office its all settled  ann was silent she was endeavouring to adjust her mind to the idea her first startled revulsion from it had begun to wane it was an idea peculiarly suited to her temperament an idea that she might have suggested herself if she had thought of it soon from being disapproving she found herself glowing with admiration for its author he was a young man of her own sort  you asked me on the boat if you remember said jimmy if i had an adventurous soul i am now submitting my proofs you also spoke highly of america as a land where there were adventures to be had i now see that you were right  ann thought for a moment  if i consent to your doing this insane thing mr bayliss will you promise me something  anything  well in the first place i absolutely refuse to let you risk all sorts of frightful things by coming into this kidnapping plot she waved him down and went on but i see where you can help me very much as i told you at lunch my aunt would do anything for jimmy crocker if he were to appear in new york now i want you to promise that you will confine your activities to asking her to let jerry mitchell come back  never  you said you would promise me anything  anything but that  then it is all off  jimmy pondered  its terribly tame that way  never mind its the only way i will consider  very well i protest though  ann sat down  i think youre splendid mr bayliss im much obliged  not at all  it will be such a splendid thing for ogden wont it  admirable  now the only thing to do is just to see that we have got everything straight how about this for instance they will ask you when you arrived in new york how are you going to account for your delay in coming to see them  ive thought of that theres a boat that docks tomorrowthe caronia i think ive got a paper upstairs ill look it up i can say i came by her  that seems all right its lucky you and uncle peter never met on the atlantic  and now as to my demeanour on entering the home how should i behave should i be jaunty or humble what would a longlost nephew naturally do  a longlost nephew with a record like jimmy crockers would crawl in with a white flag i should think  a bell clanged in the hall  supper said jimmy to go into painful details new england boiled dinner or my senses deceive me and prunes  i must be going  we shall meet at philippi  he saw her to the door and stood at the top of the steps watching her trim figure vanish into the dusk she passed from his sight jimmy drew a deep breath and thinking hard went down the passage to fortify himself with supper    chapter xii  jimmy catches the bosss eye  when jimmy arrived at mr petts office on pine street at tenthirty the next morninghis expressed intention of getting up early enough to be there by nine having proved an empty boasthe was in a high state of preparedness he had made ready for what might be a trying interview by substituting a combination of wellchosen dishes at an expensive hotel for the less imaginative boardinghouse breakfast with which he had of late been insulting his interior his suit was pressed his shoes gleamed brightly and his chin was smoothly shaven these things combined with the perfection of the morning and that vague exhilaration which a fine day in downtown new york brings to the man who has not got to work increased his natural optimism something seemed to tell him that all would be well he would have been the last person to deny that his position was a little complicatedhe had to use a pencil and a sheet of paper to show himself just where he stoodbut what of that a few complications in life are an excellent tonic for the brain it was with a sunny geniality which startled that unaccustomed stripling considerablyand indeed caused him to swallow his chewing gumthat he handed in his card to mr petts watchfully waiting officeboy  this to the boss my openfaced lad he said get swiftly off the mark  the boy departed dumbly  from where he stood outside the barrier which separated visitors to the office from the workers within jimmy could see a vista of efficientlooking young men with paper protectors round their cuffs working away at mysterious jobs which seemed to involve the use of a great deal of paper one in particular was so surrounded by it that he had the appearance of a bather in surf jimmy eyed these toilers with a comfortable and kindly eye all this industry made him feel happy he liked to think of this sort of thing going on all round him  the officeboy returned this way please  the respectfulness of the lads manner had increased noticeably mr petts reception of the visitors name had impressed him it was an odd fact that the financier a cipher in his own home could impress all sorts of people at the office  to mr pett the announcement that mr james crocker was waiting to see him had come like the announcement of a miracle not a day had passed since their return to america without lamentations from mrs pett on the subject of their failure to secure the young mans person the occasion of mrs petts reading of the article in the sunday chronicle descriptive of the lord percy whipple affair had been unique in the little mans domestic history for the first time since he had known her the indomitable woman had completely broken down of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been and the thought that if she had only happened to know it she had had in her hands during that interview with her sister in london a weapon which would have turned defeat into triumph was more than even mrs petts strong spirit could endure when she looked back on that scene and recalled the airy way in which mrs crocker had spoken of her stepsons best friend lord percy whipple and realised that at that very moment lord percy had been recovering in bed from the effects of his first meeting with jimmy crocker the iron entered into her soul and she refused to be comforted in the first instant of realisation she thought of six separate and distinct things she could have said to her sister each more crushing than the lastthings which now she would never be able to say  and now suddenly and unaccountably the means was at hand for restoring her to her tranquil selfesteem jimmy crocker despite what his stepmother had said probably in active defiance of her commands had come to america after all mr petts first thought was that his wife would as he expressed it to himself be tickled to death about this scarcely waiting for the officeboy to retire he leaped towards jimmy like a gambolling lamb and slapped him on the back with every evidence of joy and friendliness  my dear boy he cried my dear boy im delighted to see you  jimmy was surprised relieved and pleased he had not expected this warmth a civil coldness had been the best he had looked for he had been given to understand that in the pett home he was regarded as the black sheep and while one may admit a black sheep into the fold it does not follow that one must of necessity fawn upon him  youre very kind he said rather startled  they inspected each other for a brief moment mr pett was thinking that jimmy was a great improvement on the picture his imagination had drawn of him he had looked for something tougher something flashy and bloated jimmy for his part had taken an instant liking to the financier he too had been misled by imagination he had always supposed that these millionaires down wall street way were keen aggressive fellows with gimlet eyes and sharp tongues on the boat he had only seen mr pett from afar and had had no means of estimating his character he found him an agreeable little man  we had given up all hope of your coming said mr pett  a little manly penitence seemed to jimmy to be in order  i never expected you would receive me like this i thought i must have made myself rather unpopular  mr pett buried the past with a gesture  when did you land he asked  this morning on the caronia     good passage  excellent  there was a silence it seemed to jimmy that mr pett was looking at him rather more closely than was necessary for the actual enjoyment of his style of beauty he was just about to throw out some light remark about the health of mrs pett or something about porpoises on the voyage to add local colour and verisimilitude when his heart missed a beat as he perceived that he had made a blunder like many other amateur plotters ann and he had made the mistake of being too elaborate it had struck them as an ingenious idea for jimmy to pretend that he had arrived that morning and superficially it was a good idea but he now remembered for the first time that if he had seen mr pett on the atlantic the probability was that mr pett had seen him the next moment the other had confirmed this suspicion  ive an idea ive seen you before cant think where  everybody well at home said jimmy  im sure of it  im looking forward to seeing them all  ive seen you some place  im often there  eh  mr pett seemed to be turning this remark over in his mind a trifle suspiciously jimmy changed the subject  to a young man like myself he said with life opening out before him there is something singularly stimulating in the sight of a modern office how busy those fellows seem  yes said mr pett yes he was glad that this conversational note had been struck he was anxious to discuss the future with this young man  everybody works but father said jimmy  mr pett started  eh  nothing  mr pett was vaguely ruffled he suspected insult but could not pin it down he abandoned his cheeriness however and became the man of business  i hope you intend to settle down now that you are here and work hard he said in the voice which he vainly tried to use on ogden at home  work said jimmy blankly  i shall be able to make a place for you in my office that was my promise to your stepmother and i shall fulfil it  but wait a minute i dont get this do you mean to put me to work  of course i take it that that was why you came over here because you realised how you were wasting your life and wanted a chance of making good in my office  a hot denial trembled on jimmys tongue never had he been so misjudged and then the thought of ann checked him he must do nothing that would interfere with anns plans whatever the cost he must conciliate this little man for a moment he mused sentimentally on ann he hoped she would understand what he was going through for her sake to a man with his ingrained distaste for work in any shape the sight of those wageslaves outside there in the outer office had as he had told mr pett been stimulating but only because it filled him with a sort of spiritual uplift to think that he had not got to do that sort of thing consider them in the light of fellowworkers and the spectacle ceased to stimulate and became nauseating and for her sake he was about to become one of them had any knight of old ever done anything as big as that for his lady he very much doubted it  all right he said count me in i take it that i shall have a job like one of those out there  yes  not presuming to dictate i suggest that you give me something that will take some of the work off that fellow whos swimming in paper only the tip of his nose was above the surface as i passed through i never saw so many fellows working so hard at the same time in my life all trying to catch the bosss eye too i suppose it must make you feel like a snipe  mr pett replied stiffly he disliked this levity on the sacred subject of office work he considered that jimmy was not approaching his new life in the proper spirit many young men had discussed with him in that room the subject of working in his employment but none in quite the same manner  you are at a serious point in your career he said you will have every opportunity of rising  yes at seven in the morning i suppose  a spirit of levity began mr pett  i laugh that i may not weep explained jimmy try to think what this means to a bright young man who loathes work be kind to me instruct your floorwalkers to speak gently to me at first it may be a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done but dont ask me to enjoy it its all right for you youre the boss any time you want to call it a day and go off and watch a ballgame all you have to do is to leave word that you have an urgent date to see mr rockerfeller whereas i shall have to submerge myself in paper and only come up for air when the danger of suffocation becomes too great  it may have been the mention of his favourite game that softened mr pett the frostiness which had crept into his manner thawed  it beats me he said why you ever came over at all if you feel like that  duty said jimmy duty there comes a time in the life of every man when he must choose between what is pleasant and what is right  and that last foolgame of yours that lord percy whipple business must have made london pretty hot for you suggested mr pett  your explanation is less romantic than mine but there is something in what you say  had it occurred to you young man that i am taking a chance putting a fellow like you to work in my office  have no fear the little bit of work i shall do wont make any difference  ive half a mind to send you straight back to london  couldnt we compromise  how  well havent you some snug secretarial job you could put me into i have an idea that i should make an ideal secretary  my secretaries work  i get you cancel the suggestion  mr pett rubbed his chin thoughtfully  you puzzle me and thats the truth  always speak the truth said jimmy approvingly  im darned if i know what to do with you well youd better come home with me now anyway and meet your aunt and then we can talk things over after all the main thing is to keep you out of mischief  you put things crudely but no doubt you are right  youll live with us of course  thank you very much this is the right spirit  ill have to talk to nesta about you there may be something you can do  i shouldnt mind being a partner suggested jimmy helpfully  why dont you get work on a paper again you used to do that well  i dont think my old paper would welcome me now they regard me rather as an entertaining newsitem than a worker  thats true say why on earth did you make such a fool of yourself over on the other side that breachofpromise case with the barmaid said mr pett reproachfully  let bygones be bygones said jimmy i was more sinned against than sinning you know how it is uncle pete mr pett started violently but said nothing you try out of pure goodness of heart to scatter light and sweetness and protect the poor workinggirllike heavenand brighten up her lot and so on and she turns right around and soaks it to you good and anyway she wasnt a barmaid she worked in a florists shop  i dont see that that makes any difference  all the difference in the world all the difference between the sordid and the poetical i dont know if you have ever experienced the hypnotic intoxication of a florists shop take it from me uncle pete any girl can look an angel as long as she is surrounded by choice blooms i couldnt help myself i wasnt responsible i only woke up when i met her outside but all that sort of thing is different now i am another man sober steady seriousminded  mr pett had taken the receiver from the telephone and was talking to some one the buzzing of a feminine voice came to jimmys ears mr pett hung up the receiver  your aunt says we are to come up at once  im ready and it will be a good excuse for you to knock off work i bet youre glad i came does the carriage await or shall we take the subway  i guess it will be quicker to take the subway your aunts very surprised that you are here and very pleased  im making everybody happy today  mr pett was looking at him in a meditative way jimmy caught his eye  youre registering something uncle pete and i dont know what it is why the glance  i was just thinking of something  jimmy prompted his nephew  eh  add the word jimmy to your remarks it will help me to feel at home and enable me to overcome my shyness  mr pett chuckled  shyness if i had your nerve he broke off with a sigh and looked at jimmy affectionately what i was thinking was that youre a good boy at least youre not but youre different from that gang ofofthat crowd uptown  what crowd  your aunt is literary you know shes filled the house with poets and that sort of thing it will be a treat having you around youre human i dont see that were going to make much of you now that youre here but im darned glad youve come jimmy  put it there uncle pete said jimmy youre all right youre the finest captain of industry i ever met    chapter xiii  slight complications  they left the subway at ninetysixth street and walked up the drive jimmy like every one else who saw it for the first time experienced a slight shock at the sight of the pett mansion but rallying followed his uncle up the flagged path to the front door  your aunt will be in the drawingroom i guess said mr pett opening the door with his key  jimmy was looking round him appreciatively mr petts house might be an eyesore from without but inside it had had the benefit of the skill of the best interior decorator in new york  a man could be very happy in a house like this if he didnt have to poison his days with work said jimmy  mr pett looked alarmed  dont go saying anything like that to your aunt he urged she thinks you have come to settle down  so i have im going to settle down like a limpet i hope i shall be living in luxury on you twenty years from now is this the room  mr pett opened the drawingroom door a small hairy object sprang from a basket and stood yapping in the middle of the room this was aida mrs petts pomeranian mr pett avoiding the animal coldly for he disliked it ushered jimmy into the room  heres jimmy crocker nesta  jimmy was aware of a handsome woman of middle age so like his stepmother that for an instant his selfpossession left him and he stammered  howhow do you do  his demeanour made a favourable impression on mrs pett she took it for the decent confusion of remorse  i was very surprised when your uncle telephoned me she said i had not the slightest idea that you were coming over i am very glad to see you  thank you  this is your cousin ogden  jimmy perceived a fat boy lying on a settee he had not risen on jimmys entrance and he did not rise now he did not even lower the book he was reading  hello he said  jimmy crossed over to the settee and looked down on him he had got over his momentary embarrassment and as usual with him the reaction led to a fatal breeziness he prodded ogden in his wellcovered ribs producing a yelp of protest from that astounded youth  so this is ogden well well well you dont grow up ogden but you do grow out what are youa perfect sixtysix  the favourable impression which mrs pett had formed of her nephew waned she was shocked by this disrespectful attitude towards the child she worshipped  please do not disturb ogden james she said stiffly he is not feeling very well today his stomach is weak  been eating too much said jimmy cheerfully  i was just the same at his age what he wants is half rations and plenty of exercise  say protested ogden  just look at this proceeded jimmy grasping a handful of superfluous tissue around the boys ribs all that ought to come off ill tell you what ill do ill buy a pair of flannel trousers and a sweater and some sneakers and ill take him for a run up riverside drive this evening do him no end of good and a good skippingrope too nothing like it in a couple of weeks ill have him as fit as a  ogdens case said mrs pett coldly which is very complicated is in the hands of doctor briginshaw in whom we have every confidence  there was a silence the paralysing effects of which mr pett vainly tried to mitigate by shuffling his feet and coughing mrs pett spoke  i hope that now that you are here james you intend to settle down and work hard  indubitably like a beaver said jimmy mindful of mr petts recent warning the only trouble is that there seems to be a little uncertainty as to what i am best fitted for we talked it over in uncle petes office and arrived at no conclusion  cant you think of anything said mr pett  i looked right through the telephone classified directory the other day  the other day but you only landed this morning  i mean this morning when i was looking up your address so that i could go and see you said jimmy glibly it seems a long time ago i think the sight of all those fellows in your office has aged me i think the best plan would be for me to settle down here and learn how to be an electrical engineer or something by mail i was reading an advertisement in a magazine as we came up on the subway i see they guarantee to teach you anything from sheet metal working to poultry raising the thing began you are standing still because you lack training it seemed to me to apply to my case exactly i had better drop them a line tonight asking for a few simple facts about chickens  whatever comment mrs pett might have made on this suggestion was checked by the entrance of ann from the window of her room ann had observed the arrival of jimmy and her uncle and now having allowed sufficient time to elapse for the former to make mrs petts acquaintance she came down to see how things were going  she was well satisfied with what she saw a slight strain which she perceived in the atmosphere she attributed to embarrassment natural to the situation  she looked at jimmy enquiringly mrs pett had not informed her of mr petts telephone call so jimmy she realised had to be explained to her she waited for some one to say something  mr pett undertook the introduction  jimmy this is my niece ann chester this is jimmy crocker ann  jimmy could not admire sufficiently the start of surprise which she gave it was artistic and convincing  jimmy crocker  mr pett was on the point of mentioning that this was not the first time ann had met jimmy but refrained after all that interview had happened five years ago jimmy had almost certainly forgotten all about it there was no use in making him feel unnecessarily awkward it was up to ann if she wanted to disinter the ancient grievance let her it was no business of his  i thought you werent coming over said ann  i changed my mind  mr pett who had been gazing attentively at them uttered an exclamation  ive got it ive been trying all this while to think where it was that i saw you before it was on the atlantic  ann caught jimmys eye she was relieved to see that he was not disturbed by this sudden development  did you come over on the atlantic mr crocker she said surely not we crossed on her ourselves we should have met  dont call me mr crocker said jimmy call me jimmy your mothers brothers wifes sisters second husband is my father blood is thicker than water no i came over on the caronia we docked this morning  well there was a fellow just like you on the atlantic persisted mr pett  mrs pett said nothing she was watching jimmy with a keen and suspicious eye  i suppose im a common type said jimmy  you remember the man i mean said mr pett innocently unconscious of the unfriendly thoughts he was encouraging in two of his hearers he sat two tables away from us at meals you remember him nesta  as i was too unwell to come to meals i do not  why i thought i saw you once talking to him on deck ann  really said ann i dont remember any one who looked at all like jimmy  well said mr pett puzzled its very strange i guess im wrong he looked at his watch well ill have to be getting back to the office  ill come with you part of the way uncle pete said jimmy i have to go and arrange for my things to be expressed here  why not phone to the hotel said mr pett it seemed to jimmy and ann that he was doing this sort of thing on purpose which hotel did you leave them at  no i shall have to go there i have some packing to do  you will be back to lunch said ann  thanks i shant be gone more than half an hour  for a moment after they had gone ann relaxed happy and relieved everything had gone splendidly then a shock ran through her whole system as mrs pett spoke she spoke excitedly in a lowered voice leaning over to ann  ann did you notice anything did you suspect anything  ann mastered her emotion with an effort  whatever do you mean aunt nesta  about that young man who calls himself jimmy crocker  ann clutched the side of the chair  who calls himself jimmy crocker i dont understand  ann tried to laugh it seemed to her an age before she produced any sound at all and when it came it was quite unlike a laugh  what put that idea into your head surely if he says he is jimmy crocker its rather absurd to doubt him isnt it how could anybody except jimmy crocker know that you were anxious to get jimmy crocker over here you didnt tell any one did you  this reasoning shook mrs pett a little but she did not intend to abandon a perfectly good suspicion merely because it began to seem unreasonable  they have their spies everywhere she said doggedly  who have  the secret service people from other countries lord wisbeach was telling me about it yesterday he said that i ought to suspect everybody he said that an attempt might be made on willies invention at any moment now  he was joking  he was not i have never seen any one so serious he said that i ought to regard every fresh person who came into the house as a possible criminal  well that guys fresh enough muttered ogden from the settee  mrs pett started  ogden i had forgotten that you were there she uttered a cry of horror as the fact of his presence started a new train of thought why this man may have come to kidnap you i never thought of that  ann felt it time to intervene mrs pett was hovering much too near the truth for comfort you mustnt imagine things aunt nesta i believe it comes from writing the sort of stories you do surely it is impossible for this man to be an impostor how would he dare take such a risk he must know that you could detect him at any moment by cabling over to mrs crocker to ask if her stepson was really in america  it was a bold stroke for it suggested a plan of action which if followed would mean ruin for her schemes but ann could not refrain from chancing it she wanted to know whether her aunt had any intention of asking mrs crocker for information or whether the feud was too bitter for her pride to allow her to communicate with her sister in any way she breathed again as mrs pett stiffened grimly in her chair  i should not dream of cabling to eugenia  i quite understand that said ann but an impostor would not know that you felt like that would he  i see what you mean  ann relaxed again the relief was however only momentary  i cannot understand though said mrs pett why your uncle should have been so positive that he saw this young man on the atlantic  just a chance resemblance i suppose why uncle peter said he saw the man whom he imagined was like jimmy crocker talking to me if there had been any real resemblance shouldnt i have seen it before uncle peter  assistance came from an unexpected quarter  i know the chap uncle peter meant said ogden he wasnt like this guy at all  ann was too grateful for the help to feel astonished at it her mind dwelling for a mere instant on the matter decided that ogden must have seen her on deck with somebody else than jimmy she had certainly not lacked during the voyage for those who sought her society  mrs pett seemed to be impressed  i may be letting my imagination run away with me she said  of course you are aunt nesta said ann thankfully you dont realise what a vivid imagination you have got when i was typing that last story of yours i was simply astounded at the ideas you had thought of i remember saying so to uncle peter you cant expect to have a wonderful imagination like yours and not imagine things can you  mrs pett smiled demurely she looked hopefully at her niece waiting for more but ann had said her say  you are perfectly right my dear child she said when she was quite sure the eulogy was not to be resumed no doubt i have been foolish to suspect this young man but lord wisbeachs words naturally acted more strongly on a mind like mine than they would have done in the case of another woman  of course said ann  she was feeling quite happy now it had been tense while it had lasted but everything was all right now  and fortunately said mrs pett there is a way by which we can find out for certain if the young man is really james crocker  ann became rigid again  a way what way  why dont you remember my dear that skinner has known james crocker for years  skinner  the name sounded familiar but in the stress of the moment ann could not identify it  my new butler he came to me straight from eugenia it was he who let us in when we called at her house nobody could know better than he whether this person is really james crocker or not  ann felt as if she had struggled to the limit of her endurance she was not prepared to cope with this unexpected blow she had not the strength to rally under it dully she perceived that her schemes must be dismissed as a failure before they had had a chance of success her accomplice must not return to the house to be exposed she saw that clearly enough if he came back he would walk straight into a trap she rose quickly she must warn him she must intercept him before he arrivedand he might arrive at any moment now  of course she said steadying herself with an effort i never thought of that that makes it all simple    i hope lunch wont be late im hungry  she sauntered to the door but directly she had closed it behind her ran to her room snatched up a hat and rushed downstairs and out into riverside drive just as she reached the street jimmy turned the corner she ran towards him holding up her hands    chapter xiv  lord wisbeach  jimmy halted in his tracks the apparition had startled him he had been thinking of ann but he had not expected her to bound out at him waving her arms  whats the matter he enquired  ann pulled him towards a sidestreet  you mustnt go to the house everything has gone wrong  everything gone wrong i thought i had made a hit i have with your uncle anyway we parted on the friendliest terms we have arranged to go to the ballgame together tomorrow he is going to tell them at the office that carnegie wants to see him  it isnt uncle peter its aunt nesta  ah there you touch my conscience i was a little tactless im afraid with ogden it happened before you came into the room i suppose that is the trouble  it has nothing do with that said ann impatiently its much worse aunt nesta is suspicious she has guessed that you arent really jimmy crocker  great scott how  i tried to calm her down but she still suspects so now she has decided to wait and see if skinner the butler knows you if he doesnt she will know that she was right  jimmy was frankly puzzled  i dont quite follow the reasoning surely its a peculiar kind of test why should she think a man cannot be honest and true unless her butler knows him there must be hundreds of worthy citizens whom he does not know  skinner arrived from england a few days ago until then he was employed by mrs crocker now do you understand  jimmy stopped she had spoken slowly and distinctly and there could be no possibility that he had misunderstood her yet he scarcely believed that he had heard her aright how could a man named skinner have been his stepmothers butler bayliss had been with the family ever since they had arrived in london  are you sure  of course of course im sure aunt nesta told me herself there cant possibly be a mistake because it was skinner who let her in when she called on mrs crocker uncle peter told me about it he had a talk with the man in the hall and found that he was a baseball enthusiast  a wild impossible idea flashed upon jimmy it was so absurd that he felt ashamed of entertaining it even for a moment but strange things were happening these times and it might be     what sort of looking man is skinner  oh stout cleanshaven i like him hes much more human than i thought butlers ever were why  oh nothing  of course you cant go back to the house you see that he would say that you arent jimmy crocker and then you would be arrested  i dont see that if i am sufficiently like crocker for his friends to mistake me for him in restaurants why shouldnt this butler mistake me too  but  and consider in any case theres no harm done if he fails to recognise me when he opens the door to us we shall know that the game is up and i shall have plenty of time to disappear if the likeness deceives him all will be well i propose that we go to the house ring the bell and when he appears i will say ah skinner honest fellow or words to that effect he will either stare blankly at me or fawn on me like a faithful watchdog we will base our further actions on which way the butler jumps  the sound of the bell died away footsteps were heard ann reached for jimmys arm andclutched it  now she whispered  the door opened next moment jimmys suspicion was confirmed gaping at them from the open doorway wonderfully respectable and butlerlike in swallowtails stood his father how he came to be there and why he was there jimmy did not know but there he was  jimmy had little faith in his fathers talents as a man of discretion the elder crocker was one of those simple straight forward people who when surprised do not conceal their surprise and who not understanding any situation in which they find themselves demand explanation on the spot swift and immediate action was indicated on his part before his amazed parent finding him on the steps of the one house in new york where he was least likely to be should utter words that would undo everything he could see the name jimmy trembling on mr crockers lips  he waved his hand cheerily  ah skinner there you are he said breezily miss chester was telling me that you had left my stepmother i suppose you sailed on the boat before mine i came over on the caronia i suppose you didnt expect to see me again so soon eh  a spasm seemed to pass over mr crockers face leaving it calm and serene he had been thrown his cue and like the old actor he was he took it easily and without confusion he smiled a respectful smile  no indeed sir  he stepped aside to allow them to enter jimmy caught anns eye as she passed him it shone with relief and admiration and it exhilarated jimmy like wine as she moved towards the stairs he gave expression to his satisfaction by slapping his father on the back with a report that rang out like a pistol shot  what was that said ann turning  something out on the drive i think said jimmy a car backfiring i fancy skinner  very probably sir  he followed ann to the stairs as he started to mount them a faint whisper reached his ears  ataboy  it was mr crockers way of bestowing a fathers blessing  ann walked into the drawingroom her head high triumph in the glance which she cast upon her unconscious aunt  quite an interesting little scene downstairs aunt nesta she said the meeting of the faithful old retainer and the young master skinner was almost overcome with surprise and joy when he saw jimmy  mrs pett could not check an incautious exclamation  did skinner recognise she began then stopped herself abruptly  ann laughed  did he recognise jimmy of course he was hardly likely to have forgotten him surely it isnt much more than a week since he was waiting on him in london  it was a very impressive meeting said jimmy rather like the reunion of ulysses and the hound argos of which this brighteyed child here he patted ogden on the head a proceeding violently resented by that youthhas no doubt read in the course of his researches into the classics i was ulysses skinner enacted the role of the exuberant dog  mrs pett was not sure whether she was relieved or disappointed at this evidence that her suspicions had been without foundation on the whole relief may be said to have preponderated  i have no doubt he was pleased to see you again he must have been very much astonished  he was  you will be meeting another old friend in a minute or two said mrs pett  jimmy had been sinking into a chair this remark stopped him in middescent  another  mrs pett glanced at the clock  lord wisbeach is coming to lunch  lord wisbeach cried ann he doesnt know jimmy  eugenia informed me in london that he was one of your best friends james  ann looked helplessly at jimmy she was conscious again of that feeling of not being able to cope with fates blows of not having the strength to go on climbing over the barriers which fate placed in her path  jimmy for his part was cursing the ill fortune that had brought lord wisbeach across his path he saw clearly that it only needed recognition by one or two more intimates of jimmy crocker to make ann suspect his real identity the fact that she had seen him with bayliss in paddington station and had fallen into the error of supposing bayliss to be his father had kept her from suspecting until now but this could not last forever he remembered lord wisbeach well as a garrulous irrepressible chatterer who would probably talk about old times to such an extent as to cause ann to realise the truth in the first five minutes  the door opened  lord wisbeach announced mr crocker  im afraid im late mrs pett said his lordship  no youre quite punctual lord wisbeach here is an old friend of yours james crocker  there was an almost imperceptible pause then jimmy stepped forward and held out his hand  hello wizzy old man  hhello jimmy  their eyes met in his lordships there was an expression of unmistakable relief mingled with astonishment his face which had turned a sickly white flushed as the blood poured back into it he had the appearance of a man who had had a bad shock and is just getting over it jimmy eyeing him curiously was not surprised at his emotion what the mans game might be he could not say but of one thing he was sure which was that this was not lord wisbeach buton the contrarysome one he had never seen before in his life  luncheon is served madam said mr crocker sonorously from the doorway    chapter xv  a little business chat  it was not often that ann found occasion to rejoice at the presence in her uncles house of the six geniuses whom mrs pett had installed therein as a rule she disliked them individually and collectively but today their company was extraordinarily welcome to her they might have their faults but at least their presence tended to keep the conversation general and prevent it becoming a duologue between lord wisbeach and jimmy on the subject of old times she was still feeling weak from the reaction consequent upon the slackening of the tension of her emotions on seeing lord wisbeach greet jimmy as an old acquaintance she had never hoped that that barrier would be surmounted she had pictured lord wisbeach drawing back with a puzzled frown on his face and an astonished but this is not jimmy crocker the strain had left her relieved but in no mood for conversation and she replied absently to the remarks of howard bemis the poet who sat on her left she looked round the table willie partridge was talking to mrs pett about the difference between picric acid and trinitrotoluene than which a pleasanter topic for the luncheon table could hardly be selected and the voice of clarence renshaw rose above all other competing noises as he spoke of the functions of the trochaic spondee there was nothing outwardly to distinguish this meal from any other which she had shared of late in that house  the only thing that prevented her relief being unmixed was the fact that she could see lord wisbeach casting furtive glances at jimmy who was eating with the quiet concentration of one who after days of boardinghouse fare finds himself in the presence of the masterpieces of a chef in the past few days jimmy had consumed too much hash to worry now about anything like a furtive glance he had perceived lord wisbeachs roving eye and had no doubt that at the conclusion of the meal he would find occasion for a little chat meanwhile however his duty was towards his tissues and their restoration he helped himself liberally from a dish which his father offered him  he became aware that mrs pett was addressing him  i beg your pardon  quite like old times said mrs pett genially her suspicions had vanished completely since lord wisbeachs recognition of the visitor and remorse that she should have suspected him made her unwontedly amiable being with skinner again she explained it must remind you of london  jimmy caught his fathers expressionless eye  skinners he said handsomely is a character one cannot help but respect his nature expands before one like some beautiful flower  the dish rocked in mr crockers hand but his face remained impassive  there is no vice in skinner proceeded jimmy his heart is the heart of a little child  mrs pett looked at this paragon of the virtues in rather a startled way she had an uncomfortable feeling that she was being laughed at she began to dislike jimmy again  for many years skinner has been a father to me said jimmy who ran to help me when i fell and would some pretty story tell or kiss the place to make it well skinner  for all her suspense ann could not help warming towards an accomplice who carried off an unnerving situation with such a flourish she had always regarded herself with a fair degree of complacency as possessed of no mean stock of courage and resource but she could not have spoken then without betraying her anxiety she thought highly of jimmy but all the same she could not help wishing that he would not make himself quite so conspicuous perhapsthe thought chilled herperhaps he was creating quite a new jimmy crocker a character which would cause skinner and lord wisbeach to doubt the evidence of their eyes and begin to suspect the truth she wished she could warn him to simmer down but the table was a large one and he and she were at opposite ends of it  jimmy meanwhile was thoroughly enjoying himself he felt that he was being the little ray of sunshine about the home and making a good impression he was completely happy he liked the food he liked seeing his father buttle and he liked these amazing freaks who were it appeared fellowinmates with him of this highly desirable residence he wished that old mr pett could have been present he had conceived a great affection for mr pett and registered a mental resolve to lose no time in weaning him from his distressing habit of allowing the office to interfere with his pleasures he was planning a little trip to the polo grounds in which mr pett his father and a number of pop bottles were to be his companions when his reverie was interrupted by a sudden cessation of the buzz of talk he looked up from his plate to find the entire company regarding willie partridge openmouthed willie with gleaming eyes was gazing at a small testtube which he had produced from his pocket and placed beside his plate  i have enough in this testtube said willie airily to blow half new york to bits  the silence was broken by a crash in the background mr crocker had dropped a chafingdish  if i were to drop this little tube like that said willie using the occurrence as a topical illustration we shouldnt be here  dont drop it advised jimmy what is it  partridgite  mrs pett had risen from the table with blanched face  willie how can you bring that stuff here what are you thinking of  willie smiles a patronising smile  there is not the slightest danger aunt nesta it cannot explode without concussion i have been carrying it about with me all the morning  he bestowed on the testtube the look a fond parent might give his favourite child mrs pett was not reassured  go and put it in your uncles safe at once put it away  i havent the combination  call your uncle up at once at the office and ask him  very well if you wish it aunt nesta but there is no danger  dont take that thing with you screamed mrs pett as he rose you might drop it come back for it  very well  conversation flagged after willies departure the presence of the testtube seemed to act on the spirits of the company after the fashion of the corpse at the egyptian banquet howard bemis who was sitting next to it edged away imperceptibly till he nearly crowded ann off her chair presently willie returned he picked up the testtube put it in his pocket with a certain jauntiness and left the room again  now if you hear a sudden bang and find yourself disappearing through the roof said jimmy that will be it  willie returned and took his place at the table again but the spirit had gone out of the gathering the voice of clarence renshaw was hushed and howard bemis spoke no more of the influence of edgar lee masters on modern literature mrs pett left the room followed by ann the geniuses drifted away one by one jimmy having lighted a cigarette and finished his coffee perceived that he was alone with his old friend lord wisbeach and that his old friend lord wisbeach was about to become confidential  the fairhaired young man opened the proceedings by going to the door and looking out this done he returned to his seat and gazed fixedly at jimmy  whats your game he asked  jimmy returned his gaze blandly  my game he said what do you mean  can the coy stuff urged his lordship brusquely talk sense and talk it quick we may be interrupted at any moment whats your game what are you here for  jimmy raised his eyebrows  i am a prodigal nephew returned to the fold  oh quit your kidding are you one of potters lot  who is potter  you know who potter is  on the contrary my life has never been brightened by so much as a sight of potter  is that true  absolutely  are you working on your own then  i am not working at all at present there is some talk of my learning to be an asparagus adjuster by mail later on  you make me sick said lord wisbeach wheres the sense of trying to pull this line of talk why not put your cards on the table weve both got in here on the same lay and theres no use fighting and balling the thing up  do you wish me to understand said jimmy that you are not my old friend lord wisbeach  no and youre not my old friend jimmy crocker  what makes you think that  if you had been would you have pretended to recognise me upstairs just now i tell you pal i was all in for a second till you gave me the high sign  jimmy laughed  it would have been awkward for you if i really had been jimmy crocker wouldnt it  and it would have been awkward for you if i had really been lord wisbeach  who are you by the way  the boys call me gentleman jack  why asked jimmy surprised  lord wisbeach ignored the question  im working with burkes lot just now say lets be sensible about this ill be straight with you straight as a string  did you say string or spring  and ill expect you to be straight with me  are we to breathe confidences into each others ears  lord wisbeach went to the door again and submitted the passage to a second examination  you seem nervous said jimmy  i dont like that butler hes up to something  do you think hes one of potters lot  shouldnt wonder he isnt on the level anyway or why did he pretend to recognise you as jimmy crocker  recognition of me as jimmy crocker seems to be the acid test of honesty  he was in a tight place same as i was said lord wisbeach he couldnt know that you werent really jimmy crocker until you put him wisesame as you did meby pretending to know him he looked at jimmy with grudging admiration youd got your nerve with you pal coming in here like this you were taking big chances you couldnt have known you wouldnt run up against some one who really knew jimmy crocker what would you have done if this butler guy had really been on the level  the risks of the profession  when i think of the work i had to put in said lord wisbeach it makes me tired to think of some one else just walking in here as you did  what made you choose lord wisbeach as your alias  i knew that i could get away with it i came over on the boat with him and i knew he was travelling round the world and wasnt going to stay more than a day in new york even then i had to go some to get into this place burke told me to get hold of old chester and get a letter of introduction from him and here you come along and just stroll in and tell them you have come to stay he brooded for a moment on the injustice of things well what are you going to do about it pal  about what  about us both being here are you going to be sensible and work in with me and divvy up later on or are you going to risk spoiling everything by trying to hog the whole thing ill be square with you it isnt as if there was any use in trying to bluff each other were both here for the same thing you want to get hold of that powder stuff that partridgite and so do i  you believe in partridgite then  oh can it said lord wisbeach disgustedly whats the use of course i believe in it burkes had his eye on the thing for a year youve heard of dwight partridge havent you well this guys his son every one knows that dwight partridge was working on an explosive when he died and heres his son comes along with a testtube full of stuff which he says could blow this city to bits whats the answer the boys been working on the old mans dope from what ive seen of him i guess there wasnt much more to be done on it or he wouldnt have done it hes pretty well dead from the neck up as far as i can see but that doesnt alter the fact that hes got the stuff and that you and i have got to get together and make a deal if we dont im not saying you mightnt gum my game just as i might gum yours but wheres the sense in that it only means taking extra chances whereas if we sit in together theres enough in it for both of us you know as well as i do that theres a dozen markets whichll bid against each other for stuff like that partridgite if youre worrying about burke giving you a square deal forget it ill fix burke hell treat you nice all right  jimmy ground the butt of his cigarette against his plate  im no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man and speaking in the capacity of a plain blunt man i rise to replynothing doing  what you wont come in  jimmy shook his head  im sorry to disappoint you wizzy if i may still call you that but your offer fails to attract i will not get together or sit in or anything else on the contrary i am about to go to mrs pett and inform her that there is a snake in her eden  youre not going to squeal on me  at the top of my voice  lord wisbeach laughed unpleasantly  yes you will he said how are you going to explain why you recognised me as an old pal before lunch if im a crook after lunch you cant give me away without giving yourself away if im not lord wisbeach then youre not jimmy crocker  jimmy sighed i get you life is very complex isnt it  lord wisbeach rose  youd better think it over son he said you arent going to get anywhere by acting like a fool you cant stop me going after this stuff and if you wont come in and go fiftyfifty youll find yourself left ill beat you to it  he left the room and jimmy lighting a fresh cigarette addressed himself to the contemplation of this new complication in his affairs it was quite true what gentleman jack or joe or whatever the boys called him had said to denounce him meant denouncing himself jimmy smoked thoughtfully not for the first time he wished that his record during the past few years had been of a snowier character he began to appreciate what must have been the feelings of dr jekyll under the handicap of his disreputable second self mr hyde    chapter xvi  mrs pett takes precautions  mrs pett on leaving the luncheontable had returned to the drawingroom to sit beside the sicksettee of her stricken child she was troubled about ogden the poor lamb was not at all himself today a bowl of clear soup the midday meal prescribed by doctor briginshaw lay untasted at his side  she crossed the room softly and placed a cool hand on her sons aching brow  oh gee said ogden wearily  are you feeling a little better oggie darling  no said ogden firmly im feeling a lot worse  you havent drunk your nice soup  feed it to the cat  could you eat a nice bowl of breadandmilk precious  have a heart replied the sufferer  mrs pett returned to her seat sorrowfully it struck her as an odd coincidence that the poor child was nearly always like this on the morning after she had been entertaining guests she put it down to the reaction from the excitement working on a highlystrung temperament to his present collapse the brutal behaviour of jerry mitchell had of course contributed every drop of her maternal blood boiled with rage and horror whenever she permitted herself to contemplate the excesses of the late jerry she had always mistrusted the man she had never liked his facenot merely on aesthetic grounds but because she had seemed to detect in it a lurking savagery how right events had proved this instinctive feeling mrs pett was not vulgar enough to describe the feeling even to herself as a hunch but a hunch it had been and like every one whose hunches have proved correct she was conscious in the midst of her grief of a certain complacency it seemed to her that hers must be an intelligence and insight above the ordinary  the peace of the early afternoon settled upon the drawingroom mrs pett had taken up a book ogden on the settee breathed stentorously faint snores proceeded from the basket in the corner where aida the pomeranian lay curled in refreshing sleep through the open window floated sounds of warmth and summer  yielding to the drowsy calm mrs pett was just nodding into a pleasant nap when the door opened and lord wisbeach came in  lord wisbeach had been doing some rapid thinking rapid thought is one of the essentials in the composition of men who are known as gentleman jack to the boys and whose livelihood is won only by a series of arduous struggles against the forces of society and the machinations of potter and his gang condensed into capsule form his lordships meditations during the minutes after he had left jimmy in the diningroom amounted to the realisation that the best mode of defence is attack it is your man who knows how to play the bold game on occasion who wins a duller schemer than lord wisbeach might have been content to be inactive after such a conversation as had just taken place between himself and jimmy his lordship giving the matter the concentrated attention of his trained mind had hit on a better plan and he had come to the drawingroom now to put it into effect  his entrance shattered the peaceful atmosphere aida who had been gurgling apoplectically sprang snarling from the basket and made for the intruder openmouthed her shrill barking rang through the room  lord wisbeach hated little dogs he hated and feared them many men of action have these idiosyncrasies he got behind a chair and said there there aida whose outburst was mere sound and fury and who had no intention whatever of coming to blows continued the demonstration from a safe distance till mrs pett swooping down picked her up and held her in her lap where she consented to remain growling subdued defiance lord wisbeach came out from behind his chair and sat down warily  can i have a word with you mrs pett  certainly lord wisbeach  his lordship looked meaningly at ogden  in private you know  he then looked meaningly at mrs pett  ogden darling said mrs pett i think you had better go to your room and undress and get into bed a little nice sleep might do you all the good in the world  with surprising docility the boy rose  all right he said  poor oggie is not at all well today said mrs pett when he was gone he is very subject to these attacks what do you want to tell me lord wisbeach  his lordship drew his chair a little closer  mrs pett you remember what i told you yesterday  of course  might i ask what you know of this man who has come here calling himself jimmy crocker  mrs pett started she remembered that she had used almost that very expression to ann her suspicions which had been lulled by the prompt recognition of the visitor by skinner and lord wisbeach returned it is one of the effects of a successful hunch that it breeds other hunches she had been right about jerry mitchell was she to be proved right about the selfstyled jimmy crocker  you have seen your nephew i believe  never but  that man said lord wisbeach impassively is not your nephew  mrs pett thrilled all down her spine she had been right  but you  but i pretended to recognise him just so for a purpose i wanted to make him think that i suspected nothing  then you think  remember what i said to you yesterday  but skinnerthe butlerrecognised him  exactly it goes to prove that what i said about skinner was correct they are working together the thing is selfevident look at it from your point of view how simple it is this man pretends to an intimate acquaintance with skinner you take that as evidence of skinners honesty skinner recognises this man you take that as proof that this man is really your nephew the fact that skinner recognised as jimmy crocker a man who is not jimmy crocker condemns him  but why did you  i told you that i pretended to accept this man as the real jimmy crocker for a purpose at present there is nothing that you can do mere impersonation is not a crime if i had exposed him when we met you would have gained nothing beyond driving him from the house whereas if we wait if we pretend to suspect nothing we shall undoubtedly catch him redhanded in an attempt on your nephews invention  you are sure that that is why he has come  what other reason could he have  i thought he might be trying to kidnap ogden  lord wisbeach frowned thoughtfully he had not taken this consideration into account  it is possible he said there have been several attempts made have there not to kidnap your son  at one time said mrs pett proudly there was not a child in america who had to be more closely guarded why the kidnappers had a special nickname for oggie they called him the little nugget  of course then it is quite possible that that may be the mans object in any case our course must be the same we must watch every move he makes he paused i could helppardon my suggesting iti could help a great deal more if you were to invite me to live in the house you were kind enough to ask me to visit you in the country but it will be two weeks before you go to the country and in those two weeks  you must come here at once lord wisbeach tonight today  i think that would be the best plan  i cannot tell you how grateful i am for all you are doing  you have been so kind to me mrs pett said lord wisbeach with feeling that it is surely only right that i should try to make some return let us leave it at this then i will come here tonight and will make it my business to watch these two men i will go and pack my things and have them sent here  it is wonderful of you lord wisbeach  not at all replied his lordship it will be a pleasure  he held out his hand drawing it back rapidly as the dog aida made a snap at it substituting a longrange leavetaking for the more intimate farewell he left the room  when he had gone mrs pett remained for some minutes thinking she was aflame with excitement she had a sensational mind and it had absorbed lord wisbeachs revelations eagerly her admiration for his lordship was intense and she trusted him utterly the only doubt that occurred to her was whether with the best intentions in the world he would be able unassisted to foil a pair of schemers so distant from each other geographically as the man who called himself jimmy crocker and the man who had called himself skinner that was a point on which they had not touched the fact that one impostor was above stairs the other below it seemed to mrs pett impossible that lord wisbeach for all his zeal could watch skinner without neglecting jimmy or foil jimmy without taking his attention off skinner it was manifestly a situation that called for allies she felt that she must have further assistance  to mrs pett doubtless owing to her hobby of writing sensational fiction there was a magic in the word detective which was shared by no other word in the language she loved detectivestheir keen eyes their quiet smiles their derby hats when they came on the stage she leaned forward in her orchestra chair when they entered her own stories she always wrote with a greater zest it is not too much to say that she had an almost spiritual attachment for detectives and the idea of neglecting to employ one in real life now that circumstances had combined to render his advent so necessary struck her as both rash and inartistic in the old days when ogden had been kidnapped the only thing which had brought her balm had been the daily interviews with the detectives she ached to telephone for one now  the only consideration that kept her back was a regard for lord wisbeachs feelings he had been so kind and so shrewd that to suggest reinforcing him with outside assistance must infallibly wound him deeply and yet the situation demanded the services of a trained specialist lord wisbeach had borne himself during their recent conversation in such a manner as to leave no doubt that he considered himself adequate to deal with the matter singlehanded but admirable though he was he was not a professional exponent of the art of espionage he needed to be helped in spite of himself  a happy solution struck mrs pett there was no need to tell him she could combine the installation of a detective with the nicest respect for her allys feelings by the simple process of engaging one without telling lord wisbeach anything about it  the telephone stood at her elbow concealedat the express request of the interior decorator who had designed the roomin the interior of what looked to the casual eye like a stuffed owl on a table near at hand handsomely bound in morocco to resemble a complete works of shakespeare was the telephone book mrs pett hesitated no longer she had forgotten the address of the detective agency which she had employed on the occasion of the kidnapping of ogden but she remembered the name and also the name of the delightfully sympathetic manager or proprietor or whatever he was who had listened to her troubles then  she unhooked the receiver and gave a number  i want to speak to mr sturgis she said  oh mr sturgis said mrs pett i wonder if you could possibly run up hereyes now this is mrs peter pett speaking you remember we met some years ago when i was mrs ford yes the mother of ogden ford i want to consultyou will come up at once thank you so much goodbye  mrs pett hung up the receiver    chapter xvii  miss trimble detective  downstairs in the diningroom jimmy was smoking cigarettes and reviewing in his mind the peculiarities of the situation when ann came in  oh there you are said ann i thought you must have gone upstairs  i have been having a delightful and entertaining conversation with my old chum lord wisbeach  good gracious what about  oh this and that  not about old times  no we did not touch upon old times  does he still believe that you are jimmy crocker im so nervous said ann that i can hardly speak  i shouldnt be nervous said jimmy encouragingly i dont see how things could be going better  thats what makes me nervous our luck is too good to last we are taking such risks it would have been bad enough without skinner and lord wisbeach at any moment you may make some fatal slip thank goodness aunt nestas suspicions have been squashed for the time being now that skinner and lord wisbeach have accepted you as genuine but then you have only seen them for a few minutes when they have been with you a little longer they may get suspicious themselves i cant imagine how you managed to keep it up with lord wisbeach i should have thought he would be certain to say something about the time when you were supposed to be friends in london we simply mustnt strain our luck i want you to go straight to aunt nesta now and ask her to let jerry come back  you still refuse to let me take jerrys place  of course i do youll find aunt nesta upstairs  very well but suppose i cant persuade her to forgive jerry  i think she is certain to do anything you ask you saw how friendly she was to you at lunch i dont see how anything can have happened since lunch to change her  very well ill go to her now  and when you have seen her go to the library and wait for me its the second room along the passage outside here i have promised to drive lord wisbeach down to his hotel in my car i met him outside just now and he tells me aunt nesta has invited him to stay here so he wants to go and get his things ready i shant be twenty minutes i shall come straight back  jimmy found himself vaguely disquieted by this piece of information  lord wisbeach is coming to stay here  yes why  oh nothing well ill go and see mrs pett  no traces of the disturbance which had temporarily ruffled the peace of the drawingroom were to be observed when jimmy reached it the receiver of the telephone was back on its hook mrs pett back in her chair the dog aida back in her basket mrs pett her mind at ease now that she had taken the step of summoning mr sturgis was reading a book one of her own and was absorbed in it the dog aida slumbered noisily  the sight of jimmy however roused mrs pett from her literary calm to her eye after what lord wisbeach had revealed there was something sinister in the very way in which he walked into the room he made her flesh creep in a society thug mobbs and stifien 135 net all rights of translation reserved including the scandinavian she had portrayed just such a mansmooth specious and formidable instinctively as she watched jimmy her mind went back to the perfectly rotten behaviour of her own marsden tuke it was only in the last chapter but one that they managed to foil his outrageous machinations and it seemed to her that here was tuke in the flesh she had pictured him she remembered as a man of agreeable exterior the better calculated to deceive and undo the virtuous and the fact that jimmy was a presentablelooking young man only made him appear viler in her eyes in a word she could hardly have been in less suitable frame of mind to receive graciously any kind of a request from him she would have suspected ulterior motives if he had asked her the time  jimmy did not know this he thought that she eyed him a trifle frostily but he did not attribute this to any suspicion of him he tried to ingratiate himself by smiling pleasantly he could not have made a worse move marsden tukes pleasant smile had been his deadliest weapon under its influence deluded people had trusted him alone with their jewellery and what not  aunt nesta said jimmy i wonder if i might ask you a personal favour  mrs pett shuddered at the glibness with which he brought out the familiar name this was supertuke marsden himself scoundrel as he was could not have called her aunt nesta as smoothly as that  yes she said at last she found it difficult to speak  i happened to meet an old friend of mine this morning he was very sorry for himself it appears thatfor excellent reasons of courseyou had dismissed him i mean jerry mitchell  mrs pett was now absolutely appalled the conspiracy seemed to grow more complicated every moment already its ramifications embraced this man before her a trusted butler and her husbands late physical instructor who could say where it would end she had never liked jerry mitchell but she had never suspected him of being a conspirator yet if this man who called himself jimmy crocker was an old friend of his how could he be anything else  mitchell jimmy went on unconscious of the emotions which his every word was arousing in his hearers bosom told me about what happened yesterday he is very depressed he said he could not think how he happened to behave in such an abominable way he entreated me to put in a word for him with you he begged me to tell you how he regretted the brutal assault and asked me to mention the fact that his record had hitherto been blameless jimmy paused he was getting no encouragement and seemed to be making no impression whatever mrs pett was sitting bolt upright in her chair in a stiffly defensive sort of way she had the appearance of being absolutely untouched by his eloquence in fact he concluded lamely he is very sorry  there was silence for a moment  how do you come to know mitchell asked mrs pett  we knew each other when i was over here working on the chronicle i saw him fight once or twice he is an excellent fellow and used to have a right swing that was a pippini should say extremely excellent brought it up from the floor you know  i strongly object to prizefighters said mrs pett and i was opposed to mitchell coming into the house from the first  you wouldnt let him come back i suppose queried jimmy tentatively  i would not i would not dream of such a thing  hes full of remorse you know  if he has a spark of humanity i have no doubt of it  jimmy paused this thing was not coming out as well as it might have done he feared that for once in her life ann was about to be denied something on which she had set her heart the reflection that this would be extremely good for her competed for precedence in his mind with the reflection that she would probably blame him for the failure which would be unpleasant  he is very fond of ogden really  hm said mrs pett  i think the heat must have made him irritable in his normal state he would not strike a lamb ive known him to do it  do what  not strike lambs  isch said mrs pettthe first time jimmy had ever heard that remarkable monosyllable proceed from human lips he took itrightlyto be intended to convey disapproval scepticism and annoyance he was convinced that this mission was going to be one of his failures  then i may tell him he said that its all right  that what is all right  that he may come back here  certainly not  mrs pett was not a timid woman but she could not restrain a shudder as she watched the plot unfold before her eyes her gratitude towards lord wisbeach at this point in the proceedings almost became heroworship if it had not been for him and his revelations concerning this man before her she would certainly have yielded to the request that jerry mitchell be allowed to return to the house much as she disliked jerry she had been feeling so triumphant at the thought of jimmy crocker coming to her in spite of his stepmothers wishes and so pleased at having unexpectedly got her own way that she could have denied him nothing that he might have cared to ask but now it was as if herself unseen she were looking on at a gang of conspirators hatching some plot she was in the strong strategic position of the person who is apparently deceived but who in reality knows all  for a moment she considered the question of admitting jerry to the house evidently his presence was necessary to the consummation of the plot whatever it might be and it occurred to her that it might be as well on the principle of giving the schemers enough rope to hang themselves with to let him come back and play his part then she reflected that with the selfstyled jimmy crocker as well as the fraudulent skinner in the house lord wisbeach and the detective would have their hands quite full enough it would be foolish to complicate matters she glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece mr sturgis would be arriving soon if he had really started at once from his office as he had promised she drew comfort from the imminence of his coming it would be pleasant to put herself in the hands of an expert  jimmy had paused midway to the door and was standing there as if reluctant to accept her answer to his plea  it would never occur again what happened yesterday i mean you need not be afraid of that  i am not afraid of that responded mrs pett tartly  if you had seen him when i did  when did you you landed from the boat this morning you went to mr petts office and then came straight up here with him i am interested to know when you did see mitchell  she regretted this thrust a little for she felt it might put the man on his guard by showing that she suspected something but she could not resist it and it pleased her to see that her companion was momentarily confused  i met him when i was going for my luggage said jimmy  it was just the way marsden tuke would have got out of it tuke was always wriggling out of corners like that mrs petts horror of jimmy grew  i told him of course said jimmy that you had very kindly invited me to stay with you and he told me all about his trouble and implored me to plead for him if you had seen him when i did all gloom and repentance you would have been sorry for him your womans heart  whatever jimmy was about to say regarding mrs petts womans heart was interrupted by the opening of the door and the deep respectful voice of mr crocker  mr sturgis  the detective entered briskly as if time were money with himas indeed it was for the international detective agency of which he was the proprietor did a thriving business he was a gaunt hungrylooking man of about fifty with sunken eyes and thin lips it was his habit to dress in the height of fashion for one of his favourite axioms was that a man might be a detective and still look a gentleman and his appearance was that of the individual usually described as a popular clubman that is to say he looked like a floorwalker taking a sunday stroll his prosperous exterior deceived jimmy satisfactorily and the latter left the room little thinking that the visitor was anything but an ordinary caller  the detective glanced keenly at him as he passed he made a practice of glancing keenly at nearly everything it cost nothing and impressed clients  i am so glad you have come mr sturgis said mrs pett wont you sit down  mr sturgis sat down pulled up the knees of his trousers that halfinch which keeps them from bagging and so preserves the gentlemanliness of the appearance and glanced keenly at mrs pett  who was that young man who just went out  it is about him that i wished to consult you mr sturgis  mr sturgis leaned back and placed the tips of his fingers together  tell me how he comes to be here  he pretends that he is my nephew james crocker  your nephew have you never seen your nephew  never i ought to tell you that a few years ago my sister married for the second time i disapproved of the marriage and refused to see her husband or his sonhe was a widower a few weeks ago for private reasons i went over to england where they are living and asked my sister to let the boy come here to work in my husbands office she refused and my husband and i returned to new york this morning i was astonished to get a telephone call from mr pett from his office to say that james crocker had unexpectedly arrived after all and was then at the office they came up here and the young man seemed quite genuine indeed he had an offensive jocularity which would be quite in keeping with the character of the real james crocker from what i have heard of him  mr sturgis nodded  know what you mean saw that thing in the paper he said briefly yes  now it is very curious but almost from the start i was uneasy when i say that the young man seemed genuine i mean that he completely deceived my husband and my niece who lives with us but i had reasons which i need not go into now for being on my guard and i was suspicious what aroused my suspicion was the fact that my husband thought that he remembered this young man as a fellowtraveller of ours on the atlantic on our return voyage while he claimed to have landed that morning on the caronia  you are certain of that mrs pett he stated positively that he had landed this morning  yes quite positively unfortunately i myself had no chance of judging the truth of what he said as i am such a bad sailor that i was seldom out of my stateroom from beginning to end of the voyage however as i say i was suspicious i did not see how i could confirm my suspicions until i remembered that my new butler skinner had come straight from my sisters house  that is the man who just admitted me  exactly he entered my employment only a few days ago having come direct from london i decided to wait until skinner should meet this young man of course when he first came into the house he was with my husband who opened the door with his key so that they did not meet then  i understand said mr sturgis glancing keenly at the dog aida who had risen and was sniffing at his ankles you thought that if skinner recognised this young man it would be proof of his identity  exactly  did he recognise him  yes but wait i have not finished he recognised him and for the moment i was satisfied but i had had my suspicions of skinner too i ought to tell you that i had been warned against him by a great friend of mine lord wisbeach an english peer whom we have known intimately for a very long time he is one of the shropshire wisbeaches you know  no doubt said mr sturgis  lord wisbeach used to be intimate with the real jimmy crocker he came to lunch today and met this impostor he pretended to recognise him in order to put him off his guard but after lunch he came to me here and told me that in reality he had never seen him before in his life and that whoever else he might be he was certainly not james crocker my nephew  she broke off and looked at mr sturgis expectantly the detective smiled a quiet smile  and even that is not all there is another thing mr pett used to employ as a physical instructor a man named jerry mitchell yesterday i dismissed him for reasons it is not necessary to go into todayjust as you arrived in factthe man who calls himself jimmy crocker was begging me to allow mitchell to return to the house and resume his work here does that not strike you as suspicious mr sturgis  the detective closed his eyes and smiled his quiet smile again he opened his eyes and fixed them on mrs pett  as pretty a case as i have come across in years he said mrs pett let me tell you something it is one of my peculiarities that i never forget a face you say that this young man pretends to have landed this morning from the caronia well i saw him myself more than a week ago in a broadway cafe  you did  talking tojerry mitchell i know mitchell well by sight  mrs pett uttered an exclamation  and this butler of yoursskinner shall i tell you something about him you perhaps know that when the big detective agencies andersons and the others are approached in the matter of tracing a man who is wanted for anything they sometimes ask the smaller agencies like my own to work in with them it saves time and widens the field of operations we are very glad to do andersons service and andersons are big enough to be able to afford to let us do it now a few days ago a friend of mine in andersons came to me with a sheaf of photographs which had been sent to them from london whether some private client in london or from scotland yard i do not know nor do i know why the original of the photograph was wanted but andersons had been asked to trace him and make a report my peculiar gift for remembering faces has enabled me to oblige the anderson people once or twice before in this way i studied the photographs very carefully and kept two of them for reference i have one with me now he felt in his pockets do you recognise it  mrs pett stared at the photograph it was the presentment of a stout goodhumoured man of middleage whose solemn gaze dwelt on the middle distance in that fixed way which a man achieves only in photographs  skinner  exactly said mr sturgis taking the photograph from her and putting it back in his pocket i recognised him directly he opened the door to me  butbut i am almost certain that skinner is the man who let me in when i called on my sister in london  almost repeated the detective did you observe him very closely  no i suppose i did not  the type is a very common one it would be very easy indeed for a clever crook to make himself up as your sisters butler closely enough to deceive any one who had only seen the original once and for a short time then what their game is i could not say at present but taking everything into consideration there can be no doubt whatever that the man who calls himself your nephew and the man who calls himself your sisters butler are working together and that jerry mitchell is working in with them as i say i cannot tell you what they are after at present but there is no doubt that your unexpected dismissal of mitchell must have upset their plans that would account for the eagerness to get him back into the house again  lord wisbeach thought that they were trying to steal my nephews explosive perhaps you have read in the papers that my nephew willie partridge has completed an explosive which is more powerful than any at present known his fatheryou have heard of him of coursedwight partridge  mr sturgis nodded  his father was working on it at the time of his death and willie has gone on with his experiments where he left off today at lunch he showed us a testtube full of the explosive he put it in my husbands safe in the library lord wisbeach is convinced that these scoundrels are trying to steal this but i cannot help feeling that this is another of those attempts to kidnap my son ogden what do you think  it is impossible to say at this stage of the proceedings all we can tell is that there is some plot going on you refused of course to allow mitchell to come back to the house  yes you think that was wise  undoubtedly if his absence did not handicap them they would not be so anxious to have him on the spot  what shall we do  you wish me to undertake the case  of course  mr sturgis frowned thoughtfully  it would be useless for me to come here myself by bad luck the man who pretends to be your nephew has seen me if i were to come to stay here he would suspect something he would be on his guard he pondered with closed eyes miss trimble he exclaimed  i beg your pardon  you want miss trimble she is the smartest worker in my office this is precisely the type of case she could handle to perfection  a woman said mrs pett doubtfully  a woman in a thousand said mr sturgis a woman in a million  but physically would a woman be  miss trimble knows more about jiujitsu than the japanese professor who taught her at one time she was a strong woman in smalltime vaudeville she is an expert revolvershot i am not worrying about miss trimbles capacity to do the work i am only wondering in what capacity it would be best for her to enter the house have you a vacancy for a parlourmaid  i could make one  do so at once miss trimble is at her best as a parlourmaid she handled the marling divorce case in that capacity have you a telephone in the room  mrs pett opened the stuffed owl the detective got in touch with his office  mr sturgis speaking tell miss trimble to come to the phone    miss trimble i am speaking from mrs petts on riverside drive you know the house i want you to come up at once take a taxi go to the backdoor and ask to see mrs pett say you have come about getting a place here as a maid understand right say listen miss trimble hello yes dont hang up for a moment do you remember those photographs i showed you yesterday yes the photographs from andersons ive found the man hes the butler here take a look at him when you get to the house now go and get a taxi mrs pett will explain everything when you arrive he hung up the receiver i think i had better go now mrs pett it would not do for me to be here while these fellows are on their guard i can safely leave the matter to miss trimble i wish you good afternoon  after he had gone mrs pett vainly endeavoured to interest herself again in her book but in competition with the sensations of life fiction even though she had written it herself had lost its power and grip it seemed to her that miss trimble must be walking to the house instead of journeying thither in a taxicab but a glance at the clock assured her that only five minutes had elapsed since the detectives departure she went to the window and looked out she was hopelessly restless  at last a taxicab stopped at the corner and a young woman got out and walked towards the house if this were miss trimble she certainly looked capable she was a stumpy squareshouldered person and even at that distance it was possible to perceive that she had a face of no common shrewdness and determination the next moment she had turned down the sidestreet in the direction of the backpremises of mrs petts house and a few minutes later mr crocker presented himself  a young person wishes to see you madam a young person of the name of trimble a pang passed through mrs pett as she listened to his measured tones it was tragic that so perfect a butler should be a scoundrel she says that you desired her to call in connection with a situation  show her up here skinner she is the new parlourmaid i will send her down to you when i have finished speaking to her  very good madam  there seemed to mrs pett to be a faint touch of defiance in miss trimbles manner as she entered the room the fact was that miss trimble held strong views on the equal distribution of property and rich peoples houses always affected her adversely mr crocker retired closing the door gently behind him  a meaning sniff proceeded from mrs petts visitor as she looked round at the achievements of the interior decorator who had lavished his art unsparingly in this particular room at this close range she more than fulfilled the promise of that distant view which mrs pett had had of her from the window her face was not only shrewd and determined it was menacing she had thick eyebrows from beneath which small glittering eyes looked out like dangerous beasts in undergrowth and the impressive effect of these was accentuated by the fact that while the left eye looked straight out at its object the right eye had a sort of roving commission and was now while its colleague fixed mrs pett with a gimlet stare examining the ceiling as to the rest of the appearance of this remarkable woman her nose was stubby and aggressive and her mouth had the coldly forbidding look of the closed door of a subway express when you have just missed the train it bade you keep your distance on pain of injury mrs pett though herself a strong woman was conscious of a curious weakness as she looked at a female of the species so much deadlier than any male whom she had ever encountered and came near feeling a halfpity for the unhappy wretches on whom this dynamic maiden was to be unleashed she hardly knew how to open the conversation  miss trimble however was equal to the occasion she always preferred to open conversations herself her lips parted and words flew out as if shot from a machinegun as far as mrs pett could observe she considered it unnecessary to part her teeth preferring to speak with them clenched this gave an additional touch of menace to her speech  dafternoon said miss trimble and mrs pett backed convulsively into the padded recesses of her chair feeling as if somebody had thrown a brick at her  good afternoon she said faintly  gladda meecher siz pett mr sturge semme up said yad job fr me came here squick scould  i beg your pardon  squick scould got slow taxi  oh yes  miss trimbles right eye flashed about the room like a searchlight but she kept the other hypnotically on her companions face  whass trouble the right eye rested for a moment on a magnificent corot over the mantelpiece and she snifted again not sprised yhave trouble all rich people ve trouble noth tdo with their time cept get nto trouble  she frowned disapprovingly at a canaletto  youahappear to dislike the rich said mrs pett as nearly in her grand manner as she could contrive  miss trimble bowled over the grand manner as if it had been a small fowl and she an automobile she rolled over it and squashed it flat  hate em sogelist  i beg your pardon said mrs pett humbly this woman was beginning to oppress her to an almost unbelievable extent  sogelist no use fr idle rich ev read bnard shaw huh or upton sinclair uh readm make ythink a bit well yhavent told me whasser trouble  mrs pett was by this time heartily regretting the impulse which had caused her to telephone to mr sturgis in a career which had had more than its share of detectives both real and fictitious she had never been confronted with a detective like this the galling thing was that she was helpless after all one engaged a detective for his or her shrewdness and efficiency not for suavity and polish a detective who hurls speech at you through clenched teeth and yet detects is better value for the money than one who though an ideal companion for the drawingroom is incompetent and mrs pett like most other people subconsciously held the view that the ruder a person is the more efficient he must be it is but rarely that any one is found who is not dazzled by the glamour of incivility she crushed down her resentment at her visitors tone and tried to concentrate her mind on the fact that this was a business matter and that what she wanted was results rather than fair words she found it easier to do this when looking at the others face it was a capable face not beautiful perhaps but full of promise of action miss trimble having ceased temporarily to speak her mouth was in repose and when her mouth was in repose it looked more efficient than anything else of its size in existence  i want you said mrs pett to come here and watch some men  men thought so wh theres trouble always ment bottomf it  you do not like men  hate em suffgist she looked penetratingly at mrs pett her left eye seemed to pounce out from under its tangled brow you sporter of th cause  mrs pett was an antisuffragist but though she held strong opinions nothing would have induced her to air them at that moment her whole being quailed at the prospect of arguing with this woman she returned hurriedly to the main theme  a young man arrived here this morning pretending to be my nephew james crocker he is an impostor i want you to watch him very carefully  whassiz game  i do not know personally i think he is here to kidnap my son ogden  ill fixm said the fair trimble confidently say that butler f yours hes a crook  mrs pett opened her eyes this woman was manifestly competent at her work  have you found that out already  drectly saw him miss trimble opened her purse go one f his photographs here brought it from office hes th man thats wanted ll right  mr sturgis and i both think he is working with the other man the one who pretends to be my nephew  sure ill fix m  she returned the photograph to her purse and snapped the catch with vicious emphasis  there is another possibility said mrs pett my nephew mr william partridge had invented a wonderful explosive and it is quite likely that these men are here to try to steal it  sure menll do anything if y put all the men in th world in th cooler wouldnt be ny more crime  she glowered at the dog aida who had risen from the basket and removing the last remains of sleep from her system by a series of calisthenics of her own invention as if she suspected her of masculinity mrs pett could not help wondering what tragedy in the dim past had caused this hatred of males on the part of her visitor miss trimble had not the appearance of one who would lightly be deceived by man still less the appearance of one whom man unless shortsighted and extraordinarily susceptible would go out of his way to deceive she was still turning this mystery over in her mind when her visitor spoke  well gimme th rest of th dope said miss trimble  i beg your pardon  more facts spill m  oh i understand said mrs pett hastily and embarked on a brief narrative of the suspicious circumstances which had caused her to desire skilled assistance  lor wsbeach said miss trimble breaking the story whos he  a very great friend of ours  you vouch fr him persnlly hes all right uh not a crook huh  of course he is not said mrs pett indignantly hes a great friend of mine  all right well i guess thass bout all huh ill be going downstairs an starting in  you can come here immediately  sure got parlourmaid rig round at m boardinghouse round corner come back with it n ten minutes same dress i used when i ws working on th marling dvorce case djer know th marlings idle rich bound t get nto trouble i fixed m well gbye mus be going no time t waste  mrs pett leaned back faintly in her chair she felt overcome  downstairs on her way out miss trimble had paused in the hall to inspect a fine statue which stood at the foot of the stairs it was a noble work of art but it seemed to displease her she snorted  idle rich she muttered scornfully brrh  the portly form of mr crocker loomed up from the direction of the back stairs she fixed her left eye on him piercingly mr crocker met it and quailed he had that consciousness of guilt which philosophers tell is the worst drawback to crime why this womans gaze should disturb him so thoroughly he could not have said she was a perfect stranger to him she could know nothing about him yet he quailed  say said miss trimble im cming here s parlourmaid  oh ah said mr crocker feebly  grrrh observed miss trimble and departed    chapter xviii  the voice prom the past  the library whither jimmy had made his way after leaving mrs pett was a large room on the ground floor looking out on the street which ran parallel to the south side of the house it had french windows opening onto a strip of lawn which ended in a high stone wall with a small gate in it the general effect of these things being to create a resemblance to a country house rather than to one in the centre of the city mr petts town residence was full of these surprises  in one corner of the room a massive safe had been let into the wall striking a note of incongruity for the remainder of the wallspace was completely covered with volumes of all sorts and sizes which filled the shelves and overflowed into a small gallery reached by a short flight of stairs and running along the north side of the room over the door  jimmy cast a glance at the safe behind the steel doors of which he presumed the testtube of partridgite which willie had carried from the luncheontable lay hid then transferred his attention to the shelves a cursory inspection of these revealed nothing which gave promise of whiling away entertainingly the moments which must elapse before the return of ann jimmys tastes in literature lay in the direction of the lighter kind of modern fiction and mr pett did not appear to possess a single volume that had been written later than the eighteenth centuryand mostly poetry at that he turned to the writingdesk near the window on which he had caught sight of a standing shelf full of books of a more modern aspect he picked one up at random and opened it  he threw it down disgustedly it was poetry this man pett appeared to have a perfect obsession for poetry one would never have suspected it to look at him jimmy had just resigned himself after another glance at the shelf to a bookless vigil when his eye was caught by a name on the cover of the last in the row so unexpected that he had to look again to verify the discovery  he had been perfectly right there it was in gold letters                  the lonely heart                        by                    ann chester  he extracted the volume from the shelf in a sort of stupor even now he was inclined to give his goddess of the red hair the benefit of the doubt and assume that some one else of the same name had written it for it was a defect in jimmys characterone of his many defectsthat he loathed and scorned minor poetry and considered minor poets especially when feminine an unnecessary affliction he declined to believe that ann his ann a girl full of the finest traits of character the girl who had been capable of encouraging a comparative stranger to break the law by impersonating her cousin jimmy crocker could also be capable of writing the lonely heart and other poems he skimmed through the first one he came across and shuddered it was pure slush it was the sort of stuff they filled up pages with in the magazines when the detective story did not run long enough it was the sort of stuff which longhaired blighters read alone to other longhaired blighters in english suburban drawingrooms it was the sort of stuff whichto be briefgave him the willies no it could not be ann who had written it  the next moment the horrid truth was thrust upon him there was an inscription on the title page  to my dearest uncle peter with love from the author ann chester  the room seemed to reel before jimmys eyes he felt as if a friend had wounded him in his tenderest feelings he felt as if some loved one had smitten him over the back of the head with a sandbag for one moment in which time stood still his devotion to ann wobbled it was as if he had found her out in some terrible crime that revealed unsuspected flaws in her hitherto ideal character  then his eye fell upon the date on the title page and a strong spasm of relief shook him the clouds rolled away and he loved her still this frightful volume had been published five years ago  a wave of pity swept over jimmy he did not blame her now she had been a mere child five years ago scarcely old enough to distinguish right from wrong you couldnt blame her for writing sentimental verse at that age why at a similar stage in his own career he had wanted to be a vaudeville singer everything must be excused to youth it was with a tender glow of affectionate forgiveness that he turned the pages  as he did so a curious thing happened to him he began to have that feeling which every one has experienced at some time or other that he had done this very thing before he was almost convinced that this was not the first time he had seen that poem on page twentyseven entitled a lament why some of the lines seemed extraordinarily familiar the people who understood these things explained this phenomenon he believed by some stuff about the cells of the brain working simultaneously or something something about cells anyway he supposed that that must be it  but that was not it the feeling that he had read all this before grew instead of vanishing as is generally the way on these occasions he had read this stuff before he was certain of it but when and where and above all why surely he had not done it from choice  it was the total impossibility of his having done it from choice that led his memory in the right direction there had only been a year or so in his life when he had been obliged to read things which he would not have read of his own free will and that had been when he worked on the chronicle could it have been that they had given him this book of poems to review or  and then memory in its usual eccentric way having taken all this time to make the first part of the journey finished the rest of it with one lightning swoop and he knew  and with the illumination came dismay worse than dismay horror  gosh said jimmy  he knew now why he had thought on the occasion of their first meeting in london that he had seen hair like anns before the mists rolled away and he saw everything clear and stark he knew what had happened at that meeting five years before to which she had so mysteriously alluded he knew what she had meant that evening on the boat when she had charged one jimmy crocker with having cured her of sentiment a cold sweat sprang into being about his temples he could remember that interview now as clearly as if it had happened five minutes ago instead of five years he could recall the article for the sunday chronicle which he had written from the interview and the ghoulish gusto with which he had written it he had had a boys undisciplined sense of humour in those days the sense of humour which riots like a young colt careless of what it bruises and crushes he shuddered at the recollection of the things he had hammered out so gleefully on his typewriter down at the chronicle office he found himself recoiling in disgust from the man he had been the man who could have done a wanton thing like that without compunction or ruth he had read extracts from the article to an appreciative colleague     a great sympathy for ann welled up in him no wonder she hated the memory of jimmy crocker  it is probable that remorse would have tortured him even further had he not chanced to turn absently to page fortysix and read a poem entitled loves funeral it was not a long poem and he had finished it inside of two minutes but by that time a change had come upon his mood of selfloathing he no longer felt like a particularly mean murderer loves funeral was like a tonic it braced and invigourated him it was so unspeakably absurd so poor in every respect all things he now perceived had worked together for good ann had admitted on the boat that it was his satire that had crushed out of her the fondness for this sort of thing if that was so then the part he had played in her life had been that of a rescuer he thought of her as she was now and as she must have been then to have written stuff like this and he rejoiced at what he had done in a manner of speaking the ann of today the glorious creature who went about the place kidnapping ogdens was his handiwork it was he who had destroyed the minor poetry virus in her  the refrain of an old song came to him          you made me what i am today          i hope youre satisfied  he was more than satisfied he was proud of himself  he rejoiced however after the first flush of enthusiasm somewhat moderately there was no disguising the penalty of his deed of kindness to ann jimmy crocker was no rescuer but a sort of blend of ogre and vampire she must never learn his real identityor not until he had succeeded by assiduous toil as he hoped he would in neutralising that prejudice of the distant past  a footstep outside broke in on his thoughts he thrust the book quickly back into its place ann came in and shut the door behind her  well she said eagerly  jimmy did not reply for a moment he was looking at her and thinking how perfect in every way she was now as she stood there purged of sentimentality all aglow with curiosity to know how her nefarious plans had succeeded it was his ann who stood there not the author of the lonely heart  did you ask her  yes but  anns face fell  oh she wont let him come back  she absolutely refused i did my best  i know you did  there was a silence  well this settles it said jimmy now you will have to let me help you  ann looked troubled  but its such a risk something terrible might happen to you isnt impersonation a criminal offence  what does it matter they tell me prisons are excellent places nowadays concerts picnicsall that sort of thing i shant mind going there i have a nice singingvoice i think i will try to make the gleeclub  i suppose we are breaking the law said ann seriously i told jerry that nothing could happen to us except the loss of his place to him and being sent to my grandmother to me but im bound to say i said that just to encourage him dont you think we ought to know what the penalty is in case we are caught  it would enable us to make our plans if its a life sentence i shouldnt worry about selecting my future career  you see explained ann i suppose they would hardly send me to prison as im a relationthough i would far rather go there than to grandmothers she lives all alone miles away in the country and is strong on disciplinebut they might do all sorts of things to you in spite of my pleadings i really think you had better give up the idea im afraid my enthusiasm carried me away i didnt think of all this before  never this thing goes through or fails over my dead body what are you looking for  ann was deep in a bulky volume which stood on a lectern by the window  catalogue she said briefly turning the pages uncle peter has heaps of law books ill look up kidnapping here we are law encyclopedia shelf x oh thats upstairs i shant be a minute  she ran to the little staircase and disappeared her voice came from the gallery  here we are ive got it  shoot said jimmy  theres such a lot of it called the voice from above pages and pages im just skimming wait a moment  a rustling followed from the gallery then a sneeze  this is the dustiest place i was ever in said the voice its inches deep everywhere its full of cigarette ends too i must tell uncle oh here it is kidnappingpenalties  hush called jimmy theres some one coming  the door opened  hello said ogden strolling in i was looking for you didnt think you would be here  come right in my little man and make yourself at home said jimmy  ogden eyed him with disfavour  youre pretty fresh arent you  this is praise from sir hubert stanley  eh whos he  oh a gentleman who knew what was what  ogden closed the door  well i know whats what too i know what you are for one thing he chuckled ive got your number all right  in what respect  another chuckle proceeded from the bulbous boy  you think youre smooth dont you but im onto you jimmy crocker a lot of jimmy crocker you are youre a crook get me and i know what youre after at that youre going to try to kidnap me  from the corner of his eye jimmy was aware of anns startled face looking over the gallery rail and withdrawn hastily no sound came from the heights but he knew that she was listening intently  what makes you think that  ogden lowered himself into the depths of his favourite easy chair and putting his feet restfully on the writingdesk met jimmys gaze with a glassy but knowing eye  got a cigarette he said  i have not said jimmy im sorry  so am i  returning with your permission to our original subject said jimmy what makes you think that i have come here to kidnap you  ogden yawned  i was in the drawingroom after lunch and that guy lord wisbeach came in and said he wanted to talk to mother privately mother sent me out of the room so of course i listened at the door  do you know where little boys go who listen to private conversations said jimmy severely  to the witnessstand generally i guess well i listened and i heard this lord wisbeach tell mother that he had only pretended to recognise you as jimmy crocker and that really he had never seen you before in his life he said you were a crook and that they had got to watch you well i knew then why you had come here it was pretty smooth getting in the way you did ive got to hand it to you  jimmy did not reply his mind was occupied with the contemplation of this dashing counterstroke on the part of gentleman jack he could hardly refrain from admiring the simple strategy with which the latter had circumvented him there was an artistry about the move which compelled respect  well now see here said ogden you and i have got to get together on this proposition ive been kidnapped twice before and the only guys that made anything out of it were the kidnappers its pretty soft for them they couldnt have got a cent without me and they never dreamed of giving me a rakeoff im getting good and tired of being kidnapped for other peoples benefit and ive made up my mind that the next guy that wants me has got to come across see my proposition is fiftyfifty if you like it im game to let you go ahead if you dont like it then the deals off and youll find that youve a darned poor chance of getting me when i was kidnapped before i was just a kid but i can look after myself now well what do you say  jimmy found it hard at first to say anything he had never properly understood the possibilities of ogdens character before the longer he contemplated him the more admirable anns scheme appeared it seemed to him that only a resolute keeper of a home for dogs would be adequately equipped for dealing with this remarkable youth  this is a commercial age he said  you bet it is said ogden my middle name is business say are you working this on your own or are you in with buck maginnis and his crowd  i dont think i know mr maginnis  hes the guy who kidnapped me the first time hes a roughneck smooth sam fisher got away with me the second time maybe youre in with sam  no  no i guess not i heard that he had married and retired from business i rather wish you were one of bucks lot i like buck when he kidnapped me i lived with him and he gave me a swell time when i left him a woman came and interviewed me about it for one of the sunday papers sob stuff called the piece even kidnappers have tender hearts beneath a rough exterior ive got it upstairs in my pressclipping album it was pretty bad slush buck maginnis hasnt got any tender heart beneath his rough exterior but hes a good sort and i liked him we used to shoot craps and he taught me to chew id be tickled to death to have buck get me again but if youre working on your own all right its all the same to me provided you meet me on the terms  you certainly are a fascinating child  less of it less of it ive troubles enough to bear without having you getting fresh well what about it talk figures if i let you take me away do we divvy up or dont we thats all youve got to say  thats easily settled ill certainly give you half of whatever i get  ogden looked wistfully at the writingdesk  i wish i could have that in writing but i guess it wouldnt stand in law i suppose i shall have to trust you  honour among thieves  less of the thieves this is just a straight business proposition ive got something valuable to sell and im darned if im going to keep giving it away ive been too easy i ought to have thought of this before all right then thats settled now its up to you you can think out the rest of it yourself  he heaved himself out of the chair and left the room ann coming down from the gallery found jimmy meditating he looked up at the sound of her step  well that seems to make it pretty easy for us doesnt it he said it solves the problem of ways and means  but this is awful this alters everything it isnt safe for you to stay here you must go away at once theyve found you out you may be arrested at any moment  thats a sideissue the main point is to put this thing through then we can think about what is going to happen to me  but cant you see the risk youre running  i dont mind i want to help you  i wont let you  you must  but do be sensible what would you think of me if i allowed you to face this danger  i wouldnt think any differently of you my opinion of you is a fixed thing nothing can alter it i tried to tell you on the boat but you wouldnt let me i think youre the most perfect wonderful girl in all the world ive loved you since the first moment i saw you i knew who you were when we met for half a minute that day in london we were utter strangers but i knew you you were the girl i had been looking for all my life good heavens you talk of risks cant you understand that just being with you and speaking to you and knowing that we share this thing together is enough to wipe out any thought of risk id do anything for you and you expect me to back out of this thing because there is a certain amount of danger  ann had retreated to the door and was looking at him with wide eyes with other young men and there had been manywho had said much the same sort of thing to her since her debutante days she had been cool and composeda little sorry perhaps but in no doubt as to her own feelings and her ability to resist their pleadings but now her heart was racing and the conviction had begun to steal over her that the cool and composed ann chester was in imminent danger of making a fool of herself quite suddenly without any sort of warning she realised that there was some quality in jimmy which called aloud to some corresponding quality in herselfa nebulous something that made her know that he and she were mates she knew herself hard to please where men were concerned she could not have described what it was in her that all the men she had met the men with whom she had golfed and ridden and yachted had failed to satisfy but ever since she had acquired the power of selfanalysis she had known that it was something which was a solid and indestructible part of her composition she could not have put into words what quality she demanded in man but she had always known that she would recognise it when she found it and she recognised it now in jimmy it was a recklessness an irresponsibility a cheerful daredevilry the complement to her own gay lawlessness  ann said jimmy  its too late  she had not meant to say that she had meant to say that it was impossible out of the question but her heart was running away with her goaded on by the irony of it all a veil seemed to have fallen from before her eyes and she knew now why she had been drawn to jimmy from the very first they were mates and she had thrown away her happiness  ive promised to marry lord wisbeach  jimmy stopped dead as if the blow had been a physical one  youve promised to marry lord wisbeach  yes  butbut when  just now only a few minutes ago when i was driving him to his hotel he had asked me to marry him before i left for england and i had promised to give him his answer when i got back but when i got back somehow i couldnt make up my mind the days slipped by something seemed to be holding me back he pressed me to say that i would marry him and it seemed absurd to go on refusing to be definite so i said i would  you cant love him surely you dont  ann met his gaze frankly  something seems to have happened to me in the last few minutes she said and i cant think clearly a little while ago it didnt seem to matter much i liked him he was goodlooking and goodtempered i felt that we should get along quite well and be as happy as most people are that seemed as near perfection as one could expect to get nowadays sowell thats how it was  but you cant marry him its out of the question  ive promised  you must break your promise  i cant do that  you must  i cant one must play the game  jimmy groped for words but in this case you mustntits awfulin this special case he broke off he saw the trap he was in he could not denounce that crook without exposing himself and from that he still shrank anns prejudice against jimmy crocker might have its root in a trivial and absurd grievance but it had been growing through the years and who could say how strong it was now  ann came a step towards him then paused doubtfully then as if making up her mind she drew near and touched his sleeve  im sorry she said  there was a silence  im sorry  she moved away the door closed softly behind her jimmy scarcely knew that she had gone he sat down in that deep chair which was mr petts favourite and stared sightlessly at the ceiling and then how many minutes or hours later he did not know the sharp click of the doorhandle roused him he sprang from the chair was it ann come back  it was not ann round the edge of the door came inquiringly the fair head of lord wisbeach  oh said his lordship sighting jimmy  the head withdrew itself  come here shouted jimmy  the head appeared again  talking to me  yes i was talking to you  lord wisbeach followed his superstructure into the room he was outwardly all that was bland and unperturbed but there was a wary look in the eye that cocked itself at jimmy and he did not move far from the door his fingers rested easily on the handle behind him he did not think it probable that jimmy could have heard of his visit to mrs pett but there had been something menacing in the latters voice and he believed in safety first  they told me miss chester was here he said by way of relaxing any possible strain there might be in the situation  and what the devil do you want with miss chester you slimy crawling secondstoryworker you damned oily yegg enquired jimmy  the sunniest optimist could not have deluded himself into the belief that the words were spoken in a friendly and genial spirit lord wisbeachs fingers tightened on the doorhandle and he grew a little flushed about the cheekbones  whats all this about he said  you infernal crook  lord wisbeach looked anxious  dont shout like that are you crazy do you want people to hear  jimmy drew a deep breath  i shall have to get further away from you he said more quietly theres no knowing what may happen if i dont i dont want to kill you at least i do but i had better not  he retired slowly until brought to a halt by the writingdesk to this he anchored himself with a firm grip he was extremely anxious to do nothing rash and the spectacle of gentleman jack invited rashness he leaned against the desk clutching its solidity with both hands lord wisbeach held steadfastly to the doorhandle and in this tense fashion the interview proceeded  miss chester said jimmy forcing himself to speak calmly has just been telling me that she has promised to marry you  quite true said lord wisbeach it will be announced tomorrow a remark trembled on his lips to the effect that he relied on jimmy for a fishslice but prudence kept it unspoken he was unable at present to understand jimmys emotion why jimmy should object to his being engaged to ann he could not imagine but it was plain that for some reason he had taken the thing to heart and dearly as he loved a bit of quiet fun lord wisbeach decided that the other was at least six inches too tall and fifty pounds too heavy to be bantered in his present mood by one of his own physique why not  it wont be announced tomorrow said jimmy because by tomorrow you will be as far away from here as you can get if you have any sense  what do you mean  just this if you havent left this house by breakfast time tomorrow i shall expose you  lord wisbeach was not feeling particularly happy but he laughed at this  you  thats what i said  who do you think you are to go about exposing people  i happen to be mrs petts nephew jimmy crocker  lord wisbeach laughed again  is that the line you are going to take  it is  you are going to mrs pett to tell her that you are jimmy crocker and that i am a crook and that you only pretended to recognise me for reasons of your own  just that  forget it lord wisbeach had forgotten to be alarmed in his amusement he smiled broadly im not saying its not good stuff to pull but its old stuff now im sorry for you but i thought of it before you did i went to mrs pett directly after lunch and sprang that line of talk myself do you think shell believe you after that i tell you im acehigh with that dame you cant queer me with her  i think i can for the simple reason that i really am jimmy crocker  yes you are  exactly yes i am  lord wisbeach smiled tolerantly  it was worth trying the bluff i guess but it wont work i know youd be glad to get me out of this house but youve got to make a better play than that to do it  dont deceive yourself with the idea that im bluffing look here he suddenly removed his coat and threw it to lord wisbeach read the tailors label inside the pocket see the name also the address j crocker drexdale house grosvenor square london  lord wisbeach picked up the garment and looked as directed his face turned a little sallower but he still fought against his growing conviction  thats no proof  perhaps not but when you consider the reputation of the tailor whose name is on the label its hardly likely that he would be standing in with an impostor is it if you want real proof i have no doubt that there are half a dozen men working on the chronicle who can identify me or are you convinced already  lord wisbeach capitulated  i dont know what fool game you think youre playing but i cant see why you couldnt have told me this when we were talking after lunch  never mind i had my reasons they dont matter what matters is that you are going to get out of here tomorrow do you understand that  i get you  then thats about all i think dont let me keep you  say listen gentleman jacks voice was plaintive i think you might give a fellow a chance to get out good give me time to have a guy in montreal send me a telegram telling me to go up there right away otherwise you might just as well put the cops on me at once the old lady knows ive got business in canada you dont need to be rough on a fellow  jimmy pondered this point  all right i dont object to that  thanks  dont start anything though  i dont know what you mean  jimmy pointed to the safe  come come friend of my youth we have no secrets from each other i know youre after whats in there and you know that i know i dont want to harp on it but youll be spending tonight in the house and i think you had better make up your mind to spend it in your room getting a nice sleep to prepare you for your journey do you follow me old friend  i get you  that will be all then i think wind a smile around your neck and recede  the door slammed lord wisbeach had restrained his feelings successfully during the interview but he could not deny himself that slight expression of them jimmy crossed the room and took his coat from the chair where the other had dropped it as he did so a voice spoke  say  jimmy spun round the room was apparently empty the thing was beginning to assume an uncanny aspect when the voice spoke again  you think youre darned funny dont you  it came from above jimmy had forgotten the gallery he directed his gaze thither and perceived the heavy face of ogden hanging over the rail like a gargoyle  what are you doing there he demanded  listening  how did you get there  theres a door back here that you get to from the stairs i often come here for a quiet cigarette say you think yourself some josher dont you telling me you were a kidnapper you strung me like an onion so youre really jimmy crocker after all where was the sense in pulling all that stuff about taking me away and divvying up the ransom aw you make me tired  the head was withdrawn and jimmy heard heavy steps followed by the banging of a door peace reigned in the library  jimmy sat down in the chair which was mr petts favourite and which ogden was accustomed to occupy to that gentlemans displeasure the swiftness of recent events had left him a little dizzy and he desired to think matters over and find out exactly what had happened  the only point which appeared absolutely clear to him in a welter of confusing occurrences was the fact that he had lost the chance of kidnapping ogden everything had arranged itself so beautifully simply and conveniently as regarded that venture until a moment ago but now that the boy had discovered his identity it was impossible for him to attempt it he was loth to accept this fact surely even now there was a way     quite suddenly an admirable plan occurred to him it involved the cooperation of his father and at that thought he realised with a start that life had been moving so rapidly for him since his return to the house that he had not paid any attention at all to what was really as amazing a mystery as any he had been too busy to wonder why his father was there  he debated the best method of getting in touch with him it was out of the question to descend to the pantry or wherever it was that his father lived in this new incarnation of his then the happy thought struck him that results might be obtained by the simple process of ringing the bell it might produce some other unit of the domestic staff however it was worth trying he rang the bell  a few moments later the door opened jimmy looked up it was not his father it was a dangerouslooking female of uncertain age dressed as a parlourmaid who eyed him with what seemed to his consciencestricken soul dislike and suspicion she had a tightlipped mouth and beady eyes beneath heavy brows jimmy had seldom seen a woman who attracted him less at first sight  jer ring s  jimmy blinked and almost ducked the words had come at him like a projectile  oh ah yes  j want anything s  with an effort jimmy induced his mind to resume its interrupted equilibrium  oh ah yes would you mind sending skinner the butler to me  ysr  the apparition vanished jimmy drew out his handkerchief and dabbed at his forehead he felt weak and guilty he felt as if he had just been accused of nameless crimes and had been unable to deny the charge such was the magic of miss trimbles eyethe left one which looked directly at its object conjecture pauses baffled at the thought of the effect which her gaze might have created in the breasts of the sex she despised had it been double instead of singlebarrelled but half of it had wasted itself on a spot some few feet to his right  presently the door opened again and mr crocker appeared looking like a benevolent priest    chapter xix  between father and son  well skinner my man said jimmy how goes it  mr crocker looked about him cautiously then his priestly manner fell from him like a robe and he bounded forward  jimmy he exclaimed seizing his sons hand and shaking it violently say its great seeing you again jim  jimmy drew himself up haughtily  skinner my good menial you forget yourself strangely you will be getting fired if you mitt the handsome guest in this chummy fashion he slapped his father on the back dad this is great how on earth do you come to be here whats the idea why the buttling when did you come over tell me all  mr crocker hoisted himself nimbly onto the writingdesk and sat there beaming with dangling legs  it was your letter that did it jimmy say jim there wasnt any need for you to do a thing like that just for me  well i thought you would have a better chance of being a peer without me around by the way dad how did my stepmother take the lord percy episode  a shadow fell upon mr crockers happy face  i dont like to do much thinking about your stepmother he said she was pretty sore about percy and she was pretty sore about your lighting out for america but gee what she must be feeling like now that ive come over i darent let myself think  you havent explained that yet why did you come over  well id been feeling homesicki always do over there in the baseball seasonand then talking with pett made it worse  talking with pett did you see him then when he was in london  see him i let him in  how  into the house i mean i had just gone to the front door to see what sort of a day it wasi wanted to know if there had been enough rain in the night to stop my having to watch that cricket gameand just as i got there the bell rang i opened the door  a revoltingly plebeian thing to do im ashamed of you dad they wont stand for that sort of thing in the house of lords  well before i knew what was happening they had taken me for the butler i didnt want your stepmother to know id been opening doorsyou remember how touchy she was always about it so i just let it go at that and jollied them along but i just couldnt help asking the old man how the pennant race was making out and that tickled him so much that he offered me a job here as butler if i ever wanted to make a change and then your note came saying that you were going to new york andwell i couldnt help myself you couldnt have kept me in london with ropes i sneaked out next day and bought a passage on the carmanticshe sailed the wednesday after you leftand came straight here they gave me this job right away mr crocker paused and a holy light of enthusiasm made his homely features almost beautiful say jim ive seen a ballgame every darned day since i landed say two days running larry doyle made homeruns but gosh that guy klem is one swell robber see here mr crocker sprang down from the desk and snatched up a handful of books which he proceeded to distribute about the floor there were two men on bases in the sixth and whatshisname came to bat he lined one out to centrefieldwhere this book isand  pull yourself together skinner you cant monkey about with the employers library like that jimmy restored the books to their places simmer down and tell me more postpone the gossip from the diamond what plans have you made have you considered the future at all you arent going to hold down this buttling job forever are you when do you go back to london  the light died out of mr crockers face  i guess i shall have to go back some time but how can i yet with the giants leading the league like this  but did you just light out without saying anything  i left a note for your stepmother telling her i had gone to america for a vacation jimmy i hate to think what shes going to do to me when she gets me back  assert yourself dad tell her that womans place is the home and mans the ballpark be firm  mr crocker shook his head dubiously  its all very well to talk that way when youre three thousand miles from home but you know as well as i do jim that your stepmother though shes a delightful woman isnt the sort you can assert yourself with look at this sister of hers here i guess you havent been in the house long enough to have noticed but shes very like eugenia in some ways shes the boss all right and old pett does just what hes told to i guess its the same with me jim theres a certain type of man thats just born to have it put over on him by a certain type of woman im that sort of man and your stepmothers that sort of woman no i guess im going to get mine all right and the only thing to do is to keep it from stopping me having a good time now  there was truth in what he said and jimmy recognised it he changed the subject  well never mind that theres no sense in worrying oneself about the future tell me dad where did you get all the dinnerisserved madam stuff how did you ever learn to be a butler  bayliss taught me back in london and of course ive played butlers when i was on the stage  jimmy did not speak for a moment  did you ever play a kidnapper dad he asked at length  sure i was chicago ed in a crook play called this way out why surely you saw me in that i got some good notices  jimmy nodded  of course i knew id seen you play that sort of part some time you came on during the dark scene and  switched on the lights and  covered the bunch with your gun while they were still blinking you were great in that part dad  it was a good part said mr crocker modestly it had fat id like to have a chance to play a kidnapper again theres a lot of pep to kidnappers  you shall play one again said jimmy i am putting on a little sketch with a kidnapper as the star part  eh a sketch you jim where  here in this house it is entitled kidnapping ogden and opens tonight  mr crocker looked at his only son in concern jimmy appeared to him to be rambling  amateur theatricals he hazarded  in the sense that there is no pay for performing yes dad you know that kid ogden upstairs well its quite simple i want you to kidnap him for me  mr crocker sat down heavily he shook his head  i dont follow all this  of course not i havent begun to explain dad in your rambles through this joint youve noticed a girl with glorious redgold hair i imagine  ann chester  ann chester im going to marry her  jimmy  but she doesnt know it yet now follow me carefully dad five years ago ann chester wrote a book of poems its on that desk there you were using it a moment back as secondbase or something now i was working at that time on the chronicle i wrote a skit on those poems for the sunday paper do you begin to follow the plot  shes got it in for you shes sore  exactly get that firmly fixed in your mind because its the source from which all the rest of the story springs  mr crocker interrupted  but i dont understand you say shes sore at you well how is it that you came in together looking as if you were good friends when i let you in this morning  i was waiting for you to ask that the explanation is that she doesnt know that i am jimmy crocker  but you came here saying that you were jimmy crocker  quite right and that is where the plot thickens i made anns acquaintance first in london and then on the boat i had found out that jimmy crocker was the man she hated most in the world so i took another name i called myself bayliss  bayliss  i had to think of something quick because the clerk at the shipping office was waiting to fill in my ticket i had just been talking to bayliss on the phone and his was the only name that came into my mind you know how it is when you try to think of a name suddenly now mark the sequel old bayliss came to see me off at paddington ann was there and saw me she said good evening mr bayliss or something and naturally old bayliss replied what ho or words to that effect the only way to handle the situation was to introduce him as my father i did so ann therefore thinks that i am a young man named bayliss who has come over to america to make his fortune we now come to the third reel i met ann by chance at the knickerbocker and took her to lunch while we were lunching that confirmed congenital idiot reggie bartling who happened to have come over to america as well came up and called me by my name i knew that if ann discovered who i really was she would have nothing more to do with me so i gave reggie the haughty stare and told him that he had made a mistake he ambled awayand possibly committed suicide in his anguish at having made such a bloomerleaving ann discussing with me the extraordinary coincidence of my being jimmy crockers double do you follow the story of my life so far  mr crocker who had been listening with wrinkled brow and other signs of rapt attention nodded  i understand all that but how did you come to get into this house  that is reel four i am getting to that it seems that ann who is the sweetest girl on earth and always on the lookout to do some one a kindness had decided in the interests of the boys future to remove young ogden ford from his present sphere where he is being spoiled and ruined and send him down to a man on long island who would keep him for awhile and instil the first principles of decency into him her accomplice in this admirable scheme was jerry mitchell  jerry mitchell  who as you know got fired yesterday jerry was to have done the rough work of the job but being fired he was no longer available i therefore offered to take his place so here i am  youre going to kidnap that boy  no you are  me  precisely you are going to play a benefit performance of your worldfamed success chicago ed let me explain further owing to circumstances which i need not go into ogden has found out that i am really jimmy crocker so he refuses to have anything more to do with me i had deceived him into believing that i was a professional kidnapper and he came to me and offered to let me kidnap him if i would go fiftyfifty with him in the ransom  gosh  yes hes an intelligent child full of that sort of bright ideas well now he has found that i am not all his fancy painted me he wouldnt come away with me and i want you to understudy me while the going is good in the fifth reel which will be released tonight after the household has retired to rest you will be featured its got to be tonight because it has just occurred to me that ogden knowing that lord wisbeach is a crook may go to him with the same proposal that he made to me  lord wisbeach a crook  of the worst description he is here to steal that explosive stuff of willie partridges but as i have blocked that play he may turn his attention to ogden  but jimmy if that fellow is a crookhow do you know he is  he told me so himself  well then why dont you expose him  because in order to do so skinner my man i should have to explain that i was really jimmy crocker and the time is not yet ripe for that to my thinking the time will not be ripe till you have got safely away with ogden ford i can then go to ann and say i may have played you a rotten trick in the past but i have done you a good turn now so lets forget the past so you see that everything now depends on you dad im not asking you to do anything difficult ill go round to the boardinghouse now and tell jerry mitchell about what we have arranged and have him waiting outside here in a car then all you will have to do is to go to ogden play a short scene as chicago ed escort him to the car and then go back to bed and have a good sleep once ogden thinks you are a professional kidnapper you wont have any difficulty at all get it into your head that he wants to be kidnapped surely you can tackle this light and attractive job why it will be a treat for you to do a bit of character acting once more  jimmy had struck the right note his fathers eyes began to gleam with excitement the scent of the footlights seemed to dilate his nostrils  i was always good at that roughneck stuff he murmured meditatively i used to eat it  exactly said jimmy look at it in the right way and i am doing you a kindness in giving you this chance  mr crocker rubbed his cheek with his forefinger  youd want me to make up for the part he asked wistfully  of course  you want me to do it tonight  at about two in the morning i thought  ill do it jim  jimmy grasped his hand  i knew i could rely on you dad  mr crocker was following a train of thought  dark wig    blue chin    heavy eyebrows    i guess i cant do better than my old chicago ed makeup say jimmy how am i to get to the kid  thatll be all right you can stay in my room till the time comes to go to him use it as a dressingroom  how am i to get him out of the house  through this room ill tell jerry to wait out on the sidestreet with the car from two oclock on  mr crocker considered these arrangements  that seems to be about all he said  i dont think theres anything else  ill slip downtown and buy the props  ill go and tell jerry  a thought struck mr crocker  youd better tell jerry to make up too he doesnt want the kid recognising him and squealing on him later  jimmy was lost in admiration of his fathers resource  you think of everything dad that wouldnt have occurred to me you certainly do take to crime in the most wonderful way it seems to come naturally to you  mr crocker smirked modestly    chapter xx  celestine imparts information  plit is only as strong as its weakest link the bestlaid schemes of mice and men gang agley if one of the mice is a mental defective or if one of the men is a jerry mitchell     celestine mrs petts maidshe who was really maggie otoole and whom jerry loved with a strength which deprived him of even that small amount of intelligence which had been bestowed upon him by naturecame into the housekeepers room at about ten oclock that night the domestic staff had gone in a body to the movingpictures and the only occupant of the room was the new parlourmaid who was sitting in a hard chair reading schopenhauer  celestines face was flushed her dark hair was ruffled and her eyes were shining she breathed a little quickly and her left hand was out of sight behind her back she eyed the new parlourmaid doubtfully for a moment the latter was a woman of somewhat unencouraging exterior not the kind that invites confidences but celestine had confidences to bestow and the exodus to the movies had left her in a position where she could not pick and choose she was faced with the alternative of locking her secret in her palpitating bosom or of revealing it to this one auditor the choice was one which no impulsive damsel in like circumstances would have hesitated to make  say said celestine  a face rose reluctantly from behind schopenhauer a gleaming eye met celestines a second eye no less gleaming glared at the ceiling  say i just been talking to my feller outside said celestine with a coy simper say hes a grand man  a snort of uncompromising disapproval proceeded from the thinlipped mouth beneath the eyes but celestine was too full of her news to be discouraged  im strong fer jer she said  huh said the student of schopenhauer  jerry mitchell you know you aint never met him have you say hes a grand man  for the first time she had the others undivided attention the new parlourmaid placed her book upon the table  uh she said  celestine could hold back her dramatic surprise no longer her concealed left hand flashed into view on the third finger glittered a ring she gazed at it with awed affection  aint it a beaut  she contemplated its sparkling perfection for a moment in rapturous silence  say you could have knocked me down with a feather she resumed he telephones me awhile ago and says to be outside the back door at ten tonight because hed something he wanted to tell me of course he couldnt come in and tell it me here because hed been fired and everything so i goes out and there he is hello kid he says to me fresh i says to him say i got something to be fresh about he says to me and then he reaches into his jeans and hauls out the sparkler whats that i says to him its an engagement ring he says to me for you if youll wear it i came over so weak i could have fell and the next thing i know hes got it on my finger and celestine broke off modestly say aint it a beaut honest she gave herself over to contemplation once more he says to me how hes on easy street now or will be pretty soon i says to him have you got a job then he says to me now i aint got a job but im going to pull off a stunt tonight thats going to mean enough to me to start that healthfarm ive told you about say hes always had a line of talk about starting a healthfarm down on long island he knowing all about training and health and everything through having been one of them fighters i asks him what the stunt is but he wont tell me yet he says hell tell me after were married but he says its surefire and hes going to buy the license tomorrow  she paused for comment and congratulations eyeing her companion expectantly  huh said the new parlourmaid briefly and resumed her schopenhauer decidedly hers was not a winning personality  aint it a beaut demanded celestine damped  the new parlourmaid uttered a curious sound at the back of her throat  hes a beaut she said cryptically  she added another remark in a lower tone too low for celestines ears it could hardly have been that but it sounded to celestine like  ill fix m    chapter xxi  chicago ed  riverside drive slept the moon shone on darkened windows and deserted sidewalks it was past one oclock in the morning the wicked forties were still ablaze with light and noisy foxtrots but in the virtuous hundreds where mr petts house stood respectable slumber reigned only the occasional drone of a passing automobile broke the silence or the lovesick cry of some feline romeo patrolling a walltop  jimmy was awake he was sitting on the edge of his bed watching his father put the finishing touches to his makeup which was of a shaggy and intimidating nature the elder crocker had conceived the outward aspect of chicago ed king of the kidnappers on broad and impressive lines and one glance would have been enough to tell the sagacious observer that here was no whitesouled comrade for a nocturnal saunter down lonely lanes and outoftheway alleys  mr crocker seemed to feel this himself  the only trouble is jim he said peering at himself in the glass shant i scare the boy to death directly he sees me oughtnt i to give him some sort of warning  how do you suggest sending him a formal note  mr crocker surveyed his repellent features doubtfully  its a good deal to spring on a kid at one in the morning he said suppose he has a fit  hes far more likely to give you one dont you worry about ogden dad i shouldnt think there was a child alive more equal to handling such a situation  there was an empty glass standing on a tray on the dressingtable mr crocker eyed this sadly  i wish you hadnt thrown that stuff away jim i could have done with it im feeling nervous  nonsense dad youre all right i had to throw it away im on the wagon now but how long i should have stayed on with that smiling up at me i dont know ive made up my mind never to lower myself to the level of the beasts that perish with the demon rum again because my future wife has strong views on the subject but theres no sense in taking chances temptation is all very well but you dont need it on your dressingtable it was a kindly thought of yours to place it there dad but  eh i didnt put it there  i thought that sort of thing came in your department isnt it the butlers job to supply drinks to the nobility and gentry well it doesnt matter it is now distributed over the neighbouring soil thus removing a powerful temptation from your path youre better without it he looked at his watch well it ought to be all right now he went to the window theres an automobile down there i suppose its jerry i told him to be outside at one sharp and its nearly halfpast i think you might be starting dad oh by the way you had better tell ogden that you represent a gentleman of the name of buck maginnis it was buck who got away with him last time and a firm friendship seems tohave sprung up between them theres nothing like coming with a good introduction  mr crocker took a final survey of himself in the mirror  gee i id hate to meet myself on a lonely road  he opened the door and stood for a moment listening  from somewhere down the passage came the murmur of a muffled snore  third door on the left said jimmy threecount emthree dont go getting mixed  mr crocker slid into the outer darkness like a stout ghost and jimmy closed the door gently behind him  having launched his indulgent parent safely on a career of crime jimmy switched off the light and returned to the window leaning out he gave himself up for a moment to sentimental musings the night was very still through the trees which flanked the house the dimmed headlights of what was presumably jerry mitchells hired car shone faintly like enlarged fireflies a boat of some description was tooting reflectively far down the river such was the seductive influence of the time and the scene that jimmy might have remained there indefinitely weaving dreams had he not been under the necessity of making his way down to the library it was his task to close the french windows after his father and ogden had passed through and he proposed to remain hid in the gallery there until the time came for him to do this it was imperative that he avoid being seen by ogden  locking his door behind him he went downstairs there were no signs of life in the house everything was still he found the staircase leading to the gallery without having to switch on the lights  it was dusty in the gallery and a smell of old leather enveloped him he hoped his father would not be long he lowered himself cautiously to the floor and resting his head against a convenient shelf began to wonder how the interview between chicago ed and his prey was progressing                                        mr crocker meanwhile masked to the eyes had crept in fearful silence to the door which jimmy had indicated a good deal of the gay enthusiasm with which he had embarked on this enterprise had ebbed away from him now that he had become accustomed to the novelty of finding himself once more playing a character part his intimate respectability began to assert itself it was one thing to play chicago ed at a broadway theatre but quite another to give a benefit performance like this as he tiptoed along the passage the one thing that presented itself most clearly to him was the appalling outcome of this act of his should anything go wrong he would have turned back but for the thought that jimmy was depending on him and that success would mean jimmys happiness stimulated by this reflection he opened ogdens door inch by inch and went in he stole softly across the room  he had almost reached the bed and had just begun to wonder how on earth now that he was there he could open the proceedings tactfully and without alarming the boy when he was saved the trouble of pondering further on this problem a light flashed out of the darkness with the suddenness of a bursting bomb and a voice from the same general direction said hands up  when mr crocker had finished blinking and had adjusted his eyes to the glare he perceived ogden sitting up in bed with a revolver in his hand the revolver was resting on his knee and its muzzle pointed directly at mr crockers ample stomach  exhaustive as had been the thought which jimmys father had given to the possible developments of his enterprise this was a contingency of which he had not dreamed he was entirely at a loss  dont do that he said huskily it might go off  i should worry replied ogden coldly im at the right end of it what are you doing here he looked fondly at the lethal weapon i got this with cigarettecoupons to shoot rabbits when we went to the country heres where i get a chance at something parthuman  do you want to murder me  why not  mr crockers makeup was trickling down his face in sticky streams the mask however prevented ogden from seeing this peculiar phenomenon he was gazing interestedly at his visitor an idea struck him  say did you come to kidnap me  mr crocker felt the sense of relief which he had sometimes experienced on the stage when memory had failed him during a scene and a fellowactor had thrown him the line it would be exaggerating to say that he was himself again he could never be completely at his case with that pistol pointing at him but he felt considerably better he lowered his voice an octave or so and spoke in a husky growl  aw cheese it kid nix on the rough stuff  keep those hands up advised ogden  sure sure growled mr crocker can the gunplay bo say youve soitanly grown since de last time we got youse  ogdens manner became magically friendly  are you one of buck maginnis lot he enquired almost politely  dats right mr crocker blessed the inspiration which had prompted jimmys parting words im wit buck  why didnt buck come himself  hes woiking on anudder job  to mr crockers profound relief ogden lowered the pistol  im strong for buck he said conversationally were old pals did you see the piece in the paper about him kidnapping me last time ive got it in my pressclipping album  sure said mr crocker  say listen if you take me now bucks got to come across i like buck but im not going to let myself be kidnapped for his benefit its fiftyfifty or nothing doing see  i get you kid  well if thats understood all right give me a minute to get some clothes on and ill be with you  dont make a noise said mr crocker  whos making any noise say how did you get in here  troo de libery windows  i always knew some yegg would stroll in that way it beats me why they didnt have bars fixed on them  deres a buzzwagon outside waitin  you do it in style dont you observed ogden pulling on his shirt whos working this with you any one i know  naw a new guy  oh say i dont remember you if it comes to that  you dont said mr crocker a little discomposed  well maybe i wouldnt with that mask on you which of them are you  chicago eds my monaker  i dont remember any chicago ed  well you will after dis said mr crocker happily inspired  ogden was eyeing him with sudden suspicion  take that mask off and lets have a look at you  nothing doin  how am i to know youre on the level  mr crocker played a daring card  all right he said making a move towards the door its up to youse if you tink im not on de level ill beat it  here stop a minute said ogden hastily unwilling that a promising business deal should be abandoned in this summary manner im not saying anything against you theres no need to fly off the handle like that  ill tell buck i couldnt get you said mr crocker moving another step  here stop whats the matter with you  are youse comin wit me  sure if you get the conditions bucks got to slip me half of whatever he gets out of this  dats right buckll slip youse half of anyting he gets  all right then wait till ive got this shoe on and lets start now im ready  beat it quietly  what did you think i was going to do sing  step dis way said mr crocker jocosely  they left the room cautiously mr crocker for a moment had a sense of something missing he had reached the stairs before he realised what it was then it dawned upon him that what was lacking was the applause the scene had deserved a round  jimmy vigilant in the gallery heard the library door open softly and peering over the rail perceived two dim forms in the darkness one was large the other small they crossed the room together  whispered words reached him  i thought you said you came in this way  sure  then whys the shutter closed  i fixed it after i was in  there was a faint scraping sound followed by a click the darkness of the room was relieved by moonlight the figures passed through jimmy ran down from the gallery and closed the windows softly he had just fastened the shutters when from the passage outside there came the unmistakeable sound of a footstep    chapter xxii  in the library  jimmys first emotion on hearing the footstep was the crude instinct of selfpreservation all that he was able to think of at the moment was the fact that he was in a questionable position and one which would require a good deal of explaining away if he were found and his only sensation was a strong desire to avoid discovery he made a silent scrambling leap for the gallery stairs and reached their shelter just as the door opened he stood there rigid waiting to be challenged but apparently he had moved in time for no voice spoke the door closed so gently as to be almost inaudible and then there was silence again the room remained in darkness and it was this perhaps that first suggested to jimmy the comforting thought that the intruder was equally desirous of avoiding the scrutiny of his fellows he had taken it for granted in his first panic that he himself was the only person in that room whose motive for being there would not have borne inspection but now safely hidden in the gallery out of sight from the floor below he had the leisure to consider the newcomers movements and to draw conclusions from them  an honest mans first act would surely have been to switch on the lights and an honest man would hardly have crept so stealthily it became apparent to jimmy as he leaned over the rail and tried to pierce the darkness that there was sinister work afoot and he had hardly reached this conclusion when his mind took a further leap and he guessed the identity of the softfooted person below it could be none but his old friend lord wisbeach known to the boys as gentleman jack it surprised him that he had not thought of this before then it surprised him that after the talk they had only a few hours earlier in that very room gentleman jack should have dared to risk this raid  at this moment the blackness was relieved as if by the striking of a match the man below had brought an electric torch into play and now jimmy could see clearly he had been right in his surmise it was lord wisbeach he was kneeling in front of the safe what he was doing to the safe jimmy could not see for the mans body was in the way but the electric torch shone on his face lighting up grim serious features quite unlike the amiable and slightly vacant mask which his lordship was wont to present to the world as jimmy looked something happened in the pool of light beyond his vision gentleman jack gave a muttered exclamation of satisfaction and then jimmy saw that the door of the safe had swung open the air was full of a penetrating smell of scorched metal jimmy was not an expert in these matters but he had read from time to time of modern burglars and their methods and he gathered that an oxyacetylene blowpipe with its flame that cuts steel as a knife cuts cheese had been at work  lord wisbeach flashed the torch into the open safe plunged his hand in and drew it out again holding something handling this in a cautious and gingerly manner he placed it carefully in his breast pocket then he straightened himself he switched off the torch and moved to the window leaving the rest of his implements by the open safe he unfastened the shutter then raised the catch of the window at this point it seemed to jimmy that the time had come to interfere  tut tut he said in a tone of mild reproof  the effect of the rebuke on lord wisbeach was remarkable he jumped convulsively away from the window then revolving on his own axis flashed the torch into every corner of the room  whos that he gasped  conscience said jimmy  lord wisbeach had overlooked the gallery in his researches he now turned his torch upwards the light flooded the gallery on the opposite side of the room from where jimmy stood there was a pistol in gentleman jacks hand now it followed the torch uncertainly  jimmy lying flat on the gallery floor spoke again  throw that gun away and the torch too he said ive got you covered  the torch flashed above his head but the raised edge of the gallery rail protected him  ill give you five seconds if you havent dropped that gun by then i shall shoot  as he began to count jimmy heartily regretted that he had allowed his appreciation of the dramatic to lead him into this situation it would have been so simple to have roused the house in a prosaic way and avoided this delicate position suppose his bluff did not succeed suppose the other still clung to his pistol at the end of the five seconds he wished that he had made it ten instead gentleman jack was an enterprising person as his previous acts had showed he might very well decide to take a chance he might even refuse to believe that jimmy was armed he had only jimmys word for it perhaps he might be as deficient in simple faith as he had proved to be in norman blood jimmy lingered lovingly over his count  four he said reluctantly  there was a breathless moment then to jimmys unspeakable relief gun and torch dropped simultaneously to the floor in an instant jimmy was himself again  go and stand with your face to that wall he said crisply hold your hands up  why  im going to see how many more guns youve got  i havent another  id like to make sure of that for myself get moving  gentleman jack reluctantly obeyed when he had reached the wall jimmy came down he switched on the lights he felt in the others pockets and almost at once encountered something hard and metallic  he shook his head reproachfully  you are very loose and inaccurate in your statements he said why all these weapons i didnt raise my boy to be a soldier now you can turn around and put your hands down  gentleman jacks appeared to be a philosophical nature the chagrin consequent upon his failure seemed to have left him he sat on the arm of a chair and regarded jimmy without apparent hostility he even smiled a faint smile  i thought i had fixed you he said you must have been smarter than i took you for i never supposed you would get on to that drink and pass it up  understanding of an incident which had perplexed him came to jimmy  was it you who put that highball in my room was it doped  didnt you know  well said jimmy i never knew before that virtue got its reward so darned quick in this world i rejected that highball not because i suspected it but out of pure goodness because i had made up my mind that i was through with all that sort of thing  his companion laughed if jimmy had had a more intimate acquaintance with the resourceful individual whom the boys called gentleman jack he would have been disquieted by that laugh it was an axiom among those who knew him well that when gentleman jack chuckled in the reflective way he generally had something unpleasant up his sleeve  its your lucky night said gentleman jack  it looks like it  well it isnt over yet  very nearly you had better go and put that testtube back in what is left of the safe now did you think i had forgotten it  what testtube  come come old friend the one filled with partridges explosive which you have in your breastpocket  gentleman jack laughed again then he moved towards the safe  place it gently on the top shelf said jimmy  the next moment every nerve in his body was leaping and quivering a great shout split the air gentleman jack apparently insane was giving tongue at the top of his voice  help help help  the conversation having been conducted up to this point in undertones the effect of this unexpected uproar was like an explosion the cries seemed to echo round the room and shake the very walls for a moment jimmy stood paralysed staring feebly then there was a sudden deafening increase in the din something living seemed to writhe and jump in his hand he dropped it incontinently and found himself gazing in a stupefied way at a round smoking hole in the carpet such had been the effect of gentleman jacks unforeseen outburst that he had quite forgotten that he held the revolver and he had been unfortunate enough at this juncture to pull the trigger  there was a sudden rush and a swirl of action something hit jimmy under the chin he staggered back and when he had recovered himself found himself looking into the muzzle of the revolver which had nearly blown a hole in his foot a moment back the sardonic face of gentleman jack smiled grimly over the barrel  i told you the night wasnt over yet he said  the blow under the chin had temporarily dulled jimmys mentality he stood swallowing and endeavouring to pull himself together and to get rid of a feeling that his head was about to come off he backed to the desk and steadied himself against it  as he did so a voice from behind him spoke  whassall this  he turned his head a curious procession was filing in through the open french window first came mr crocker still wearing his hideous mask then a heavily bearded individual with round spectacles who looked like an automobile coming through a haystack then ogden ford and finally a sturdy determinedlooking woman with glittering but poorly coordinated eyes who held a large revolver in her unshaking right hand and looked the very embodiment of the modern female who will stand no nonsense it was part of the nightmarelike atmosphere which seemed to brood inexorably over this particular night that this person looked to jimmy exactly like the parlourmaid who had come to him in this room in answer to the bell and who had sent his father to him yet how could it be she jimmy knew little of the habits of parlourmaids but surely they did not wander about with revolvers in the small hours  while he endeavoured feverishly to find reason in this chaos the door opened and a motley crowd roused from sleep by the cries poured in jimmy turning his head back again to attend to this invasion perceived mrs pett ann two or three of the geniuses and willie partridge in various stages of negligee and babbling questions  the woman with the pistol assuming instant and unquestioned domination of the assembly snapped out an order  shutatdoor  somebody shut the door  now whassall this she said turning to gentleman jack    chapter xxiii  stirring times for the petts  gentleman jack had lowered his revolver and was standing waiting to explain all with the insufferable look of the man who is just going to say that he has only done his duty and requires no thanks  who are you he said  nev min who i am said miss trimble curtly siz pett knows who i am  i hope you wont be offended lord wisbeach said mrs pett from the group by the door i engaged a detective to help you i really thought you could not manage everything by yourself i hope you do not mind  not at all mrs pett very wise  im so glad to hear you say so  an excellent move  miss trimble broke in on these amiable exchanges  whassall this howjer meanhelp me  lord wisbeach most kindly offered to do all he could to protect my nephews explosive said mrs pett  gentleman jack smiled modestly  i hope i have been of some slight assistance i think i came down in the nick of time look he pointed to the safe he had just got it open luckily i had my pistol with me i covered him and called for help in another moment he would have got away  miss trimble crossed to the safe and inspected it with a frown as if she disliked it she gave a grunt and returned to her place by the window  made good job f it was her comment  ann came forward her face was glowing and her eyes shone  do you mean to say that you found jimmy breaking into the safe i never heard anything so absurd  mrs pett intervened  this is not james crocker ann this man is an impostor who came into the house in order to steal willies invention she looked fondly at gentleman jack lord wisbeach told me so he only pretended to recognise him this afternoon  a low gurgle proceeded from the open mouth of little ogden the proceedings bewildered him the scene he had overheard in the library between the two men had made it clear to him that jimmy was genuine and lord wisbeach a fraud and he could not understand why jimmy did not produce his proofs as before he was not aware that jimmys head was only just beginning to clear from the effects of the blow on the chin ogden braced himself for resolute lying in the event of jimmy calling him as a witness but he did not intend to have his little business proposition dragged into the open  ann was looking at jimmy with horrorstruck eyes for the first time it came to her how little she knew of him and how very likely it wasin the face of the evidence it was almost certainthat he should have come to the house with the intention of stealing willies explosive she fought against it but a voice seemed to remind her that it was he who had suggested the idea of posing as jimmy crocker she could not help remembering how smoothly and willingly he had embarked on the mad scheme but had it been so mad had it not been a mere cloak for this other venture if lord wisbeach had found him in this room with the safe blown open what other explanation could there be  and then simultaneously with her conviction that he was a criminal came the certainty that he was the man she loved it had only needed the spectacle of him in trouble to make her sure she came to his side with the vague idea of doing something to help him of giving him her support once there she found that there was nothing to do and nothing to say she put her hand on his and stood waiting helplessly for she knew not what  it was the touch of her fingers which woke jimmy from his stupor he came to himself almost with a jerk he had been mistily aware of what had been said but speech had been beyond him now quite suddenly he was a whole man once more he threw himself into the debate with energy  good heavens he cried youre all wrong i found him blowing open the safe  gentleman jack smiled superciliously  a likely story what i mean to say its a bit thin  ridiculous said mrs pett she turned to miss trimble with a gesture arrest that man  wait a momnt replied that clearheaded maiden picking her teeth thoughtfully with the muzzle of her revolver wait momnt gotta look nto this hear both these guys stries  really said gentleman jack suavely it seems somewhat absurd  ney mind how bsurd t sounds returned the fair trimble rebukingly you close yr face n lissen t me thass all youve gotta do  i know you didnt do it cried ann tightening her hold on jimmys arm  less f it please less f it miss trimble removed the pistol from her mouth and pointed it at jimmy whatve you to say talk quick  i happened to be down there  why asked miss trimble as if she had touched off a bomb  jimmy stopped short he perceived difficulties in the way of explanation  i happened to be down there he resumed stoutly and that man came into the room with an electric torch and a blowpipe and began working on the safe  the polished tones of gentleman jack cut in on his story  really now is it worth while he turned to miss trimble i came down here having heard a noise i did not happen to be here for some unexplained purpose i was lying awake and something attracted my attention as mrs pett knows i was suspicious of this worthy and expected him to make an attempt on the explosive at any moment so i took my pistol and crept downstairs when i got here the safe was open and this man making for the window  miss trimble scratched her chin caressingly with the revolver and remained for a moment in thought then she turned to jimmy like a striking rattlesnake  y gotta pull somethg better thn that she said i got yr number yre caught with th goods  no cried ann  yes said mrs pett the thing is obvious  i think the best thing i can do said gentleman jack smoothly is to go and telephone for the police  you think of everything lord wisbeach said mrs pett  not at all said his lordship  jimmy watched him moving to the door at the back of his mind there was a dull feeling that he could solve the whole trouble if only he could remember one fact which had escaped him the effects of the blow he had received still handicapped him he struggled to remember but without result gentleman jack reached the door and opened it and as he did so a shrill yapping hitherto inaudible because of the intervening oak and the raised voices within made itself heard from the passage outside gentleman jack closed the door with a hasty bang  i say that dogs out there he said plaintively  the scratching of aidas busy feet on the wood bore out his words he looked about him baffled  that dogs out there he repeated gloomily  something seemed to give way in jimmys brain the simple fact which had eluded him till now sprang into his mind  dont let that man get out he cried good lord ive only just remembered you say you found me breaking into the safe you say you heard a noise and came down to investigate well then whats that testtube of the explosive doing in your breastpocket he swung round to miss trimble you neednt take my word or his word theres a much simpler way of finding out whos the real crook search us both he began to turn out his pockets rapidly look hereand hereand here now ask him to do the same  he was pleased to observe a spasm pass across gentleman jacks hitherto composed countenance miss trimble was eyeing the latter with sudden suspicion  thasso she said say bill ive fgottn yr namesup to you to show us lessve a look t what y got inside there  gentleman jack drew himself up haughtily  i really could not agree to  mrs pett interrupted indignantly  i never heard of such a thing lord wisbeach is an old friend  lessf it ordered miss trimble whose left eye was now like the left eye of a basilisk y gotta show us bill so b quick bout t  a tired smile played over gentleman jacks face he was the bored aristocrat mutely protesting against something that wasnt done he dipped his slender fingers into his pocket then drawing out the testtube and holding it up he spoke with a drawling calm for which even jimmy could not help admiring him  all right if im done im done  the sensation caused by his action and his words was of the kind usually described as profound mrs pett uttered a strangled shriek willie partridge yelped like a dog sharp exclamations came simultaneously from each of the geniuses  gentleman jack waited for the clamour to subside then he resumed his gentle drawl  but im not done he explained im going out now through that window and if anybody tries to stop me it will be hisor her he bowed politely to miss trimblelast act in the world if any one makes a move to stop me i shall drop this testtube and blow the whole damned place to pieces  if his first speech had made a marked impression on his audience his second paralysed them a silence followed as of the tomb only the yapping of the dog aida refused to be stilled  y stay where y are said miss trimble as the speaker moved towards the window she held the revolver poised but for the first time that nightpossibly for the first time in her lifeshe spoke irresolutely superbly competent woman though she was here was a situation that baffled her  gentleman jack crossed the room slowly the testtube held aloft between forefinger and thumb he was level with miss trimble who had lowered her revolver and had drawn to one side plainly at a loss to know how to handle this unprecedented crisis when the door flew open for an instant the face of howard bemis the poet was visible  mrs pett i have telephoned  then another voice interrupted him  yipe yipe yipe  through the opening the dog aida rejoicing in the removal of the obstacle raced like a fur muff mysteriously endowed with legs and a tongue she tore across the room to where gentleman jacks ankles waited invitingly ever since their first meeting she had wanted a fair chance at those ankles but some one had always prevented her  damn shouted gentleman jack  the word was drowned in one vast cataclysm of noise from every throat in the room there proceeded a shout a shriek or some other variety of cry as the testtube slipping from between the victims fingers described a parabola through the air  ann flung herself into jimmys arms and he held her tight he shut his eyes even as he waited for the end the thought flashed through his mind that if he must die this was the manner of death which he would prefer  the testtube crashed on the writingdesk and burst into a million pieces     jimmy opened his eyes things seemed to be much about the same as before he was still alive the room in which he stood was solid and intact nobody was in fragments there was only one respect in which the scene differed from what it had been a moment before then it had contained gentleman jack now it did not  a great sigh seemed to sweep through the room there was a long silence then from the direction of the street came the roar of a starting automobile and at that sound the bearded man with the spectacles who had formed part of miss trimbles procession uttered a wailing cry  gee hes beat it in my bubble and it was a hired one  the words seemed to relieve the tension in the air one by one the company became masters of themselves once more miss trimble that masterly woman was the first to recover she raised herself from the floorfor with a confused idea that she would be safer there she had flung herself downand having dusted her skirt with a few decisive dabs of her strong left hand addressed herself once more to business  i let m bluff me with a fake bomb she commented bitterly she brooded on this for a moment say shut tht door gain some one and trun this mutt out i cant think with tht yapping going on  mrs pett pale and scared gathered aida into her arms at the same time ann removed herself from jimmys she did not look at him she was feeling oddly shy shyness had never been a failing of hers but she would have given much now to have been elsewhere  miss trimble again took charge of the situation the sound of the automobile had died away gentleman jack had passed out of their lives this fact embittered miss trimble she spoke with asperity  well hes gone she said acidly now we can get down t cases again say she addressed mrs pett who started nervously the experience of passing through the shadow of the valley of death and of finding herself in one piece instead of several thousand had robbed her of all her wonted masterfulness say listn t me theres been a double game on here tnight that guy thats jus gone was th first part of th entertainment now we cn start th secnd part you see these ducks she indicated with a wave of the revolver mr crocker and his bearded comrade theyve been trying t kidnap yr son  mrs pett uttered a piercing cry  oggie  oh can it muttered that youth uncomfortably he foresaw awkward moments ahead and he wished to concentrate his faculties entirely on the part he was to play in them he looked sideways at chicago ed in a few minutes he supposed ed would be attempting to minimise his own crimes by pretending that he ogden had invited him to come and kidnap him stout denial must be his weapon  i had m suspicions resumed miss trimble that somethng was goin t be pulled off tonight nd i was waiting outside fr it to break loose this guy here she indicated the bearded plotter who blinked deprecatingly through his spectacles hs been waiting on the crner of th street for the last hour with n automobile ive bn watching him right along i was onto hs game well just now out came the kid with this plugugly here she turned to mr crocker say you take off tht mask lets have a lk at you  mr crocker reluctantly drew the cambric from his face  goosh exclaimed miss trimble in strong distaste say ve you got some kind of a plague or wht is it ylook like a coloured comic supplement she confronted the shrinking mr crocker and ran a bony finger over his cheek makeup she said eyeing the stains disgustedly grease paint goosh  skinner cried mrs pett  miss trimble scanned her victim more closely  so t is if y do a bit f excavating she turned on the bearded one nd i guess all this shrubbery is fake f you come down to it she wrenched at the unhappy mans beard it came off in her hands leaving a square chin behind it if this aint a wig yll have a headache tmorrow observed miss trimble weaving her fingers into his luxuriant headcovering and pulling wish y luck ah twas a wig gimme those spectcles she surveyed the results of her handiwork grimly say clarence she remarked yre a wise guy y look handsomer with em on does any one know this duck  it is mitchell said mrs pett my husbands physical instructor  miss trimble turned and walking to jimmy tapped him meaningly on the chest with her revolver  say this is gettn interesting this is where y xplain yng man how twas you happened to be down in this room when tht crook whos just gone was monkeyin with the safe lks t me as if you were in with these two  a feeling of being on the verge of one of those crises which dot the smooth path of our lives came to jimmy to conceal his identity from ann any longer seemed impossible he was about to speak when ann broke in  aunt nesta she said i cant let this go on any longer jerry mitchell isnt to blame i told him to kidnap ogden  there was an awkward silence mrs pett laughed nervously  i think you had better go to bed my dear child you have had a severe shock you are not yourself  but its true i did tell him didnt i jerry  say miss trimble silenced jerry with a gesture you beat t back t yr little bed honey like yr aunt says y say y told this guy t steal th kid well what about this here skinner y didnt tell him did y  ii ann began confusedly she was utterly unable to account for skinner and it made her task of explaining difficult  jimmy came to the rescue he did not like to think how ann would receive the news but for her own sake he must speak now it would have required a harderhearted man than himself to resist the mute pleading of his fathers greasepainted face mr crocker was a game sport he would not have said a word without the sign from jimmy even to save himself from a night in prison but he hoped that jimmy would speak  its perfectly simple said jimmy with an attempt at airiness which broke down miserably under miss trimbles eye perfectly simple i really am jimmy crocker you know he avoided anns gaze i cant think what you are making all this fuss about  thn why did y sit in at a plot to kidnap this boy  that of courseha hamight seem at first sight to require a little explanation  y admit it then  yes as a matter of fact i did have the idea of kidnapping ogden wanted to send him to a dogs hospital if you understand what i mean he tried to smile a conciliatory smile but encountering miss trimbles left eye abandoned the project he removed a bead of perspiration from his forehead with his handkerchief it struck him as a very curious thing that the simplest explanations were so often quite difficult to make before i go any further i ought to explain one thing skinner there is my father  mrs pett gasped  skinner was my sisters butler in london  in a way of speaking said jimmy that is correct its rather a long story it was this way you see     miss trimble uttered an ejaculation of supreme contempt  i nver saw such a lot of babblng crooks in m life t beats me what y hope to get pulling this stuff say she indicated mr crocker this guys wanted fr something over in england weve got hs photographs n th office if y ask me he lit out with the spoons r something say she fixed one of the geniuses with her compelling eye bout time y made yrself useful gon call up th astorbilt on th phone theres a dame there thats been making the enquiries fr this duck she told andersonsand andersons handed it on to usto call her up any hour of the day r night when they found him you go get her on the wire and tll her t come right up heren a taxi and identify him  the genius paused at the door  whom shall i ask for  mrs crocker snapped miss trimble siz bingley crocker tell her weve found th guy shes been looking for  the genius backed out there was a howl of anguish from the doorway  i beg your pardon said the genius  cant you look where youre going  i am exceedingly sorry  brrh  mr pett entered the room hopping he was holding one slippered foot in his hand and appeared to be submitting it to some form of massage it was plain that the usually mild and gentle little man was in a bad temper he glowered round him at the company assembled  what the devils the matter here he demanded i stood it as long as i could but a man cant get a wink of sleep with this noise going on  yipe yipe yipe barked aida from the shelter of mrs petts arms  mr pett started violently  kill that dog throw her out do something to her  mrs pett was staring blankly at her husband she had never seen him like this before it was as if a rabbit had turned and growled at her coming on top of the crowded sensations of the night it had the effect of making her feel curiously weak in all her married life she had never known what fear was she had coped dauntlessly with the late mr ford a man of a spirited temperament and as for the mild mr pett she had trampled on him but now she felt afraid this new peter intimidated her    chapter xxiv  sensational turning of a worm  to this remarkable metamorphosis in mr peter pett several causes had contributed in the first place the sudden dismissal of jerry mitchell had obliged him to go two days without the physical exercises to which his system had become accustomed and this had produced a heavy irritable condition of body and mind he had brooded on the injustice of his lot until he had almost worked himself up to rebellion and then as sometimes happened with him when he was out of sorts a touch of gout came to add to his troubles being a patient man by nature he might have borne up against these trials had he been granted an adequate nights rest but just as he had dropped off after tossing restlessly for two hours things had begun to happen noisily in the library he awoke to a vague realisation of tumult below  such was the morose condition of his mind as the result of his misfortune that at first not even the cries for help could interest him sufficiently to induce him to leave his bed he knew that walking in his present state would be painful and he declined to submit to any more pain just because some party unknown was apparently being murdered in his library it was not until the shrill barking of the dog aida penetrated right in among his nervecentres and began to tie them into knots that he found himself compelled to descend even when he did so it was in no spirit of kindness he did not come to rescue anybody or to interfere between any murderer and his victim he came in a fever of militant wrath to suppress aida on the threshold of the library however the genius by treading on his gouty foot had diverted his anger and caused it to become more general he had not ceased to concentrate his venom on aida he wanted to assail everybody  whats the matter here he demanded redeyed isnt somebody going to tell me have i got to stop here all night who on earth is this he glared at miss trimble whats she doing with that pistol he stamped incautiously with his bad foot and emitted a dry howl of anguish  she is a detective peter said mrs pett timidly

 i told him to kidnap the boy snarled mr pett  peter  mr pett looked like an undersized lion as he faced his wife he bristled the recollection of all that he had suffered from ogden came to strengthen his determination  ive tried for two years to get you to send that boy to a good boardingschool and you wouldnt do it i couldnt stand having him loafing around the house any longer so i told jerry mitchell to take him away to a friend of his who keeps a dogs hospital on long island and to tell his friend to hold him there till he got some sense into him well youve spoiled that for the moment with your detectives but it still looks good to me ill give you a choice you can either send that boy to a boardingschool next week or he goes to jerry mitchells friend im not going to have him in the house any longer loafing in my chair and smoking my cigarettes which is it to be  but peter  well  if i send him to a school he may be kidnapped  kidnapping cant hurt him its what he needs and anyway

whos been making this mess on my desk its hard its darned hard the only room in the house that i ask to have for my own where i can get a little peace and i find it turned into a beergarden and coffee or some damned thing spilled all over my writingdesk  that isnt coffee peter said mrs pett mildly this caveman whom she had married under the impression that he was a gentle domestic pet had taken all the spirit out of her its willies explosive  willies explosive  lord wisbeachi mean the man who pretended to be lord wisbeachdropped it there  dropped it there well why didnt it explode and blow the place to hoboken then  mrs pett looked helplessly at willie who thrust his fingers into his mop of hair and rolled his eyes  there was fortunately some slight miscalculation in my formula uncle peter he said i shall have to look into it tomorrow whether the trinitrotoluol  mr pett uttered a sharp howl he beat the air with his clenched fists he seemed to be having a brainstorm  has thisthis fish been living on me all this timehave i been supporting thisthis buzzard in luxury all these years while he fooled about with an explosive that wont explode he pointed an accusing finger at the inventor look into it tomorrow will you yes you can look into it tomorrow after six oclock until then youll be workingfor the first time in your lifeworking in my office where you ought to have been all along he surveyed the crowded room belligerently now perhaps you will all go back to bed and let people get a little sleep go home he said to the detective  miss trimble stood her ground she watched mrs pett pass away with ogden and willie partridge head a stampede of geniuses but she declined to move  y gotta cut th rough stuff ster pett she said calmly i need my sleep jst s much s everybdy else but i gotta stay here theres a lady cming right up in a taxi frm th astorbilt to identify this gook shes afterm fr something  what skinner  s what he calls hmself  whats he done  i dno th ladyll tell us

encouragement  i dont know what youve done skinner he said but ill stand by you youre the best fan i ever met and if i can keep you out of the penitentiary i will  it isnt the penitentiary said mr crocker unhappily  a tall handsome and determinedlooking woman came into the room she stood in the doorway looking about her then her eyes rested on mr crocker for a moment she gazed incredulously at his discoloured face she drew a little nearer peering  dyo dentify m maam said miss trimble  bingley  is t th guy y wanted  its my husband said mrs crocker  y cant arrest m fr that said miss trimble disgustedly  she thrust her revolver back into the hinterland of her costume  guess ill be beatin it she said with a sombre frown she was plainly in no sunny mood f all th hunk jobs i was ever on this

guys son i spose its all right  that is my stepson james crocker  ann uttered a little cry but it was lost in miss trimbles stupendous snort the detective turned to the window  i guess ill beat t she observed caustically before it turns out that im yr lil daughter genevieve    chapter xxv  nearly everybody happy  mrs crocker turned to her husband  well bingley she said a steely tinkle in her voice  well eugenia said mr crocker  a strange light was shining in mr crockers mild eyes he had seen a miracle happen that night he had seen an even more formidable woman than his wife dominated by an even meeker man than himself and he had been amazed and impressed by the spectacle it had never even started to occur to him before but apparently it could be done a little resolution a little determination    nothing more was needed he looked at mr pett and yet mr pett had crumpled up eugenias sister with about three firm speeches it could be done     what have you to say bingley  mr crocker drew himself up  just this he said im an american citizen and the way ive figured it out is that my place is in america its no good talking about it eugenia im sorry if it upsets your plans but iamnotgoingbacktolondon he eyed his speechless wife unflatteringly im going to stick on here and see the pennant race out and after that im going to take in the worlds series  mrs crocker opened her mouth to speak closed it reopened it then she found that she had nothing to say  i hope youll be sensible eugenia and stay on this side and we can all be happy im sorry to have to take this stand but you tried me too high youre a woman and you dont know what it is to go five years without seeing a ball game but take it from me its more than any real fan can stand it nearly killed me and im not going to risk it again if mr pett will keep me on as his butler ill stay here in this house if he wont ill get another job somewhere but whatever happens i stick to this side  mr pett uttered a whoop of approval  theres always been a place for you in my house old man he cried when i get a butler who  but bingley how can you be a butler  you ought to watch him said mr pett enthusiastically hes a wonder he can pull all the starchy stuff as if hed lived with the duke of whoosis for the last forty years and then go right off and fling a popbottle at an umpire hes all right  the eulogy was wasted on mrs crocker she burst into tears it was a new experience for her husband and he watched her awkwardly his resolute demeanour crumbling under this unexpected assault  eugenia  mrs crocker wiped her eyes  i cant stand it she sobbed ive worked and worked all these years and now just as success has nearly comebingley do come back it will only be for a little longer  mr crocker stared  a little longer why that lord percy whipple businessi know you must have had excellent reasons for soaking him jimmy but it did put the lid on itsurely after that lord percy affair theres no chance  there is there is it has made no difference at all lord percy came to call next day with a black eye poor boyand said that james was a sportsman and that he wanted to know him better he said he had never felt so drawn towards any one in his life and he wanted him to show him how he made some blow which he called a right hook the whole affair has simply endeared james to him and lady corstorphine says that the duke of devizes read the account of the fight to the premier that very evening and they both laughed till they nearly got apoplexy  jimmy was deeply touched he had not suspected such a sporting spirit in his antagonist  percys all right he said enthusiastically dad you ought to go back its only fair  but jimmy surely you can understand theres only a game separating the giants and the phillies with the braves coming along just behind and the season only half over  mrs crocker looked imploringly at him  it will only be for a little while bingley lady corstorphine who has means of knowing says that your name is certain to be in the next honours list after that you can come back as often as you like we could spend the summer here and the winter in england or whatever you pleased  mr crocker capitulated  all right eugenia ill come  bingley we shall have to go back by the next boat dear people are beginning to wonder where you are ive told them that you are taking a rest in the country but they will suspect something if you dont come back at once  mr crockers face wore a drawn look he had never felt so attached to his wife as now when she wept these unexpected tears and begged favours of him with that unfamiliar catch in her voice on the other hand    a vision rose before him of the polo grounds on a warm afternoon    he crushed it down  very well he said  mr pett offered a word of consolation  maybe youll be able to run over for the worlds series  mr crockers face cleared  thats true  and ill cable you the scores every day dad said jimmy  mrs crocker looked at him with a touch of disapproval clouding the happiness of her face  are you staying over here james there is no reason why you should not come back too if you make up your mind to change your habits  i have made up my mind to change them but im going to do it in new york mr pett is going to give me a job in his office i am going to start at the bottom and work my way still further down  mr pett yapped with rapture he was experiencing something of the emotion of the preacher at the campmeeting who sees the sinners bench filling up to have secured willie partridge whom he intended to lead gradually into the realms of high finance by way of envelopeaddressing was much but that jimmy with a choice in the matter should have chosen the office filled him with such content that he only just stopped himself from dancing on his bad foot  dont worry about me dad i shall do wonders its quite easy to make a large fortune i watched uncle pete in his office this morning and all he does is sit at a mahogany table and tell the officeboy to tell callers that he has gone away for the day i think i ought to rise to great heights in that branch of industry from the little i have seen of it it seems to have been made for me    chapter xxvi  everybody happy  jimmy looked at ann they were alone mr pett had gone back to bed mrs crocker to her hotel mr crocker was removing his makeup in his room a silence had followed their departure  this is the end of a perfect day said jimmy  ann took a step towards the door  dont go  ann stopped  mr crocker she said  jimmy he corrected  mr crocker repeated ann firmly  or algernon if you prefer it  may i ask ann regarded him steadily may i ask  nearly always said jimmy when people begin with that they are going to say something unpleasant  may i ask why you went to all this trouble to make a fool of me why could you not have told me who you were from the start  have you forgotten all the harsh things you said to me from time to time about jimmy crocker i thought that if you knew who i was you would have nothing more to do with me  you were quite right  surely though you wont let a thing that happened five years ago make so much difference  i shall never forgive you  and yet a little while ago when willies bomb was about to go off you flung yourself into my arms  anns face flamed  i lost my balance  why try to recover it  ann bit her lip  you did a cruel heartless thing what does it matter how long ago it was if you were capable of it then  be reasonable dont you admit the possibility of reformation take your own case five years ago you were a minor poetess now you are an amateur kidnappera bright lovable girl at whose approach people lock up their children and sit on the key as for me five years ago i was a heartless brute now i am a sober serious businessman specially called in by your uncle to help jack up his tottering firm why not bury the dead past besidesi dont want to praise myself i just want to call your attention to itthink what i have done for you you admitted yourself that it was my influence that had revolutionised your character but for me you would now be doing worse than write poetry you would be writing vers libre i saved you from that and you spurn me  i hate you said ann  jimmy went to the writingdesk and took up a small book  put that down  i just wanted to read you loves funeral it illustrates my point think of yourself as you are now and remember that it is i who am responsible for the improvement here we are loves funeral my heart is dead      ann snatched the book from his hands and flung it away it soared up clearing the gallery rails and fell with a thud on the gallery floor she stood facing him with sparkling eyes then she moved away  i beg your pardon she said stiffly i lost my temper  its your hair said jimmy soothingly youre bound to be quicktempered with hair of that glorious red shade you must marry some nice determined fellow blueeyed darkhaired cleanshaven about five foot eleven with a future in business he will keep you in order  mr crocker  gently of course kindlylovingly the velvet thingummy rather than the iron whatsitsname but nevertheless firmly  ann was at the door  to a girl with your ardent nature some one with whom you can quarrel is an absolute necessity of life you and i are affinities ours will be an ideally happy marriage you would be miserable if you had to go through life with a human doormat with welcome written on him you want some one made of sterner stuff you want as it were a sparringpartner some one with whom you can quarrel happily with the certain knowledge that he will not curl up in a ball for you to kick but will be there with the return wallop i may have my faults he paused expectantly ann remained silent no no he went on but i am such a man brisk giveandtake is the foundation of the happy marriage do you remember that beautiful line of tennysonswe fell out my wife and i it always conjures up for me a vision of wonderful domestic happiness i seem to see us in our old age you on one side of the radiator i on the other warming our old limbs and thinking up snappy stuff to hand to each othersweethearts still if i were to go out of your life now you would be miserable you would have nobody to quarrel with you would be in the position of the female jaguar of the indian jungle who as you doubtless know expresses her affection for her mate by biting him shrewdly in the fleshy part of the leg if she should snap sideways one day and find nothing there  of all the things which ann had been trying to say during this discourse only one succeeded in finding expression to her mortification it was the only weak one in the collection  are you asking me to marry you  i am  i wont  you think so now because i am not appearing at my best you see me nervous diffident tonguetied all this will wear off however and you will be surprised and delighted as you begin to understand my true self beneath the surfacei speak conservativelyi am a corker  the door banged behind ann jimmy found himself alone he walked thoughtfully to mr petts armchair and sat down there was a feeling of desolation upon him he lit a cigarette and began to smoke pensively what a fool he had been to talk like that what girl of spirit could possibly stand it if ever there had been a time for being soothing and serious and pleading it had been these last few minutes and he talked like that  ten minutes passed jimmy sprang from his chair he thought he had heard a footstep he flung the door open the passage was empty he returned miserably to his chair of course she had not come back why should she  a voice spoke  jimmy  he leaped up again and looked wildly round then he looked up ann was leaning over the gallery rail  jimmy ive been thinking it over theres something i want to ask you do you admit that you behaved abominably five years ago  yes shouted jimmy  and that youve been behaving just as badly ever since  yes  and that you are really a pretty awful sort of person  yes  then its all right you deserve it  deserve it  deserve to marry a girl like me i was worried about it but now i see that its the only punishment bad enough for you she raised her arm  heres the dead past jimmy go and bury it goodnight  a small book fell squashily at jimmys feet he regarded it dully for a moment then with a wild yell which penetrated even to mr petts bedroom and woke that sufferer just as he was dropping off to sleep for the third time that night he bounded for the gallery stairs  at the further end of the gallery a musical laugh sounded and a door closed ann had gone
