61379279	soldiers three  by rudyard kipling     contents  loveowomen  from many inventions the big drunk draf the mutiny of the mavericks the man who was only a subaltern in the matter of a private the lost legion  from many inventions the drums of the fore and aft judson and the empire  from many inventions a conference of the powers  from many inventions     loveowomen  a lamentable tale of things done long ago and ill done  the horror the confusion and the separation of the murderer from his comrades were all over before i came there remained only on the barracksquare the blood of man calling from the ground the hot sun had dried it to a dusky goldbeater skin film cracked lozengewise by the heat and as the wind rose each lozenge rising a little curled up at the edges as if it were a dumb tongue then a heavier gust blew all away down wind in grains of darkcoloured dust it was too hot to stand in the sunshine before breakfast the men were all in barracks talking the matter over a knot of soldiers wives stood by one of the entrances to the married quarters while inside a woman shrieked and raved with wicked filthy words  a quiet and wellconducted sergeant had shot down in broad daylight just after early parade one of his own corporals had then returned to barracks and sat on a cot till the guard came for him he would therefore in due time be handed over to the high court for trial further but this he could hardly have considered in his scheme of revenge he would horribly upset my work for the reporting of the trial would fall on me without a relief what that trial would be like i knew even to weariness there would be the rifle carefully uncleaned with the fouling marks about breech and muzzle to be sworn to by half a dozen superfluous privates there would be heat reeking heat till the wet pencil slipped sideways between the fingers and the punkah would swish and the pleaders would jabber in the verandahs and his commanding officer would put in certificates of the prisoners moral character while the jury would pant and the summer uniforms of the witnesses would smell of dye and soaps and some abject barracksweeper would lose his head in crossexamination and the young barrister who always defended soldiers cases for the credit that they never brought him would say and do wonderful things and would then quarrel with me because i had not reported him correctly at the last for he surely would not be hanged i might meet the prisoner again ruling blank accountforms in the central jail and cheer him with the hope of a wardership in the andamans  the indian penal code and its interpreters do not treat murder under any provocation whatever in a spirit of jest sergeant raines would be very lucky indeed if he got off with seven years i thought he had slept the night upon his wrongs and had killed his man at twenty yards before any talk was possible that much i knew unless therefore the case was doctored a little seven years would be his least and i fancied it was exceedingly well for sergeant raines that he had been liked by his company  that same evening  no day is so long as the day of a murder  i met ortheris with the dogs and he plunged defiantly into the middle of the matter ill be one o the witnesses said he i was in the verandah when mackie came along e come from mrs rainess quarters quigley parsons an trot they was in the inside verandah so they couldnt ave eard nothing sergeant raines was in the verandah talkin to me an mackie e come along acrost the square an e sez well sez e ave they pushed your elmet off yet sergeant e sez an at that raines e catches is breath an e sez my gawd i cant stand this sez e an e picks up my rifle an shoots mackie see  but what were you doing with your rifle in the outer verandah an hour after parade  cleanin er said ortheris with the sullen brassy stare that always went with his choice lies  he might as well have said that he was dancing naked for at no time did his rifle need hand or rag on her twenty minutes after parade still the high court would not know his routine  are you going to stick to that  on the book i asked  yes like a bloomin leech  all right i dont want to know any more only remember that quigley parsons and trot couldnt have been where you say without hearing something and theres nearly certain to be a barracksweeper who was knocking about the square at the time there always is  twasnt the sweeper it was the beastie es all right  then i knew that there was going to be some spirited doctoring and i felt sorry for the government advocate who would conduct the prosecution  when the trial came on i pitied him more for he was always quick to lose his temper and made a personal matter of each lost cause rainess young barrister had for once put aside his unslaked and welling passion for alibis and insanity had forsworn gymnastics and fireworks and worked soberly for his client mercifully the hot weather was yet young and there had been no flagrant cases of barrackshootings up to the time and the jury was a good one even for an indian jury where nine men out of every twelve are accustomed to weighing evidence ortheris stood firm and was not shaken by any crossexamination the one weak point in his tale  the presence of his rifle in the outer verandah  went unchallenged by civilian wisdom though some of the witnesses could not help smiling the government advocate called for the rope contending throughout that the murder had been a deliberate one time had passed he argued for that reflection which comes so naturally to a man whose honour is lost there was also the law ever ready and anxious to right the wrongs of the common soldier if in deed wrong had been done but he doubted much whether there had been any sufficient wrong causeless suspicion overlong brooded upon had led by his theory to deliberate crime but his attempts to minimise the motive failed the most disconnected witness knew  had known for weeks  the causes of offence and the prisoner who naturally was the last of all to know groaned in the dock while he listened the one question that the trial circled round was whether raines had fired under sudden and blinding provocation given that very morning and in the summing up it was clear that ortheriss evidence told he had contrived most artistically to suggest that he personally hated the sergeant who had come into the verandah to give him a talking to for insubordination in a weak moment the government advocate asked one question too many beggin your pardon sir ortheris replied e was callin me a dam impudent little lawyer the court shook the jury brought it in a killing but with every provocation and extenuation known to god or man and the judge put his hand to his brow before giving sentence and the adams apple in the prisoners throat went up and down mercurypumping before a cyclone  in consideration of all considerations from his commanding officers certificate of good conduct to the sure loss of pension service and honour the prisoner would get two years to be served in india and  there need be no demonstration in court the government advocate scowled and picked up his papers the guard wheeled with a clash and the prisoner was relaxed to the secular arm and driven to the jail in a brokendown ticcagharri  his guard and some ten or twelve military witnesses being less important were ordered to wait till what was officially called the cool of the evening before marching back to cantonments they gathered together in one of the deep red brick verandahs of a disused lockup and congratulated ortheris who bore his honours modestly i sent my work into the office and joined them ortheris watched the government advocate driving off lunch  thats a nasty little baldeaded little butcher that is he said e dont please me es got a colley dog wot do though im goin up to murree in a week that dawgll bring fifteen rupees anywheres  you had better spend it in masses said terence unbuckling his belt for he had been on the prisoners guard standing helmeted and bolt up right for three long hours  not me said ortheris cheerfully gawdll put it down to b compnys barrick damages one o these days you look strapped terence  faith im not so young as i was that guardmountin wears on the sole av the fut and this  he sniffed contemptuously at the brick verandah  is as hard setting as standin  wait a minute ill get the cushions out of my cart i said  strewth  sofies were going it gay said ortheris as terence dropped himself section by section on the leather cushions saying prettily may you niver want a soft place wheriver you go an power to share utt wid a frind another for yourself thats good it lets me sit long ways stanley pass me a poipe augrrh an thats another man gone all to pieces bekaze av a woman i must ha been on forty or fifty prisoners gyards first an last an i hate ut new ivry time  lets see you were on lossons lanceys dugards and stebbinss that i can remember i said  ay an before that an before that  scores av thim he answered with a worn smile tis betther to die than to live for thim though whin raines comes out  hell be changin his kit at the jail now  hell think that too he shud ha shot himself an the woman by rights an made a clean bill av all now hes left the woman  she tuk tay wid dinah sunday gone last  an hes left himself mackies the lucky man  hes probably getting it hot where he is i ventured for i knew something of the dead corporals record  be sure av that said terence spitting over the edge of the verandah but fwhat hell get there is light marchinordher to fwhat hed ha got here if hed lived  surely not hed have gone on and forgotten like the others  did ye know mackie well sorr said terence  he was on the pattiala guard of honour last winter and i went out shooting with him in an ekka for the day and i found him rather an amusing man  well hell ha got shut av amusemints excipt turnin from wan side to the other these few years come i knew mackie an ive seen too many to be mistuk in the muster av wan man he might ha gone on an forgot as you say sorr but was a man wid an educashin an he used ut for his schames an the same educashin an talk an all that made him able to do fwhat he had a mind to wid a woman that same wud turn back again in the long run an tear him alive i cant say fwhat that i mane to say bekaze i dont

for he ud put the comether on any woman that trod the green earth av god an he knew ut like mackie thats roastin now he knew ut an niver did he put the comether on any woman save an excipt for the black shame tis not me that shud be talkin dear knows dear knows but the most av my mis  misallinces was for pure devilry an mighty sorry i have been whin harm came an time an again wid a girl ay an a woman too for the matter av that whin i have seen by the eyes av her that i was makin more throuble than i talked i have hild off an let be for the sake av the mother that bore me but larry im thinkin

sight of a white uniform skulking behind hedge  the sergeants gone visiting said a voice  thin i command here an i will have no sneakin away to the bazar an huntin for you wid a pathrol at midnight nalson for i know uts you come back to the verandah  nalson detected slunk back to his fellows there was a grumble that died away in a minute or two and terence turning on the other side went on  that was the last i saw av larry for a while exchange is the same as death for not thinkin an by token i married dinah an that kept me from remimberin ould times thin we wint up to the front an ut tore my heart in tu to lave dinah at the depot in pindi consequint whin was at the front i fought circumspectuous till i warrmed up an thin i fought double tides you remimber fwhat i tould you in the gyardgate av the fight at silvers theatre  wots that about silvers theayter said ortheris quickly over his shoulder  nothin little man a tale that ye know as i was sayin afther that fight us av the ould rigmint an the tyrone was all mixed together takin shtock ay the dead an av coorse i wint about to find if there was any man that remimbered me the second man i came acrost  an how id missed him in the fight i do not know  was larry an a fine man he looked but oulder by token that he had a call to be larry sez i how is ut wid you  yere callin the wrong man he sez wid his gentlemans smile larry has been dead these three years they call him loveo women now he sez by that i knew the ould divil was in him yet but the ind av a fight is no time for the beginnin av confession so we sat down an talked av times  they tell me youre a married man he sez puffing slow at his poipe are ye happy  i will be whin i get back to depot i sez tis a reconnaissance honeymoon now  im married too he sez puffin slow an more slow an stopperin wid his forefinger  sind you happiness i sez thats the best hearin for a long time  are ye av that opinion he sez an thin he began talkin av the campaign the sweat av silvers theatre was not dhry upon him an he was prayin for more work i was well contint to lie and listen to the cookpot lids  whin he got up off the ground he shtaggered a little an laned over all twisted  yeve got more than ye bargained for i sez take an inventory larry tis like youre hurt  he turned round stiff as a ramrod an damned the eyes av me up an down for an impartinent irishfaced ape if that had been in barricks id ha stretched him an no more said but twas at the front an afther such a fight as silvers theatre i knew there was no callin a man to account for his timpers he might as well ha kissed me aftherwards i was well pleased i kept my fistes home then our captain crook  cruiknabulleen  came up hed been talkin to the little orfcer bhoy av the tyrone were all cut to windystraws he sez but the tyrone are damned short for noncoms go you over there mulvaney an be deputysergeant corpral lance an everything else ye can lay hands on till i bid you stop  i wint over an tuk hould there was wan sergeant left standin an theyd pay no heed to him the remnint was me an twas high time i came some i talked to an some i did not but before night the bhoys av the tyrone stud to attention begad if i sucked on my poipe above a whishper betune you an me an bobs i was commandin the company an that was what cruik had thransferred me for an the little orfcer bhoy knew ut and i knew ut but the compny did not and there mark you is the vartue that no money an no dhrill can buy  the vartue av the ould soldier that knows his orfcers work an does ut  at the salute  thin the tyrone wid the ould rigmint in touch was sint maraudin and prowlin acrost the hills promishcuous an unsatisfactory tis my privit opinion that a ginral does not know half his time fwhat to do wid threequarthers his command so he shquats on his hunkers an bids thim run round an round forninst him while he considhers on ut whin by the process av nature they get sejuced into a big fight that was none av their seekin he sez obsarve my shuparior janius i meant ut to come so we ran round an about an all we got was shootin into the camp at night an rushin empty sungars wid the long bradawl an bein hit from behind rocks till we was wore out  all except loveowomen that puppydog business was mate an dhrink to him begad he cud niver get enough av ut me well knowin that it is just this desultorial campaignin that kills the best men an suspicionin that if i was cut the little orfcer bhoy wud expind all his men in thryin to get out i wud lie most powerful doggo whin i heard a shot an curl my long legs behind a bowlder an run like blazes whin the ground was clear faith if i led the tyrone in rethreat wanst i led them forty times loveowomen wud stay pottin an pottin from behind a rock and wait till the fire was heaviest an thin stand up an fire manheight clear he wud lie out in camp too at night snipin at the shadows for he niver tuk a mouthful av slape my commandin orfcer  save his little soul  cud not see the beauty av of my strategims an whin the ould rigmint crossed us an that was wanst a week hed throt off to cruik wid his big blue eyes as round as saucers an lay an information against me i heard thim wanst talkin through the tentwall an i nearly laughed  he runs  runs like a hare sez the little orfcer bhoy tis demoralisin my men  ye damned little fool sez cruik

evenin very contempshus youre growin very jeldy wid your feet among gentlemen he sez among gentlemen thats called no pretty name  among privits tis different i sez get back to your tent im sergeant here i sez  there was just enough in the voice av me to tell him he was playin wid his life betune his teeth he wint off an i noticed that this man that was contempshus set off from the halt wid a shunt as tho he was bein kicked behind that same night there was a paythan picnic in the hills about an firin into our tents fit to wake the livin dead lie down all i sez lie down an kape still theyll no more than waste ammunition  i heard a mans feet on the ground an thin a tini joinin in the chorus id been lyin warm thinkin av dinah an all but i crup out wid the bugle for to look round in case there was a rush an the tini was flashin at the foreind av the camp an the hill near by was fair flickerin wid longrange fire undher the starlight i beheld loveowomen settin on a rock wid his belt and helmet off he shouted wanst or twice an thin i heard him say they should ha got the range long ago maybe theyll fire at the flash thin he fired again an that dhrew a fresh volley and the long slugs that they chew in their teeth came floppin among the rocks like treetoads av a hot night thats better sez loveowomen oh lord how long how long he sez an at that he lit a match an held ut above his head  mad thinks i mad as a coot an i tuk wan stip forward an the nixt i knew was the sole av my boot flappin like a cavalry gydon an the  funnybone av my toes tinglin twas a clanecut shot  a slug  that niver touched sock or hide but set me barefut on the rocks at that i tuk loveo women by the scruff an threw him under a bowlder an whin i sat down i heard the bullets patterin on that good stone  ye may dhraw your own wicked fire i sez shakin him but im not goin to be kilt too  yeve come too soon he sez yeve come too soon in another minute they cud not ha missed me mother av god he sez fwhy did ye not lave me be now tis all to do again an he hides his face in his hands  so thats it i sez shakin him again thats th manin av your disobeyin ordhers  i dare not kill meself he sez rockin to

good to us all i sez for i saw his face will ye tell a man the throuble if tis not murder maybe well mend it yet  at that he laughed dyou remimber fwhat i said in the tyrone barricks about comin to you for ghostly consolation i have not forgot he sez that came back an the rest av my time is on me now terence ive fought ut off for months an months but the liquor will not bite any more terence he sez i cant get dhrunk  thin i knew he spoke the truth about bein in hell for whin liquor does not take hould the sowl av a man is rotten in him but me bein such as i was fwhat could i say to him  dimonds an pearls he begins again dimonds and pearls i have thrown away wid both hands  an fwhat have i left oh fwhat have i left  he was shakin an thremblin up against my shouldher an the slugs was singin overhead an i was wonderin whether my little bhoy wud have sinse enough to kape his men quiet through all this firin  so long as i did not think sez loveowomen so long i did not see  i wud not see  but i can now what ive lost the time an the place he sez an the very words i said whin ut pleased me to go off alone to hell but thin even thin he sez wrigglin tremenjus i wud not ha been happy there was too much behind av me how cud i ha believed her sworn oath  me that have bruk mine again an again for the sport av seein thim cry an there are the  others he sez oh what will i do  what will i do he rocked back an forward again an i think he was cryin like wan av the women he dealt wid  the full half av fwhat he said was brigade ordhers to me but from the rest an the remnint i suspicioned somethin av his throuble twas the judgmint av god had grup the heel av him as i tould him twould in the tyrone barricks the slugs was singin over our rock more an more an i sez for to divart him let bad alone i sez theyll be thryin to rush the camp in a minut  i had no more than said that whin a paythan man crep up on his belly wid his knife betune his teeth not twinty yards from us loveowomen jumped up an fetched a yell an the man saw him an ran at him hed left his rifle under the rock wid the knife loveowomen niver turned a hair but by the living power for i saw ut a stone twisted under the paythan mans feet an he came down full sprawl an his knife wint tinklin acrost the rocks i tould you i was cain sez loveowomen fwhats the use av killin him hes an honest man  by compare  i was not dishputin about the morils av paythans that tide so i dhropped loveowomens burt acrost the mans face an hurry into camp i sez for this may be the first av a rush  there was no rush afther all though we waited undher arms to give thim a chanst the paythan man must ha come alone for the mischief an afther a while loveowomen wint back to his tint wid that quare lurchin sindoff in his walk that i cud niver undherstand begad i pitied him an the more bekaze he made me think for the rest av the night av the day whin i was confirmed corpril not actin leftenant an my thoughts was not good  ye can undherstand that afther that night we came to talkin a dale together an bit by bit ut came out fwhat id suspicioned the whole av his carrins on an divilmints had come back on him hard as liquor comes back whin youve been on the dhrink for a wake all hed said an all hed done an only he cud tell how much that was come back an there was niver a minuts peace in his sowl twas the horrors widout any cause to see an yet an yet  fwhat am i talkin av hed ha taken the horrors wid thankfulness beyon the repentince av the man an that was beyon the natur av man  awful awful to behould  there was more that was worst than any repentince av the scores an scores that he called over in his mind an they were dhrivin him mad there was mark you wan woman av all an she was not his wife that cut him to the quick av his marrow twas there he said that hed thrown away dimonds an pearls past count an thin hed begin again like a blind byle in an oilmill walkin round an round to considher him that was beyond all touch av being happy this side hell how happy he wud ha been wid her the more he considhered the more hed consate himself that hed lost mighty happiness an thin he wud work ut all backwards an cry that he niver cud ha been happy anyways  time an time an again in camp on prade ay an in action ive seen that man shut his eyes an duck his head as you wud duck to the flicker av a baynit for twas thin he tould me that the thought av all hed missed came an stud forninst him like redhot irons for what hed done wid the others he was sorry but he did not care but this wan woman that ive tould of by the hilts av god she made him pay for all the others twice over niver did i know that a man cud enjure such tormint widout his heart crackin in his ribs an i have been  terence turned the pipestem

evenshually we finished our promnade acrost the hills and thanks to me for the same there was no casualties an no glory the campaign was comin to an ind an all the rigmints was bein drawn together for to be sint back home loveowomen was mighty sorry bekaze he had no work to do an all his time to think in ive heard that man talkin to his beltplate an his sidearms while he was soldierin thim all to

ann for ill marry you yet on a fourpny bit as a timeexpired maaan  barrack room ballad   an awful thing has happened my friend private mulvaney who went home in the serapis timeexpired not very long ago has come back to india as a civilian it was all dinah shadds fault she could not stand the poky little lodgings and she missed her servant abdullah more than words could tell the fact was that the mulvaneys had been out here too long and had lost touch of england  mulvaney knew a contractor on one of the new central india lines and wrote to him for some sort of work the contractor said that if mulvaney could pay the passage he would give him command of a gang of coolies for old sakes sake the pay was eightyfive rupees a month and dinah shadd said that if terence did not accept she would make his life a basted purgathory therefore the mulvaneys came out as civilians which was a great and terrible fall though mulvaney tried to disguise it by saying that he was kernel on the railway line an a consequinshal man  he wrote me an invitation on a toolindent form to visit him and i came down to the funny little construction bungalow at the side of the line dinah shadd had planted peas about and about and nature had spread all manner of green stuff round the place there was no change in mulvaney except the change of clothing which was deplorable but could not be helped he was standing upon his trolly haranguing a gangman and his shoulders were as well drilled and his big thick chin was as cleanshaven as ever  im a civilian now said mulvaney cud you tell that i was iver a martial man dont answer sorr av youre strainin betune a complimint an a lie theres no houldin dinah shadd now shes got a house av her own go inside an dhrink tay out av chiny in the drrrrawinroom an thin well dhrink like christians undher the tree here scutt ye naygurfolk theres a sahib come to call on me an thats more than hell iver do for you onless you run get out an go on pilin up the earth quick till sundown   when we three were comfortably settled under the big sisham in front of the bungalow and the first rush of questions and answers about privates ortheris and learoyd and old times and places had died away mulvaney said reflectively  glory be theres no prade tomorrow an no bunheaded corprilbhoy to give you his lip an yit i dont know tis harrd to be something ye niver were an niver meant to be an all the ould days shut up along wid your papers eyah im growin rusty an tis the will av god that a man mustnt serve his quane for time an all  he helped himself to a fresh peg and sighed furiously  let your beard grow mulvaney said i and then you wont be troubled with those notions youll be a real civilian  dinah shadd had told me in the drawingroom of her desire to coax mulvaney into letting his beard grow twas so civilianlike said poor dinah who hated her husbands hankering for his old life  dinah shadd youre a dishgrace to an honust clanescraped man said mulvaney without replying to me grow a beard on your own chin darlint and lave my razors alone theyre all that stand betune me and disrispectability av i didnt shave i wud be torminted wid an outrajis thurrst for theres nothin so dhryin to the throat as a big billygoat beard waggin undher the chin ye wudnt have me dhrink always dinah shadd by the same token youre kapin me crool dhry now let me look at that whiskey  the whiskey was lent and returned but dinah shadd who had been just as eager as her husband in asking after old friends rent me with   i take shame for you sorr coming down here though the saints know youre as welkim as the daylight whin you do come  an upsettin terences head wid your nonsense about  about fwhats much betther forgotten he bein a civilian now an you niver was aught else can you not let the arrmy rest tis not good for terence  i took refuge by mulvaney for dinah shadd has a temper of her own  let be  let be said mulvaney tis only wanst in a way i can talk about the ould days then to me  ye say dhrumshticks is well an his lady tu i niver knew how i liked the gray garron till i was shut av him an asia  dhrumshticks was the nickname of the colonel commanding mulvaneys old regiment   will you be seein him again you will thin tell him  mulvaneys eyes began to twinkle  tell him wid privit   mister terence interrupted dinah shadd now the divil an all his angils an the firmament av hiven fly away wid the mister an the sin av makin me swear be on your confession dinah shadd privit i tell ye wid privit mulvaneys best obedience that but for me the last timeexpired wud be still pullin hair on their way to the sea  he threw himself back in the chair chuckled and was silent  mrs mulvaney i said please take up the whiskey and dont let him have it until he has told the story  dinah shadd dexterously whipped the bottle away saying at the same time tis nothing to be proud av and thus captured by the enemy mulvaney spake   twas on chuseday week i was behaderin round wid the gangs on the bankmint  ive taught the hoppers how to kape step an stop screechin  whin a headgangman comes up to me wid about two inches av shirttail hanging round his neck an

good lave well dhrink to the ould rigmint  three fingers  standin up and we drank   the mutiney of the mavericks  sec 7 1  causing or conspiring with other persons to cause a mutiny or sedition in forces belonging to her majestys regular forces reserve forces auxiliary forces or navy  when three obscure gentlemen in san francisco argued on insufficient premises they condemned a fellowcreature to a most unpleasant death in a far country which had nothing whatever to do with the united states they foregathered at the top of a tenementhouse in tehama street an unsavoury quarter of the city and there calling for certain drinks they conspired because they were conspirators by trade officially known as the third three of the i a a  an institution for the propagation of pure light not to be confounded with any others though it is affiliated to many the second three live in montreal and work among the poor there the first three have their home in new york not far from castle garden and write regularly once a week to a small house near one of the big hotels at boulogne what happens after that a particular section of scotland yard knows too well and laughs at a conspirator detests ridicule more men have been stabbed with lucrezia borgia daggers and dropped into the thames for laughing at head centres and triangles than for betraying secrets for this is human nature  the third three conspired over whiskey cocktails and a clean sheet of notepaper against the british empire and all that lay therein this work is very like what men without discernment call politics before a general election you pick out and discuss in the company of congenial friends all the weak points in your opponents organisation and unconsciously dwell upon and exaggerate all their mishaps till it seems to you a miracle that the hated party holds together for an hour  our principle is not so much active demonstration  that we leave to others  as passive embarrassment to weaken and unnerve said the first man wherever an organisation is crippled wherever confusion is thrown into any branch of any department we gain a step for those who take on the work we are but the forerunners he was a german enthusiast and editor of a newspaper from whose leading articles he quoted frequently  that cursed empire makes so many blunders of her own that unless we doubled the years average i guess it wouldnt strike her anything special had occurred said the second man are you prepared to say that all our resources are equal to blowing off the muzzle of a hundredton gun or spiking a tenthousandton ship on a plain rock in clear daylight they can beat us at our own game better join hands with the practical branches were in funds now try a direct scare in a crowded street they value their greasy hides he was the drag upon the wheel and an americanised irishman of the second generation despising his own race and hating the other he had learned caution  the third man drank his cocktail and spoke no word he was the strategist but unfortunately his knowledge of life was limited he picked a letter from his breastpocket and threw it across the table that epistle to the heathen contained some very concise directions from the first three in new york it said   the boom in black iron has already affected the eastern markets where our agents have been forcing down the englishheld stock among the smaller buyers who watch the turn of shares any immediate operations such as western bears would increase their willingness to unload  this however cannot be expected till they see clearly that foreign ironmasters are willing to cooperate mulcahy should be dispatched to feel the pulse of the market and act accordingly mavericks are at present the best for our purpose p d q  as a message referring to an iron crisis in pennsylvania it was interesting if not lucid as a new departure in organized attack on an outlying english dependency it was more than interesting  the second man read it through and murmured   already surely they are in too great a hurry all that dhulip singh could do in india he has done down to the distribution of his photographs among the peasantry ho ho the paris firm arranged that and he has no substantial money backing from the other power even our agents in india know he hasnt what is the use of our organisation wasting men on work that is already done of course the irish regiments in india are half mutinous as they stand  this shows how near a lie may come to the truth an irish regiment for just so long as it stands still is generally a hard handful to control being reckless and rough when however it is moved in the direction of musketryfiring it becomes strangely and unpatriotically content with its lot it has even been heard to cheer the queen with enthusiasm on these occasions  but the notion of tampering with the army was from the point of view of tehama street an altogether sound one there is no shadow of stability in the policy of an english government and the most sacred oaths of england would even if engrossed on vellum find very few buyers among colonies and dependencies that have suffered from vain beliefs but there remains to england always her army that cannot change except in the matter of uniform and equipment the officers may write to the papers demanding the heads of the horse guards in default of cleaner redress for grievances the men may break loose across a country town and seriously startle the publicans but neither officers nor men have it in their composition to mutiny after the continental manner the english people when they trouble to think about the army at all are and with justice absolutely assured that it is absolutely trustworthy imagine for a moment their emotions on realising that such and such a regiment was in open revolt from causes directly due to englands management of ireland they would probably send the regiment to the polls forthwith and examine their own consciences as to their duty to erin but they would never be easy any more and it was this vague unhappy mistrust that the i a a were labouring to produce  sheer waste of breath said the second man after a pause in the council i dont see the use of tampering with their foolarmy but it has been tried before and we must try it again it looks well in the reports if we send one man from here you may bet your life that other men are going too order up mulcahy  they ordered him up  a slim slight darkhaired young man devoured with that blind rancorous hatred of england that only reaches its full growth across the atlantic he had sucked it from his mothers breast in the little cabin at the back of the northern avenues of new york he had been taught his rights and his wrongs in german and irish on the canal fronts of chicago and san francisco held men who told him strange and awful things of the great blind power over the seas once when business took him across the atlantic he had served in an english regiment and being insubordinate had suffered extremely he drew all his ideas of england that were not bred by the cheaper patriotic prints from one ironfisted colonel and an unbending adjutant he would go to the mines if need be to teach his gospel and he went as his instructions advised p d q  which means with speed  to introduce embarrassment into an irish regiment already halfmutinous quartered among sikh peasantry all wearing miniatures of his highness dhulip singh maharaja of the punjab next their hearts and all eagerly expecting his arrival other information equally valuable was given him by his masters he was to be cautious but never to grudge expense in winning the hearts of the men in the regiment his mother in new york would supply funds and he was to write to her once a month life is pleasant for a man who has a mother in new york to send him two hundred pounds a year over and above his regimental pay  in process of time thanks to his intimate knowledge of drill and musketry exercise the excellent mulcahy wearing the corporals stripe went out in a troopship and joined her majestys royal loyal musketeers commonly known as the mavericks because they were masterless and unbranded cattle  sons of small farmers in county clare shoeless vagabonds of kerry herders of ballyvegan much wanted moonlighters from the bare rainy headlands of the south coast officered by omores bradys hills kilreas and the like never to outward seeming was there more promising material to work on the first three had chosen their regiment well it feared nothing that moved or talked save the colonel and the regimental roman catholic chaplain the fat father dennis who held the keys of heaven and hell and blared like an angry bull when he desired to be convincing him also it loved because on occasions of stress he was used to tuck up his cassock and charge with the rest into the merriest of the fray where he always found good man that the saints sent him a revolver when there was a fallen private to be protected or  but this came as an afterthought his own gray head to be guarded  cautiously as he had been instructed tenderly and with much beer mulcahy opened his projects to such as he deemed fittest to listen and these were one and all of that quaint crooked sweet profoundly irresponsible and profoundly lovable race that fight like fiends argue like children reason like women obey like men and jest like their own goblins of the rath through rebellion loyalty want woe or war the underground work of a conspiracy is always dull and very much the same the world over at the end of six months  the seed always falling on good ground  mulcahy spoke almost explicitly hinting darkly in the approved fashion at dread powers behind him and advising nothing more nor less than mutiny were they not dogs evilly treated had they not all their own and their national revenges to satisfy who in these days would do aught to nine hundred men in rebellion who again could stay them if they broke for the sea licking up on their way other regiments only too anxious to join and afterwards    here followed windy promises of gold and preferment office and honour ever dear to a certain type of irishman  as he finished his speech in the dusk of a twilight to his chosen associates there was a sound of a rapidly unslung belt behind him the arm of one dan grady flew out in the gloom and arrested something then said dan   mulcahy youre a great man an you do credit to whoever sent you walk about a bit while we think of it mulcahy departed elate he knew his words would sink deep  why the tripledashed asterisks did ye not let me belt him grunted a voice  because im not a fatheaded fool boys tis what hes been driving at these six months  our superior corpril with his education and his copies of the irish papers and his everlasting beer hes been sent for the purpose and thats where the money comes from can ye not see that mans a goldmine which horse egan here would have destroyed with a beltbuckle it would be throwing away the gifts of providence not to fall in with his little plans of coorse well mutny till alls dry shoot the colonel on the paradeground massacree the company officers ransack the arsenal and then  boys did he tell you what next he told me the other night when he was beginning to talk wild then were to join with the niggers and look for help from dhulip singh and the russians  and spoil the best campaign that ever was this side of hell danny id have lost the beer to ha given him the belting he requires  oh let him go this awhile man hes got no  no constructiveness but thats the eggmeat of his plan and you must understand that im in with it an so are you well want oceans of beer to convince us  firmaments full well give him talk for his money and one by one all the boysll come in and hell have a nest of nine hundred mutineers to squat in an give drink to  what makes me killingmad is his wanting us to do what the niggers did thirty years gone that an his pigs cheek in saying that other regiments would come along said a kerry man  thats not so bad as hintin we should loose off on the colonel  colonel be sugared id as soon as not put a shot through his helmet to see him jump and clutch his old horses head but mulcahy talks o shootin our compny orfcers accidental  he said that did he said horse egan  somethin like that anyways cant ye fancy ould barber brady wid a bullet in his lungs coughin like a sick monkey an sayin bhoys i do not mind your gettin dhrunk but you must hould your liquor like men the man that shot me is dhrunk ill suspend investigations for six hours while i get this bullet cut out and then   an then continued horse egan for the peppery majors peculiarities of speech and manner were as well known as his tanned face an then ye dissolute halfbaked puttyfaced scum o connemara if i find a man so much as lookin confused begad ill coortmartial the whole company a man that cant get over his liquor in six hours is not fit to belong to the mavericks  a shout of laughter bore witness to the truth of the sketch  its pretty to think of said the kerry man slowly mulcahy would have us do all the devilmint and get clear himself someways he wudnt be takin all this fools throuble in shpoilin the reputation of the regimint   reputation of your grandmothers pig said dan  well an he had a good reputation tu so its all right mulcahy must see his way to clear out behind him or hed not ha come so far talkin powers of darkness  did you hear anything of a regimental coortmartial among the black boneens these days half a company of em took one of the new draft an hanged him by his arms with a tentrope from a thirdstory verandah they gave no reason for so doin but he was half dead im thinking that the boneens are shortsighted it was a friend of mulcahys or a man in the same trade theyd a deal better ha taken his beer returned dan reflectively  better still ha handed him up to the colonel said horse egan onless  but sure the news wud be all over the counthry an give the regment a bad name  an thered be no reward for that man  he but went about talkin said the kerry man artlessly  you speak by your breed said dan with a laugh there was never a kerry man yet that wudnt sell his brother for a pipe o tobacco an a pat on the back from a pliceman  praise god im not a bloomin orangeman was the answer  no nor never will be said dan they breed men in ulster would you like to thry the taste of one  the kerry man looked and longed but forbore the odds of battle were too great then youll not even give mulcahy a  a strike for his money said the voice of horse egan who regarded what he called trouble of any kind as the pinnacle of felicity  dan answered not at all but crept on tiptoe with long strides to the messroom the men following the room was empty in a corner cased like the king of dahomeys state umbrella stood the regimental colours dan lifted them tenderly and unrolled in the light of the candles the record of the mavericks  tattered worn and hacked the white satin was darkened everywhere with big brown stains the gold threads on the crowned harp were frayed and discoloured and the red bull the totem of the mavericks was coffeehued the stiff embroidered folds whose price is human life rustled down slowly the mavericks keep their colours long and guard them very sacredly  vittoria salamanca toulouse waterloo moodkee ferozshah an sobraon  that was fought close next door here against the very beggars he wants us to join inkerman the alma sebastopol what are those little businesses compared to the campaigns of general mulcahy the mutny think o that the mutny an some dirty little matters in afghanistan an for that an these an those  dan pointed to the names of glorious battles  that yankee man with the partin in his hair comes an says as easy as have a drink    holy moses theres the captain  but it was the messsergeant who came in just as the men clattered out and found the colours uncased  from that day dated the mutiny of the mavericks to the joy of mulcahy and the pride of his mother in new york  the good lady who sent the money for the beer never so far as words went was such a mutiny the conspirators led by dan grady and horse egan poured in daily they were sound men men to be trusted and they all wanted blood but first they must have beer they cursed the queen they mourned over ireland they suggested hideous plunder of the indian countryside and then alas  some of the younger men would go forth and wallow on the ground in spasms of wicked laughter the genius of the irish for conspiracies is remarkable none the less they would swear no oaths but those of their own making which were rare and curious and they were always at pains to impress mulcahy with the risks they ran naturally the flood of beer wrought demoralisation but mulcahy confused the causes of things and when a very muzzy maverick smote a sergeant on the nose or called his commanding officer a baldheaded old lard bladder and even worse names he fancied that rebellion and not liquor was at the bottom of the outbreak other gentlemen who have concerned themselves in larger conspiracies have made the same error  the hot season in which they protested no man could rebel came to an end and mulcahy suggested a visible return for his teachings as to the actual upshot of the mutiny he cared nothing it would be enough if the english infatuatedly trusting to the integrity of their army should be startled with news of an irish regiment revolting from political considerations his persistent demands would have ended at dans instigation in a regimental belting which in all probability would have killed him and cut off the supply of beer had not he been sent on special duty some fifty miles away from the cantonment to cool his heels in a mud fort and dismount obsolete artillery then the colonel of the mavericks reading his newspaper diligently and scenting frontier trouble from afar posted to the army headquarters and pled with the commanderinchief for certain privileges to be granted under certain contingencies which contingencies came about only a week later when the annual little war on the border developed itself and the colonel returned to carry the good news to the mavericks he held the promise of the chief for active service and the men must get ready  on the evening of the same day mulcahy an unconsidered corporal  yet great in conspiracy  returned to cantonments and heard sounds of strife and howlings from afar off the mutiny had broken out and the barracks of the mavericks were one whitewashed pandemonium a private tearing through the barracksquare gasped in his ear service active service its a burnin shame oh joy the mavericks had risen on the eve of battle they would not  noble and loyal sons of ireland  serve the queen longer the news would flash through the countryside and over to england and he  mulcahy  the trusted of the third three had brought about the crash the private stood in the middle of the square and cursed colonel regiment officers and doctor particularly the doctor by his gods an orderly of the native cavalry regiment clattered through the mob of soldiers he was half lifted half dragged from his horse beaten on the back with mighty handclaps till his eyes watered and called all manner of endearing names yes the mavericks had fraternized with the native troops who then was the agent among the latter that had blindly wrought with mulcahy so well  an officer slunk almost ran from the mess to a barrack he was mobbed by the infuriated soldiery who closed round but did not kill him for he fought his way to shelter flying for the life mulcahy could have wept with pure joy and thankfulness the very prisoners in the guardroom were shaking the bars of their cells and howling like wild beasts and from every barrack poured the booming as of a big wardrum  mulcahy hastened to his own barrack he could hardly hear himself speak eighty men were pounding with fist and heel the tables and trestles  eighty men flushed with mutiny stripped to their shirt sleeves their knapsacks halfpacked for the march to the sea made the twoinch boards thunder again as they chanted to a tune that mulcahy knew well the sacred war song of the mavericks  listen in the north my boys theres trouble on the wind tramp o cossack hooves in front gray greatcoats behind trouble on the frontier of a most amazin kind trouble on the waters o the oxus  then as the table broke under the furious accompaniment  hurrah hurrah its north by west we go hurrah hurrah the chance we wanted so let em hear the chorus from umballa to moscow as we go marchin to the kremling  mother of all the saints in bliss and all the devils in cinders wheres my fine new sock widout the heel howled horse egan ransacking everybodys valise but his own he was engaged in making up deficiencies of kit preparatory to a campaign and in that work he steals best who steals last ah mulcahy youre in good time he shouted weve got the route and were off on thursday for a picnic wid the lancers next door  an ambulance orderly appeared with a huge basket full of lint rolls provided by the forethought of the queen for such as might need them later on horse egan unrolled his bandage and flicked it under mulcahys nose chanting   sheepskin an bees wax thunder pitch and plaster the more you try to pull it off the more it sticks the faster as i was goin to new orleans   you know the rest of it my irish americanjew boy by gad ye have to fight for the queen in the inside av a fortnight my darlin  a roar of laughter interrupted mulcahy looked vacantly down the room bid a boy defy his father when the pantomimecab is at the door or a girl develop a will of her own when her mother is putting the last touches to the first balldress but do not ask an irish regiment to embark upon mutiny on the eve of a campaign when it has fraternised with the native regiment that accompanies it and driven its officers into retirement with ten thousand clamorous questions and the prisoners dance for joy and the sick men stand in the open calling down all known diseases on the head of the doctor who has certified that they are medically unfit for active service at even the mavericks might have been mistaken for mutineers by one so unversed in their natures as mulcahy at dawn a girls school might have learned deportment from them they knew that their colonels hand had closed and that he who broke that iron discipline would not go to the front nothing in the world will persuade one of our soldiers when he is ordered to the north on the smallest of affairs that he is not immediately going gloriously to slay cossacks and cook his kettles in the palace of the czar a few of the younger men mourned for mulcahys beer because the campaign was to be conducted on strict temperance principles but as dan and horse egan said sternly weve got the beerman with us he shall drink now on his own hook  mulcahy had not taken into account the possibility of being sent on active service he had made up his mind that he would not go under any circumstances but fortune was against him  sickyou said the doctor who had served an unholy apprenticeship to his trade in tralee poorhouses youre only homesick and what you call varicose veins come from overeating a little gentle exercise will cure that and later mulcahy my man everybody is allowed to apply for a sickcertificate once if he tries it twice we call him by an ugly name go back to your duty and lets hear no more of your diseases  i am ashamed to say that horse egan enjoyed the study of mulcahys soul in those days and dan took an equal interest together they would communicate to their corporal all the dark lore of death which is the portion of those who have seen men die egan had the larger experience but dan the finer imagination mulcahy shivered when the former spoke of the knife as an intimate acquaintance or the latter dwelt with loving particularity on the fate of those who wounded and helpless had been overlooked by the ambulances and had fallen into the hands of the afghan womenfolk  mulcahy knew that the mutiny for the present at least was dead knew too that a change had come over dans usually respectful attitude towards him and horse egans laughter and frequent allusions to abortive conspiracies emphasised all that the conspirator had guessed the horrible fascination of the death stories however made him seek the mens society he learned much more than he had bargained for and in this manner it was on the last night before the regiment entrained to the front the barracks were stripped of everything movable and the men were too excited to sleep the bare walls gave out a heavy hospital smell of chloride of lime  and what said mulcahy in an awestricken whisper after some conversation on the eternal subject are you going to do to me dan this might have been the language of an able conspirator conciliating a weak spirit  youll see said dan grimly turning over in his cot or i rather shud say youll not see  this was hardly the language of a weak spirit mulcahy shook under the bedclothes  bc easy with him put in egan from the next cot he has got his chanst o goin clean listen mulcahy all we want is for the good sake of the regiment that you take your death standing up as a man shud theres be heaps an heaps of enemy  plenshus heaps go there an do all you can and die decent youll die with a good name there tis not a hard thing considerin  again mulcahy shivered  an how could a man wish to die better than fightin added dan consolingly  and if i wont said the corporal in a dry whisper  therell be a dale of smoke returned dan sitting up and ticking off the situation on his fingers sure to be an the noise of the firinll be tremenjus an well be running about up and down the regiment will but we horse and i  well stay by you mulcahy and never let you go maybe therell be an accident  its playing it low on me let me go for pitys sake let me go i never did you harm and  and i stood you as much beer as i could oh dont be hard on me dan you are  you were in it too you wont kill me up there will you  im not thinkin of the treason though you shud be glad any honest boys drank with you its for the regiment we cant have the shame o you bringin shame on us you went to the doctor quiet as a sick cat to get and stay behind an live with the women at the depot  you that wanted us to run to the sea in wolfpacks like the rebels none of your black blood dared to be but we knew about your goin to the doctor for he told in mess and its all over the regiment bein as we are your best friends we didnt allow any one to molest you yet we will see to you ourselves fight which you will  us or the enemy youll never lie in that cot again and theres more glory and maybe less kicks from fightin the enemy thats fair speakin  and he told us by word of mouth to go and join with the niggers  youve forgotten that dan said horse egan to justify sentence  whats the use of plaguin the man one shot pays for all sleep ye sound mulcahy but you onderstand do ye not  mulcahy for some weeks understood very little of anything at all save that ever at his elbow in camp or at parade stood two big men with soft voices adjuring him to commit harikari lest a worse thing should happen  to die for the honour of the regiment in decency among the nearest knives but mulcahy dreaded death he remembered certain things that priests had said in his infancy and his mother  not the one at new york  starting from her sleep with shrieks to pray for a husbands soul in torment it is well to be of a cultured intelligence but in time of trouble the weak human mind returns to the creed it sucked in at the breast and if that creed be not a pretty one trouble follows also the death he would have to face would be physically painful most conspirators have large imaginations mulcahy could see himself as he lay on the earth in the night dying by various causes they were all horrible the mother in new york was very far away and the regiment the engine that once you fall in its grip moves you forward whether you will or wont was daily coming closer to the enemy  they were brought to the field of marzunkatai and with the black boneens to aid they fought a fight that has never been set down in the newspapers in response many believe to the fervent prayers of father dennis the enemy not only elected to fight in the open but made a beautiful fight as many weeping irish mothers knew later they gathered behind walls or flickered across the open in shouting masses and were potvaliant in artillery it was expedient to hold a large reserve and wait for the psychological moment that was being prepared by the shrieking shrapnel therefore the mavericks lay down in open order on the brow of a hill to watch the play till their call should come father dennis whose duty was in the rear to smooth the trouble of the wounded had naturally managed to make his way to the foremost of his boys and lay like a black porpoise at length on the grass to him crawled mulcahy ashengray demanding absolution  wait till youre shot said father dennis sweetly theres a time for everything  dan grady chuckled as he blew for the fiftieth time into the breech of his speckless rifle mulcahy groaned and buried his head in his arms till a stray shot spoke like a snipe immediately above his head and a general heave and tremour rippled the line other shots followed and a few took effect as a shriek or a grunt attested the officers who had been lying down with the men rose and began to walk steadily up and down the front of their companies  this manoeuvre executed not for publication but as a guarantee of good faith to soothe men demands nerve you must not hurry you must not look nervous though you know that you are a mark for every rifle within extreme range and above all if you are smitten you must make as little noise as possible and roll inwards through the files it is at this hour when the breeze brings the first salt whiff of the powder to noses rather cold at the tip and the eye can quietly take in the appearance of each red casualty that the strain on the nerves is strongest scotch regiments can endure for half a day and abate no whit of their zeal at the end english regiments sometimes sulk under punishment while the irish like the french are apt to run forward by ones and twos which is just as bad as running back the truly wise commandant of highlystrung troops allows them in seasons of waiting to hear the sound of their own voices uplifted in song there is a legend of an english regiment that lay by its arms under fire chaunting sam hall to the horror of its newly appointed and pious colonel the black boneens who were suffering more than the mavericks on a hill half a mile away began presently to explain to all who cared to listen   well sound the jubilee from the centre to the sea and ireland shall be free says the shanvan vogh  sing boys said father dennis softly it looks as if we cared for their afghan peas  dan grady raised himself to his knees and opened his mouth in a song imparted to him as to most of his comrades in the strictest confidence by mulcahy  that mulcahy then lying limp and fainting on the grass the chill fear of death upon him  company after company caught up the words which the i a a say are to herald the general rising of erin and to breathe which except to those duly appointed to hear is death wherefore they are printed in this place  the saxon in heavens just balance is weighed his doom like belshazzars in death has been cast and the hand of the venger shall never be stayed till his race faith and speech are a dream of the past  they were heartfilling lines and they ran with a swirl the i a a are better served by their pens than their petards dan clapped mulcahy merrily on the back asking him to sing up the officers lay down again there was no need to walk any more their men were soothing themselves thunderously thus   st mary in heaven has written the vow that the land shall not rest till the heretic blood from the babe at the breast to the hand at the plough has rolled to the ocean like shannon in flood  ill speak to you after alls over said father dennis authoritatively in dans ear whats the use of confessing to me when you do this foolishness dan youve been playing with fire ill lay you more penance in a week than   come along to purgatory with us father dear the boneens are on the move theyll let us go now  the regiment rose to the blast of the bugle as one man but one man there was who rose more swiftly than all the others for half an inch of bayonet was in the fleshy part of his leg  youve got to do it said dan grimly do it decent anyhow and the roar of the rush drowned his words for the rear companies thrust forward the first still singing as they swung down the slope   from the child at the breast to the hand at the plough shall roll to the ocean like shannon in flood  they should have sung it in the face of england not of the afghans whom it impressed as much as did the wild irish yell  they came down singing said the unofficial report of the enemy borne from village to village the next day they continued to sing and it was written that our men could not abide when they came it is believed that there was magic in the aforesaid song  dan and horse egan kept themselves in the neighbourhood of mulcahy twice the man would have bolted back in the confusion twice he was heaved kicked and shouldered back again into the unpaintable inferno of a hotly contested charge  at the end the panic excess of his fear drove him into madness beyond all human courage his eyes staring at nothing his mouth open and frothing and breathing as one in a cold bath he went forward demented while dan toiled after him the charge checked at a high mud wall it was mulcahy who scrambled up tooth and nail and hurled down among the bayonets the amazed afghan who barred his way it was mulcahy keeping to the straight line of the rabid dog who led a collection of ardent souls at a newly unmasked battery and flung himself on the muzzle of a gun as his companions danced among the gunners it was mulcahy who ran wildly on from that battery into the open plain where the enemy were retiring in sullen groups his hands were empty he had lost helmet and belt and he was bleeding from a wound in the neck dan and horse egan panting and distressed had thrown themselves down on the ground by the captured guns when they noticed mulcahys charge  mad said horse egan critically mad with fear hes going straight to his death an shoutings no use  let him go watch now if we fire well hit him maybe  the last of a hurrying crowd of afghans turned at the noise of shod feet behind him and shifted his knife ready to hand this he saw was no time to take prisoners mulcahy tore on sobbing the straightheld blade went home through the defenceless breast and the body pitched forward almost before a shot from dans rifle brought down the slayer and still further hurried the afghan retreat the two irishmen went out to bring in their dead  he was given the point and that was an easy death said horse egan viewing the corpse but would you ha shot him danny if he had lived  he didnt live so theres no sayin but i doubt i wud have bekaze of the fun he gave us  let alone the beer hike up his legs horse and well bring him in perhaps tis better this way  they bore the poor limp body to the mass of the regiment lolling openmouthed on their rifles and there was a general snigger when one of the younger subalterns said that was a good man  phew said horse egan when a burialparty had taken over the burden im powerful dhry and this reminds me therell be no more beer at all  fwhy not said dan with a twinkle in his eye as he stretched himself for rest are we not conspirin all we can an while we conspire are we not entitled to free dhrinks sure his ould mother in new york would not let her sons comrades perish of drouth  if she can be reached at the end of a letter  youre a janius said horse egan 0 coorse she will not i wish this crool war was over an wed get back to canteen faith the commanderinchief ought to be hanged in his own little sword belt for makin us work on wather  the mavericks were generally of horse egans opinion so they made haste to get their work done as soon as possible and their industry was rewarded by unexpected peace  we can fight the sons of adam said the tribesmen but we cannot fight the sons of eblis and this regiment never stays still in one place let us therefore come in they came in and this regiment withdrew to conspire under the leadership of dan grady  excellent as a subordinate dan failed altogether as a chiefin command  possibly because he was too much swayed by the advice of the only man in the regiment who could manufacture more than one kind of handwriting the same mail that bore to mulcahys mother in new york a letter from the colonel telling her how valiantly her son had fought for the queen and how assuredly he would have been recommended for the victoria cross had he survived carried a communication signed i grieve to say by that same colonel and all the officers of the regiment explaining their willingness to do anything which is contrary to the regulations and all kinds of revolutions if only a little money could be forwarded to cover incidental expenses daniel grady esquire would receive funds vice mulcahy who was unwell at this present time of writing  both letters were forwarded from new york to tehama street san francisco with marginal comments as brief as they were bitter the third three read and looked at each other then the second conspirator  he who believed in joining hands with the practical branches  began to laugh and on recovering his gravity said gentlemen i consider this will be a lesson to us were left again those cursed irish have let us down i knew they would but  here he laughed afresh  id give considerable to know what was at the back of it all  his curiosity would have been satisfied had he seen dan grady discredited regimental conspirator trying to explain to his thirsty comrades in india the nonarrival of funds from new york   the man who was  the earth gave up her dead that tide into our camp he came and said his say and went his way and left our hearts aflame  keep tally  on the gunbutt score the vengeance we must take when god shall bring full reckoning for our dead comrades sake  ballad  let it be clearly understood that the russian is a delightful person till he tucks in his shirt as an oriental he is charming it is only when he insists upon being treated as the most easterly of western peoples instead of the most westerly of easterns that he becomes a racial anomaly extremely difficult to handle the host never knows which side of his nature is going to turn up next  dirkovitch was a russian  a russian of the russians  who appeared to get his bread by serving the czar as an officer in a cossack regiment and corresponding for a russian newspaper with a name that was never twice alike he was a handsome young oriental fond of wandering through unexplored portions of the earth and he arrived in india from nowhere in particular at least no living man could ascertain whether it was by way of balkh badakshan chitral beluchistan or nepaul or anywhere else the indian government being in an unusually affable mood gave orders that he was to be civilly treated and shown everything that was to be seen so he drifted talking bad english and worse french from one city to another till he foregathered with her majestys white hussars in the city of peshawur which stands at the mouth of that narrow swordcut in the hills that men call the khyber pass he was undoubtedly an officer and he was decorated after the manner of the russians with little enamelled crosses and he could talk and though this has nothing to do with his merits he had been given up as a hopeless task or cask by the black tyrone who individually and collectively with hot whiskey and honey mulled brandy and mixed spirits of every kind had striven in all hospitality to make him drunk and when the black tyrone who are exclusively irish fail to disturb the peace of head of a foreigner  that foreigner is certain to be a superior man  the white hussars were as conscientious in choosing their wine as in charging the enemy all that they possessed including some wondrous brandy was placed at the absolute disposition of dirkovitch and he enjoyed himself hugely  even more than among the black tyrones  but he remained distressingly european through it all the white hussars were my dear true friends fellowsoldiers glorious and brothers inseparable he would unburden himself by the hour on the glorious future that awaited the combined arms of england and russia when their hearts and their territories should run side by side and the great mission of civilising asia should begin that was unsatisfactory because asia is not going to be civilised after the methods of the west there is too much asia and she is too old you cannot reform a lady of many lovers and asia has been insatiable in her flirtations aforetime she will never attend sundayschool or learn to vote save with swords for tickets  dirkovitch knew this as well as any one else but it suited him to talk specialcorrespondently and to make himself as genial as he could now and then he volunteered a little a very little information about his own sotnia of cossacks left apparently to look after themselves somewhere at the back of beyond he had done rough work in central asia and had seen rather more helpyourself fighting than most men of his years but he was careful never to betray his superiority and more than careful to praise on all occasions the appearance drill uniform and organisation of her majestys white hussars and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all  from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title  the only persons who did not share the general regard for the white hussars were a few thousand gentlemen of jewish extraction who lived across the border and answered to the name of pathan they had once met the regiment officially and for something less than twenty minutes but the interview which was complicated with many casualties had filled them with prejudice they even called the white hussars children of the devil and sons of persons whom it would be perfectly impossible to meet in decent society yet they were not above making their aversion fill their moneybelts the regiment possessed carbines  beautiful martinihenry carbines that would lob a bullet into an enemys camp at one thousand yards and were even handier than the long rifle therefore they were coveted all along the border and since demand inevitably breeds supply they were supplied at the risk of life and limb for exactly their weight in coined silver  seven and one half pounds weight of rupees or sixteen pounds sterling reckoning the rupee at par they were stolen at night by snakyhaired thieves who crawled on their stomachs under the nose of the sentries they disappeared mysteriously from locked armracks and in the hot weather when all the barrack doors and windows were open they vanished like puffs of their own smoke the border people desired them for family vendettas and contingencies but in the long cold nights of the northern indian winter they were stolen most extensively the traffic of murder was liveliest among the hills at that season and prices ruled high the regimental guards were first doubled and then trebled a trooper does not much care if he loses a weapon  government must make it good  but he deeply resents the loss of his sleep the regiment grew very angry and one riflethief bears the visible marks of their anger upon him to this hour that incident stopped the burglaries for a time and the guards were reduced accordingly and the regiment devoted itself to polo with unexpected results for it beat by two goals to one that very terrible polo corps the lushkar light horse though the latter had four ponies apiece for a short hours fight as well as a native officer who played like a lambent flame across the ground  they gave a dinner to celebrate the event the lushkar team came and dirkovitch came in the fullest full uniform of a cossack officer which is as full as a dressinggown and was introduced to the lushkars and opened his eyes as he regarded they were lighter men than the hussars and they carried themselves with the swing that is the peculiar right of the punjab frontier force and all irregular horse like everything else in the service it has to be learnt but unlike many things it is never forgotten and remains on the body till death  the great beamroofed messroom of the white hussars was a sight to be remembered all the mess plate was out on the long table  the same table that had served up the bodies of five officers after a forgotten fight long and long ago  the dingy battered standards faced the door of entrance clumps of winterroses lay between the silver candlesticks and the portraits of eminent officers deceased looked down on their successors from between the heads of sambhur nilghai markhor and pride of all the mess two grinning snowleopards that had cost bassetholmer four months leave that he might have spent in england instead of on the road to thibet and the daily risk of his life by ledge snow slide and grassy slope  the servants in spotless white muslin and the crest of their regiments on the brow of their turbans waited behind their masters who were clad in the scarlet and gold of the white hussars and the cream and silver of the lushkar light horse dirkovitchs dull green uniform was the only dark spot at the board but his big onyx eyes made up for it he was fraternising effusively with the captain of the lushkar team who was wondering how many of dirkovitchs cossacks his own dark wiry down countrymen could account for in a fair charge but one does not speak of these things openly  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the immemorial custom till all tongues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their messbills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever he be by sea or by land dirkovitch rose with his brothers glorious but he could not understand no one but an officer can tell what the toast means and the bulk have more sentiment than comprehension immediately after the little silence that follows on the ceremony there entered the native officer who had played for the lushkar team he could not of course eat with the mess but he came in at dessert all six feet of him with the blue and silver turban atop and the big black boots below the mess rose joyously as he thrust forward the hilt of his sabre in token of fealty for the colonel of the white hussars to touch and dropped into a vacant chair amid shouts of rung ho hira singh which being translated means go in and win  did i whack you over the knee old man ressaidar sahib what the devil made you play that kicking pig of a pony in the last ten minutes shabash ressaidar sahib then the voice of the colonel the health of ressaidar hira singh  after the shouting had died away hira singh rose to reply for he was the cadet of a royal house the son of a kings son and knew what was due on these occasions thus he spoke in the vernacular  colonel sahib and officers of this regiment much honour have you done me this will i remember we came down from afar to play you but we were beaten  no fault of yours ressaidar sahib played on our own ground y know your ponies were cramped from the railway dont apologise therefore perhaps we will come again if it be so ordained  hear hear hear indeed bravo hsh then we will play you afresh happy to meet you till there are left no feet upon our ponies thus far for sport he dropped one hand on his swordhilt and his eye wandered to dirkovitch lolling back in his chair but if by the will of god there arises any other game which is not the polo game then be assured colonel sahib and officers that we will play it out side by side though they again his eye sought dirkovitch though they i say have fifty ponies to our one horse and with a deep mouthed rung ho that sounded like a musketbutt on flagstones he sat down amid leaping glasses  dirkovitch who had devoted himself steadily to the brandy  the terrible brandy aforementioned  did not understand nor did the expurgated translations offered to him at all convey the point decidedly hira singhs was the speech of the evening and the clamour might have continued to the dawn had it not been broken by the noise of a shot without that sent every man feeling at his defenseless left side then there was a scuffle and a yell of pain  carbinestealing again said the adjutant calmly sinking back in his chair this comes of reducing the guards i hope the sentries have killed him  the feet of armed men pounded on the verandah flags and it was as though something was being dragged  why dont they put him in the cells till the morning said the colonel testily see if theyve damaged him sergeant  the mess sergeant fled out into the darkness and returned with two troopers and a corporal all very much perplexed  caught a man stealin carbines sir said the corporal leastways e was crawlin towards the barricks sir past the main road sentries an the sentry e sez sir   the limp heap of rags upheld by the three men groaned never was seen so destitute and demoralised an afghan he was turbanless shoeless caked with dirt and all but dead with rough handling hira singh started slightly at the sound of the mans pain dirkovitch took another glass of brandy  what does the sentry say said the colonel  sez e speaks english sir said the corporal  so you brought him into mess instead of handing him over to the sergeant if he spoke all the tongues of the pentecost youve no business   again the bundle groaned and muttered little mildred had risen from his place to inspect he jumped back as though he had been shot  perhaps it would be better sir to send the men away said he to the colonel for he was a much privileged subaltern he put his arms round the ragbound horror as he spoke and dropped him into a chair it may not have been explained that the littleness of mildred lay in his being six feet four and big in proportion the corporal seeing that an officer was disposed to look after the capture and that the colonels eye was beginning to blaze promptly removed himself and his men the mess was left alone with the carbinethief who laid his head on the table and wept bitterly hopelessly and inconsolably as little children weep  hira singh leapt to his feet colonel sahib said he that man is no afghan for they weep ai ai nor is he of hindustan for they weep oh ho he weeps after the fashion of the white men who say ow ow  now where the dickens did you get that knowledge hira singh said the captain of the lushkar team  hear him said hira singh simply pointing at the crumpled figure that wept as though it would never cease  he said my god said little mildred i heard him say it  the colonel and the messroom looked at the man in silence it is a horrible thing to hear a man cry a woman can sob from the top  of her palate or her lips or anywhere else but a man must cry from his diaphragm and it rends him to pieces  poor devil said the colonel coughing tremendously we ought to send him to hospital hes been manhandled  now the adjutant loved his carbines they were to him as his grandchildren the men standing in the first place he grunted rebelliously i can understand an afghan stealing because hes built that way but i cant understand his crying that makes it worse  the brandy must have affected dirkovitch for he lay back in his chair and stared at the ceiling there was nothing special in the ceiling beyond a shadow as of a huge black coffin owing to some peculiarity in the construction of the messroom this shadow was always thrown when the candles were lighted it never disturbed the digestion of the white hussars they were in fact rather proud of it  is he going to cry all night said the colonel or are we supposed to sit up with little mildreds guest until he feels better  the man in the chair threw up his head and stared at the mess oh my god he said and every soul in the mess rose to his feet then the lushkar captain did a deed for which he ought to have been given the victoria cross  distinguished gallantry in a fight against overwhelming curiosity he picked up his team with his eyes as the hostess picks up the ladies at the opportune moment and pausing only by the colonels chair to say this isnt our affair you know sir led them into the verandah and the gardens hira singh was the last to go and he looked at dirkovitch but dirkovitch had departed into a brandyparadise of his own his lips moved without sound and he was studying the coffin on the ceiling  white  white all over said bassetholmer the adjutant what a pernicious renegade he must be i wonder where he came from  the colonel shook the man gently by the arm and who are you said he  there was no answer the man stared round the messroom and smiled in the colonels face little mildred who was always more of a woman than a man till boot and saddle was sounded repeated the question in a voice that would have drawn confidences from a geyser the man only smiled dirkovitch at the far end of the table slid gently from his chair to the floor no son of adam in this present imperfect world can mix the hussars champagne with the hussars brandy by five and eight glasses of each without remembering the pit whence he was digged and descending thither the band began to play the tune with which the white hussars from the date of their formation have concluded all their functions they would sooner be disbanded than abandon that tune it is a part of their system the man straightened himself in his chair and drummed on the table with his fingers  i dont see why we should entertain lunatics said the colonel call a guard and send him off to the cells well look into the business in the morning give him a glass of wine first though  little mildred filled a sherryglass with the brandy and thrust it over to the man he drank and the tune rose louder and he straightened himself yet more then he put out his longtaloned hands to a piece of plate opposite and fingered it lovingly there was a mystery connected with that piece of plate in the shape of a spring which converted what was a sevenbranched candlestick three springs on each side and one in the middle into a sort of wheelspoke candelabrum he found the spring pressed it and laughed weakly he rose from his chair and inspected a picture on the wall then moved on to another picture the mess watching him without a word when he came to the mantelpiece he shook his head and seemed distressed a piece of plate representing a mounted hussar in full uniform caught his eye he pointed to it and then to the mantelpiece with inquiry in his eyes  what is it  oh what is it said little mildred then as a mother might speak to a child that is a horse yes a horse  very slowly came the answer in a thick passionless guttural yes i  have seen but  where is the horse  you could have heard the hearts of the mess beating as the men drew back to give the stranger full room in his wanderings there was no question of calling the guard  again he spoke  very slowly where is our horse  there is but one horse in the white hussars and his portrait hangs outside the door of the messroom he is the piebald drum horse the king of the regimental band that served the regiment for sevenandthirty years and in the end was shot for old age half the mess tore the thing down from its place and thrust it into the mans hands he placed it above the mantelpiece it clattered on the ledge as his poor hands dropped it and he staggered towards the bottom of the table falling into mildreds chair then all the men spoke to one another something after this fashion the drumhorse hasnt hung over the mantelpiece since 67 how does he know mildred go and speak to him again colonel what are you going to do oh dry up and give the poor devil a chance to pull himself together it isnt possible anyhow the mans a lunatic  little mildred stood at the colonels side talking in his ear will you be good enough to take your seats please gentlemen he said and the mess dropped into the chairs only dirkovitchs seat next to little mildreds was blank and little mildred himself had found hira singhs place the wideeyed messsergeant filled the glasses in dead silence once more the colonel rose but his hand shook and the port spilled on the table as he looked straight at the man in little mildreds chair and said hoarsely mr vice the queen there was a little pause but the man sprung to his feet and answered without hesitation the queen god bless her and as he emptied the thin glass he snapped the shank between his fingers  long and long ago when the empress of india was a young woman and there were no unclean ideals in the land it was the custom of a few messes to drink the queens toast in broken glass to the vast delight of the messcontractors the custom is now dead because there is nothing to break anything for except now and again the word of a government and that has been broken already  that settles it said the colonel with a gasp hes not a sergeant what in the world is he  the entire mess echoed the word and the volley of questions would have scared any man it was no wonder that the ragged filthy invader could only smile and shake his head  from under the table calm and smiling rose dirkovitch who had been roused from healthful slumber by feet upon his body by the side of the man he rose and the man shrieked and grovelled it was a horrible sight coming so swiftly upon the pride and glory of the toast that had brought the strayed wits together  dirkovitch made no offer to raise him but little mildred heaved him up in an instant it is not good that a gentleman who can answer to the queens toast should lie at the feet of a subaltern of cossacks  the hasty action tore the wretchs upper clothing nearly to the waist and his body was seamed with dry black scars there is only one weapon in the world that cuts in parallel lines and it is neither the cane nor the cat dirkovitch saw the marks and the pupils of his eyes dilated also his face changed he said something that sounded like shto ve takete and the man fawning answered chetyre  whats that said everybody together  his number that is number four you know dirkovitch spoke very thickly  what has a queens officer to do with a qualified number said the colonel and an unpleasant growl ran round the table  how can i tell said the affable oriental with a sweet smile he is a  how you have it  escape  runaway from over there he nodded towards the darkness of the night  speak to him if hell answer you and speak to him gently said little mildred settling the man in a chair it seemed most improper to all present that dirkovitch should sip brandy as he talked in purring spitting russian to the creature who answered so feebly and with such evident dread but since dirkovitch appeared to understand no one said a word all breathed heavily leaning forward in the long gaps of the conversation the next time that they have no engagements on hand the white hussars intend to go to st petersburg in a body to learn russian  he does not know how many years ago said dirkovitch facing the mess but he says it was very long ago in a war i think that there was an accident he says he was of this glorious and distinguished regiment in the war  the rolls the rolls holmer get the rolls said little mildred and the adjutant dashed off bareheaded to the orderly room where the musterrolls of the regiment were kept he returned just in time to hear dirkovitch conclude therefore my dear friends i am most sorry to say there was an accident which would have been reparable if he had apologised to that our colonel which he had insulted  then followed another growl which the colonel tried to beat down the mess was in no mood just then to weigh insults to russian colonels  he does not remember but i think that there was an accident and so he was not exchanged among the prisoners but he was sent to another place  how do you  say  the country so he says he came here he does not know how he came eh he was at chepany  the man caught the word nodded and shivered  at zhigansk and irkutsk i cannot understand how he escaped he says too that he was in the forests for many years but how many years he has forgotten  that with many things it was an accident done because he did not apologise to that our colonel ah  instead of echoing dirkovitchs sigh of regret it is sad to record that the white hussars livelily exhibited unchristian delight and other emotions hardly restrained by their sense of hospitality holmer flung the frayed and yellow regimental rolls on the table and the men flung themselves at these  steady fiftysix  fiftyfive  fiftyfour said holmer here we are lieutenant austin limmason missing that was before sebastopol what an infernal shame insulted one of their colonels and was quietly shipped off thirty years of his life wiped out  but he never apologised said hed see him damned first chorused the mess  poor chap i suppose he never had the chance afterwards how did he come here said the colonel  the dingy heap in the chair could give no answer  do you know who you are  it laughed weakly  do you know that you are limmason lieutenant limmason of the white hussars  swiftly as a shot came the answer in a slightly surprised tone yes im limmason of course the light died out in his eyes and the man collapsed watching every motion of dirkovitch with terror a flight from siberia may fix a few elementary facts in the mind but it does not seem to lead to continuity of thought the man could not explain how like a homing pigeon he had found his way to his own old mess again of what he had suffered or seen he knew nothing he cringed before dirkovitch as instinctively as he had pressed the spring of the candlestick sought the picture of the drumhorse and answered to the toast of the queen the rest was a blank that the dreaded russian tongue could only in part remove his head bowed on his breast and he giggled and cowered alternately  the devil that lived in the brandy prompted dirkovitch at this extremely inopportune moment to make a speech he rose swaying slightly gripped the tableedge while his eyes glowed like opals and began  fellowsoldiers glorious  true friends and hospitables it was an accident and deplorable  most deplorable here he smiled sweetly all round the mess but you will think of this little little thing so little is it not the czar posh i slap my fingers  i snap my fingers at him do i believe in him no but in us slav who has done nothing him i believe seventy  how much  millions peoples that have done nothing  not one thing posh napoleon was an episode he banged a hand on the table hear you old peoples we have done nothing in the world  out here all our work is to do and it shall be done old peoples get a way he waved his hand imperiously and pointed to the man you see him he is not good to see he was just one little  oh so little accident that no one remembered now he is  that so will you be brother soldiers so brave so will you be but you will never come back you will all go where he is gone or  he pointed to the great coffinshadow on the ceiling and muttering seventy millions  get away you old peoples fell asleep  sweet and to the point said little mildred whats the use of getting wroth lets make this poor devil comfortable  but that was a matter suddenly and swiftly taken from the loving hands of the white hussars the lieutenant had returned only to go away again three days later when the wail of the dead march and the tramp of the squadrons told the wondering station who saw no gap in the messtable that an officer of the regiment had resigned his newfound commission  and dirkovitch bland supple and always genial went away too by a night train little mildred and another man saw him off for he was the guest of the mess and even had he smitten the colonel with the open hand the law of that mess allowed no relaxation of hospitality  goodbye dirkovitch and a pleasant journey said little mildred  au revoir said the russian  indeed but we thought you were going home  yes but i will come again my dear friends is that road shut he pointed to where the north star burned over the khyber pass  by jove i forgot of course happy to meet you old man any time you like got everything you want cheroots ice bedding thats all right well au revoir dirkovitch  um said the other man as the taillights of the train grew small of  all  the  unmitigated  little mildred answered nothing but watched the north star and hummed a selection from recent simla burlesque that had much delighted the white hussars it ran   im sorry for mister bluebeard im sorry to cause him pain but a terrible spree theres sure to be when he comes back again    only a subaltern  not only to enforce by command but to encourage by example the energetic discharge of duty and the steady endurance of the difficulties and privations inseparable from military service  bengal army regulations  they made bobby wick pass an examination at sandhurst he was a gentleman before he was gazetted so when the empress announced that gentlemancadet robert hanna wick was posted as second lieutenant to the tyneside tail twisters at krab bokhar he became an officer and a gentleman which is an enviable thing and there was joy in the house of wick where mamma wick and all the little wicks fell upon their knees and offered incense to bobby by virtue of his achievements  papa wick had been a commissioner in his day holding authority over three millions of men in the chotabuldana division building great works for the good of the land and doing his best to make two blades of grass grow where there was but one before of course nobody knew anything about this in the little english village where he was just old mr wick and had forgotten that he was a companion of the order of the star of india  he patted bobby on the shoulder and said well done my boy  there followed while the uniform was being prepared an interval of pure delight during which bobby took brevetrank as a man at the womenswamped tennisparties and teafights of the village and i daresay had his joiningtime been extended would have fallen in love with several girls at once little country villages at home are very full of nice girls because all the young men come out to india to make their fortunes  india said papa wick is the place ive had thirty years of it and begad id like to go back again when you join the tail twisters youll be among friends if every one hasnt forgotten wick of chotabuldana and a lot of people will be kind to you for our sakes the mother will tell you more about outfit than i can but remember this stick to your regiment bobby  stick to your regiment youll see men all round you going into the staff corps and doing every possible sort of duty but regimental and you may be tempted to follow suit now so long as you keep within your allowance and i havent stinted you there stick to the line the whole line and nothing but the line be careful how you back another young fools bill and if you fall in love with a woman twenty years older than yourself dont tell me about it thats all  with these counsels and many others equally valuable did papa wick fortify bobby ere that last awful night at portsmouth when the officers quarters held more inmates than were provided for by the regulations and the libertymen of the ships fell foul of the drafts for india and the battle raged from the dockyard gates even to the slums of longport while the drabs of fratton came down and scratched the faces of the queens officers  bobby wick with an ugly bruise on his freckled nose a sick and shaky detachment to manoeuvre inship and the comfort of fifty scornful females to attend to had no time to feel homesick till the malabar reached midchannel when he doubled his emotions with a little guardvisiting and a great many other matters  the tail twisters were a most particular regiment those who knew them least said that they were eaten up with side but their reserve and their internal arrangements generally were merely protective diplomacy some five years before the colonel commanding had looked into the fourteen fearless eyes of seven plump and juicy subalterns who had all applied to enter the staff corps and had asked them why the three stars should he a colonel of the line command a dashed nursery for doubledashed bottle suckers who put on condemned tin spurs and rode qualified mokes at the hiatused heads of forsaken black regiments he was a rude man and a terrible wherefore the remnant took measures with the halfbutt as an engine of public opinion till the rumour went abroad that young men who used the tail twisters as a crutch to the staff corps had many and varied trials to endure however a regiment has just as much right to its own secrets as a woman  when bobby came up from deolali and took his place among the tail twisters it was gently but firmly borne in upon him that the regiment was his father and his mother and his indissolubly wedded wife and that there was no crime under the canopy of heaven blacker than that of bringing shame on the regiment which was the bestshooting bestdrilled best setup bravest most illustrious and in all respects most desirable regiment within the compass of the seven seas he was taught the legends of the mess plate from the great grinning golden gods that had come out of the summer palace in pekin to the silvermounted markhorhorn snuffmull presented by the last c 0 he who spake to the seven subalterns and every one of those legends told him of battles fought at long odds without fear as without support of hospitality catholic as an arabs of friendships deep as the sea and steady as the fightingline of honour won by hard roads for honours sake and of instant and unquestioning devotion to the regiment  the regiment that claims the lives of all and lives forever  more than once too he came officially into contact with the regimental colours which looked like the lining of a bricklayers hat on the end of a chewed stick bobby did not kneel and worship them because british subalterns are not constructed in that manner indeed he condemned them for their weight at the very moment that they were filling him with awe and other more noble sentiments  but best of all was the occasion when he moved with the tail twisters in review order at the breaking of a november day allowing for dutymen and sick the regiment was one thousand and eighty strong and bobby belonged to them for was he not a subaltern of the line  the whole line and nothing but the line  as the tramp of two thousand one hundred and sixty sturdy ammunition boots attested he would not have changed places with deighton of the horse battery whirling by in a pillar of cloud to a chorus of strong right strong left or hoganyale of the white hussars leading his squadron for all it was worth with the price of horseshoes thrown in or tick boileau trying to live up to his fierce blue and gold turban while the wasps of the bengal cavalry stretched to a gallop in the wake of the long lollopping walers of the white hussars  they fought through the clear cool day and bobby felt a little thrill run down his spine when he heard the tinkletinkletinkle of the empty cartridgecases hopping from the breechblocks after the roar of the volleys for he knew that he should live to hear that sound in action the review ended in a glorious chase across the plain  batteries thundering after cavalry to the huge disgust of the white hussars and the tyneside tail twisters hunting a sikh regiment till the lean lathy singhs panted with exhaustion bobby was dusty and dripping long before noon but his enthusiasm was merely focused  not diminished  he returned to sit at the feet of revere his skipper that is to say the captain of his company and to be instructed in the dark art and mystery of managing men which is a very large part of the profession of arms  if you havent a taste that way said revere between his puffs of his cheroot youll never be able to get the hang of it but remember bobby tisnt the best drill though drill is nearly everything that hauls a regiment through hell and out on the other side its the man who knows how to handle men  goatmen swinemen dogmen and so on  dormer for instance said bobby i think he comes under the head of foolmen he mopes like a sick owl  that s where you make your mistake my son dormer isnt a fool yet but hes a dashed dirty soldier and his room corporal makes fun of his socks before kitinspection dormer being twothirds pure brute goes into a corner and growls  how do you know said bobby admiringly  because a company commander has to know these things  because if he does not know he may have crime  ay murder  brewing under his very nose and yet not see that its there dormer is being badgered out of his mind  big as he is  and he hasnt intellect enough to resent it hes taken to quiet boozing and bobby when the butt of a room goes on the drink or takes to moping by himself measures are necessary to pull him out of himself  what measures man cant run round coddling his men for ever  no the men would precious soon show him that he was not wanted youve got   to   here the coloursergeant entered with some papers bobby reflected for a while as revere looked through the company forms  does dormer do anything sergeant bobby asked with the air of one continuing an interrupted conversation  no sir does is dooty like a hortomato said the sergeant who delighted in long words a dirty soldier and es under full stoppages for new kit its covered with scales sir  scales what scales  fishscales sir es always pokin in the mud by the river an acleanin them muchlyfish with is thumbs revere was still absorbed in the company papers and the sergeant who was sternly fond of bobby continued  e generally goes down there when es got is skinful beggin your pardon sir an they do say that the more lush  inebriated e is the more fish e catches they call im the looney fishmonger in the compny sir  revere signed the last paper and the sergeant retreated  its a filthy amusement sighed bobby to himself then aloud to revere are you really worried about dormer  a little you see hes never mad enough to send to hospital or drunk enough to run in but at any minute he may flare up brooding and sulking as he does he resents any interest being shown in him and the only time i took him out shooting he all but shot me by accident  i fish said bobby with a wry face i hire a countryboat and go down river from thursday to sunday and the amiable dormer goes with me  if you can spare us both  you blazing young fool said revere but his heart was full of much more pleasant words  bobby the captain of a dhoni with private dormer for mate dropped down the river on thursday morning  the private at the bow the subaltern at the helm the private glared uneasily at the subaltern who respected the reserve of the private  after six hours dormer paced to the stern saluted and said  beg y pardon sir but was you ever on the durhm canal  no said bobby wick come and have some tiffin  they ate in silence as the evening fell private dormer broke forth speaking to himself   hi was on the durhm canal jes such a night come next week twelvemonth atrailin of my toes in the water he smoked and said no more till bedtime  the witchery of the dawn turned the gray riverreaches to purple gold and opal and it was as though the lumbering dhoni crept across the splendours of a new heaven  private dormer popped his head out of his blanket and gazed at the glory below and around  well  damn  my eyes said private dormer in an awed whisper this ere is like a bloomin gallantryshow for the rest of the day he was dumb but achieved an ensanguined filthiness through the cleaning of big fish  the boat returned on saturday evening dormer had been struggling with speech since noon as the lines and luggage were being disembarked he found tongue  beg y pardon sir he said but would you  would you min shakin ands with me sir  of course not said bobby and he shook accordingly dormer returned to barracks and bobby to mess  he wanted a little quiet and some fishing i think said bobby my aunt but hes a filthy sort of animal have you ever seen him clean them muchlyfish with is thumbs  anyhow said revere three weeks later hes doing his best to keep his things clean  when the spring died bobby joined in the general scramble for hill leave and to his surprise and delight secured three months  as good a boy as i want said revere the admiring skipper  the best of the batch said the adjutant to the colonel keep back that young skrimshanker porkiss sir and let revere make him sit up  so bobby departed joyously to simla pahar with a tin box of gorgeous raiment  son of wick  old wick of chotabuldana ask him to dinner dear said the aged men  what a nice boy said the matrons and the maids  firstclass place simla oh ri   ipping said bobby wick and ordered new white cord breeches on the strength of it  were in a bad way wrote revere to bobby at the end of two months since you left the regiment has taken to fever and is fairly rotten with it  two hundred in hospital about a hundred in cells  drinking to keep off fever  and the companies on parade fifteen file strong at the outside theres rather more sickness in the outvillages than i care for but then im so blistered with pricklyheat that im ready to hang myself whats the yarn about your mashing a miss haverley up there not serious i hope youre overyoung to hang millstones round your neck and the colonel will turf you out of that in doublequick time if you attempt it  it was not the colonel that brought bobby out of simla but a much more to be respected commandant the sickness in the outvillages spread the bazar was put out of bounds and then came the news that the tail twisters must go into camp the message flashed to the hill stations  cholera  leave stopped  officers recalled alas for the white gloves in the neatly soldered boxes the rides and the dances and picnics that were to be the loves half spoken and the debts unpaid without demur and without question fast as tonga could fly or pony gallop back to their regiments and their batteries as though they were hastening to their weddings fled the subalterns  bobby received his orders on returning from a dance at viceregal lodge where he had but only the haverley girl knows what bobby had said or how many waltzes he had claimed for the next ball six in the morning saw bobby at the tonga office in the drenching rain the whirl of the last waltz still in his ears and an intoxication due neither to wine nor waltzing in his brain  good man shouted deighton of the horse battery through the mists whar you raise dat tonga im coming with you ow but ive a head and half i didnt sit out all night they say the batterys awful bad and he hummed dolorously   leave the what at the whatsitsname leave the flock without shelter leave the corpse uninterred leave the bride at the altar   my faith itll be more bally corpse than bride though this journey jump in bobby get on coachwan  on the umballa platform waited a detachment of officers discussing the latest news from the stricken cantonment and it was here that bobby learned the real condition of the tail twisters  they went into camp said an elderly major recalled from the whisttables at mussoorie to a sickly native regiment they went into camp with two hundred and ten sick in carts two hundred and ten fever cases only and the balance looking like so many ghosts with sore eyes a madras regiment could have walked through em  but they were as fit as bedamned when i left them said bobby  then youd better make them as fit as bedamned when you rejoin said the major brutally  bobby pressed his forehead against the rainsplashed windowpane as the train lumbered across the sodden doab and prayed for the health of the tyneside tail twisters naini tal had sent down her contingent with all speed the lathering ponies of the dalhousie road staggered into pathankot taxed to the full stretch of their strength while from cloudy darjiling the calcutta mail whirled up the last straggler of the little army that was to fight a fight in which was neither medal nor honour for the winning against an enemy none other than the sickness that destroyeth in the noonday  and as each man reported himself he said this is a bad business and went about his own forthwith for every regiment and battery in the cantonment was under canvas the sickness bearing them company  bobby fought his way through the rain to the tail twisters temporary mess and revere could have fallen on the boys neck for the joy of seeing that ugly wholesome phiz once more  keep em amused and interested said revere they went on the drink poor fools after the first two cases and there was no improvement oh its good to have you back bobby porkiss is a  never mind  deighton came over from the artillery camp to attend a dreary mess dinner and contributed to the general gloom by nearly weeping over the condition of his beloved battery porkiss so far forgot himself as to insinuate that the presence of the officers could do no earthly good and that the best thing would be to send the entire regiment into hospital and let the doctors look after them porkiss was demoralised with fear nor was his peace of mind restored when revere said coldly oh the sooner you go out the better if thats your way of thinking any public school could send us fifty good men in your place but it takes time time porkiss and money and a certain amount of trouble to make a regiment spose youre the person we go into camp for eh  whereupon porkiss was overtaken with a great and chilly fear which a drenching in the rain did not allay and two days later quitted this world for another where men do fondly hope allowances are made for the weaknesses of the flesh the regimental sergeantmajor looked wearily across the sergeants mess tent when the news was announced  there goes the worst of them he said itll take the best and then please god itll stop the sergeants were silent till one said it couldnt be him and all knew of whom travis was thinking  bobby wick stormed through the tents of his company rallying rebuking mildly as is consistent with the regulations chaffing the fainthearted haling the sound into the watery sunlight when there was a break in the weather and bidding them be of good cheer for their trouble was nearly at an end scuttling on his dun pony round the outskirts of the camp and heading back men who with the innate perversity of british soldiers were always wandering into infected villages or drinking deeply from rain flooded marshes comforting the panicstricken with rude speech and more than once tending the dying who had no friends  the men without townies organizing with banjos and burnt cork sing songs which should allow the talent of the regiment full play and generally as he explained playing the giddy gardengoat all round  youre worth half a dozen of us bobby said revere in a moment of enthusiasm how the devil do you keep it up  bobby made no answer but had revere looked into the breastpocket of his coat he might have seen there a sheaf of badlywritten letters which perhaps accounted for the power that possessed the boy a letter came to bobby every other day the spelling was not above reproach but the sentiments must have been most satisfactory for on receipt bobbys eyes softened marvellously and he was wont to fall into a tender abstraction for a while ere shaking his cropped head he charged into his work  by what power he drew after him the hearts of the roughest and the tail twisters counted in their ranks some rough diamonds indeed was a mystery to both skipper and c 0 who learned from the regimental chaplain that bobby was considerably more in request in the hospital tents than the reverend john emery  the men seem fond of you are you in the hospitals much said the colonel who did his daily round and ordered the men to get well with a hardness that did not cover his bitter grief  a little sir said bobby  shouldnt go there too often if i were you they say its not contagious but theres no use in running unnecessary risks we cant afford to have you down y know  six days later it was with the utmost difficulty that the post runner plashed his way out to the camp with the mailbags for the rain was falling in torrents bobby received a letter bore it off to his tent and the programme for the next weeks singsong being satisfactorily disposed of sat down to answer it for an hour the unhandy pen toiled over the paper and where sentiment rose to more than normal tidelevel bobby wick stuck out his tongue and breathed heavily he was not used to letterwriting  beg y pardon sir said a voice at the tent door but dormers orrid bad sir an theyve taken him orf sir  damn private dormer and you too said bobby wick running the blotter over the halffinished letter tell him ill come in the morning  es awful bad sir said the voice hesitatingly there was an undecided squelching of heavy boots  well said bobby impatiently  excusin imself before and for takin the liberty e says it would be a comfort for to assist im sir if        tattoo lao get my pony here come in out of the rain till im ready what blasted nuisances you are thats brandy drink some you want it hang on to my stirrup and tell me if i go too fast  strengthened by a fourfinger nip which he swallowed without a wink the hospital orderly kept up with the slipping mudstained and very disgusted pony as it shambled to the hospital tent  private dormer was certainly orrid bad he had all but reached the stage of collapse and was not pleasant to look upon  whats this dormer said bobby bending over the man youre not going out this time youve got to come fishing with me once or twice more yet  the blue lips parted and in the ghost of a whisper said  beg y pardon sir disturbin of you now but would you min oldin my and sir  bobby sat on the side of the bed and the icycold hand closed on his own like a vice forcing a ladys ring which was on the little finger deep into the flesh bobby set his lips and waited the water dripping from the hem of his trousers an hour passed and the grasp of the hand did not relax nor did the expression of the drawn face change bobby with infinite craft lit himself a cheroot with the left hand his right arm was numbed to the elbow and resigned himself to a night of pain  dawn showed a very whitefaced subaltern sitting on the side of a sick mans cot and a doctor in the doorway using language unfit for publication  have you been here all night you young ass said the doctor  there or thereabouts said bobby ruefully hes frozen on to me  dormers mouth shut with a click he turned his head and sighed the clinging hand opened and bobbys arm fell useless at his side  hell do said the doctor quietly it must have been a tossup all through the night think youre to be congratulated on this case  oh bosh said bobby i thought the man had gone out long ago  only  only i didnt care to take my hand away rub my arm down theres a good chap what a grip the brute has im chilled to the marrow he passed out of the tent shivering  private dormer was allowed to celebrate his repulse of death by strong waters four days later he sat on the side of his cot and said to the patients mildly id a liken to a spoken to im  so i should  but at that time bobby was reading yet another letter  he had the most persistent correspondent of any man in camp  and was even then about to write that the sickness had abated and in another week at the outside would be gone he did not intend to say that the chill of a sick mans hand seemed to have struck into the heart whose capacities for affection he dwelt on at such length he did intend to enclose the illustrated programme of the forthcoming singsong whereof he was not a little proud he also intended to write on many other matters which do not concern us and doubtless would have done so but for the slight feverish headache which made him dull and unresponsive at mess  you are overdoing it bobby said his skipper might give the rest of us credit of doing a little work you go on as if you were the whole mess rolled into one take it easy  i will said bobby im feeling done up somehow revere looked at him anxiously and said nothing  there was a flickering of lanterns about the camp that night and a rumour that brought men out of their cots to the tent doors a paddling of the naked feet of dooliebearers and the rush of a galloping horse  wots up asked twenty tents and through twenty tents ran the answer  wick es down  they brought the news to revere and he groaned any one but bobby and i shouldnt have cared the sergeantmajor was right  not going out this journey gasped bobby as he was lifted from the doolie not going out this journey then with an air of supreme conviction  i cant you see  not if i can do anything said the surgeonmajor who had hastened over from the mess where he had been dining  he and the regimental surgeon fought together with death for the life of bobby wick their work was interrupted by a hairy apparition in a bluegray dressinggown who stared in horror at the bed and cried  oh my gawd it cant be im until an indignant hospital orderly whisked him away  if care of man and desire to live could have done aught bobby would have been saved as it was he made a fight of three days and the surgeonmajors brow uncreased well save him yet he said and the surgeon who though he ranked with the captain had a very youthful heart went out upon the word and pranced joyously in the mud  not going out this journey whispered bobby wick gallantly at the end of the third day  bravo said the surgeonmajor thats the way to look at it bobby  as evening fell a gray shade gathered round bobbys mouth and he turned his face to the tentwall wearily the surgeonmajor frowned  im awfully tired said bobby very faintly whats the use of bothering me with medicine i  dont  want  it let me alone  the desire for life had departed and bobby was content to drift away on the easy tide of death  its no good said the surgeonmajor he doesnt want to live hes meeting it poor child and he blew his nose  half a mile away the regimental band was playing the overture to the singsong for the men had been told that bobby was out of danger the clash of the brass and the wail of the horns reached bobbys ears  is there a single joy or pain that i should never knoow you do not love me tis in vain bid me goodbye and go  an expression of hopeless irritation crossed the boys face and he tried to shake his head  the surgeonmajor bent down  what is it bobby  not that waltz muttered bobby thats our own  our very ownest own   mummy dear  with this he sank into the stupor that gave place to death early next morning  revere his eyes red at the rims and his nose very white went into bobbys tent to write a letter to papa wick which should bow the white head of the excommissioner of chotabuldana in the keenest sorrow of his life bobbys little store of papers lay in confusion on the table and among them a halffinished letter the last sentence ran so you see darling there is really no fear because as long as i know you care for me and i care for you nothing can touch me  revere stayed in the tent for an hour when he came out his eyes were redder than ever  private conklin sat on a turneddown bucket and listened to a not unfamiliar tune private conklin was a convalescent and should have been tenderly treated  ho said private conklin theres another bloomin orfcer da ed  the bucket shot from under him and his eyes filled with a smithyful of sparks a tall man in a bluegray bedgown was regarding him with deep disfavour  you ought to take shame for yourself conky orfcer  bloomin orfcer ill learn you to misname the likes of im hangel bloomin hangel thats wot e is  and the hospital orderly was so satisfied with the justice of the punishment that he did not even order private dormer back to his cot   in the matter of a private  hurrah hurrah a soldiers life for me shout boys shout for it makes you jolly and free  the ramrod corps  people who have seen say that one of the quaintest spectacles of human frailty is an outbreak of hysterics in a girls school it starts without warning generally on a hot afternoon among the elder pupils a girl giggles till the giggle gets beyond control then she throws up her head and cries honk honk honk like a wild goose and tears mix with the laughter if the mistress be wise she will rap out something severe at this point to check matters if she be tenderhearted and send for a drink of water the chances are largely in favour of another girl laughing at the afflicted one and herself collapsing thus the trouble spreads and may end in half of what answers to the lower sixth of a boys school rocking and whooping together given a week of warm weather two stately promenades per diem a heavy mutton and rice meal in the middle of the day a certain amount of nagging from the teachers and a few other things some amazing effects develop at least this is what folk say who have had experience  now the mother superior of a convent and the colonel of a british infantry regiment would be justly shocked at any comparison being made between their respective charges but it is a fact that under certain circumstances thomas in bulk can be worked up into ditthering rippling hysteria he does not weep but he shows his trouble unmistakably and the consequences get into the newspapers and all the good people who hardly know a martini from a snider say take away the brutes ammunition  thomas isnt a brute and his business which is to look after the virtuous people demands that he shall have his ammunition to his hand he doesnt wear silk stockings and he really ought to be supplied with a new adjective to help him to express his opinions but for all that he is a great man if you call him the heroic defender of the national honour one day and a brutal and licentious soldiery the next you naturally bewilder him and he looks upon you with suspicion there is nobody to speak for thomas except people who have theories to work off on him and nobody understands thomas except thomas and he does not always know what is the matter with himself  that is the prologue this is the story   corporal slane was engaged to be married to miss jhansi mkenna whose history is well known in the regiment and elsewhere he had his colonels permission and being popular with the men every arrangement had been made to give the wedding what private ortheris called eeklar it fell in the heart of the hot weather and after the wedding slane was going up to the hills with the bride none the less slanes grievance was that the affair would be only a hiredcarriage wedding and he felt that the eeklar of that was meagre miss mkenna did not care so much the sergeants wife was helping her to make her weddingdress and she was very busy slane was just then the only moderately contented man in barracks all the rest were more or less miserable  and they had so much to make them happy too all their work was over at eight in the morning and for the rest of the day they could lie on their backs and smoke canteenplug and swear at the punkahcoolies they enjoyed a fine full flesh meal in the middle of the day and then threw themselves down on their cots and sweated and slept till it was cool enough to go out with their towny whose vocabulary contained less than six hundred words and the adjective and whose views on every conceivable question they had heard many times before  there was the canteen of course and there was the temperance room with the secondhand papers in it but a man of any profession cannot read for eight hours a day in a temperature of 96° or 98° in the shade running up sometimes to 103° at midnight very few men even though they get a pannikin of flat stale muddy beer and hide it under their cots can continue drinking for six hours a day one man tried but he died and nearly the whole regiment went to his funeral because it gave them something to do it was too early for the excitement of fever or cholera the men could only wait and wait and wait and watch the shadow of the barrack creeping across the blinding white dust that was a gay life  they lounged about cantonments  it was too hot for any sort of game and almost too hot for vice  and fuddled themselves in the evening and filled themselves to distension with the healthy nitrogenous food provided for them and the more they stoked the less exercise they took and more explosive they grew then tempers began to wear away and men fell abrooding over insults real or imaginary for they had nothing else to think of the tone of the repartees changed and instead of saying lightheartedly ill knock your silly face in men grew laboriously polite and hinted that the cantonments were not big enough for themselves and their enemy and that there would be more space for one of the two in another place  it may have been the devil who arranged the thing but the fact of the case is that losson had for a long time been worrying simmons in an aimless way it gave him occupation the two had their cots side by side and would sometimes spend a long afternoon swearing at each other but simmons was afraid of losson and dared not challenge him to a fight he thought over the words in the hot still nights and half the hate he felt towards losson he vented on the wretched punkahcoolie  losson bought a parrot in the bazar and put it into a little cage and lowered the cage into the cool darkness of a well and sat on the wellcurb shouting bad language down to the parrot he taught it to say simmons ye sooor which means swine and several other things entirely unfit for publication he was a big gross man and he shook like a jelly when the parrot had the sentence correctly simmons however shook with rage for all the room were laughing at him  the parrot was such a disreputable puff of green feathers and it looked so human when it chattered losson used to sit swinging his fat legs on the side of the cot and ask the parrot what it thought of simmons the parrot would answer simmons ye sooor good boy losson used to say scratching the parrots head ye ear that sim and simmons used to turn over on his stomach and make answer i ear take eed you dont ear something one of these days  in the restless nights after he had been asleep all day fits of blind rage came upon simmons and held him till he trembled all over while he thought in how many different ways he would slay losson sometimes he would picture himself trampling the life out of the man with heavy ammunitionboots and at others smashing in his face with the butt and at others jumping on his shoulders and dragging the head back till the neckbone cracked then his mouth would feel hot and fevered and he would reach out for another sup of the beer in the pannikin  but the fancy that came to him most frequently and stayed with him longest was one connected with the great roll of fat under lossons right ear he noticed it first on a moonlight night and thereafter it was always before his eyes it was a fascinating roll of fat a man could get his hand upon it and tear away one side of the neck or he could place the muzzle of a rifle on it and blow away all the head in a flash losson had no right to be sleek and contented and welltodo when he simmons was the butt of the room some day perhaps he would show those who laughed at the simmons ye sooor joke that he was as good as the rest and held a mans life in the crook of his forefinger when losson snored simmons hated him more bitterly than ever why should losson be able to sleep when simmons had to stay awake hour after hour tossing and turning on the tapes with the dull liver pain gnawing into his right side and his head throbbing and aching after canteen he thought over this for many many nights and the world became unprofitable to him he even blunted his naturally fine appetite with beer and tobacco and all the while the parrot talked at and made a mock of him  the heat continued and the tempers wore away more quickly than before a sergeants wife died of heatapoplexy in the night and the rumour ran abroad that it was cholera men rejoiced openly hoping that it would spread and send them into camp but that was a false alarm  it was late on a tuesday evening and the men were waiting in the deep double verandahs for last post when simmons went to the box at the foot of his bed took out his pipe and slammed the lid down with a bang that echoed through the deserted barrack like the crack of a rifle ordinarily speaking the men would have taken no notice but their nerves were fretted to fiddlestrings they jumped up and three or four clattered into the barrackroom only to find simmons kneeling by his box  ow its you is it they said and laughed foolishly we thought twas   simmons rose slowly if the accident had so shaken his fellows what would not the reality do  you thought it was  did you and what makes you think he said lashing himself into madness as he went on to hell with your thinking ye dirty spies  simmons ye sooor chuckled the parrot in the verandah sleepily recognising a wellknown voice now that was absolutely all  the tension snapped simmons fell back on the armrack deliberately  the men were at the far end of the room  and took out his rifle and packet of ammunition dont go playing the goat sim said losson put it down but there was a quaver in his voice another man stooped slipped his boot and hurled it at simmonss head the prompt answer was a shot which fired at random found its billet in lossons throat losson fell forward without a word and the others scattered  you thought it was yelled simmons youre drivin me to it i tell you youre drivin me to it get up losson an dont lie shammin there  you an your blasted parrit that druv me to it  but there was an unaffected reality about lossons pose that showed simmons what he had done the men were still clamouring in the verandah simmons appropriated two more packets of ammunition and ran into the moonlight muttering ill make a night of it thirty rouns an the last for myself take you that you dogs  he dropped on one knee and fired into the brown of the men on the verandah but the bullet flew high and landed in the brickwork with a vicious phwit that made some of the younger ones turn pale it is as musketry theorists observe one thing to fire and another to be fired at  then the instinct of the chase flared up the news spread from barrack to barrack and the men doubled out intent on the capture of simmons the wild beast who was heading for the cavalry paradeground stopping now and again to send back a shot and a curse in the direction of his pursuers  ill learn you to spy on me he shouted ill learn you to give me dorgs names come on the ole lot o you colonel john anthony deever c b he turned towards the infantry mess and shook his rifle  you think yourself the devil of a man  but i tell you that if you put your ugly old carcass outside o that door ill make you the poorestlookin man in the army come out colonel john anthony deever c b come out and see me practiss on the rainge im the crack shot of the ole bloomin battalion in proof of which statement simmons fired at the lighted windows of the messhouse  private simmons e compny on the cavalry pradeground sir with thirty rounds said a sergeant breathlessly to the colonel shootin right and lef sir shot private losson whats to be done sir  colonel john anthony deever c b sallied out only to be saluted by a spurt of dust at his feet  pull up said the second in command i dont want my step in that way colonel hes as dangerous as a mad dog  shoot him like one then said the colonel bitterly if he wont take his chance my regiment too if it had been the towheads i could have understood  private simmons had occupied a strong position near a well on the edge of the paradeground and was defying the regiment to come on the regiment was not anxious to comply for there is small honour in being shot by a fellowprivate only corporal slane rifle in hand threw himself down on the ground and wormed his way towards the well  dont shoot said he to the men round him like as not youll it me ill catch the beggar livin  simmons ceased  shouting for a while and th noise of trapwheels could be heard across the plain major oldyne commanding the horse battery was coming back from a dinner in the civil lines was driving after his usual custom  that is to say as fast as the horse could go  a orfcer a blooming spangled orfcer shrieked simmons ill make a scarecrow of that orfcer the trap stopped  whats this demanded the major of gunners you there drop your rifle  why its jerry blazes i aint got no quarrel with you jerry blazes pass frien an alls well  but jerry blazes had not the faintest intention of passing a dangerous murderer he was as his adoring battery swore long and fervently without knowledge of fear and they were surely the best judges for jerry blazes it was notorious had done his possible to kill a man each time the battery went out  he walked towards simmons with the intention of rushing him and knocking him down  dont make me do it sir said simmons i aint got nothing agin you ah you would  the major broke into a run  take that then  the major dropped with a bullet through his shoulder and simmons stood over him he had lost the satisfaction of killing losson in the desired way but here was a helpless body to his hand should he slip in another cartridge and blow off the head or with the butt smash in the white face he stopped to consider and a cry went up from the far side of the paradeground hes killed jerry blazes but in the shelter of the wellpillars simmons was safe except when he stepped out to fire ill blow yer andsome ead off jerry blazes said simmons reflectively six and three is nine an one is ten an that leaves me another nineteen an one for myself he tugged at the string of the second packet of ammunition corporal slane crawled out of the shadow of a bank into the moonlight  i see you said simmons come a bit furder on an ill do for you  im comin said corporal slane briefly youve done a bad days work sim come out ere an come back with me  come to laughed simmons sending a cartridge home with his thumb not before ive settled you an jerry blazes  the corporal was lying at full length in the dust of the parade ground a rifle under him some of the less cautious men in the distance shouted shoot im shoot im slane  you move and or foot slane said simmons an ill kick jerry blazes ead in and shoot you after  i aint movin said the corporal raising his head you darent it a man on is legs let go o jerry blazes an come out o that with your fistes come an it me you darent you bloom in dogshooter  i dare  you lie you mansticker you sneakin sheeny butcher you lie see there slane kicked the rifle away and stood up in the peril of his life come on now  the temptation was more than simmons could resist for the corporal in his white clothes offered a perfect mark  dont misname me shouted simmons firing as he spoke the shot missed and the shooter blind with rage threw his rifle down and rushed at slane from the protection of the well within striking distance he kicked savagely at slanes stomach but the weedy corporal knew something of simmonss weakness and knew too the deadly guard for that kick bowing forward and drawing up his right leg till the heel of the right foot was set some three inches above the inside of the left kneecap he met the blow standing on one leg  exactly as gonds stand when they meditate  and ready for the fall that would follow there was an oath the corporal fell over to his own left as shinbone met shinbone and the private collapsed his right leg broken an inch above the ankle  pity you dont know that guard sim said slane spitting out the dust as he rose then raising his voice  come an take him on ive bruk is leg this was not strictly true for the private had accomplished his own downfall since it is the special merit of that legguard that the harder the kick the greater the kickers discomfiture  slane walked to jerry blazes and hung over him with ostentatious anxiety while simmons weeping with pain was carried away ope you aint urt badly sir said slane the major had fainted and there was an ugly ragged hole through the top of his arm slane knelt down and murmured selp me i believe es dead well if that aint my blooming luck all over  but the major was destined to lead his battery afield for many a long day with unshaken nerve he was removed and nursed and petted into convalescence while the battery discussed the wisdom of capturing simmons and blowing him from a gun they idolised their major and his reappearance on parade brought about a scene nowhere provided for in the army regulations  great too was the glory that fell to slanes share the gunners would have made him drunk thrice a day for at least a fortnight even the colonel of his own regiment complimented him upon his coolness and the local paper called him a hero these things did not puff him up when the major offered him money and thanks the virtuous corporal took the one and put aside the other but he had a request to make and prefaced it with many a beg y pardon sir could the major see his way to letting the slanemkenna wedding be adorned by the presence of four battery horses to pull a hired barouche the major could and so could the battery excessively so it was a gorgeous wedding  wot did i do it for said corporal slane for the orses o course jhansi aint a beauty to look at but i wasnt goin to ave a hired turnout jerry blazes if i adnt a wanted something sim might ha blowed jerry blazes blooming ead into hirish stew for aught id a cared   and they hanged private simmons  hanged him as high as haman in hollow square of the regiment and the colonel said it was drink and the chaplain was sure it was the devil and simmons fancied it was both but he didnt know and only hoped his fate would be a warning to his companions and half a dozen intelligent publicists wrote six beautiful leading articles on the prevalence of crime in the army  but not a soul thought of comparing the bloodyminded simmons to the squawking gaping schoolgirl with which this story opens   the lost legion  when the indian mutiny broke out and a little time before the siege of delhi a regiment of native irregular horse was stationed at peshawur on the frontier of india that regiment caught what john lawrence called at the time the prevalent mania and would have thrown in its lot with the mutineers had it been allowed to do so the chance never came for as the regiment swept off down south it was headed off by a remnant of an english corps into the hills of afghanistan and there the newly conquered tribesmen turned against it as wolves turn against buck it was hunted for the sake of its arms and accoutrements from hill to hill from ravine to ravine up and down the dried beds of rivers and round the shoulders of bluffs till it disappeared as water sinks in the sand  this officerless rebel regiment the only trace left of its existence today is a nominal roll drawn up in neat round hand and countersigned by an officer who called himself adjutant late irregular cavalry the paper is yellow with years and dirt but on the back of it you can still read a pencilnote by john lawrence to this effect see that the two native officers who remained loyal are not deprived of their estates j l of six hundred and fifty sabres only two stood strain and john lawrence in the midst of all the agony of the first months of the mutiny found time to think about their merits  that was more than thirty years ago and the tribesmen across the afghan border who helped to annihilate the regiment are now old men sometimes a graybeard speaks of his share in the massacre they came he will say across the border very proud calling upon us to rise and kill the english and go down to the sack of delhi but we who had just been conquered by the same english knew that they were overbold and that the government could account easily for those downcountry dogs this hindustani regiment therefore we treated with fair words and kept standing in one place till the redcoats came after them very hot and angry then this regiment ran forward a little more into our hills to avoid the wrath of the english and we lay upon their flanks watching from the sides of the hills till we were well assured that their path was lost behind them then we came down for we desired their clothes and their bridles and their rifles and their boots  more especially their boots that was a great killing  done slowly here the old man will rub his nose and shake his long snaky locks and lick his bearded lips and grin till the yellow tooth stumps show yea we killed them because we needed their gear and we knew that their lives had been forfeited to god on account of their sin  the sin of treachery to the salt which they had eaten they rode up and down the valleys stumbling and rocking in their saddles and howling for mercy we drove them slowly like cattle till they were all assembled in one place the flat wide valley of sheor kôt many had died from want of water but there still were many left and they could not make any stand we went among them pulling them down with our hands two at a time and our boys killed them who were new to the sword my share of the plunder was such and such  so many guns and so many saddles the guns were good in those days now we steal the government rifles and despise smooth barrels yes beyond doubt we wiped that regiment from off the face of the earth and even the memory of the deed is now dying but men say   at this point the tale would stop abruptly and it was impossible to find out what men said across the border the afghans were always a secretive race and vastly preferred doing something wicked to saying anything at all they would be quiet and well behaved for months till one night without word or warning they would rush a policepost cut the throats of a constable or two dash through a village carry away three or four women and withdraw in the red glare of burning thatch driving the cattle and goats before them to their own desolate hills the indian government would become almost tearful on these occasions first it would say please be good and well forgive you the tribe concerned in the latest depredation would collectively put its thumb to its nose and answer rudely then the government would say hadnt you better pay up a little money for those few corpses you left behind you the other night here the tribe would temporise and lie and bully and some of the younger men merely to show contempt of authority would raid another policepost and fire into some frontier mudfort and if lucky kill a real english officer then the government would say  observe if you really persist in this line of conduct you will be hurt if the tribe knew exactly what was going on in india it would apologise or be rude according as it learned whether the government was busy with other things or able to devote its full attention to their performances some of the tribes knew to one corpse how far to go others became excited lost their heads and told the government to come on with sorrow and tears and one eye on the british taxpayer at home who insisted on regarding these exercises as brutal wars of annexation the government would prepare an expensive little fieldbrigade and some guns and send all up into the hills to chase the wicked tribe out of the valleys where the corn grew into the hilltops where there was nothing to eat the tribe would turn out in full strength and enjoy the campaign for they knew that their women would never be touched that their wounded would be nursed not mutilated and that as soon as each mans bag of corn was spent they could surrender and palaver with the english general as though they had been a real enemy afterwards years afterwards they would pay the bloodmoney driblet by driblet to the government and tell their children how they had slain the redcoats by thousands the only drawback to this kind of picnicwar was the weakness of the redcoats for solemnly blowing up with powder their fortified towers and keeps this the tribes always considered mean  chief among the leaders of the smaller tribes  the little clans who knew to a penny the expense of moving white troops against them  was a priestbanditchief whom we will call the gulla kutta mullah his enthusiasm for border murder as an art was almost dignified he would cut down a mailrunner from pure wantonness or bombard a mudfort with riflefire when he knew that our men needed to sleep in his leisure moments he would go on circuit among his neighbours and try to incite other tribes to devilry also he kept a kind of hotel for fellowoutlaws in his own village which lay in a valley called bersund any respectable murderer on that section of the frontier was sure to lie up at bersund for it was reckoned an exceedingly safe place the sole entry to it ran through a narrow gorge which could be converted into a deathtrap in five minutes it was surrounded by high hills reckoned inaccessible to all save born mountaineers and here the gulla kutta mullah lived in great state the head of a colony of mud and stone huts and in each mud hut hung some portion of a red uniform and the plunder of dead men the government particularly wished for his capture and once invited him formally to come out and be hanged on account of the many murders in which he had taken a direct part he replied   i am only twenty miles as the crow flies from your border come and fetch me some day we will come said the government and hanged you will be  the gulla kutta mullah let the matter slip from his mind he knew that the patience of the government was as long as a summer day but he did not realise that its arm was as long as a winter night months afterwards when there was peace on the border and all india was quiet the indian government turned in its sleep and remembered the gulla kutta mullah at bersund with his thirteen outlaws the movement against him of one single regiment  which the telegrams would have translated as war  would have been highly impolitic this was a time for silence and speed and above all absence of bloodshed  you must know that all along the northwest frontier of india there is spread a force of some thirty thousand foot and horse whose duty it is to quietly and unostentatiously shepherd the tribes in front of them they move up and down and down and up from one desolate little post to another they are ready to take the field at ten minutes notice they are always half in and half out of a difficulty somewhere along the monotonous line their lives are as hard as their own muscles and the papers never say anything about them it was from this force that the government picked its men  one night at a station where the mounted night patrol fire as they challenge and the wheat rolls in great bluegreen waves under our cold northern moon the officers were playing billiards in the mudwalled clubhouse when orders came to them that they were to go on parade at once for a nightdrill they grumbled and went to turn out their men  a hundred english troops let us say two hundred goorkhas and about a hundred cavalry of the finest native cavalry in the world  when they were on the paradeground it was explained to them in whispers that they must set off at once across the hills to bersund the english troops were to post themselves round the hills at the side of the valley the goorkhas would command the gorge and the deathtrap and the cavalry would fetch a long march round and get to the back of the circle of hills whence if there were any difficulty they could charge down on the mullahs men but orders were very strict that there should be no fighting and no noise they were to return in the morning with every round of ammunition intact and the mullah and the thirteen outlaws bound in their midst if they were successful no one would know or care anything about their work but failure meant probably a small border war in which the gulla kutta mullah would pose as a popular leader against a big bullying power instead of a common border murderer  then there was silence broken only by the clicking of the compassneedles and snapping of watchcases as the heads of columns compared bearings and made appointments for the rendezvous five minutes later the paradeground was empty the green coats of the goorkhas and the overcoats of the english troops had faded into the darkness and the cavalry were cantering away in the face of a blinding drizzle  what the goorkhas and the english did will be seen later on the heavy work lay with the horses for they had to go far and pick their way clear of habitations many of the troopers were natives of that part of the world ready and anxious to fight against their kin and some of the officers had made private and unofficial excursions into those hills before they crossed the border found a dried riverbed cantered up that walked through a stony gorge risked crossing a low hill under cover of the darkness skirted another hill leaving their hoofmarks deep in some ploughed ground felt their way along another watercourse ran over the neck of a spur praying that no one would hear their horses grunting and so worked on in the rain and the darkness till they had left bersund and its crater of hills a little behind them and to the left and it was time to swing round the ascent commanding the back of bersund was steep and they halted to draw breath in a broad level valley below the height that is to say the men reined up but the horses blown as they were refused to halt there was unchristian language the worse for being delivered in a whisper and you heard the saddles squeaking in the darkness as the horses plunged  the subaltern at the rear of one troop turned in his saddle and said very  softly   carter what the blessed heavens are you doing at the rear bring your men up man  there was no answer till a trooper replied   carter sahib is forward  not here there is nothing behind us  there is said the subaltern the squadrons walking on its own tail  then the major in command moved down to the rear swearing softly and asking for the blood of lieutenant halley  the subaltern who had just spoken  look after your rearguard said the major some of your infernal thieves have got lost theyre at the head of the squadron and youre a several kinds of idiot  shall i tell off my men sir said the subaltern sulkily for he was feeling wet and cold  tell em off said the major whip em off by gad youre squandering them all over the place theres a troop behind you now  so i was thinking said the subaltern calmly i have all my men here sir better speak to carter  carter sahib sends salaam and wants to know why the regiment is stopping said a trooper to lieutenant halley  where under heaven is carter said the major  forward with his troop was the answer  are we walking in a ring then or are we the centre of a blessed brigade said the major  by this time there was silence all along the column the horses were still but through the drive of the fine rain men could hear the feet of many horses moving over stony ground  were being stalked said lieutenant halley  theyve no horses here besides theyd have fired before this said the major its  its villagers ponies  then our horses would have neighed and spoilt the attack long ago they must have been near us for half an hour said the subaltern  queer that we cant smell the horses said the major damping his finger and rubbing it on his nose as he sniffed up wind  well its a bad start said the subaltern shaking the wet from his overcoat what shall we do sir  get on said the major we shall catch it tonight  the column moved forward very gingerly for a few paces then there was an oath a shower of blue sparks as shod hooves crashed on small stones and a man rolled over with a jangle of accoutrements that would have waked the dead  now weve gone and done it said lieutenant halley all the hillside awake and all the hillside to climb in the face of musketryfire this comes of trying to do nighthawk work  the trembling trooper picked himself up and tried to explain that his horse had fallen over one of the little cairns that are built of loose stones on the spot where a man has been murdered there was no need to give reasons the majors big australian charger blundered next and the column came to a halt in what seemed to be a very graveyard of little cairns all about two feet high the manoeuvres of the squadron are not reported men said that it felt like mounted quadrilles without training and without the music but at last the horses breaking rank and choosing their own way walked clear of the cairns till every man of the squadron reformed and drew rein a few yards up the slope of the hill then according to lieutenant halley there was another scene very like the one which has been described the major and carter insisted that all the men had not joined rank and that there were more of them in the rear clicking and blundering among the dead mens cairns lieutenant halley told off his own troopers again and resigned himself to wait later on he said to me  i didnt much know and i didnt much care what was going on the row of that trooper falling ought to have scared half the country and i would take my oath that we were being stalked by a full regiment in the rear and they were making row enough to rouse all afghanistan i sat tight but nothing happened  the mysterious part of the nights work was the silence on the hillside everybody knew that the gulla kutta mullah had his outposthuts on the reverse side of the hill and everybody expected by the time that the major had sworn himself into quiet that the watchmen there would open fire when nothing happened they said that the gusts of the rain had deadened the sound of the horses and thanked providence at last the major satisfied himself a that he had left no one behind among the cairns and b that he was not being taken in the rear by a large and powerful body of cavalry the mens tempers were thoroughly spoiled the horses were lathered and unquiet and one and all prayed for the daylight  they set themselves to climb up the hill each man leading his mount carefully before they had covered the lower slopes or the breastplates had begun to tighten a thunderstorm came up behind rolling across the low hills and drowning any noise less than that of cannon the first flash of the lightning showed the bare ribs of the ascent thc hillcrest standing steelyblue against the black sky the little falling lines of the rain and a few yards to their left flank an afghan watchtower twostoried built of stone and entered by a ladder from the upper story the ladder was up and a man with a rifle was leaning from the window the darkness and the thunder rolled down in an instant and when the lull followed a voice from the watchtower cried who goes there  the cavalry were very quiet but each man gripped his carbine and stood beside his horse again the voice called who goes there and in a louder key 0 brothers give the alarm now every man in the cavalry would have died in his long boots sooner than have asked for quarter but it is a fact that the answer to the second call was a long wail of marf karo marf karo which means have mercy have mercy it came from the climbing regiment  the cavalry stood dumbfoundered till the big troopers had time to whisper one to another mir khan was that thy voice abdullah didst thou call lieutenant halley stood beside his charger and waited so long as no firing was going on he was content another flash of lightning showed the horses with heaving flanks and nodding heads the men white eyeballed glaring beside them and the stone watchtower to the left this time there was no head at the window and the rude ironclamped shutter that could turn a riflebullet was closed  go on men said the major get up to the top at any rate the squadron toiled forward the horses wagging their tails and the men pulling at the bridles the stones rolling down the hillside and the sparks flying lieutenant halley declares that he never heard a squadron make so much noise in his life they scrambled up he said as though each horse had eight legs and a spare horse to follow him even then there was no sound from the watchtower and the men stopped exhausted on the ridge that overlooked the pit of darkness in which the village of bersund lay girths were loosed curbchains shifted and saddles adjusted and the men dropped down among the stones whatever might happen now they held the upper ground of any attack  the thunder ceased and with it the rain and the soft thick darkness of a winter night before the dawn covered them all except for the sound of falling water among the ravines below everything was still they heard the shutter of the watchtower below them thrown back with a clang and the voice of the watcher calling oh hafiz ullah  the echoes took up the call lalala and an answer came from the watchtower hidden round the curve of the hill what is it shahbaz khan  shahbaz khan replied in the highpitched voice of the mountaineer hast thou seen  the answer came back yes god deliver us from all evil spirits  there was a pause and then hafiz ullah i am alone come to me  shahbaz khan i am alone also but i dare not leave my post  that is a lie thou art afraid  a longer pause followed and then i am afraid be silent they are below us still pray to god and sleep  the troopers listened and wondered for they could not understand what save earth and stone could lie below the watchtowers  shahbaz khan began to call again they are below us i can see them for the pity of god come over to me hafiz ullah my father slew ten of them come over  hafiz ullah answered in a very loud voice mine was guiltless hear ye men of the night neither my father nor my blood had any part in that sin bear thou thine own punishment shahbaz khan  oh some one ought to stop those two chaps crowing away like cocks there said the lieutenant shivering under his rock  he had hardly turned round to expose a new side of him to the rain before a bearded longlocked evilsmelling afghan rushed up the hill and tumbled into his arms halley sat upon him and thrust as much of a swordhilt as could be spared down the mans gullet if you cry out i kill you he said cheerfully  the man was beyond any expression of terror he lay and quaked gasping when halley took the swordhilt from between his teeth he was still inarticulate but clung to halleys arm feeling it from elbow to wrist  the rissala the dead rissala  he gasped it is down there  no the rissala the very much alive rissala it is up here said halley unshipping his wateringbridle and fastening the mans hands why were you in the towers so foolish as to let us pass  the valley is full of the dead said the afghan it is better to fall into the hands of the english than the hands of the dead they march to and fro below there i saw them in the lightning  he recovered his composure after a little and whispering because halleys pistol was at his stomach said what is this there is no war between us now and the mullah will kill me for not seeing you pass  rest easy said halley we are coming to kill the mullah if god please his teeth have grown too long no harm will come to thee unless the daylight shows thee as a face which is desired by the gallows for crime done but what of the dead regiment  i only kill within my own border said the man immensely relieved the dead regiment is below the men must have passed through it on their journey  four hundred dead on horses stumbling among their own graves among the little heaps  dead men all whom we slew  whew said halley that accounts for my cursing carter and the major cursing me four hundred sabres eh no wonder we thought there were a few extra men in the troop kurruk shah he whispered to a grizzled native officer that lay within a few feet of him hast thou heard anything of a dead rissala in these hills  assuredly said kurruk shah with a grim chuckle otherwise why did i who have served the queen for sevenandtwenty years and killed many hilldogs shout aloud for quarter when the lightning revealed us to the watchtowers when i was a young man i saw the killing in the valley of sheorkôt there at our feet and i know the tale that grew up therefrom but how can the ghosts of unbelievers prevail against us who are of the faith strap that dogs hands a little tighter sahib an afghan is like an eel  but a dead rissala said halley jerking his captives wrist that is foolish talk kurruk shah the dead are dead hold still sag the afghan wriggled  the dead are dead and for that reason they walk at night what need to talk we be men we have our eyes and ears thou canst both see and hear them down the hillside said kurruk shah composedly  halley stared and listened long and intently the valley was full of stifled noises as every valley must be at night but whether he saw or heard more than was natural halley alone knows and he does not choose to speak on the subject  at last and just before the dawn a green rocket shot up from the far side of the valley of bersund at the head of the gorge to show that the goorkhas were in position a red light from the infantry at left and right answered it and the cavalry burnt a white flare afghans in winter are late sleepers and it was not till full day that the gulla kutta mullahs men began to straggle from their huts rubbing their eyes they saw men in green and red and brown uniforms leaning on their arms neatly arranged all round the crater of the village of bersund in a cordon that not even a wolf could have broken they rubbed their eyes the more when a pinkfaced young man who was not even in the army but represented the political department tripped down the hillside with two orderlies rapped at the door of the gulla kutta mullahs house and told him quietly to step out and be tied up for safe transport that same young man passed on through the huts tapping here one cateran and there another lightly with his cane and as each was pointed out so he was tied up staring hopelessly at the crowned heights around where the english soldiers looked down with incurious eyes only the mullah tried to carry it off with curses and high words till a soldier who was tying his hands said   none o your lip why didnt you come out when you was ordered instead o keeping us awake all night youre no better than my own barracksweeper you whiteeaded old polyanthus kim up  half an hour later the troops had gone away with the mullah and his thirteen friends the dazed villagers were looking ruefully at a pile of broken muskets and snapped swords and wondering how in the world they had come so to miscalculate the forbearance of the indian government  it was a very neat little affair neatly carried out and the men concerned were unofficially thanked for their services  yet it seems to me that much credit is also due to another regiment whose name did not appear in brigade orders and whose very existence is in danger of being forgotten    the drums of the fore and aft  in the army list they still stand as the fore and fit princess hohenzollernsigmaringenanspachs merthertydfilshire own royal loyal light infantry regimental district 329a but the army through all its barracks and canteens knows them now as the fore and aft they may in time do something that shall make their new title honourable but at present they are bitterly ashamed and the man who calls them fore and aft does so at the risk of the head which is on his shoulders  two words breathed into the stables of a certain cavalry regiment will bring the men out into the streets with belts and mops and bad language but a whisper of fore and aft will bring out this regiment with rifles  their one excuse is that they came again and did their best to finish the job in style but for a time all their world knows that they were openly beaten whipped dumbcowed shaking and afraid the men know it their officers know it the horse guards know it and when the next war comes the enemy will know it also there are two or three regiments of the line that have a black mark against their names which they will then wipe out and it will be excessively inconvenient for the troops upon whom they do their wiping  the courage of the british soldier is officially supposed to be above proof and as a general rule it is so the exceptions are decently shovelled out of sight only to be referred to in the freshest of unguarded talk that occasionally swamps a messtable at midnight then one hears strange and horrible stories of men not following their officers of orders being given by those who had no right to give them and of disgrace that but for the standing luck of the british army might have ended in brilliant disaster these are unpleasant stories to listen to and the messes tell them under their breath sitting by the big wood fires and the young officer bows his head and thinks to himself please god his men shall never behave unhandily  the british soldier is not altogether to be blamed for occasional lapses but this verdict he should not know a moderately intelligent general will waste six months in mastering the craft of the particular war that he may be waging a colonel may utterly misunderstand the capacity of his regiment for three months after it has taken the field and even a company commander may err and be deceived as to the temper and temperament of his own handful wherefore the soldier and the soldier of today more particularly should not be blamed for fa1ling back he should be shot or hanged afterwards  to encourage the others but he should not be vilified in newspapers for that is want of tact and waste of space  he has let us say been in the service of the empress for perhaps four years he will leave in another two years he has no inherited morals and four years are not sufficient to drive toughness into his fibre or to teach him how holy a thing is his regiment he wants to drink he wants to enjoy himself  in india he wants to save money  and he does not in the least like getting hurt he has received just sufficient education to make him understand half the purport of the orders he receives and to speculate on the nature of clean incised and shattering wounds thus if he is told to deploy under fire preparatory to an attack he knows that he runs a very great risk of being killed while he is deploying and suspects that he is being thrown away to gain ten minutes time he may either deploy with desperate swiftness or he may shuffle or bunch or break according to the discipline under which he has lain for four years  armed with imperfect knowledge cursed with the rudiments of an imagination hampered by the intense selfishness of the lower classes and unsupported by any regimental associations this young man is suddenly introduced to an enemy who in eastern lands is always ugly generally tall and hairy and frequently noisy if he looks to the right and the left and sees old soldiers  men of twelve years service who he knows know what they are about  taking a charge rush or demonstration without embarrassment he is consoled and applies his shoulder to the butt of his rifle with a stout heart his peace is the greater if he hears a senior who has taught him his soldiering and broken his head on occasion whispering theyll shout and carry on like this for five minutes then theyll rush in and then weve got em by the short hairs  but on the other hand if he sees only men of his own term of service turning white and playing with their triggers and saying what the hells up now while the company commanders are sweating into their swordhilts and shouting front rank fix bayonets steady there  steady sight for three hundred  no for five lie down all steady front rank kneel and so forth he becomes unhappy and grows acutely miserable when he hears a comrade turn over with the rattle of fireirons falling into the fender and the grunt of a poleaxed ox if he can be moved about a little and allowed to watch the effect of his own fire on the enemy he feels merrier and may be then worked up to the blind passion of fighting which is contrary to general belief controlled by a chilly devil and shakes men like ague if he is not moved about and begins to feel cold at the pit of the stomach and in that crisis is badly mauled and hears orders that were never given he will break and he will break badly and of all things under the light of the sun there is nothing more terrible than a broken british regiment when the worst comes to the worst and the panic is really epidemic the men must be een let go and the company commanders had better escape to the enemy and stay there for safetys sake if they can be made to come again they are not pleasant men to meet because they will not break twice  about thirty years from this date when we have succeeded in half educating everything that wears trousers our army will be a beautifully unreliable machine it will know too much and it will do too little later still when all men are at the mental level of the officer of today it will sweep the earth speaking roughly you must employ either blackguards or gentlemen or best of all blackguards commanded by gentlemen to do butchers work with efficiency and despatch the ideal soldier should of course think for himself  the pocketbook says so unfortunately to attain this virtue he has to pass through the phase of thinking of himself and that is misdirected genius a blackguard may be slow to think for himself but he is genuinely anxious to kill and a little punishment teaches him how to guard his own skin and perforate anothers a powerfully prayerful highland regiment officered by rank presbyterians is perhaps one degree more terrible in action than a hardbitten thousand of irresponsible irish ruffians led by most improper young unbelievers but these things prove the rule  which is that the midway men are not to be trusted alone they have ideas about the value of life and an upbringing that has not taught them to go on and take the chances they are carefully unprovided with a backing of comrades who have been shot over and until that backing is reintroduced as a great many regimental commanders intend it shall be they are more liable to disgrace themselves than the size of the empire or the dignity of the army allows their officers are as good as good can be because their training begins early and god has arranged that a cleanrun youth of the british middle classes shall in the matter of backbone brains and bowels surpass all other youths for this reason a child of eighteen will stand up doing nothing with a tin sword in his hand and joy in his heart until he is dropped if he dies he dies like a gentleman if he lives he writes home that he has been potted sniped chipped or cut over and sits down to besiege government for a wound gratuity until the next little war breaks out when he perjures himself before a medical board blarneys his colonel burns incense round his adjutant and is allowed to go to the front once more  which homily brings me directly to a brace of the most finished little fiends that ever banged drum or tootled fife in the band of a british regiment they ended their sinful career by open and flagrant mutiny and were shot for it their names were jakin and lew  piggy lew and they were bold bad drummerboys both of them frequently birched by the drummajor of the fore and aft  jakin was a stunted child of fourteen and lew was about the same age when not looked after they smoked and drank they swore habitually after the manner of the barrackroom which is cold swearing and comes from between clenched teeth and they fought religiously once a week jakin had sprung from some london gutter and may or may not have passed through dr barnardos hands ere he arrived at the dignity of drummerboy lew could remember nothing except the regiment and the delight of listening to the band from his earliest years he hid somewhere in his grimy little soul a genuine love for music and was most mistakenly furnished with the head of a cherub insomuch that beautiful ladies who watched the regiment in church were wont to speak of him as a darling they never heard his vitriolic comments on their manners and morals as he walked back to barracks with the band and matured fresh causes of offence against jakin  the other drummerboys hated both lads on account of their illogical conduct jakin might be pounding lew or lew might be rubbing jakins head in the dirt but any attempt at aggression on the part of an outsider was met by the combined forces of lew and jakin and the consequences were painful the boys were the ishmaels of the corps but wealthy ishmaels for they sold battles in alternate weeks for the sport of the barracks when they were not pitted against other boys and thus amassed money  on this particular day there was dissension in the camp they had just been convicted afresh of smoking which is bad for little boys who use plugtobacco and lews contention was that jakin had stunk so orrid bad from keepin the pipe in pocket that he and he alone was responsible for the birching they were both tingling under  i tell you i id the pipe back o barracks said jakin pacifically  youre a bloomin liar said lew without heat  youre a bloomin little barstard said jakin strong in the knowledge that his own ancestry was unknown  now there is one word in the extended vocabulary of barrackroom abuse that cannot pass without comment you may call a man a thief and risk nothing you may even call him a coward without finding more than a boot whiz past your ear but you must not call a man a bastard unless you are prepared to prove it on his front teeth  you might ha kep that till i wasnt so sore said lew sorrowfully dodging round jakins guard  ill make you sorer said jakin genially and got home on lews alabaster forehead all would have gone well and this story as the books say would never have been written had not his evil fate prompted the bazarsergeants son a long employless man of fiveandtwenty to put in an appearance after the first round he was eternally in need of money and knew that the boys had silver  fighting again said he ill report you to my father and hell report you to the coloursergeant  whats that to you said jakin with an unpleasant dilation of the nostrils  oh nothing to me youll get into trouble and youve been up too often to afford that  what the hell do you know about what weve done asked lew the seraph you arent in the army you lousy cadging civilian  he closed in on the mans left flank  jes cause you find two gentlemen settlin their diffrences with their fistes you stick in your ugly nose where you arent wanted run ome to your arfcaste slut of a ma  or well give you whatfor said jakin  the man attempted reprisals by knocking the boys heads together the scheme would have succeeded had not jakin punched him vehemently in the stomach or had lew refrained from kicking his shins they fought together bleeding and breathless for half an hour and after heavy punishment triumphantly pulled down their opponent as terriers pull down a jackal  now gasped jakin ill give you whatfor he proceeded to pound the mans features while lew stamped on the outlying portions of his anatomy chivalry is not a strong point in the composition of the average drummerboy he fights as do his betters to make his mark  ghastly was the ruin that escaped and awful was the wrath of the bazarsergeant awful too was the scene in orderlyroom when the two reprobates appeared to answer the charge of halfmurdering a civilian the bazarsergeant thirsted for a criminal action and his son lied the boys stood to attention while the black clouds of evidence accumulated  you little devils are more trouble than the rest of the regiment put together said the colonel angrily one might as well admonish thistledown and i cant well put you in cells or under stoppages you must be birched again  beg y pardon sir cant we say nothin in our own defence sir shrilled jakin  hey what are you going to argue with me said the colonel  no sir said lew but if a man come to you sir and said he was going to report you sir for aving a bit of a turnup with a friend sir an wanted to get money out o you sir  the orderlyroom exploded in a roar of laughter well said the colonel  that was what that measly jarnwar there did sir and ed a done it sir if we adnt prevented im we didnt it im much sir e adnt no manner o right to interfere with us sir i dont mind bein birched by the drummajor sir nor yet reported by any corpral but im  but i dont think its fair sir for a civilian to come an talk over a man in the army  a second shout of laughter shook the orderlyroom but the colonel was grave  what sort of characters have these boys he asked of the regimental sergeantmajor  accordin to the bandmaster sir returned that revered official  the only soul in the regiment whom the boys feared  they do everything but lie sir  is it like wed go for that man for fun sir said lew pointing to the plaintiff  oh admonished  admonished said the colonel testily and when the boys had gone he read the bazarsergeants son a lecture on the sin of unprofitable meddling and gave orders that the bandmaster should keep the drums in better discipline  if either of you come to practice again with so much as a scratch on your two ugly little faces thundered the bandmaster ill tell the drummajor to take the skin off your backs understand that you young devils  then he repented of his speech for just the length of time that lew looking like a seraph in red worsted embellishments took the place of one of the trumpets  in hospital  and rendered the echo of a battlepiece lew certainly was a musician and had often in his more exalted moments expressed a yearning to master every instrument of the band  theres nothing to prevent your becoming a bandmaster lew said the bandmaster who had composed waltzes of his own and worked day and night in the interests of the band  what did he say demanded jakin after practice  said i might be a bloomin bandmaster an be asked in to ave a glass o sherry wine on messnights  ho said you might be a bloomin noncombatant did e thats just about wot e would say when ive put in my boys service its a bloomin shame that doesnt count for pension  ill take on as a privit then ill be a lance in a year  knowin what i know about the ins an outs o things in three years ill be a bloomin sergeant i wont marry then not i ill old on and learn the orfcers ways an apply for exchange into a regment that doesnt know all about me then ill be a bloomin orfcer then ill ask you to ave a glass o sherry wine mister lew an youll bloomin well ave to stay in the hantyroom while the messsergeant brings it to your dirty ands  spose im going to be a bandmaster not i quite ill be a orfcer too theres nothin like takin to a thing an stickin to it the schoolmaster says the regment dont go ome for another seven years ill be a lance then or near to  thus the boys discussed their futures and conducted themselves piously for a week that is to say lew started a flirtation with the coloursergeants daughter aged thirteen  not as he explained to jakin with any intention o matrimony but by way o keep in my and in and the blackhaired cris delighan enjoyed that flirtation more than previous ones and the other drummerboys raged furiously together and jakin preached sermons on the dangers of      bein tangled along o petticoats  but neither love nor virtue would have held lew long in the paths of propriety had not the rumour gone abroad that the regiment was to be sent on active service to take part in a war which for the sake of brevity we will call the war of the lost tribes  the barracks had the rumour almost before the messroom and of all the nine hundred men in barracks not ten had seen a shot fired in anger the colonel had twenty years ago assisted at a frontier expedition one of the majors had seen service at the cape a confirmed deserter in e company had helped to clear streets in ireland but that was all the regiment had been put by for many years the overwhelming mass of its rank and file had from three to four years service the noncommissioned officers were under thirty years old and men and sergeants alike had forgotten to speak of the stories written in brief upon the colours  the new colours that had been formally blessed by an archbishop in england ere the regiment came away they wanted to go to the front  they were enthusiastically anxious to go  but they had no knowledge of what war meant and there was none to tell them they were an educated regiment the percentage of schoolcertificates in their ranks was high and most of the men could do more than read and write they had been recruited in loyal observance of the territorial idea but they themselves had no notion of that idea they were made up of drafts from an over populated manufacturing district the system had put flesh and muscle upon their small bones but it could not put heart into the sons of those who for generations had done overmuch work for overscanty pay had sweated in dryingrooms stooped over looms coughed among whitelead and shivered on limebarges the men had found food and rest in the army and now they were going to fight niggers  people who ran away if you shook a stick at them wherefore they cheered lustily when the rumour ran and the shrewd clerkly noncommissioned officers speculated on the chances of batta and of saving their pay at headquarters men said the fore and fit have never been under fire within the last generation let us therefore break them in easily by setting them to guard lines of communication and this would have been done but for the fact that british regiments were wanted  badly wanted  at the front and there were doubtful native regiments that could fill the minor duties brigade em with two strong regiments said headquarters they may be knocked about a bit but theyll learn their business before they come through nothing like a nightalarm and a little cuttingup of stragglers to make a regiment smart in the field wait till theyve had half a dozen sentries throats cut  the colonel wrote with delight that the temper of his men was excellent that the regiment was all that could be wished and as sound as a bell the majors smiled with a sober joy and the subalterns waltzed in pairs down the messroom after dinner and nearly shot themselves at revolverpractice but there was consternation in the hearts of jakin and lew what was to be done with the drums would the band go to the front how many of the drums would accompany the regiment  they took counsel together sitting in a tree and smoking  its more than a bloomin tossup theyll leave us beind at the depot with the women youll like that said jakin sarcastically  cause o cris y mean wots a woman or a ole bloomin depot o women longside o the chanst of fieldservice you know im as keen on goin as you said lew  wish i was a bloomin bugler said jakin sadly theyll take tom kidd along that i can plaster a wall with an like as not they wont take us  then lets go an make tom kidd so bloomin sick e cant bugle no more you old is ands an ill kick him said lew wriggling on the branch  that aint no good neither we aint the sort o characters to presoom on our reptations  theyre bad if they have the band at the depot we dont go and no error there if they take the band we may get cast for medical unfitness are you medical fit piggy said jakin digging lew in the ribs with force  yus said lew with an oath the doctor says your earts weak through smokin on an empty stummick throw a chest an ill try yer  jakin threw out his chest which lew smote with all his might jakin turned very pale gasped crowed screwed up his eyes and said  thats all right  youll do said lew ive eard o men dying when you it em fair on the breastbone  dont bring us no nearer goin though said jakin do you know where were ordered  gawd knows an e wont split on a pal somewheres up to the front to kill paythans  hairy big beggars that turn you inside out if they get old o you they say their women are good looking too  any loot asked the abandoned jakin  not a bloomin anna they say unless you dig up the ground an see what the niggers ave id theyre a poor lot jakin stood upright on the branch and gazed across the plain  lew said he theres the colonel coming colonels a good old beggar lets go an talk to im  lew nearly fell out of the tree at the audacity of the suggestion like jakin he feared not god neither regarded he man but there are limits even to the audacity of a drummerboy and to speak to a colonel was   but jakin had slid down the trunk and doubled in the direction of the colonel that officer was walking wrapped in thought and visions of a c b yes even a k c b for had he not at command one of the best regiments of the line  the fore and fit and he was aware of two small boys charging down upon him once before it had been solemnly reported to him that the drums were in a state of mutiny jakin and lew being the ringleaders this looked like an organised conspiracy  the boys halted at twenty yards walked to the regulation four paces and saluted together each as well setup as a ramrod and little taller  the colonel was in a genial mood the boys appeared very forlorn and unprotected on the desolate plain and one of them was handsome  well said the colonel recognising them are you going to pull me down in the open im sure i never interfere with you even though  he sniffed suspiciously  you have been smoking  it was time to strike while the iron was hot their hearts beat tumultuously  beg y pardon sir began jakin the regments ordered on active service sir  so i believe said the colonel courteously  is the band goin sir said both together then without pause were     goin sir aint we  you said the colonel stepping back the more fully to take in the two small figures you youd die in the first march  no we wouldnt sir we can march with the regment anywheres  prade an anywhere else said jakin  if tom kidd goes ell shut up like a claspknife said lew tom as veryclose veins in both is legs sir  very how much  veryclose veins sir thats why they swells after long prade sir if e can go we can go sir  again the colonel looked at them long and intently  yes the band is going he said as gravely as though he had been addressing a brother officer have you any parents either of you two  no sir rejoicingly from lew and jakin were both orphans sir theres no one to be considered of on our account sir  you poor little sprats and you want to go up to the front with the regiment do you why  ive wore the queens uniform for two years said jakin its very ard sir that a man dont get no recompense for doin of is dooty sir  an an if i dont go sir interrupted lew the bandmaster e says ell catch an make a bloo  a blessed musician o me sir before ive seen any service sir  the colonel made no answer for a long time then he said quietly if youre passed by the doctor i dare say you can go i shouldnt smoke if i were you  the boys saluted and disappeared the colonel walked home and told the story to his wife who nearly cried over it the colonel was well pleased if that was the temper of the children what would not the men do  jakin and lew entered the boys barrackroom with great stateliness and refused to hold any conversation with their comrades for at least ten minutes then bursting with pride jakin drawled ive bin intervooin the colonel good old beggar is the colonel says i to im colonel says i let me go to the front along o the regment  to the front you shall go says e an i only wish there was more like you among the dirty little devils that bang the bloomin drums kidd if you throw your courtrements at me for tellin you the truth to your own advantage your legsll swell  none the less there was a battleroyal in the barrackroom for the boys were consumed with envy and hate and neither jakin nor lew behaved in conciliatory wise  im goin out to say adoo to my girl said lew to cap the climax dont none o you touch my kit because its wanted for active service me bein specially invited to go by the colonel  he strolled forth and whistled in the clump of trees at the back of the married quarters till cris came to him and the preliminary kisses being given and taken lew began to explain the situation  im goin to the front with the regment he said valiantly  piggy youre a little liar said cris but her heart misgave her for lew was not in the habit of lying  liar yourself cris said lew slipping an arm round her im goin when the regment marches out youll see me with em all galliant and gay give us another kiss cris on the strength of it  if youd ony astayed at the depot  where you ought to ha bin  you could get as many of em as  as you dam please whimpered cris putting up her mouth  its ard cris i grant you its ard but whats a man to do if id astayed at the depot you wouldnt think anything of me  like as not but id ave you with me piggy an all the thinkin in the world isnt like kissin  an all the kissin in the world isnt like avin a medal to wear on the front o your coat  you wont get no medal  oh yus i shall though me an jakin are the only acting drummers thatll be took along all the rest is full men an well get our medals with them  they might ha taken anybody but you piggy youll get killed  youre so venturesome stay with me piggy darlin down at the depot an ill love you true for ever  aint you goin to do that now cris you said you was  0 course i am but th others more comfortable wait till youve growed a bit piggy you arent no

 marry you when im a lance  promise piggy  lew reflected on the future as arranged by jakin a short time previously but criss mouth was very near to his own  i promise selp me gawd said he  cris slid an arm round his neck  i wont old you back no more piggy go away an get your medal an ill make you a new buttonbag as nice as i know how she whispered  put some o your air into it cris an ill keep it in my pocket so longs im alive  then cris wept anew and the interview ended public feeling among the drummerboys rose to fever pitch and the lives of jakin and lew became unenviable not only had they been permitted to enlist two years before the regulation boys age  fourteen  but by virtue it seemed of their extreme youth they were allowed to go to the front  which thing had not happened to actingdrummers within the knowledge of boy the band which was to accompany the regiment had been cut down to the regulation twenty men the surplus returning to the ranks jakin and lew were attached to the band as supernumeraries though they would much have preferred being company buglers  dont matter much said jakin after the medical inspection be thankful that were lowed to go at all the doctor e said that if we could stand what we took from the bazarsergeants son wed stand pretty nigh anything  which we will said lew looking tenderly at the ragged and ill made housewife that cris had given him with a lock of her hair worked into a sprawling l upon the cover  it was the best i could she sobbed i wouldnt let mother nor the sergeants tailor elp me keep it always piggy an remember i love you true  they marched to the railway station nine hundred and sixty strong and every soul in cantonments turned out to see them go the drummers gnashed their teeth at jakin and lew marching with the band the married women wept upon the platform and the regiment cheered its noble self black in the face  a nice level lot said the colonel to the secondincommand as they watched the first four companies entraining  fit to do anything said the secondincommand enthusiastically but it seems to me theyre a thought too young and tender for the work in hand its bitter cold up at the front now  theyre sound enough said the colonel we must take our chance of sick casualties  so they went northward ever northward past droves and droves of camels armies of campfollowers and legions of laden mules the throng thickening day by day till with a shriek the train pulled up at a hopelessly congested junction where six lines of temporary track accommodated six fortywaggon trains where whistles blew babus sweated and commissariat officers swore from dawn till far into the night amid the winddriven chaff of the fodderbales and the lowing of a thousand steers  hurry up  youre badly wanted at the front was the message that greeted the fore and aft and the occupants of the red cross carriages told the same tale  tisnt so much the bloomin fightin gasped a headbound trooper of hussars to a knot of admiring fore and afts tisnt so much the bloomin fightin though theres enough o that its the bloomin food an the bloomin climate frost all night cept when it hails and biling sun all day and the water stinks fit to knock you down i got my ead chipped like a egg ive got pneumonia too an my guts is all out o order taint no bloomin picnic in those parts i can tell you  wot are the niggers like demanded a private  theres some prisoners in that train yonder go an look at em theyre the aristocracy o the country the common folk are a dashed sight uglier if you want to know what they fight with reach under my seat an pull out the long knife thats there  they dragged out and beheld for the first time the grim bone handled triangular afghan knife it was almost as long as lew  thats the thing to jint ye said the trooper feebly it can take off a mans arm at the shoulder as easy as slicing butter i halved the beggar that used that un but theres more of his likes up above they dont understand thrustin but theyre devils to slice  the men strolled across the tracks to inspect the afghan prisoners they were unlike any niggers that the fore and aft had ever met  these huge blackhaired scowling sons of the beniisrael as the men stared the afghans spat freely and muttered one to another with lowered eyes  my eyes wot awful swine said jakin who was in the rear of the procession say ole man how you got puckrowed eh kiswasti you wasnt hanged for your ugly face hey  the tallest of the company turned his legirons clanking at the movement and stared at the boy see he cried to his fellows in pushto they send children against us what a people and what fools  hya said jakin nodding his head cheerily you go down country khana get peenikapanee get  live like a bloomin raja ke marfik thats a better bandobust than baynit get it in your innards goodbye ole man take care o your beautiful figure ead an try to look kushy  the men laughed and fell in for their first march when they began to realise that a soldiers life is not all beer and skittles they were much impressed with the size and bestial ferocity of the niggers whom they had now learned to call paythans and more with the exceeding discomfort of their own surroundings twenty old soldiers in the corps would have taught them how to make themselves moderately snug at night but they had no old soldiers and as the troops on the line of march said they lived like pigs they learned the heartbreaking cussedness of campkitchens and camels and the depravity of an e p tent and a witherwrung mule they studied animalculae in water and developed a few cases of dysentery in their study  at the end of their third march they were disagreeably surprised by the arrival in their camp of a hammered iron slug which fired from a steady rest at seven hundred yards flicked out the brains of a private seated by the fire this robbed them of their peace for a night and was the beginning of a longrange fire carefully calculated to that end in the daytime they saw nothing except an unpleasant puff of smoke from a crag above the line of march at night there were distant spurts of flame and occasional casualties which set the whole camp blazing into the gloom and occasionally into opposite tents then they swore vehemently and vowed that this was magnificent but not war  indeed it was not the regiment could not halt for reprisals against the sharpshooters of the countryside its duty was to go forward and make connectioon with the scotch and goorkha troops with which it was brigaded the afghans knew this and knew too after their first tentative shots that they were dealing with a raw regiment thereafter they devoted themselves to the task of keeping the fore and aft on the strain not for anything would they have taken equal liberties with a seasoned corps  with the wicked little goorkhas whose delight it was to lie out in the open on a dark night and stalk their stalkers  with the terrible big men dressed in womens clothes who could be heard praying to their god in the nightwatches and whose peace of mind no amount of sniping could shake  or with those vile sikhs who marched so ostentatiously unprepared and who dealt out such grim reward to those who tried to profit by that unpreparedness this white regiment was different  quite different it slept like a hog and like a hog charged in every direction when it was roused its sentries walked with a footfall that could be heard for a quarter of a mile would fire at anything that moved  even a driven donkey  and when they had once fired could be scientifically rushed  and laid out a horror and an offence against the morning sun then there were campfollowers who straggled and could be cut up without fear their shrieks would disturb the white boys and the loss of their services would inconvenience them sorely  thus at every march the hidden enemy became bolder and the regiment writhed and twisted under attacks it could not avenge the crowning triumph was a sudden nightrush ending in the cutting of many tentropes the collapse of the sodden canvas and a glorious knifing of the men who struggled and kicked below it was a great deed neatly carried out and it shook the already shaken nerves of the fore and aft all the courage that they had been required to exercise up to this point was the two oclock in the morning courage and so far they had only succeeded in shooting their comrades and losing their sleep  sullen discontented cold savage sick with their uniforms dulled and unclean the fore and aft joined their brigade  i hear you had a tough time of it coming up said the brigadier but when he saw the hospitalsheets his face fell  this is bad said he to himself theyre as rotten as sheep and aloud to the colonel  im afraid we cant spare you just yet we want all we have else i should have given you ten days to recover in  the colonel winced on my honour sir he returned there is not the least necessity to think of sparing us my men have been rather mauled and upset without a fair return they only want to go in somewhere where they can see whats before them  cant say i think much of the fore and fit said the brigadier in confidence to his brigademajor theyve lost all their soldiering and by the trim of them might have marched through the country from the other side a more faggedout set of men i never put eyes on  oh theyll improve as the work goes on the parade gloss has been rubbed off a little but theyll put on field polish before long said the brigademajor theyve been mauled and they dont quite understand it  they did not all the hitting was on one side and it was cruelly hard hitting with accessories that made them sick there was also the real sickness that laid hold of a strong man and dragged him howling to the grave worst of all their officers knew just as little of the country as the men themselves and looked as if they did the fore and aft were in a thoroughly unsatisfactory condition but they believed that all would be well if they could once get a fair goin at the enemy potshots up and down the valleys were unsatisfactory and the bayonet never seemed to get a chance perhaps it was as well for a longlimbed afghan with a knife had a reach of eight feet and could carry away lead that would disable three englishmen  the fore and aft would like some riflepractice at the enemy  all seven hundred rifles blazing together that wish showed the mood of the men  the goorkhas walked into their camp and in broken barrackroom english strove to fraternise with them offered them pipes of tobacco and stood them treat at the canteen but the fore and aft not knowing much of the nature of the goorkhas treated them as they would treat any other niggers and the little men in green trotted back to their firm friends the highlanders and with many grins confided to them that dam white regiment no dam use sulky  ugh dirty  ugh hya any tot for johnny whereat the highlanders smote the goorkhas as to the head and told them not to vilify a british regiment and the goorkhas grinned cavernously for the highlanders were their elder brothers and entitled to the privileges of kinship the common soldier who touches a goorkha is more than likely to have his head sliced open  three days later the brigadier arranged a battle according to the rules of war and the peculiarity of the afghan temperament the enemy were massing in inconvenient strength among the hills and the moving of many green standards warned him that the tribes were up in aid of the afghan regular troops a squadron and a half of bengal lancers represented the available cavalry and two screw guns borrowed from a column thirty miles away the artillery at the generals disposal  if they stand as ive a very strong notion that they will i fancy we shall see an infantry fight that will be worth watching said the brigadier well do it in style each regiment shall be played into action by its band and well hold the cavalry in reserve  for all the reserve somebody asked  for all the reserve because were going to crumple them up said the brigadier who was an extraordinary brigadier and did not believe in the value of a reserve when dealing with asiatics indeed when you come to think of it had the british army consistently waited for reserves in all its little affairs the boundaries of our empire would have stopped at brighton beach  the battle was to be a glorious battle  the three regiments debouching from three separate gorges after duly crowning the heights above were to converge from the centre left and right upon what we will call the afghan army then stationed towards the lower extremity of a flatbottomed valley thus it will be seen that three sides of the valley practically belonged to the english while the fourth was strictly afghan property in the event of defeat the afghans had the rocky hills to fly to where the fire from the guerrilla tribes in aid would cover their retreat in the event of victory these same tribes would rush down and lend their weight to the rout of the british  the screwguns were to shell the head of each afghan rush that was made in close formation and the cavalry held in reserve in the right valley were to gently stimulate the breakup which would follow on the combined attack the brigadier sitting upon a rock overlooking the valley would watch the battle unrolled at his feet the fore and aft would debouch from the central gorge the goorkhas from the left and the highlanders from the right for the reason that the left flank of the enemy seemed as though it required the most hammering it was not every day that an afghan force would take ground in the open and the brigadier was resolved to make the most of it  if we only had a few more men he said plaintively we could surround the creatures and crumple em up thoroughly as it is im afraid we can only cut them up as they run its a great pity  the fore and aft had enjoyed unbroken peace for five days and were beginning in spite of dysentery to recover their nerve but they were not happy for they did not know the work in hand and had they known would not have known how to do it throughout those five days in which old soldiers might have taught them the craft of the game they discussed together their misadventures in the past  how such an one was alive at dawn and dead ere the dusk and with what shrieks and struggles such another had given up his soul under the afghan knife death was a new and horrible thing to the sons of mechanics who were used to die decently of zymotic disease and their careful conservation in barracks had done nothing to make them look upon it with less dread  very early in the dawn the bugles began to blow and the fore and aft filled with a misguided enthusiasm turned out without waiting for a cup of coffee and a biscuit and were rewarded by being kept under arms in the cold while the other regiments leisurely prepared for the fray all the world knows that it is ill taking the breeks off a highlander it is much iller to try to make him stir unless he is convinced of the necessity for haste 507 the fore and aft waited leaning upon their rifles and listening to the protests of their empty stomachs the colonel did his best to remedy the default of lining as soon as it was borne in upon him that the affair would not begin at once and so well did he succeed that the coffee was just ready when  the men moved off their band leading even then there had been a mistake in time and the fore and aft came out into the valley ten minutes before the proper hour their band wheeled to the right after reaching the open and retired behind a little rocky knoll still playing while the regiment went past  it was not a pleasant sight that opened on the uninstructed view for the lower end of the valley appeared to be filled by an army in position  real and actual regiments attired in red coats and  of this there was no doubt  firing martinihenry bullets which cut up the ground a hundred yards in front of the leading company over that pockmarked ground the regiment had to pass and it opened the ball with a general and profound courtesy to the piping pickets ducking in perfect time as though it had been brazed on a rod being half capable of thinking for itself it fired a volley by the simple process of pitching its rifle into its shoulder and pulling the trigger the bullets may have accounted for some of the watchers on the hill side but they certainly did not affect the mass of enemy in front while the noise of the rifles drowned any orders that might have been given  good god said the brigadier sitting on the rock high above all that regiment has spoilt the whole show hurry up the others and let the screwguns get off  but the screwguns in working round the heights had stumbled upon a wasps nest of a small mud fort which they incontinently shelled at eight hundred yards to the huge discomfort of the occupants who were unaccustomed to weapons of such devilish precision  the fore and aft continued to go forward but with shortened stride where were the other regiments and why did these niggers use martinis they took open order instinctively lying down and firing at random rushing a few paces forward and lying down again according to the regulations once in this formation each man felt himself desperately alone and edged in towards his fellow for comforts sake  then the crack of his neighbors rifle at his ear led him to fire as rapidly as he could  again for the sake of the comfort of the noise the reward was not long delayed five volleys plunged the files in banked smoke impenetrable to the eye and the bullets began to take ground twenty or thirty yards in front of the firers as the weight of the bayonet dragged down and to the right arms wearied with holding the kick of the leaping martini the company commanders peered helplessly through the smoke the more nervous mechanically trying to fan it away with their helmets  high and to the left bawled a captain till he was hoarse no good cease firing and let it drift away a bit  three and four times the bugles shrieked the order and when it was obeyed the fore and aft looked that their foe should be lying before them in mown swaths of men a light wind drove the smoke to leeward and showed the enemy still in position and apparently unaffected a quarter of a ton of lead had been buried a furlong in front of them as the ragged earth attested  that was not demoralizing to the afghans who have not european nerves they were waiting for the mad riot to die down and were firing quietly into the heart of the smoke a private of the fore and aft spun up his company shrieking with agony another was kicking the earth and gasping and a third ripped through the lower intestines by a jagged bullet was calling aloud on his comrades to put him out of his pain these were the casualties and they were not soothing to hear or see the smoke cleared to a dull haze  then the foe began to shout with a great shouting and a mass  a black mass  detached itself from the main body and rolled over the ground at horrid speed it was composed of perhaps three hundred men who would shout and fire and slash if the rush of their fifty comrades who were determined to die carried home the fifty were ghazis half maddened with drugs and wholly mad with religious fanaticism when they rushed the british fire ceased and in the lull the order was given to close ranks and meet them with the bayonet  any one who knew the business could have told the fore and aft that the only way of dealing with a ghazi rush is by volleys at long ranges because a man who means to die who desires to die who will gain heaven by dying must in nine cases out of ten kill a man who has a lingering prejudice in favour of life where they should have closed and gone forward the fore and aft opened out and skirmished and where they should have opened out and fired they closed and waited  a man dragged from his blankets half awake and unfed is never in a pleasant frame of mind nor does his happiness increase when he watches the whites of the eyes of three hundred sixfoot fiends upon whose beards the foam is lying upon whose tongues is a roar of wrath and in whose hands are yardlong knives  the fore and aft heard the goorkha bugles bringing that regiment forward at the double while the neighing of the highland pipes came from the left they strove to stay where they were though the bayonets wavered down the line like the oars of a ragged boat then they felt body to body the amazing physical strength of their foes a shriek of pain ended the rush and the knives fell amid scenes not to be told the men clubbed together and smote blindly  as often as not at their own fellows their front crumpled like paper and the fifty ghazis passed on their backers now drunk with success fighting as madly as they  then the rear ranks were bidden to close up and the subalterns dashed into the stew  alone for the rearranks had heard the clamour in front the yells and the howls of pain and had seen the dark stale blood that makes afraid they were not going to stay it was the rushing of the camps over again let their officers go to hell if they chose they would get away from the knives  come on shrieked the subalterns and their men cursing them drew back each closing in to his neighbour and wheeling round  charteris and devlin subalterns of the last company faced their death alone in the belief that their men would follow  youve killed me you cowards sobbed devlin and dropped cut from the shoulderstrap to the centre of the chest and a fresh detachment of his men retreating always retreating trampled him under foot as they made for the pass whence they had emerged  i kissed her in the kitchen and i kissed her in the hall childun childun follow me oh golly said the cook is he gwine to kiss us all halla  halla  halla  hallelujah  the goorkhas were pouring through the left gorge and over the heights at the double to the invitation of their regimental quick step the black rocks were crowned with dark green spiders as the bugles gave tongue jubilantly   in the morning in the morning by the bright light when gabriel blows his trumpet in the morning  the goorkha rear companies tripped and blundered over loose stones the front files halted for a moment to take stock of the valley and to settle stray bootlaces then a happy little sigh of contentment soughed down the ranks and it was as though the land smiled for behold there below was the enemy and it was to meet them that the goorkhas had doubled so hastily there was much enemy there would be amusement the little men hitched their kukris well to hand and gaped expectantly at their officers as terriers grin ere the stone is cast for them to fetch the goorkhas ground sloped downward to the valley and they enjoyed a fair view of the proceedings they sat upon the boulders to watch for their officers were not going to waste their wind in assisting to repulse a ghazi rush more than half a mile away let the white men look to their own front  hi yi  said the subadarmajor who was sweating profusely dam fools yonder stand close order this is no time for close order it is the time for volleys ugh  horrified amused and indignant the goorkhas beheld the retirement of the fore and aft with a running chorus of oaths and commentaries  they run the white men run colonel sahib may we also do a little running murmured runbir thappa the senior jemadar  but the colonel would have none of it let the beggars be cut up a little said he wrathfully serves em right theyll be prodded into facing round in a minute he looked through his fieldglasses and caught the glint of an officers sword  beating em with the flat  damned conscripts how the ghazis are walking into them said he  the fore and aft heading back bore with them their officers the narrowness of the pass forced the mob into solid formation and the rear ranks delivered some sort of a wavering volley the ghazis drew off for they did not know what reserve the gorge might hide moreover it was never wise to chase white men too far they returned as wolves return to cover satisfied with the slaughter that they had done and only stopping to slash at the wounded on the ground a quarter of a mile had the fore and aft retreated and now jammed in the pass was quivering with pain shaken and demoralised with fear while the officers maddened beyond control smote the men with the hilts and the flats of their swords  get back get back you cowards  you women right about face  column of companies form  you hounds shouted the colonel and the subalterns swore aloud but the regiment wanted to go  to go anywhere out of the range of those merciless knives it swayed to and fro irresolutely with shouts and outcries while from the right the goorkhas dropped volley after volley of cripplestopper snider bullets at long range into the mob of the ghazis returning to their own troops  the fore and aft band though protected from direct fire by the rocky knoll under which it had sat down fled at the first rush jakin and lew would have fled also but their short legs left them fifty yards in the rear and by the time the band had mixed with the regiment they were painfully aware that they would have to close in alone and unsupported  get back to that rock gasped jakin they wont see us there  and they returned to the scattered instruments of the band their hearts nearly bursting their ribs  heres a nice show for us said jakin throwing himself full length on the ground a bloomin fine show for british infantry oh the devils theyve gone and left us alone here wotll we do  lew took possession of a castoff waterbottle which naturally was full of canteen rum and drank till he coughed again  drink said he shortly theyll come back in a minute or two  you see  jakin drank but there was no sign of the regiments return they could hear a dull clamour from the head of the valley of retreat and saw the ghazis slink back quickening their pace as the goorkhas fired at them  were all thats left of the band an well be cut up as sure as death said jakin  ill die game then said lew thickly fumbling with his tiny drummers sword the drink was working on his brain as it was on jakins  old on i know something better than fightin said jakin stung by the splendour of a sudden thought due chiefly to rum tip our bloomin cowards yonder the word to come back the paythan beggars are well away come on lew we wont get hurt take the fife an give me the drum the old step for all your bloomin guts are worth theres a few of our men coming back now stand up ye drunken little defaulter by your right  quick march  he slipped the drumsling over his shoulder thrust the fife into lews hand and the two boys marched out of the cover of the rock into the open making a hideous hash of the first bars of the british grenadiers  as lew had said a few of the fore and aft were coming back sullenly and shamefacedly under the stimulus of blows and abuse their red coats shone at the head of the valley and behind them were wavering bayonets but between this shattered line and the enemy who with afghan suspicion feared that the hasty retreat meant an ambush and had not moved therefore lay half a mile of level ground dotted only by the wounded  the tune settled into full swing and the boys kept shoulder to shoulder jakin banging the drum as one possessed the one fife made a thin and pitiful squeaking but the tune carried far even to the goorkhas  come on you dogs muttered jakin to himself are we to play forhever lew was staring straight in front of him and marching more stiffly than ever he had done on parade  and in bitter mockery of the distant mob the old tune of the old line shrilled and rattled  some talk of alexander and some of hercules of hector and lysander and such great names as these  there was a faroff clapping of hands from the goorkhas and a roar from the highlanders in the distance but never a shot was fired by british or afghan the two little red dots moved forward in the open parallel to the enemys front  but of all the worlds great heroes theres none that can compare with a towrowrowrowrowrow to the british grenadier  the men of the fore and aft were gathering thick at the entrance into the plain the brigadier on the heights far above was speechless with rage still no movement from the enemy the day stayed to watch the children  jakin halted and beat the long roll of the assembly while the fife squealed despairingly  right about face hold up lew youre drunk said jakin they wheeled and marched back   hose heroes of antiquity neer saw a cannonball nor knew the force o powder  here they come said jakin go on lew   to scare their foes withal  the fore and aft were pouring out of the valley what officers had said to men in that time of shame and humiliation will never be known for neither officers nor men speak of it now  they are coming anew shouted a priest among the afghans do not kill the boys take them alive and they shall be of our faith  but the first volley had been fired and lew dropped on his face jakin stood for a minute spun round and collapsed as the fore and aft came forward the curses of their officers in their ears and in their hearts the shame of open shame   half the men had seen the drummers die and they made no sign they did not even shout they doubled out straight across the plain in open order and they did not fire  this said the colonel of goorkhas softly is the real attack as it should have been delivered come on my children  ululululu squealed the goorkhas and came down with a joyful clicking of kukris  those vicious goorkha knives  on the right there was no rush the highlanders cannily commending their souls to god for it matters as much to a dead man whether he has been shot in a border scuffle or at waterloo opened out and fired according to their custom that is to say without heat and without intervals while the screwguns having disposed of the impertinent mud fort aforementioned dropped shell after shell into the clusters round the flickering green standards on the heights  charrging is an unfortunate necessity murmured the colour sergeant of the right company of the highlanders it makes the men sweer so but i am thinkin that it will come to a charrge if these black devils stand much longer stewarrt man youre firing into the eye of the sun and hell not take any harm for government ammuneetion a foot lower and a great deal slower what are the english doing theyre very quiet there in the center running again  the english were not running they were hacking and hewing and stabbing for though one white man is seldom physically a match for an afghan in a sheepskin or wadded coat yet through the pressure of many white men behind and a certain thirst for revenge in his heart he becomes capable of doing much with both ends of his rifle the fore and aft held their fire till one bullet could drive through five or six men and the front of the afghan force gave on the volley they then selected their men and slew them with deep gasps and short hacking coughs and groanings of leather belts against strained bodies and realised for the first time that an afghan attacked is far less formidable than an afghan attacking which fact old soldiers might have told them  but they had no old soldiers in their ranks  the goorkhas stall at the bazar was the noisiest for the men were engaged  to a nasty noise as of beef being cut on the block  with the kukri which they preferred to the bayonet well knowing how the afghan hates the halfmoon blade  as the afghans wavered the green standards on the mountain moved down to assist them in a last rally this was unwise the lancers chafing in the right gorge had thrice despatched their only subaltern as galloper to report on the progress of affairs on the third occasion he returned with a bulletgraze on his knee swearing strange oaths in hindustani and saying that all things were ready so that squadron swung round the right of the highlanders with a wicked whistling of wind in the pennons of its lances and fell upon the remnant just when according to all the rules of war it should have waited for the foe to show more signs of wavering  but it was a dainty charge deftly delivered and it ended by the cavalry finding itself at the head of the pass by which the afghans intended to retreat and down the track that the lances had made streamed two companies of the highlanders which was never intended by the brigadier the new development was successful it detached the enemy from his base as a sponge is torn from a rock and left him ringed about with fire in that pitiless plain and as a sponge is chased round the bathtub by the hand of the bather so were the afghans chased till they broke into little detachments much more difficult to dispose of than large masses  see quoth the brigadier everything has come as i arranged weve cut their base and now well bucket em to pieces  a direct hammering was all that the brigadier had dared to hope for considering the size of the force at his disposal but men who stand or fall by the errors of their opponents may be forgiven for turning chance into design the bucketing went forward merrily the afghan forces were upon the run  the run of wearied wolves who snarl and bite over their shoulders the red lances dipped by twos and threes and with a shriek uprose the lance butt like a spar on a stormy sea as the trooper cantering forward cleared his point the lancers kept between their prey and the steep hills for all who could were trying to escape from the valley of death the highlanders gave the fugitives two hundred yards law and then brought them down gasping and choking ere they could reach the protection of the boulders above the goorkhas followed suit but the fore and aft were killing on their own account for they had penned a mass of men between their bayonets and a wall of rock and the flash of the rifles was lighting the wadded coats  we cannot hold them captain sahib panted a ressaidar of lancers let us try the carbine the lance is good but it wastes time  they tried the carbine and still the enemy melted away  fled up the hills by hundreds when there were only twenty bullets to stop them on the heights the screwguns ceased firing  they had run out of ammunition  and the brigadier groaned for the musketry fire could not sufficiently smash the retreat long before the last volleys were fired the doolies were out in force looking for the wounded the battle was over and but for want of fresh troops the afghans would have been wiped off the earth as it was they counted their dead by hundreds and nowhere were the dead thicker than in the track of the fore and aft  but the regiment did not cheer with the highlanders nor did they dance uncouth dances with the goorkhas among the dead they looked under their brows at the colonel as they leaned upon their rifles and panted  get back to camp you havent you disgraced yourself enough for one day go and look to the wounded its all youre fit for said the colonel yet for the past hour the fore and aft had been doing all that mortal commander could expect they had lost heavily because they did not know how to set about their business with proper skill but they had borne themselves gallantly and this was their reward  a young and sprightly coloursergeant who had begun to imagine himself a hero offered his waterbottle to a highlander whose tongue was black with thirst i drink with no cowards answered the youngster huskily and turning to a goorkha said hya johnny drink water got it the goorkha grinned and passed his bottle the fore and aft said no word  they went back to camp when the field of strife had been a little mopped up and made presentable and the brigadier who saw himself a knight in three months was the only soul who was complimentary to them the colonel was heartbroken and the officers were savage and sullen  well said the brigadier they are young troops of course and it was not unnatural that they should retire in disorder for a bit  oh my only aunt maria   murmured a junior staff officer retire in disorder it was a bally run  but they came again as we all know cooed the brigadier the colonels ashywhite face before him and they behaved as well as could possibly be expected behaved beautifully indeed i was watching them its not a matter to take to heart colonel as some german general said of his men they wanted to be shooted over a little that was all to himself he said  now theyre blooded i can give em responsible work its as well that they got what they did teach em more than half a dozen rifle flirtations that will  later  run alone and bite poor old colonel though  all that afternoon the heliograph winked and flickered on the hills striving to tell the good news to a mountain forty miles away and in the evening there arrived dusty sweating and sore a misguided correspondent who had gone out to assist at a trumpery villageburning and who had read off the message from afar cursing his luck the while  lets have the details somehow  as full as ever you can please its the first time ive ever been left this campaign said the correspondent to the brigadier and the brigadier nothing loth told him how an army of communication had been crumpled up destroyed and all but annihilated by the craft strategy wisdom and foresight of the brigadier  but some say and among these be the goorkhas who watched on the hillside that that battle was won by jakin and lew whose little bodies were borne up just in time to fit two gaps at the head of the big ditchgrave for the dead under the heights of jagai    judson and the empire  gloriana the don may attack us whenever his stomach be fain he must reach us before he can rack us    and where are the galleons of spain  dobson   one of the many beauties of a democracy is its almost superhuman skill in developing troubles with other countries and finding its honour abraded in the process a true democracy has a large contempt for all other lands that are governed by kings and queens and emperors and knows little and thinks less of their internal affairs all it regards is its own dignity which is its king queen and knave so sooner or later an international difference ends in the common people who have no dignity shouting the common abuse of the street which also has no dignity across the seas in order to vindicate their own dignity the consequences may or may not be war but the chances do not favour peace  an advantage in living in a civilised land which is really governed lies in the fact that all the kings and queens and emperors of the continent are closely related by blood or marriage  are in fact one large family a wise head of them knows that what appears to be a studied insult may be no more than some mans indigestion or womans indisposition to be treated as such and explained in quiet talk again a popular demonstration headed by king and court may mean nothing more than that soandsos people are out of hand for the minute when a horse falls to kicking in a huntcrowd at a gate the rider does not dismount but puts his open hand behind him and the others draw aside it is so with the rulers of men in the old days they cured their own and their peoples bad temper with fire and slaughter but now that the fire is so long of range and the slaughter so large they do other things and few among their people guess how much they owe in mere life and money to what the slang of the minute calls puppets and luxuries  once upon a time there was a little power the halfbankrupt wreck of a once great empire that lost its temper with england the whippingboy of all the world and behaved as every one knows most scandalously but it is not generally known that that power fought a pitched battle with england and won a glorious victory the trouble began with the people their own misfortunes had been many and for private rage it is always refreshing to find a vent in public swearing their national vanity had been deeply injured and they thought of their ancient glories and the days when their fleets had first rounded the cape of storms and their own newspapers called upon camoens and urged them to extravagances it was the gross smooth sleek lying england that was checking their career of colonial expansion they assumed at once that their ruler was in league with that country and consequently they his people would forthwith become a republic and colonially expand themselves as a free people should this made plain the people threw stones at the english consuls and spat at english ladies and cut off drunken sailors of our fleet in their ports and hammered them with oars and made things very unpleasant for tourists at their customs and threatened awful deaths to the consumptive invalids at madeira while the junior officers of the army drank fruitextracts and entered into bloodcurdling conspiracies against their monarch all with the object of being a republic now the history of all the south american republics shows that it is not good that southern europeans should be also republicans they glide too quickly into military despotism and the propping of men against walls and shooting them in detachments can be arranged much more economically and with less effect on the deathrate by a hidebound monarchy still the performances of the power as represented by its people were extremely inconvenient it was the kicking horse in the crowd and probably the rider explained that he could not check it the people enjoyed all the glory of war with none of the risks and the tourists who were stoned in their travels returned stolidly to england and told the times that the police arrangements of foreign towns were defective  this then was the state of affairs north of the line south it was more strained for there the powers were at direct issue england unable to go back because of the pressure of adventurous children behind her and the actions of faraway adventurers who would not come to heel but offering to buy out her rival and the other power lacking men or money stiff in the conviction that three hundred years of slaveholding and intermingling with the nearest natives gave an inalienable right to hold slaves and issue half castes to all eternity they had built no roads their towns were rotting under their hands they had no trade worth the freight of a crazy steamer and their sovereignty ran almost one musketshot inland when things were peaceful for these very reasons they raged all the more and the things that they said and wrote about the manners and customs of the english would have driven a younger nation to the guns with a long red bill for wounded honour  it was then that fate sent down in a twinscrew shallowdraft gunboat designed for the defence of rivers of some two hundred and seventy tons displacement lieutenant harrison edward judson to be known for the future as baijovejudson his type of craft looked exactly like a flatiron with a match stuck up in the middle it drew five feet of water or less carried a fourinch gun forward which was trained by the ship and on account of its persistent rolling was to live in three degrees worse than a torpedoboat when judson was appointed to take charge of the thing on her little trip of six or seven thousand miles southward his first remark as he went to look her over in dock was bai jove that topmast wants staying forward the topmast was a stick about as thick as a clothesprop but the flatiron was judsons first command and he would not have exchanged his position for second post on the anson or the howe he navigated her under convoy tenderly and lovingly to the cape the story of the topmast came with him and he was so absurdly in love with his wallowing washtub when he reported himself that the admiral of the station thought it would be a pity to kill a new man on her and allowed judson to continue in his unenvied rule  the admiral visited her once in simons bay and she was bad even for a flatiron gunboat strictly designed for river and harbour defence she sweated clammy drops of dew between decks in spite of a preparation of powdered cork that was sprinkled over her inside paint she rolled in the long cape swell like a buoy her focsle was a dogkennel judsons cabin was practically under the water line not one of her deadbights could ever be opened and her compasses thanks to the influence of the fourinch gun were a curiosity even among admiralty compasses but baijovejudson was radiant and enthusiastic he had even contrived to fill mr davies the secondclass engineroom artificer who was his chief engineer with the glow of his passion the admiral who remembered his own first command when pride forbade him to slacken off a single rope on a dewy night and he had racked his rigging to pieces in consequence looked at the flatiron keenly her fenders were done all over with white sennit which was truly white her big gun was varnished with a better composition than the admiralty allowed the spare sights were cased as carefully as the chronometers the chocks for spare spars two of them were made of fourinch burma teak carved with dragons heads that was one result of baijovejudsons experiences with the naval brigade in the burmese war the bowanchor was varnished instead of being painted and there were charts more than the admiralty scale supplied the admiral was well pleased for he loved a ships husband  a man who had a little money of his own and was willing to spend it on his command judson looked at him hopefully he was only a junior navigating lieutenant under eight years standing he might be kept in simons bay for six months and his ship at sea was his delight the dream of his heart was to enliven her dismal official gray with a line of goldleaf and perhaps a little scrollwork at her blunt bargelike bows  theres nothing like a first command is there said the admiral reading his thoughts you seem to have rather queer compasses though better get them adjusted  its no use sir said judson the gun would throw out the pole itself but  but ive got the hang of most of their weaknesses  will you be good enough to lay that gun over thirty degrees please the gun was put over round and round and round went the needle merrily and the admiral whistled  you must have kept close to your convoy  saw her twice between here and madeira sir said judson with a flush for he resented the slur on his seamanship  its  its a little out of hand now but shell settle down after a while  the admiral went over the side according to the rules of the service but the staffcaptain must have told the other men of the squadron in simons bay for they one and all made light of the flatiron for many days what can you shake out of her judson said the lieutenant of the mongoose a real whitepainted ram bow gunboat with quickfiring guns as he came into the upper verandah of the little naval club overlooking the dockyard one hot afternoon it is in that club as the captains come and go that you hear all the gossip of all the seven seas  ten point four said baijovejudson  ah that was on her trial trip shes too deep by the head now i told you staying that topmast would throw her out of trim  you leave my tophamper alone said judson for the joke was beginning to pall on him  oh my soul listen to him juddys tophamper keate have you heard of the flatirons tophamper youre to leave it alone commodore judsons feelings are hurt  keate was the torpedo lieutenant of the big vortigern and he despised small things his tophamper said he slowly oh ah yes of course juddy theres a shoal of mullet in the bay and i think theyre foul of your screws better go down or theyll carry away something  i dont let things carry away as a rule you see ive no torpedo lieutenant on board thank god  keate within the past week had so managed to bungle the slinging in of a small torpedoboat on the vortigern that the boat had broken the crutches in which she rested and was herself being repaired in the dockyard under the club windows  one for you keate never mind juddy youre hereby appointed dockyardtender for the next three years and if youre very good and theres no sea on you shall take me round the harbour waitabeechee commodore whatll you take vanderhum for the cook and the captain bold and the mate o the nancy brig and the bosun tight juddy put that cue down or ill put you under arrest for insulting the lieutenant of the real ship and the midshipmite and the crew of the captains gig  by this time judson had pinned him in a corner and was prodding him with the halfbutt the admirals secretary entered and saw the scuffle from afar  ouch juddy i apologise take that  er topmast of yours away heres the man with the bowstring i wish i were a staffcaptain instead of a bloody lootenant sperril sleeps below every night thats what makes sperril tumble home from the waist uppards sperril i defy you to touch me im under orders for zanzibar probably i shall annex it  judson the admiral wants to see you said the staffcaptain disregarding the scoffer of the mongoose  i told you youd be a dockyardtender yet juddy a side of fresh beef tomorrow and three dozen snapper on ice on ice you understand juddy  baijovejudson and the staffcaptain went out together  now what does the admiral want with judson said keate from the bar  dont know juddys a damned good fellow though i wish to goodness he was on the mongoose with us  the lieutenant of the mongoose dropped into a chair and read the mail papers for an hour then he saw baijovejudson in the street and shouted to him judsons eyes were very bright and his figure was held very straight and he moved joyously except for the lieutenant of the mongoose the club was empty  juddy there will be a beautiful row said that young man when he had heard the news delivered in an undertone youll probably have to fight and yet i cant see what the admirals thinking of to   my orders are not to fight under any circumstances said judson  golooksee that all when do you go  tonight if i can i must go down and see about things i say i may want a few men for the day  anything on the mongoose is at your service theres my gig come in now i know that coast dead drunk or asleep and youll need all the knowledge you can get if it had only been us two together come over with me  for one whole hour judson remained closeted in the stern cabin of the mongoose listening poring over chart upon chart and taking notes and for an hour the marine at the door heard nothing but things like these now youll have to put in here if theres any sea on that current is ridiculously underestimated and it sets west at this season of the year remember their boats never come south of this see so its no good looking out for them and so on and so forth while judson lay at length on the locker by the threepounder and smoked and absorbed it all  next morning there was no flatiron in simons bay only a little smudge of smoke off cape hangklip to show that mr davies the secondclass engineroom artificer was giving her all she could carry at the admirals house the ancient and retired bosun who had seen many admirals come and go brought out his paint and brushes and gave a new coat of pure raw peagreen to the two big cannonballs that stood one on each side of the admirals entrancegate he felt dimly that great events were stirring  and the flatiron constructed as has been before said solely for the defense of rivers met the great roll off cape agulhas and was swept from end to end and sat upon her twinscrews and leaped as gracefully as a cow in a bog from one sea to another till mr davies began to fear for the safety of his engines and the kroo boys that made the majority of the crew were deathly sick she ran along a very badlylighted coast past bays that were no bays where ugly flattopped rocks lay almost level with the water and very many extraordinary things happened that have nothing to do with the story but they were all duly logged by baijovejudson  at last the coast changed and grew green and low and exceedingly muddy and there were broad rivers whose bars were little islands standing three or four miles out at sea and baijovejudson hugged the shore more closely than ever remembering what the lieutenant of the mongoose had told him then he found a river full of the smell of fever and mud with green stuff growing far into its waters and a current that made the flatiron gasp and grunt  we will turn up here said baijovejudson and they turned up accordingly mr davies wondering what in the world it all meant and the kroo boys grinning baijovejudson went forward to the bows and meditated staring through the muddy waters after six hours of rooting through this desolation at an average rate of five miles an hour his eyes were cheered by the sight of one white buoy in the coffeehued midstream the flatiron crept up to it cautiously and a leadsman took soundings all around it from a dinghy while baijovejudson smoked and thought with his head on one side  about seven feet isnt there said he that must be the tail end of the shoal theres four fathom in the fairway knock that buoy down with axes i dont think its picturesque somehow the kroo men hacked the wooden sides to pieces in three minutes and the mooringchain sank with the lasst splinters of wood baijove judson laid the flatiron carefully over the site while mr davies watched biting his nails nervously  can you back her against this current said baijovejudson mr davies could inch by inch but only inch by inch and baijove judson sat in the bows and gazed at various things on the bank as they came into line or opened out the flatiron dropped down over the tail of the shoal exactly where the buoy had been and backed once before baijovejudson was satisfied then they went up stream for half an hour put into shoal water by the bank and waited with a sliprope on the anchor  seems to me said mr davies deferentially like as if i heard some one afiring off at intervals so to say  there was beyond doubt a dull mutter in the air seems to me said baijovejudson as if i heard a screw stand by to slip her moorings  another ten minutes passed and the beat of engines grew plainer then round the bend of the river came a remarkably prettily built whitepainted gunboat with a blue and white flag bearing a red boss in the centre  unshackle abaft the windlass stream both buoys easy astern let go all the sliprope flew out the two buoys bobbed in the water to mark where anchor and cable had been left and the flat iron waddled out into midstream with the white ensign at her one masthead  give her all you can that thing has the legs of us said judson and down we go  its war  bloody war hes going to fire said mr davies looking up through the engineroom hatch  the white gunboat without a word of explanation fired three guns at the flatiron cutting the trees on the banks into green chips baijovejudson was at the wheel and mr davies and the current helped the boat to an almost respectable degree of speed  it was an exciting chase but it did not last for more than five minutes the white gunboat fired again and mr davies in his engineroom gave a wild shout  whats the matter hit said baijovejudson  no ive just seized of your roosdegare beg y pardon sir  right 0 just the half a fraction of a point more the wheel turned under the steady hand as baijovejudson watched his marks on the bank coming in line swiftly as troops anxious to aid the flatiron smelt the shoal water under her checked for an instant and went on now were over come along you thieves there  the white gunboat too hurried even to fire was storming in the wake of the flatiron steering as she steered this was unfortunate because the lighter craft was dead over the missing buoy  what you do here shouted a voice from the bows  im going on hold tight now youre arranged for  there was a crash and a clatter as the white gunboats nose took the shoal and the brown mud boiled up in oozy circles under her forefoot then the current caught her stem by the starboard side and drove her broadside on to the shoal slowly and gracefully there she heeled at an undignified angle and her crew yelled aloud  neat oh damn neat quoth mr davies dancing on the engine room plates while the kroo stokers grinned  the flatiron turned upstream again and passed under the hoveup starboard side of the white gunboat to be received with howls and imprecations in a strange tongue the stranded boat exposed even to her lower strakes was as defenceless as a turtle on its back without the advantage of the turtles plating and the one big blunt gun in the bows of the flatiron was unpleasantly near  but the captain was valiant and swore mightily baijovejudson took no sort of notice his business was to go up the river  we will come in a flotilla of boats and ecrazer your vile tricks said the captain with language that need not be published  then said baijovejudson who was a linguist you stay o where you are o or ill leave a holeo in your bottom o that will make you much os perforatados  there was a great deal of mixed language in reply but baijove judson was out of hearing in a few minutes and mr davies himself a man of few words confided to one of his subordinates that lieutenant judson was a most remarkable prompt officer in a way of putting it  for two hours the flatiron pawed madly through the muddy water and that which had been at first a mutter became a distinct rumble  was war declared said mr davies and baijovejudson laughed then damn his eyes he might have spoilt my pretty little engines theres war up there though  the next bend brought them full in sight of a small but lively village built round a whitewashed mud house of some pretensions there were scores and scores of saddlecoloured soldiery on duty white uniforms running to and fro and shouting round a man in a litter and on a gentle slope that ran inland for four or five miles something like a brisk battle was raging round a rude stockade a smell of unburied carcasses floated through the air and vexed the sensitive nose of mr davies who spat over the side  i want to get this gun on that house said baijovejudson indicating the superior dwelling over whose flat roof floated the blue and white flag the little twin screws kicked up the water exactly as a hens legs kick in the dust before she settles down to a bath the little boat moved un easily from left to right backed yawed again went ahead and at last the gray blunt guns nose was held as straight as a riflebarrel on the mark indicated then mr davies allowed the whistle to speak as it is not allowed to speak in her majestys service on account of waste of steam the soldiery of the village gathered into knots and groups and bunches and the firing up the hill ceased and every one except the crew of the flatiron yelled aloud something like an english cheer came down wind  our chaps in mischief for sure probably said mr davies they must have declared war weeks ago in a kind of way seems to me  hold her steady you son of a soldier shouted baijovejudson as the muzzle fell off the white house  something rang as loudly as a ships bell on the forward plates of the flatiron something spluttered in the water and another thing cut a groove in the deck planking an inch in front of bai jovejudsons left foot the saddlecoloured soldiery were firing as the mood took them and the man in the litter waved a shining sword the muzzle of the big gun kicked down a fraction as it was laid on the mud wall at the bottom of the house garden ten pounds of gunpowder shut up in a hundred pounds of metal was its charge three or four yards of the mud wall jumped up a little as a man jumps when he is caught in the small of the back with a kneecap and then fell forward spreading fanwise in the fall the soldiery fired no more that day and judson saw an old black woman climb to the flat roof of the house she fumbled for a time with the flag halliards then finding that they were jammed took off her one garment which happened to be an isabellacoloured petticoat and waved it impatiently the man in the litter flourished a white handkerchief and baijovejudson grinned now well give em one up the hill round with her mr davies curse the man who invented those floating gun platforms where can i pitch in a notice without slaying one of those little devils  the side of the slope was speckled with men returning in a disorderly fashion to the river front behind them marched a small but very compact body of men who had filed out of the stockade these last dragged quickfiring guns with them  bai jove its a regular army i wonder whose said baijove judson and he waited developments the descending troops met and mixed with the troops in the village and with the litter in the centre crowded down to the river till the men with the quick firing guns came up behind them then they divided left and right and the detachment marched through  heave these damned things over said the leader of the party and one after another ten little gatlings splashed into the muddy water the flatiron lay close to the bank  when youre quite done said baijovejudson politely would you mind telling me whats the matter im in charge here  were the pioneers of the general development company said the leader these little bounders have been hammering us in lager for twelve hours and were getting rid of their gatlings had to climb out and take them but theyve snaffled the lockactions glad to see you  any one hurt  no one killed exactly but were very dry  can you hold your men  the man turned round and looked at his command with a grin there were seventy of them all dusty and unkempt  we shant sack this ashbin if thats what you mean were mostly gentlemen here though we dont look it  all right send the head of this post or fort or village or whatever it is aboard and make what arrangements you can for your men  well find some barrack accommodation somewhere hullo you in the litter there go aboard the gunboat the command wheeled round pushed through the dislocated soldiery and began to search through the village for spare huts  the little man in the litter came aboard smiling nervously he was in the fullest of full uniform with many yards of gold lace and dangling chains also he wore very large spurs the nearest horse being not more than four hundred miles away my children said he facing the silent soldiery lay aside your arms  most of the men had dropped them already and were sitting down to smoke let nothing he added in his own tongue tempt you to kill these who have sought your protection  now said baijovejudson on whom the last remark was lost will you have the goodness to explain what the deuce you mean by all this nonsense  it was of a necessitate said the little man the operations of war are unconformible i am the governor and i operate captain beold my little sword  confound your little sword sir i dont want it youve fired on our flag youve been firing at our people here for a week and ive been fired at coming up the river  ah the guadala she have misconstrued you for a slaver possibly how are the guadala  mistook a ship of her majestys navy for a slaver you mistake any craft for a slaver bai jove sir ive a good mind to hang you at the yardarm  there was nothing nearer that terrible spar than the walkingstick in the rack of judsons cabin the governor looked at the one mast and smiled a deprecating smile  the position is embarrassment he said captain do you think those illustrious traders burn my capital my people will give them beer  never mind the traders i want an explanation  hum there are popular uprising in europe captain  in my country his eye wandered aimlessly round the horizon  what has that to do with   captain you are very young there is still uproariment but i  here he slapped his chest till his epaulets jingled  i am loyalist to pits of all my stomachs  go on said judson and his mouth quivered  an order arrive to me to establish a customhouses here and to collect of the taximent from the traders when she are come here necessarily that was on account of political understandings with your country and mine but on that arrangement there was no money also not one damn little cowrie i desire damnably to extend all commercial things and why i am loyalist and there is rebellion  yes i tell you  republics in my country for to just begin you do not believe see some time how it exist i cannot make this customhouses and pay the so highpaid officials the people too in my country they say the king she has no regardance into honour of her nation he throw away everything  gladstone her all you say pay  yes thats what we say said judson with a grin  therefore they say let us be republics on hot cakes but i  i am loyalist to all my hands ends captain once i was attaché at mexico i say the republics are no good the peoples have her stomach high they desire  they desire  a course for the bills  what on earth is that  the cockfight for pay at the gate you give something pay for see bloody row do i make its comprehension  a run for their money  is that what you mean gad youre sporting governor  so i say i am loyalist too he smiled more easily now how can anything do herself for the customshouses but when the companys mens she arrives then a cockfight for pay at gate that is quite correct my army he says it will republic and shoot me off upon walls if i have not give her blood an army captain are terrible in her angries  especialment when she are not paid i know too here he laid his hand on judsons shoulder i know too we are old friends yes badajos almeida fuentes donor  time ever since and a little little cockfight for pay at gate that is good for my king more sit her tight on throne behind you see now he waved his hand round the decayed village i say to my armies fight fight the companys men when she come but fight not so very strong that you are any deads it is all in the raporta that i send but you understand captain we are good friends all the time ah ciudad rodrigo you remember no perhaps your father then so you see no one are deads and we fight a fight and it is all in the raporta to please the people in our country and my armies they do not put me against the walls you see  yes but the guadala she fired on us was that part of your game my joker  the guadala ah no i think not her captain he is too big fool but i think she have gone down the coast those your gunboats poke her nose and shove her oar in every place how is guadala  on a shoal stuck till i take her off there are any deads  no  the governor drew a breath of deep relief there are no deads here so you see none are deads anywhere and nothing is done captain you talk to the companys mens i think they are not pleased  naturally  they have no sense i thought to go backwards again they would i leave her stockade alone all night to let them out but they stay and come facewards to me not backwards they did not know we must conquer much in all these battles or the king he is kicked off her throne now we have won this battle  this great battle he waved his arms abroad and i think you will say so that we have won captain you are loyalist also you would not disturb to the peaceful europe captain i tell you this your queen she know too she would not fight her cousins it is a  a handup thing  what  handup thing jobe you put how you say  putup job  yes putup job who is hurt we win you lose all righta  baijovejudson had been exploding at intervals for the last five minutes here he broke down completely and roared aloud  but look here governor he said at last ive got to think of other things than your riots in europe youve fired on our flag  captain if you are me you would have done how and also and also he drew himself up to his full height we are both brave men of bravest countries our honour is the honour of our king here he uncovered and of our queen here he bowed low now captain you shall shell my palace and i shall be your prisoner  skittles said baijovejudson i cant shell that old hencoop  then come to dinner madeira she are still to us and i have of the best she manufac  he skipped over the side beaming and baijovejudson went into the cabin to laugh his laugh out when he had recovered a little he sent mr davies to the head of the pioneers the dusty man with the gatlings and the troops who had abandoned the pursuit of arms watched the disgraceful spectacle of two men reeling with laughter on the quarterdeck of a gunboat  ill put my men to build him a customhouse said the head of the pioneers gasping well make him one decent road at least that governor ought to be knighted im glad now that we didnt fight em in the open or wed have killed some of them so hes won great battles has he give him the compliments of the victims and tell him im coming to dinner you havent such a thing as a dresssuit have you i havent seen one for six months  that evening there was a dinner in the village  a general and enthusiastic dinner whose head was in the governors house and whose tail threshed at large throughout all the streets the madeira was everything that the governor had said and more and it was tested against two or three bottles of baijovejudsons best vanderhum which is cape brandy ten years in the bottle flavoured with orangepeel and spices before the coffee was removed by the lady who had made the flag of truce the governor had sold the whole of his governorship and its appurtenances once to baijovejudson for services rendered by judsons grandfather in the peninsular war and once to the head of the pioneers in consideration of that gentlemans good friendship after the negotiation he retreated for a while into an inner apartment and there evolved a true and complete account of the defeat of the british arms which he read with his cocked hat over one eye to judson and his companion it was judson who suggested the sinking of the flatiron with all hands and the head of the pioneers who supplied the list of killed and wounded not more than two hundred in his command  gentlemen said the governor from under his cocked hat the peace of europe are saved by this raporta you shall all be knights of the golden hide she shall go by the guadala  great heavens said baijove judson flushed but composed that reminds me ive left that boat stuck on her broadside down the river i must go down and soothe the commandante hell be blue with rage governor let us go a sail on the river to cool our heads a picnic you understand  ya  as everything i understand ho a picnica you are all my prisoner but i am good gaoler we shall picnic on the river and we shall take all the girls come on my prisoners  i do hope said the head of the pioneers staring from the verandah into the roaring village that my chaps wont set the town alight by accident hullo hullo a guard of honour for his excellency the most illustrious governor  some thirty men answered the call made a swaying line upon a more swaying course and bore the governor most swayingly of all high in the arms as they staggered down to the river and the song that they sang bade them swing swing together their body between their knees and they obeyed the words of the song faithfully except that they were anything but steady from stroke to bow his excellency the governor slept on his uneasy litter and did not wake when the chorus dropped him on the deck of the flatiron  goodnight and goodbye said the head of the pioneers to judson id give you my card if i had it but im so damned drunk i hardly know my own club oh yes its the travellers if ever we meet in town remember me i must stay here and look after my fellows were all right in the open now i spose youll return the governor some time this is a political crisis goodnight  the flatiron went down stream through the dark the governor slept on deck and judson took the wheel but how he steered and why he did not run into each bank many times that officer does not remember mr davies did not note anything unusual for there are two ways of taking too much and judson was only wardroom not focsle drunk as the night grew colder the governor woke up and expressed a desire for whiskey and soda when that came they were nearly abreast of the stranded guadala and his excellency saluted the flag that he could not see with loyal and patriotic strains  they do not see they do not hear he cried ten thousand saints they sleep and i have won battles ha  he started forward to the gun which very naturally was loaded pulled the lanyard and woke the dead night with the roar of the full charge behind a common shell that shell mercifully just missed the stern of the guadala and burst on the bank now you shall salute your governor said he as he heard feet running in all directions within the iron skin why you demand so base a quarter i am here with all my prisoners  in the hurlyburly and the general shriek for mercy his reassurances were not heard  captain said a grave voice from the ship we have surrendered is it the custom of the english to fire on a helpless ship  surrendered holy virgin i go to cut off all their heads you shall be ate by wild ants flogged and drowned throw me a balcony it is i the governor you shall never surrender judson of my soul ascend her insides and send me a bed for i am sleepy but oh i will multiple time kill that captain  oh said the voice in the darkness i begin to comprehend and a ropeladder was thrown up which the governor scrambled with judson at his heels  now we will enjoy executions said the governor on the deck all these republicans shall be shot little judson if i am not drunk why are so sloping the boards which do not support  the deck as i have said was at a very stiff cant his excellency sat down slid to leeward and was asleep again  the captain of the guadala bit his moustache furiously and muttered in his own tongue this land is the father of great villains and the stepfather of honest men you see our material captain it is so everywhere with us you have killed some of the rats i hope  not a rat said judson genially  that is a pity if they were dead our country might send us men but our country is dead too and i am dishonoured on a mudbank through your english treachery  well it seems to me that firing on a little tub of our size without a word of warning when you know that the countries were at peace is treachery enough in a small way  if one of my guns had touched you you would have gone to the bottom all of you i would have taken the risk with my government by that time it would have been   a republic so you really did mean fighting on your own hook youre rather a dangerous officer to cut loose in a navy like yours well what are you going to do now  stay here go away in boats what does it matter that drunken cat  he pointed to the shadow in which the governor slept  is here i must take him back to his hole  very good ill tow you off at daylight if you get steam ready  captain i warn you that as soon as she floats again i will fight you  humbug youll have lunch with me and then youll take the governor up the river  the captain was silent for some time then he said let us drink what must be must be and after all we have not forgotten the peninsula you will admit captain that it is bad to be run upon a shoal like a muddredger  oh well pull you off before you can say knife take care of his excellency i shall try to get a little sleep now  they slept on both ships till the morning and then the work of towing off the guadala began with the help of her own engines and the tugging and puffing of the flatiron she slid off the mudbank sideways into the deep water the flatiron immediately under her stern and the big eye of the fourinch gun almost peering through the window of the captains cabin  remorse in the shape of a violent headache had overtaken the governor he was uneasily conscious that he might perhaps have exceeded his powers and the captain of the guadala in spite of all his patriotic sentiments remembered distinctly that no war had been declared between the two countries he did not need the governors repeated reminders that war serious war meant a republic at home possible supersession in his command and much shooting of living men against dead walls  we have satisfied our honour said the governor in confidence our army is appeased and the raporta that you take home will show that we were loyal and brave that other captain bah he is a boy he will call this a  a judson of my soul how you say this is  all this affairs which have transpirated between us  judson was watching the last hawser slipping through the fairlead call it oh i should call it rather a lark now your boats all right captain when will you come to lunch  i told you said the governor it would be a larque to him  mother of the saints then what is his seriousness said the captain we shall be happy to come when you please indeed we have no other choice he added bitterly  not at all said judson and as he looked at the three or four shotblisters on the bows of his boat a brilliant idea took him it is we who are at your mercy see how his excellencys guns knocked us about  senior captain said the governor pityingly that is very sad you are most injured and your deck too it is all shot over we shall not be too severe on a beat man shall we captain  you couldnt spare us a little paint could you id like to patch up a little after the  action said judson meditatively fingering his upper lip to hide a smile  our storeroom is at your disposition said the captain of the guadala and his eye brightened for a few lead splashes on gray paint make a big show  mr davies go aboard and see what they have to spare  to spare remember their sparcolour with a little working up should be just our freeboard tint  oh yes ill spare them said mr davies savagely i dont understand this howdyoudo and damnyoureyes business coming one atop of the other in a manner o speaking by all rights theyre our lawful prize  the governor and the captain came to lunch in the absence of mr davies baijovejudson had not much to offer but what he had was given as by a beaten foeman to a generous conqueror when they were a little warmed  the governor genial and the captain almost effusive  he explained quite casually over the opening of a bottle that it would not be to his interest to report the affair seriously and it was in the highest degree improbable that the admiral would treat it in any grave fashion  when my decks are cut up there was one groove across four planks and my plates buckled there were five lead patches on three plates and i meet such a boat as the guadala and a mere accident saves me from being blown out of the water   yes a mere accident captain the shoalbuoy has been lost said the captain of the guadala  ah i do not know this river that was very sad but as i was saying when an accident saves me from being sunk what can i do but go away  if that is possible but i fear that i have no coal for the sea voyage it is very sad judson had compromised on what he knew of the french tongue as a working language  it is enough said the governor waving a generous hand judson of my soul the coal is yours and you shall be repaired  yes repaired all over of your battles wounds you shall go with all the honours of all the wars your flag shall fly your drum shall beat your ah  jolly boys shall spoke their bayonets is it not so captain  as you say excellency but the traders in the town what of them  the governor looked puzzled for an instant he could not quite remember what had happened to those jovial men who had cheered him over night judson interrupted swiftly his excellency has set them to forced works on barracks and magazines and i think a customhouse when that is done they will be released i hope excellency  yes they shall be released for your sake little judson of my heart then they drank the health of their respective sovereigns while mr davies superintended the removal of the scarred plank and the shotmarks on the deck and the bowplates  oh this is too bad said judson when they went on deck that idiot has exceeded his instructions but  but yow must let me pay for this  mr davies his legs in the water as he sat on a staging slung over the bows was acutely conscious that he was being blamed in a foreign tongue he smiled uneasily and went on with his work  what is it said the governor  that thickhead has thought that we needed some goldleaf and he has borrowed that from your storeroom but i must make it good then in english stand up mr davies what the  in  do you mean by taking their goldleaf my  are we a set of pirates to scrape the guts out of a levantine bumboat look contrite you buttended broadbreeched bottlebellied swiveleyed son of a tinker you my soul alive cant i maintain discipline in my own ship without a blacksmith of a boilerriveter putting me to shame before a yellownosed picaroon get off the staging mr davies and go to the engineroom put down that leaf first though and leave the books where they are ill send for you in a minute go aft  now only the upper half of mr daviess round face was above the bulwarks when this torrent of abuse descended upon him and it rose inch by inch as the shower continued blank amazement bewilderment rage and injured pride chasing each other across it till he saw his superior officers left eyelid flutter on the cheek twice then he fled to the engineroom and wiping his brow with a handful of cottonwaste sat down to overtake circumstances  i am desolated said judson to his companions but you see the material that you give us this leaves me more in your debt than before the stuff i can replace goldleaf is never carried on floating gunplatforms but for the insolence of that man how shall i apologise  mr daviess mind moved slowly but after a while he transferred the cottonwaste from his forehead to his mouth and bit on it to prevent laughter he began a second dance on the engineroom plates neat oh damned neat he chuckled ive served with a good few but there never was one so neat as him and i thought he was the new kind that dont know how to put a few words as it were  mr davies you can continue your work said judson down the engineroom hatch these officers have been good enough to speak in your favour make a thorough job of it while you are about it slap on every man you have where did you get hold of it  their storeroom is a regular theatre sir you couldnt miss it theres enough for two firstrates and ive scoffed the best half of it  look sharp then we shall be coaling from her this afternoon youll have to cover it all  neat oh damned neat said mr davies under his breath as he gathered his subordinates together and set about accomplishing the longdeferred wish of judsons heart  it was the martin frobisher the flagship a great warboat when she was new in the days when men built for sail as well as for steam she could turn twelve knots under full sail and it was under that that she stood up the mouth of the river a pyramid of silver beneath the moon the admiral fearing that he had given judson a task beyond his strength was coming to look for him and incidentally to do a little diplomatic work along the coast there was hardly wind enough to move the frobisher a couple of knots an hour and the silence of the land closed about her as she entered the fairway her yards sighed a little from time to time and the ripple under her bows answered the sigh the full moon rose over the steaming swamps and the admiral gazing upon it thought less of judson and more of the softer emotions in answer to the very mood of his mind there floated across the silver levels of the water mellowed by distance to a most poignant sweetness the throb of a mandolin and the voice of one who called upon a genteel julia  upon julia and upon love the song ceased and the sighing of the yards was all that broke the silence of the big ship  again the mandolin began and the commander on the lee side of the quarterdeck grinned a grin that was reflected in the face of the signalmidshipman not a word of the song was lost and the voice of the singer was the voice of judson  last week down our alley came a toff nice old geyser with a nasty cough sees my missus takes his topper off quite in a gentlemanly way    and so on to the end of the verse the chorus was borne by several voices and the signalmidshipmans foot began to tap the deck furtively  what cheer all the neighbours cried oo are you going to meet bill ave you bought the street bill laugh  i thought i should ha died when i knocked em in the old kent road   it was the admirals gig rowing softly that came into the midst of that merry little smokingconcert it was judson the beribboned mandolin round his neck who received the admiral as he came up the side of the guadala and it may or may not have been the admiral who stayed till two in the morning and delighted the hearts of the captain and the governor he had come as an unbidden guest and he departed as an honoured one but strictly unofficial throughout judson told his tale next day in the admirals cabin as well as he could in the face of the admirals gales of laughter but the most amazing tale was that told by mr davies to his friends in the dockyard at simons town from the point of view of a secondclass engineroom artificer all unversed in diplomacy  and if there be no truth either in my tale which is judsons tale or the tale of mr davies you will not find in harbour at simons town today a flatbottomed twinscrew gunboat designed solely for the defence of rivers about two hundred and seventy tons displacement and five feet draught wearing in open defiance of the rules of the service a gold line on her gray paint it follows also that you will be compelled to credit that version of the fray which signed by his excellency the governor and despatched in the guadala satisfied the selflove of a great and glorious people and saved a monarchy from the illconsidered despotism which is called a republic   a conference of the powers life liveth but in life and doth not roam to other lands if all be well at home solid as ocean foam quoth ocean foam  the room was blue with the smoke of three pipes and a cigar the leaveseason had opened in india and the firstfruits on this side of the water were tick boileau of the 45th bengal cavalry who called on me after three years absence to discuss old things which had happened fate who always does her work handsomely sent up the same staircase within the same hour the infant fresh from upper burma and he and boileau looking out of my window saw walking in the street one nevin late in a goorkha regiment which had been through the black mountain expedition they yelled to him to come up and the whole street was aware that they desired him to come up and he came up and there followed pandemonium in my room because we had foregathered from the ends of the earth and three of us were on a holiday and none of us were twentyfive and all the delights of all london lay waiting our pleasure  boileau took the only other chair the infant by right of his bulk the sofa and nevin being a little man sat crosslegged on the top of the revolving bookcase and we all said whod ha thought it and what are you doing here till speculation was exhausted and the talk went over to inevitable shop boileau was full of a great scheme for winning a military attachéship at st petersburg nevin had hopes of the staff college and the infant had been moving heaven and earth and the horse guards for a commission in the egyptian army  whats the use o that said nevin twirling round on the bookcase  oh heaps course if you get stuck with a fellaheen regiment youre sold but if you are appointed to a soudanese lot youre in clover they are firstclass fightingmen  and just think of the eligible central position of egypt in the next row  this was putting the match to a magazine we all began to explain the central asian question offhand flinging army corps from the helmund to kashmir with more than russian recklessness each of the boys made for himself a war to his own liking and when we had settled all the details of armageddon killed all our senior officers handled a division apiece and nearly torn the atlas in two in attempts to explain our theories boileau needs must lift up his voice above the clamour and cry anyhow itll be the hell of a row in tones that carried conviction far down the staircase  entered unperceived in the smoke william the silent genelman to see you sir said he and disappeared leaving in his stead none other than mr eustace cleever william would have introduced the dragon of wantley with equal disregard of present company  i  i beg your pardon i didnt know that there was anybody  with you   but it was not seemly to allow mr cleever to depart he was a great man the boys remained where they were for any movement would have choked up the little room only when they saw his gray hairs they stood on their feet and when the infant caught the name he said  are you  did you write that book called as it was in the beginning  mr cleever admitted that he had written the book  then  then i dont know how to thank you sir said the infant flushing pink i was brought up in the country you wrote about  all my people live there and i read the book in camp on the hlinedatalone and i knew every stick and stone and the dialect too and by jove it was just like being at home and hearing the country people talk nevin you know as it was in the beginning so does ti  boileau  mr cleever has tasted as much praise public and private as one man may safely swallow but it seemed to me that the outspoken admiration in the infants eyes and the little stir in the little company came home to him very nearly indeed  wont you take the sofa said the infant ill sit on boileaus chair and  here he looked at me to spur me to my duties as a host but i was watching the novelists face cleever had not the least intention of going away but settled himself on the sofa  following the first great law of the army which says all property is common except money and youve only got to ask the next man for that the infant offered tobacco and drink it was the least he could do but not the most lavish praise in the world held half as much appreciation and reverence as the infants simple say when sir above the long glass  cleever said when and more thereto for he was a golden talker and he sat in the midst of heroworship devoid of all taint of selfinterest the boys asked him of the birth of his book and whether it was hard to write and how his notions came to him and he answered with the same absolute simplicity as he was questioned his big eyes twinkled he dug his long thin hands into his gray beard and tugged it as he grew animated he dropped little by little from the peculiar pinching of the broader vowels  the indefinable euh that runs through the speech of the pundit caste  and the elaborate choice of words to freely mouthed ows and ois and for him at least unfettered colloquialisms he could not altogether understand the boys who hung upon his words so reverently the line of the chinstrap that still showed white and untanned on cheekbone and jaw the steadfast young eyes puckered at the corners of the lids with much staring through red hot sunshine the slow untroubled breathing and the curious crisp curt speech seemed to puzzle him equally he could create men and women and send them to the uttermost ends of the earth to help delight and comfort he knew every mood of the fields and could interpret them to the cities and he knew the hearts of many in city and country but he had hardly in forty years come into contact with the thing which is called a subaltern of the line he told the boys this in his own way  well how should you said the infant you  youre quite different y see sir  the infant expressed his ideas in his tone rather than his words but cleever understood the compliment  were only subs said nevin and we arent exactly the sort of men youd meet much in your life i spose  thats true said cleever i live chiefly among men who write and paint and sculp and so forth we have our own talk and our own interests and the outer world doesnt trouble us much  that must be awfully jolly said boileau at a venture we have our own shop too but tisnt half as interesting as yours of course you know all the men whove ever done anything and we only knock about from place to place and we do nothing  the armys a very lazy profession if you choose to make it so said nevin when theres nothing going on there is nothing going on and you lie up  or try to get a billet somewhere to be ready for the next show said the infant with a chuckle  to me said cleever softly the whole idea of warfare seems so foreign and unnatural so essentially vulgar if i may say so that i can hardly appreciate your sensations of course though any change from idling in garrison towns must be a godsend to you  like many homestaying englishmen cleever believed that the newspaper phrase he quoted covered the whole duty of the army whose toils enabled him to enjoy his manysided life in peace the remark was not a happy one for boileau had just come off the frontier the infant had been on the warpath for nearly eighteen months and the little red man nevin two months before had been sleeping under the stars at the peril of his life but none of them tried to explain till i ventured to point out that they had all seen service and were not used to idling cleever took in the idea slowly  seen service said he then as a child might ask tell me tell me everything about everything  how do you mean said the infant delighted at being directly appealed to by the great man  good heavens how am i to make you understand if you cant see in the first place what is your age  twentythree next july said the infant promptly  cleever questioned the others with his eyes  im twentyfour said nevin  and im twentytwo said boileau  and youve all seen service  weve all knocked about a little bit sir but the infants the warworn veteran hes had two years work in upper burma said nevin  when you say work what do you mean you extraordinary creatures  explain it infant said nevin  oh keeping things in order generally and running about after little dakus  thats dacoits and so on theres nothing to explain  make that young leviathan speak said cleever impatiently above his glass  how can he speak said i hes done the work the two dont go together but infant youre ordered to bukb  what about ill try  bukb about a daur youve been on heaps of em said nevin  what in the world does that mean has the army a language of its own  the infant turned very red he was afraid he was being laughed at and he detested talking before outsiders but it was the author of as it was in the beginning who waited  its all so new to me pleaded cleever and  and you said you liked my book  this was a direct appeal that the infant could understand and he began rather flurriedly with much slang bred of nervousness   pull me up sir if i say anything you dont follow about six months before i took my leave out of burma i was on the hlinedatalone up near the shan states with sixty tommies  private soldiers that is  and another subaltern a year senior to me the burmese business was a subalterns war and our forces were split up into little detachments all running about the country and trying to keep the dacoits quiet the dacoits were having a firstclass time y know filling women up with kerosene and setting em alight and burning villages and crucifying people  the wonder in eustace cleevers eyes deepened he could not quite realise that the cross still existed in any form  have you ever seen a crucifixion said he  of course not shouldnt have allowed it if i had but ive seen the corpses the dacoits had a trick of sending a crucified corpse down the river on a raft just to show they were keeping their tail up and enjoying themselves well that was the kind of people i had to deal with  alone said cleever solitude of the soul he could understand  none better  but he had never in the body moved ten miles from his fellows  i had my men but the rest of it was pretty much alone the nearest post that could give me orders was fifteen miles away and we used to heliograph to them and they used to give us orders same way  too many orders  who was your c 0 said boileau  bounderby  major pukka bounderby more bounder than pukka he went out up bhamo way shot or cut down last year said the infant  what are these interludes in a strange tongue said cleever to me  professional information  like the mississippi pilots talk said i he did not approve of his major who died a violent death go on infant  far too many orders you couldnt take the tommies out for a two days daur thats expedition  without being blown up for not asking leave and the whole country was humming with dacoits i used to send out spies and act on their information as soon as a man came in and told me of a gang in hiding id take thirty men with some grub and go out and look for them while the other subaltern lay doggo in camp  lay pardon me but how did he lie said cleever  lay doggo  lay quiet with the other thirty men when i came back hed take out his half of the men and have a good time of his own  who was he said boileau  carterdeecey of the aurungabadis good chap but too zubberdusty and went bokhar four days out of seven hes gone out too dont interrupt a man  cleever looked helplessly at me  the other subaltern i translated swiftly came from a native regiment and was overbearing in his demeanour he suffered much from the fever of the country and is now dead go on infant  after a bit we got into trouble for using the men on frivolous occasions and so i used to put my signaller under arrest to prevent him reading the helioorders then id go out and leave a message to be sent an hour after i got clear of the camp something like this received important information start in an hour unless countermanded if i was ordered back it didnt much matter i swore the c 0s watch was wrong or something when i came back the tommies enjoyed the fun and  oh yes there was one tommy who was the bard of the detachment he used to make up verses on everything that happened  what sort of verses said cleever  lovely verses and the tommies used to sing em there was one song with a chorus and it said something like this the infant dropped into the true barrackroom twang  theebaw the burma king did a very foolish thing when e mustered ostile forces in arrai e little thought that we from far across the sea would send our armies up to mandalai  0 gorgeous  said cleever and how magnificently direct the notion of a regimental bard is new to me but of course it must be so  he was awfly popular with the men said the infant he had them all down in rhyme as soon as ever they had done anything he was a great bard he was always ready with an elegy when we picked up a boh  thats a leader of dacoits  how did you pick him up said cleever  oh shot him if he wouldnt surrender  you have you shot a man  there was a subdued chuckle from all three boys and it dawned on the questioner that one experience in life which was denied to himself and he weighed the souls of men in a balance had been shared by three very young gentlemen of engaging appearance he turned round on nevin who had climbed to the top of the bookcase and was sitting crosslegged as before  and have you too  think so said nevin sweetly in the black mountain he was rolling cliffs on to my halfcompany and spoiling our formation i took a rifle from a man and brought him down at the second shot  good heavens and how did you feel afterwards  thirsty i wanted a smoke too  cleever looked at boileau  the youngest surely his hands were guiltless of blood  boileau shook his head and laughed go on infant said he  and you too said cleever  fancy so it was a case of cut cut or be cut with me so i cut  one i couldnt do any more sir  cleever looked as though he would like to ask many questions but the infant swept on in the full tide of his tale  well we were called insubordinate young whelps at last and strictly forbidden to take the tommies out any more without orders i wasnt sorry because tommy is such an exacting sort of creature he wants to live as though he were in barracks all the time i was grubbing on fowls and boiled corn but the tommies wanted their pound of fresh meat and their half ounce of this and their two ounces of tother thing and they used to come to me and badger me for plug tobacco when we were four days in jungle i said i can get you burma tobacco but i dont keep a canteen up my sleeve they couldnt see it they wanted all the luxuries of the season confound em  you were alone when you were dealing with these men said cleever watching the infants face under the palm of his hand he was receiving new ideas and they seemed to trouble him  of course unless you count the mosquitoes they were nearly as big as the men after i had to lie doggo i began to look for something to do and i was great pals with a man called hicksey in the police the best man that ever stepped on earth a firstclass man  cleever nodded applause he knew how to appreciate enthusiasm  hicksey and i were as thick as thieves he had some burma mounted police  rummy chaps armed with sword and snider carbine they rode punchy burma ponies with string stirrups red cloth saddles and red bellrope headstalls hicksey used to lend me six or eight of them when i asked him  nippy little devils keen as mustard but they told their wives too much and all my plans got known till i learned to give false marching orders overnight and take the men to quite a different village in the morning then we used to catch the simple daku before breakfast and made him very sick its a ghastly country on the hlinedatalone all bamboo jungle with paths about four feet wide winding through it the daku knew all the paths and potted at us as we came round a corner but the mounted police knew the paths as well as the daku and we used to go stalking em in and out once we flushed em the men on the ponies had the advantage of the men on foot we held all the country absolutely quiet for ten miles round in about a month then we took boh naghee hicksey and i and the civil officer that was a lark  i think i am beginning to understand a little said cleever it was a pleasure to you to administer and fight  rather theres nothing nicer than a satisfactory little expedition when you find your plans fit together and your informations teek  correct you know and the whole subchiz  i mean when everything works out like formulae on a blackboard hicksey had all the information about the boh he had been burning villages and murdering people right and left and cutting up government convoys and all that he was lying doggo in a village about fifteen miles off waiting to get a fresh gang together so we arranged to take thirty mounted police and turn him out before he could plunder into our newlysettled villages at the last minute the civil officer in our part of the world thought hed assist at the performance  who was he said nevin  his name was dennis said the infant slowly and well let it stay so hes a better man now than he was then  but how old was the civil power said cleever the situation is developing itself  he was about sixandtwenty and he was awfly clever he knew a lot of things but i dont think he was quite steady enough for dacoithunting we started overnight for boh naghees village and we got there just before morning without raising an alarm dennis had turned out armed to his teeth  two revolvers a carbine and all sorts of things i was talking to hicksey about posting the men and dennis edged his pony in between us and said what shall i do what shall i do tell me what to do you fellows we didnt take much notice but his pony tried to bite me in the leg and i said pull out a bit old man till weve settled the attack he kept edging in and fiddling with his reins and his revolvers and saying dear me dear me oh dear me what do you think id better do the man was in a deadly funk and his teeth were chattering  i sympathise with the civil power said cleever continue young clive  the fun of it was that he was supposed to be our superior officer hicksey took a good look at him and told him to attach himself to my party beastly mean of hicksey that the chap kept on edging in and bothering instead of asking for some men and taking up his own position till i got angry and the carbines began popping on the other side of the village then i said for gods sake be quiet and sit down where you are if you see anybody come out of the village shoot at him i knew he couldnt hit a hayrick at a yard then i took my men over the garden wall  over the palisades y know  somehow or other and the fun began hicksey had found the boh in bed under a mosquitocurtain and he had taken a flying jump on to him  a flying jump said cleever is that also war  yes said the infant now thoroughly warmed dont you know how you take a flying jump on to a fellows head at school when he snores in the dormitory the boh was sleeping in a bedful of swords and pistols and hicksey came down like zazel through the netting and the net got mixed up with the pistols and the boh and hicksey and they all rolled on the floor together i laughed till i couldnt stand and hicksey was cursing me for not helping him so i left him to fight it out and went into the village our men were slashing about and firing and so were the dacoits and in the thick of the mess some ass set fire to a house and we all had to clear out i froze on to the nearest daku and ran to the palisade shoving him in front of me he wriggled loose and bounded over the other side i came after him but when i had one leg one side and one leg the other of the palisade i saw that the daku had fallen flat on denniss head that man had never moved from where i left him they rolled on the ground together and denniss carbine went off and nearly shot me the daku picked himself up and ran and dennis buzzed his carbine after him and it caught him on the back of his head and knocked him silly you never saw anything so funny in your life i doubled up on the top of the palisade and hung there yelling with laughter but dennis began to weep like anything oh ive killed a man he said ive killed a man and i shall never know another peaceful hour in my life is he dead oh is he dead good lord ive killed a man i came down and said dont be a fool but he kept on shouting is he dead till i could have kicked him the daku was only knocked out of time with the carbine he came to after a bit and i said are you hurt much he groaned and said no his chest was all cut with scrambling over the palisade the white mans gun didnt do that he said i did that and i knocked the white man over just like a burman wasnt it but dennis wouldnt be happy at any price he said tie up his wounds hell bleed to death oh hell bleed to death tie em up yourself i said if youre so anxious i cant touch him said dennis but heres my shirt he took off his shirt and fixed the braces again over his bare shoulders i ripped the shirt up and bandaged the dacoit quite professionally he was grinning at dennis all the time and denniss haversack was lying on the ground bursting full of sandwiches greedy hog i took some and offered some to dennis how can i eat he said how can you ask me to eat his very blood is on your hands now and youre eating my sandwiches all right i said ill give em to the daku so i did and the little chap was quite pleased and wolfed em down like one oclock  cleever brought his hand down on the table with a thump that made the empty glasses dance thats art he said flat flagrant mechanism dont tell me that happened on the spot  the pupils of the infants eyes contracted to two pinpoints i beg your pardon he said slowly and stiffly but i am telling this thing as it happened  cleever looked at him a moment my fault entirely said he i should have known please go on  hicksey came out of what was left of the village with his prisoners and captives all neatly tied up boh naghee was first and one of the villagers as soon as he found the old ruffian helpless began kicking him quietly the boh stood it as long as he could and then groaned and we saw what was going on hicksey tied the villager up and gave him a half a dozen good with a bamboo to remind him to leave a prisoner alone you should have seen the old boh grin oh but hicksey was in a furious rage with everybody hed got a wipe over the elbow that had tickled up his funnybone and he was rabid with me for not having helped him with the boh and the mosquitonet i had to explain that i couldnt do anything if youd seen em both tangled up together on the floor in one kicking cocoon youd have laughed for a week hicksey swore that the only decent man of his acquaintance was the boh and all the way to camp hicksey was talking to the boh and the boh was complaining about the soreness of his bones when we got back and had had a bath the boh wanted to know when he was going to be hanged hicksey said he couldnt oblige him on the spot but had to send him to rangoon the boh went down on his knees and reeled off a catalogue of his crimes  he ought to have been hanged seventeen times over by his own confession  and implored hicksey to settle the business out of hand if im sent to rangoon said he theyll keep me in jail all my life and that is a death every time the sun gets up or the wind blows but we had to send him to rangoon and of course he was let off down there and given penal servitude for life when i came to rangoon i went over the jail  i had helped to fill it y know  and the old boh was there and he spotted me at once he begged for some opium first and i tried to get him some but that was against the rules then he asked me to have his sentence changed to death because he was afraid of being sent to the andamans i couldnt do that either but i tried to cheer him and told him how things were going upcountry and the last thing he said was  give my compliments to the fat white man who jumped on me if id been awake id have killed him i wrote that to hicksey next mail and  and thats all im fraid ive been gassing awfly sir  cleever said nothing for a long time the infant looked uncomfortable he feared that misled by enthusiasm he had filled up the novelists time with unprofitable recital of trivial anecdotes  then said cleever i cant understand why should you have seen and done all these things before you have cut your wisdomteeth  dont know said the infant apologetically i havent seen much  only burmese jungle  and dead men and war and power and responsibility said cleever under his breath you wont have any sensations left at thirty if you go on as you have done but i want to hear more tales  more tales he seemed to forget that even subalterns might have engagements of their own  were thinking of dining out somewhere  the lot of us  and going on to the empire afterwards said nevin with hesitation he did not like to ask cleever to come too the invitation might be regarded as perilously near to cheek and cleever anxious not to wag a gray beard unbidden among boys at large said nothing on his side  boileau solved the little difficulty by blurting out wont you come too sir  cleever almost shouted yes and while he was being helped into his coat continued to murmur good heavens at intervals in a way that the boys could not understand  i dont think ive been to the empire in my life said he but  what is my life after all let us go  they went out with eustace cleever and i sulked at home because they had come to see me but had gone over to the better man which was humiliating they packed him into a cab with utmost reverence for was he not the author of as it was in the beginning and a person in whose company it was an honour to go abroad from all i gathered later he had taken less interest in the performance before him than in their conversations and they protested with emphasis that he was as good a man as they make knew what a man was driving at almost before he said it and yet hes so damned simple about things any man knows that was one of many comments  at midnight they returned announcing that they were highly respectable gondoliers and that oysters and stout were what they chiefly needed the eminent novelist was still with them and i think he was calling them by their shorter names i am certain that he said he had been moving in worlds not realised and that they had shown him the empire in a new light  still sore at recent neglect i answered shortly thank heaven we have within the land ten thousand as good as they and when he departed asked him what he thought of things generally  he replied with another quotation to the effect that though singing was a remarkably fine performance i was to be quite sure that few lips would be moved to song if they could find a sufficiency of kissing  whereby i understood that eustace cleever decorator and colourman in words was blaspheming his own art and would be sorry for this in the morning
