evening not three months ago lionel wallace told me this story of the door in the wall  and at the time i thought that so far as he was concerned it was a true story  he told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that i could not do otherwise than believe in him  but in the morning in my own flat i woke to a different atmosphere and as i lay in bed and recalled the things he had told me stripped of the glamour of his earnest slow voice denuded of the focussed shaded table light the shadowy atmosphere that wrapped about him and the pleasant bright things the dessert and glasses and napery of the dinner we had shared making them for the time a bright little world quite cut off from everyday realities i saw it all as frankly incredible  he was mystifying i said and then how well he did it      it isnt quite the thing i should have expected him of all people to do well  afterwards as i sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea i found myself trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me in his impossible reminiscences by supposing they did in some way suggest present conveyi hardly know which word to useexperiences it was otherwise impossible to tell  well i dont resort to that explanation now  i have got over my intervening doubts  i believe now as i believed at the moment of telling that wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his secret for me  but whether he himself saw or only thought he saw whether he himself was the possessor of an inestimable privilege or the victim of a fantastic dream i cannot pretend to guess  even the facts of his death which ended my doubts forever throw no light on that  that much the reader must judge for himself  i forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent a man to confide in me  he was i think defending himself against an imputation of slackness and unreliability i had made in relation to a great public movement in which he had disappointed me  but he plunged suddenly  i have he said a preoccupation  i know he went on after a pause that he devoted to the study of his cigar ash i have been negligent  the fact isit isnt a case of ghosts or apparitionsbutits an odd thing to tell of redmondi am haunted  i am haunted by somethingthat rather takes the light out of things that fills me with longings       he paused checked by that english shyness that so often overcomes us when we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things  you were at saint athelstans all through he said and for a moment that seemed to me quite irrelevant  welland he paused  then very haltingly at first but afterwards more easily he began to tell of the thing that was hidden in his life the haunting memory of a beauty and a happiness that filled his heart with insatiable longings that made all the interests and spectacle of worldly life seem dull and tedious and vain to him  now that i have the clue to it the thing seems written visibly in his face  i have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been caught and intensified  it reminds me of what a woman once said of hima woman who had loved him greatly suddenly she said the interest goes out of him  he forgets you  he doesnt care a rap for youunder his very nose       yet the interest was not always out of him and when he was holding his attention to a thing wallace could contrive to be an extremely successful man  his career indeed is set with successes  he left me behind him long ago he soared up over my head and cut a figure in the world that i couldnt cutanyhow he was still a year short of forty and they say now that he would have been in office and very probably in the new cabinet if he had lived  at school he always beat me without effortas it were by nature  we were at school together at saint athelstans college in west kensington for almost all our school time  he came into the school as my coequal but he left far above me in a blaze of scholarships and brilliant performance  yet i think i made a fair average running  and it was at school i heard first of the door in the wallthat i was to hear of a second time only a month before his death  to him at least the door in the wall was a real door leading through a real wall to immortal realities  of that i am now quite assured  and it came into his life early when he was a little fellow between five and six  i remember how as he sat making his confession to me with a slow gravity he reasoned and reckoned the date of it  there was he said a crimson virginia creeper in itall one bright uniform crimson in a clear amber sunshine against a white wall  that came into the impression somehow though i dont clearly remember how and there were horsechestnut leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green door  they were blotched yellow and green you know not brown nor dirty so that they must have been new fallen  i take it that means october  i look out for horsechestnut leaves every year and i ought to know  if im right in that i was about five years and four months old  he was he said rather a precocious little boyhe learned to talk at an abnormally early age and he was so sane and oldfashioned as people say that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most children scarcely attain by seven or eight his mother died when he was born and he was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a nursery governess  his father was a stern preoccupied lawyer who gave him little attention and expected great things of him  for all his brightness he found life a little grey and dull i think  and one day he wandered  he could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get away nor the course he took among the west kensington roads all that had faded among the incurable blurs of memory  but the white wall and the green door stood out quite distinctly  as his memory of that remote childish experience ran he did at the very first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion an attraction a desire to get to the door and open it and walk in and at the same time he had the clearest conviction that either it was unwise or it was wrong of himhe could not tell whichto yield to this attraction  he insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from the very beginningunless memory has played him the queerest trickthat the door was unfastened and that he could go in as he chose  i seem to see the figure of that little boy drawn and repelled  and it was very clear in his mind too though why it should be so was never explained that his father would be very angry if he went through that door  wallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost particularity  he went right past the door and then with his hands in his pockets and making an infantile attempt to whistle strolled right along beyond the end of the wall  there he recalls a number of mean dirty shops and particularly that of a plumber and decorator with a dusty disorder of earthenware pipes sheet lead ball taps pattern books of wall paper and tins of enamel  he stood pretending to examine these things and coveting passionately desiring the green door  then he said he had a gust of emotion  he made a run for it lest hesitation should grip him again he went plump with outstretched hand through the green door and let it slam behind him  and so in a trice he came into the garden that has haunted all his life  it was very difficult for wallace to give me his full sense of that garden into which he came  there was something in the very air of it that exhilarated that gave one a sense of lightness and good happening and well being there was something in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect and subtly luminous  in the instant of coming into it one was exquisitely gladas only in rare moments and when one is young and joyful one can be glad in this world and everything was beautiful there       wallace mused before he went on telling me  you see he said with the doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things there were two great panthers there    yes spotted panthers  and i was not afraid  there was a long wide path with marbleedged flower borders on either side and these two huge velvety beasts were playing there with a ball  one looked up and came towards me a little curious as it seemed  it came right up to me rubbed its soft round ear very gently against the small hand i held out and purred  it was i tell you an enchanted garden  i know  and the size  oh it stretched far and wide this way and that  i believe there were hills far away  heaven knows where west kensington had suddenly got to  and somehow it was just like coming home  you know in the very moment the door swung to behind me i forgot the road with its fallen chestnut leaves its cabs and tradesmens carts i forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and obedience of home i forgot all hesitations and fear forgot discretion forgot all the intimate realities of this life  i became in a moment a very glad and wonderhappy little boyin another world  it was a world with a different quality a warmer more penetrating and mellower light with a faint clear gladness in its air and wisps of suntouched cloud in the blueness of its sky  and before me ran this long wide path invitingly with weedless beds on either side rich with untended flowers and these two great panthers  i put my little hands fearlessly on their soft fur and caressed their round ears and the sensitive corners under their ears and played with them and it was as though they welcomed me home  there was a keen sense of homecoming in my mind and when presently a tall fair girl appeared in the pathway and came to meet me smiling and said well to me and lifted me and kissed me and put me down and led me by the hand there was no amazement but only an impression of delightful rightness of being reminded of happy things that had in some strange way been overlooked  there were broad steps i remember that came into view between spikes of delphinium and up these we went to a great avenue between very old and shady dark trees  all down this avenue you know between the red chapped stems were marble seats of honour and statuary and very tame and friendly white doves       and along this avenue my girlfriend led me looking downi recall the pleasant lines the finelymodelled chin of her sweet kind faceasking me questions in a soft agreeable voice and telling me things pleasant things i know though what they were i was never able to recall     and presently a little capuchin monkey very clean with a fur of ruddy brown and kindly hazel eyes came down a tree to us and ran beside me looking up at me and grinning and presently leapt to my shoulder  so we went on our way in great happiness      he paused  go on i said  i remember little things  we passed an old man musing among laurels i remember and a place gay with paroquets and came through a broad shaded colonnade to a spacious cool palace full of pleasant fountains full of beautiful things full of the quality and promise of hearts desire  and there were many things and many people some that still seem to stand out clearly and some that are a little vague but all these people were beautiful and kind  in some wayi dont know howit was conveyed to me that they all were kind to me glad to have me there and filling me with gladness by their gestures by the touch of their hands by the welcome and love in their eyes  yes  he mused for awhile  playmates i found there  that was very much to me because i was a lonely little boy  they played delightful games in a grasscovered court where there was a sundial set about with flowers  and as one played one loved      butits oddtheres a gap in my memory  i dont remember the games we played  i never remembered  afterwards as a child i spent long hours trying even with tears to recall the form of that happiness  i wanted to play it all over againin my nurseryby myself  no  all i remember is the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most with me      then presently came a sombre dark woman with a grave pale face and dreamy eyes a sombre woman wearing a soft long robe of pale purple who carried a book and beckoned and took me aside with her into a gallery above a hallthough my playmates were loth to have me go and ceased their game and stood watching as i was carried away  come back to us they cried  come back to us soon i looked up at her face but she heeded them not at all  her face was very gentle and grave  she took me to a seat in the gallery and i stood beside her ready to look at her book as she opened it upon her knee  the pages fell open  she pointed and i looked marvelling for in the living pages of that book i saw myself it was a story about myself and in it were all the things that had happened to me since ever i was born      it was wonderful to me because the pages of that book were not pictures you understand but realities  wallace paused gravelylooked at me doubtfully  go on i said  i understand  they were realitiesyes they must have been people moved and things came and went in them my dear mother whom i had near forgotten then my father stern and upright the servants the nursery all the familiar things of home  then the front door and the busy streets with traffic to and fro i looked and marvelled and looked half doubtfully again into the womans face and turned the pages over skipping this and that to see more of this book and more and so at last i came to myself hovering and hesitating outside the green door in the long white wall and felt again the conflict and the fear  and next i cried and would have turned on but the cool hand of the grave woman delayed me  next i insisted and struggled gently with her hand pulling up her fingers with all my childish strength and as she yielded and the page came over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow  but the page did not show the enchanted garden nor the panthers nor the girl who had led me by the hand nor the playfellows who had been so loth to let me go  it showed a long grey street in west kensington on that chill hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit and i was there a wretched little figure weeping aloud for all that i could do to restrain myself and i was weeping because i could not return to my dear playfellows who had called after me come back to us  come back to us soon  i was there  this was no page in a book but harsh reality that enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave mother at whose knee i stood had gonewhither have they gone  he halted again and remained for a time staring into the fire  oh the wretchedness of that return he murmured  well i said after a minute or so  poor little wretch i wasbrought back to this grey world again  as i realised the fulness of what had happened to me i gave way to quite ungovernable grief  and the shame and humiliation of that public weeping and my disgraceful homecoming remain with me still  i see again the benevolentlooking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and spoke to meprodding me first with his umbrella  poor little chap said he and are you lost thenand me a london boy of five and more  and he must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of me and so march me home  sobbing conspicuous and frightened i came from the enchanted garden to the steps of my fathers house  that is as well as i can remember my vision of that gardenthe garden that haunts me still  of course i can convey nothing of that indescribable quality of translucent unreality that difference from the common things of experience that hung about it all but thatthat is what happened  if it was a dream i am sure it was a daytime and altogether extraordinary dream        hmnaturally there followed a terrible questioning by my aunt my father the nurse the governesseveryone        i tried to tell them and my father gave me my first thrashing for telling lies  when afterwards i tried to tell my aunt she punished me again for my wicked persistence  then as i said everyone was forbidden to listen to me to hear a word about it  even my fairy tale books were taken away from me for a timebecause i was too imaginative eh  yes they did that  my father belonged to the old school      and my story was driven back upon myself  i whispered it to my pillowmy pillow that was often damp and salt to my whispering lips with childish tears  and i added always to my official and less fervent prayers this one heartfelt request please god i may dream of the garden  oh take me back to my garden  take me back to my garden  i dreamt often of the garden  i may have added to it i may have changed it i do not know       all this you understand is an attempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a very early experience  between that and the other consecutive memories of my boyhood there is a gulf  a time came when it seemed impossible i should ever speak of that wonder glimpse again  i asked an obvious question  no he said  i dont remember that i ever attempted to find my way back to the garden in those early years  this seems odd to me now but i think that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements after this misadventure to prevent my going astray  no it wasnt until you knew me that i tried for the garden again  and i believe there was a periodincredible as it seems nowwhen i forgot the garden altogetherwhen i was about eight or nine it may have been  do you remember me as a kid at saint athelstans  rather  i didnt show any signs did i in those days of having a secret dream   ii   he looked up with a sudden smile  did you ever play northwest passage with me       no of course you didnt come my way  it was the sort of game he went on that every imaginative child plays all day  the idea was the discovery of a northwest passage to school  the way to school was plain enough the game consisted in finding some way that wasnt plain starting off ten minutes early in some almost hopeless direction and working ones way round through unaccustomed streets to my goal  and one day i got entangled among some rather lowclass streets on the other side of campden hill and i began to think that for once the game would be against me and that i should get to school late  i tried rather desperately a street that seemed a cul de sac and found a passage at the end  i hurried through that with renewed hope  i shall do it yet i said and passed a row of frowsy little shops that were inexplicably familiar to me and behold there was my long white wall and the green door that led to the enchanted garden  the thing whacked upon me suddenly  then after all that garden that wonderful garden wasnt a dream      he paused  i suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the infinite leisure of a child  anyhow this second time i didnt for a moment think of going in straight away  you see    for one thing my mind was full of the idea of getting to school in timeset on not breaking my record for punctuality  i must surely have felt some little desire at least to try the dooryes i must have felt that       but i seem to remember the attraction of the door mainly as another obstacle to my overmastering determination to get to school  i was immediately interested by this discovery i had made of coursei went on with my mind full of itbut i went on  it didnt check me  i ran past tugging out my watch found i had ten minutes still to spare and then i was going downhill into familiar surroundings  i got to school breathless it is true and wet with perspiration but in time  i can remember hanging up my coat and hat    went right by it and left it behind me  odd eh  he looked at me thoughtfully  of course i didnt know then that it wouldnt always be there  school boys have limited imaginations  i suppose i thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there to know my way back to it but there was the school tugging at me  i expect i was a good deal distraught and inattentive that morning recalling what i could of the beautiful strange people i should presently see again  oddly enough i had no doubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me    yes i must have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career  i didnt go that day at all  the next day was a half holiday and that may have weighed with me  perhaps too my state of inattention brought down impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for the detour  i dont know  what i do know is that in the meantime the enchanted garden was so much upon my mind that i could not keep it to myself  i toldwhat was his namea ferretylooking youngster we used to call squiff  young hopkins said i  hopkins it was  i did not like telling him i had a feeling that in some way it was against the rules to tell him but i did he was walking part of the way home with me he was talkative and if we had not talked about the enchanted garden we should have talked of something else and it was intolerable to me to think about any other subject  so i blabbed  well he told my secret  the next day in the play interval i found myself surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys half teasing and wholly curious to hear more of the enchanted garden  there was that big fawcettyou remember himand carnaby and morley reynolds  you werent there by any chance  no i think i should have remembered if you were       a boy is a creature of odd feelings  i was i really believe in spite of my secret selfdisgust a little flattered to have the attention of these big fellows  i remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused by the praise of crawshawyou remember crawshaw major the son of crawshaw the composerwho said it was the best lie he had ever heard  but at the same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at telling what i felt was indeed a sacred secret  that beast fawcett made a joke about the girl in green  wallaces voice sank with the keen memory of that shame  i pretended not to hear he said  well then carnaby suddenly called me a young liar and disputed with me when i said the thing was true  i said i knew where to find the green door could lead them all there in ten minutes   carnaby became outrageously virtuous and said id have toand bear out my words or suffer did you ever have carnaby twist your arm  then perhaps youll understand how it went with me  i swore my story was true  there was nobody in the school then to save a chap from carnaby though crawshaw put in a word or so  carnaby had got his game  i grew excited and redeared and a little frightened i behaved altogether like a silly little chap and the outcome of it all was that instead of starting alone for my enchanted garden i led the way presentlycheeks flushed ears hot eyes smarting and my soul one burning misery and shamefor a party of six mocking curious and threatening schoolfellows  we never found the white wall and the green door     you mean  i mean i couldnt find it  i would have found it if i could  and afterwards when i could go alone i couldnt find it  i never found it  i seem now to have been always looking for it through my schoolboy days but ive never come upon it again  did the fellowsmake it disagreeable  beastly       carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying  i remember how i sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my blubbering  but when i cried myself to sleep at last it wasnt for carnaby but for the garden for the beautiful afternoon i had hoped for for the sweet friendly women and the waiting playfellows and the game i had hoped to learn again that beautiful forgotten game       i believed firmly that if i had not told       i had bad times after thatcrying at night and woolgathering by day for two terms i slackened and had bad reports  do you remember of course you would  it was youyour beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the grind again   iii   for a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the fire  then he said i never saw it again until i was seventeen  it leapt upon me for the third timeas i was driving to paddington on my way to oxford and a scholarship  i had just one momentary glimpse  i was leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette and no doubt thinking myself no end of a man of the world and suddenly there was the door the wall the dear sense of unforgettable and still attainable things  we clattered byi too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we were well past and round a corner  then i had a queer moment a double and divergent movement of my will i tapped the little door in the roof of the cab and brought my arm down to pull out my watch  yes sir said the cabman smartly  erwellits nothing i cried  my mistake  we havent much time  go on and he went on     i got my scholarship  and the night after i was told of that i sat over my fire in my little upper room my study in my fathers house with his praisehis rare praiseand his sound counsels ringing in my ears and i smoked my favourite pipethe formidable bulldog of adolescenceand thought of that door in the long white wall  if i had stopped i thought i should have missed my scholarship i should have missed oxfordmuddled all the fine career before me  i begin to see things better i fell musing deeply but i did not doubt then this career of mine was a thing that merited sacrifice  those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me very fine but remote  my grip was fixing now upon the world  i saw another door openingthe door of my career  he stared again into the fire  its red lights picked out a stubborn strength in his face for just one flickering moment and then it vanished again  well he said and sighed i have served that career  i have donemuch work much hard work  but i have dreamt of the enchanted garden a thousand dreams and seen its door or at least glimpsed its door four times since then  yesfour times  for a while this world was so bright and interesting seemed so full of meaning and opportunity that the halfeffaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and remote  who wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty women and distinguished men  i came down to london from oxford a man of bold promise that i have done something to redeem  somethingand yet there have been disappointments       twice i have been in lovei will not dwell on thatbut once as i went to someone who i know doubted whether i dared to come i took a short cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near earls court and so happened on a white wall and a familiar green door  odd said i to myself but i thought this place was on campden hill  its the place i never could find somehowlike counting stonehengethe place of that queer day dream of mine and i went by it intent upon my purpose  it had no appeal to me that afternoon  i had just a moments impulse to try the door three steps aside were needed at the mostthough i was sure enough in my heart that it would open to meand then i thought that doing so might delay me on the way to that appointment in which i thought my honour was involved  afterwards i was sorry for my punctualityi might at least have peeped in i thought and waved a hand to those panthers but i knew enough by this time not to seek again belatedly that which is not found by seeking  yes that time made me very sorry       years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door its only recently it has come back to me  with it there has come a sense as though some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world i began to think of it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that i should never see that door again  perhaps i was suffering a little from overworkperhaps it was what ive heard spoken of as the feeling of forty  i dont know  but certainly the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things recently and that just at a time with all these new political developmentswhen i ought to be working  odd isnt it  but i do begin to find life toilsome its rewards as i come near them cheap  i began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly  yesand ive seen it three times  the garden  nothe door  and i havent gone in  he leaned over the table to me with an enormous sorrow in his voice as he spoke  thrice i have had my chancethrice  if ever that door offers itself to me again i swore i will go in out of this dust and heat out of this dry glitter of vanity out of these toilsome futilities  i will go and never return  this time i will stay       i swore it and when the time camei didnt go  three times in one year have i passed that door and failed to enter  three times in the last year  the first time was on the night of the snatch division on the tenants redemption bill on which the government was saved by a majority of three  you remember  no one on our sideperhaps very few on the opposite sideexpected the end that night  then the debate collapsed like eggshells  i and hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at brentford we were both unpaired and we were called up by telephone and set off at once in his cousins motor  we got in barely in time and on the way we passed my wall and doorlivid in the moonlight blotched with hot yellow as the glare of our lamps lit it but unmistakable  my god cried i  what said hotchkiss  nothing i answered and the moment passed  ive made a great sacrifice i told the whip as i got in they all have he said and hurried by  i do not see how i could have done otherwise then  and the next occasion was as i rushed to my fathers bedside to bid that stern old man farewell  then too the claims of life were imperative  but the third time was different it happened a week ago  it fills me with hot remorse to recall it  i was with gurker and ralphsits no secret now you know that ive had my talk with gurker  we had been dining at frobishers and the talk had become intimate between us  the question of my place in the reconstructed ministry lay always just over the boundary of the discussion yesyes  thats all settled  it neednt be talked about yet but theres no reason to keep a secret from you       yesthanks thanks  but let me tell you my story  then on that night things were very much in the air  my position was a very delicate one  i was keenly anxious to get some definite word from gurker but was hampered by ralphs presence i was using the best power of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too obviously directed to the point that concerns me  i had to  ralphs behaviour since has more than justified my caution       ralphs i knew would leave us beyond the kensington high street and then i could surprise gurker by a sudden frankness  one has sometimes to resort to these little devices      and then it was that in the margin of my field of vision i became aware once more of the white wall the green door before us down the road  we passed it talking  i passed it  i can still see the shadow of gurkers marked profile his opera hat tilted forward over his prominent nose the many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow and ralphs as we sauntered past  i passed within twenty inches of the door  if i say goodnight to them and go in i asked myself what will happen and i was all atingle for that word with gurker  i could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems  they will think me mad i thought  and suppose i vanish nowamazing disappearance of a prominent politician that weighed with me  a thousand inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that crisis  then he turned on me with a sorrowful smile and speaking slowly here i am he said  here i am he repeated and my chance has gone from me three times in one year the door has been offered methe door that goes into peace into delight into a beauty beyond dreaming a kindness no man on earth can know  and i have rejected it redmond and it has gone  how do you know  i know  i know  i am left now to work it out to stick to the tasks that held me so strongly when my moments came  you say i have successthis vulgar tawdry irksome envied thing  i have it  he had a walnut in his big hand  if that was my success he said and crushed it and held it out for me to see  let me tell you something redmond  this loss is destroying me  for two months for ten weeks nearly now i have done no work at all except the most necessary and urgent duties  my soul is full of inappeasable regrets  at nightswhen it is less likely i shall be recognisedi go out  i wander  yes  i wonder what people would think of that if they knew  a cabinet minister the responsible head of that most vital of all departments wandering alonegrievingsometimes near audibly lamentingfor a door for a garden   iv   i can see now his rather pallid face and the unfamiliar sombre fire that had come into his eyes  i see him very vividly tonight  i sit recalling his words his tones and last evenings westminster gazette still lies on my sofa containing the notice of his death  at lunch today the club was busy with him and the strange riddle of his fate  they found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation near east kensington station  it is one of two shafts that have been made in connection with an extension of the railway southward  it is protected from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high road in which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some of the workmen who live in that direction  the doorway was left unfastened through a misunderstanding between two gangers and through it he made his way       my mind is darkened with questions and riddles  it would seem he walked all the way from the house that nighthe has frequently walked home during the past sessionand so it is i figure his dark form coming along the late and empty streets wrapped up intent  and then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat the rough planking into a semblance of white  did that fatal unfastened door awaken some memory  was there after all ever any green door in the wall at all  i do not know  i have told his story as he told it to me there are times when i believe that wallace was no more than the victim of the coincidence between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination and a careless trap but that indeed is not my profoundest belief  you may think me superstitious if you will and foolish but indeed i am more than half convinced that he had in truth an abnormal gift and a sense somethingi know not whatthat in the guise of wall and door offered him an outlet a secret and peculiar passage of escape into another and altogether more beautiful world  at any rate you will say it betrayed him in the end  but did it betray him  there you touch the inmost mystery of these dreamers these men of vision and the imagination we see our world fair and common the hoarding and the pit  by our daylight standard he walked out of security into darkness danger and death  but did he see like that     the star  it was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made almost simultaneously from three observatories that the motion of the planet neptune the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun had become very erratic  ogilvy had already called attention to a suspected retardation in its velocity in december  such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet neptune nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any very great excitement  scientific people however found the intelligence remarkable enough even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets and that the deflection of neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind  few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of the solar system  the sun with its specks of planets its dust of planetoids and its impalpable comets swims in a vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination  beyond the orbit of neptune there is space vacant so far as human observation has penetrated without warmth or light or sound blank emptiness for twenty million times a million miles  that is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of the stars is attained  and saving a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame no matter had ever to human knowledge crossed this gulf of space until early in the twentieth century this strange wanderer appeared  a vast mass of matter it was bulky heavy rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into the radiance of the sun  by the second day it was clearly visible to any decent instrument as a speck with a barely sensible diameter in the constellation leo near regulus  in a little while an opera glass could attain it  on the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual apparition in the heavens  a planetary collision one london paper headed the news and proclaimed duchaines opinion that this strange new planet would probably collide with neptune  the leader writers enlarged upon the topic so that in most of the capitals of the world on january 3rd there was an expectation however vague of some imminent phenomenon in the sky and as the night followed the sunset round the globe thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to seethe old familiar stars just as they had always been  until it was dawn in london and pollux setting and the stars overhead grown pale  the winters dawn it was a sickly filtering accumulation of daylight and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to show where people were astir  but the yawning policeman saw the thing the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape workmen going to their work betimes milkmen the drivers of newscarts dissipation going home jaded and pale homeless wanderers sentinels on their beats and in the country labourers trudging afield poachers slinking home all over the dusky quickening country it could be seenand out at sea by seamen watching for the daya great white star come suddenly into the westward sky  brighter it was than any star in our skies brighter than the evening star at its brightest  it still glowed out white and large no mere twinkling spot of light but a small round clear shining disc an hour after the day had come  and where science has not reached men stared and feared telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the heavens  sturdy boers dusky hottentots gold coast negroes frenchmen spaniards portuguese stood in the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star  and in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement rising almost to shouting pitch as the two remote bodies had rushed together and a hurrying to and fro to gather photographic apparatus and spectroscope and this appliance and that to record this novel astonishing sight the destruction of a world  for it was a world a sister planet of our earth far greater than our earth indeed that had so suddenly flashed into flaming death  neptune it was had been struck fairly and squarely by the strange planet from outer space and the heat of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast mass of incandescence  round the world that day two hours before the dawn went the pallid great white star fading only as it sank westward and the sun mounted above it  everywhere men marvelled at it but of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those sailors habitual watchers of the stars who far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night  and when next it rose over europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on hilly slopes on houseroofs in open spaces staring eastward for the rising of the great new star  it rose with a white glow in front of it like the glare of a white fire and those who had seen it come into existence the night before cried out at the sight of it  it is larger they cried  it is brighter  and indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange new star  it is brighter cried the people clustering in the streets but in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one another  it is nearer they said  nearer  and voice after voice repeated it is nearer and the clicking telegraph took that up and it trembled along telephone wires and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type  it is nearer  men writing in offices struck with a strange realisation flung down their pens men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in those words it is nearer  it hurried along wakening streets it was shouted down the froststilled ways of quiet villages men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellowlit doorways shouting the news to the passersby  it is nearer pretty women flushed and glittering heard the news told jestingly between the dances and feigned an intelligent interest they did not feel  nearer  indeed  how curious  how very very clever people must be to find out things like that  lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to comfort themselveslooking skyward  it has need to be nearer for the nights as cold as charity  dont seem much warmth from it if it is nearer all the same  what is a new star to me cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her dead  the schoolboy rising early for his examination work puzzled it out for himselfwith the great white star shining broad and bright through the frostflowers of his window  centrifugal centripetal he said with his chin on his fist  stop a planet in its flight rob it of its centrifugal force what then centripetal has it and down it falls into the sun  and this  do we come in the way  i wonder  the light of that day went the way of its brethren and with the later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again  and it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself hanging huge in the sunset  in a south african city a great man had married and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride  even the skies have illuminated said the flatterer  under capricorn two negro lovers daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one another crouched together in a cane brake where the fireflies hovered  that is our star they whispered and felt strangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light  the master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers from him  his calculations were already finished  in a small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active for four long nights  each day serene explicit patient as ever he had given his lecture to his students and then had come back at once to this momentous calculation  his face was grave a little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity  for some time he seemed lost in thought then he went to the window and the blind went up with a click half way up the sky over the clustering roofs chimneys and steeples of the city hung the star  he looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy  you may kill me he said after a silence  but i can hold youand all the universe for that matterin the grip of this little brain  i would not change  even now  he looked at the little phial  there will be no need of sleep again he said  the next day at noonpunctual to the minute he entered his lecture theatre put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was and carefully selected a large piece of chalk  it was a joke among his students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply  he came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers of young fresh faces and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of phrasing  circumstances have arisencircumstances beyond my control he said and paused which will debar me from completing the course i had designed  it would seem gentlemen if i may put the thing clearly and briefly thatman has lived in vain  the students glanced at one another  had they heard aright mad  raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were but one or two faces remained intent upon his calm greyfringed face  it will be interesting he was saying to devote this morning to an exposition so far as i can make it clear to you of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion  let us assume  he turned towards the blackboard meditating a diagram in the way that was usual to him  what was that about lived in vain whispered one student to another  listen said the other nodding towards the lecturer  and presently they began to understand  that night the star rose later for its proper eastward motion had carried it some way across leo towards virgo and its brightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose and every star was hidden in its turn save only jupiter near the zenith capella aldebaran sirius and the pointers of the bear  it was very white and beautiful  in many parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about  it was perceptibly larger in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon  the frost was still on the ground in england but the world was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight  one could see to read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan  and everywhere the world was awake that night and throughout christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country side like the belling of bees in the heather and this murmurous tumult grew to a clangour in the cities  it was the tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and steeples summoning the people to sleep no more to sin no more but to gather in their churches and pray  and overhead growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed rose the dazzling star  and the streets and houses were alight in all the cities the shipyards glared and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all night long  and in all the seas about the civilised lands ships with throbbing engines and ships with bellying sails crowded with men and living creatures were standing out to ocean and the north  for already the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the world and translated into a hundred tongues  the new planet and neptune locked in a fiery embrace were whirling headlong ever faster and faster towards the sun  already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles and every second its terrific velocity increased  as it flew now indeed it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it  but near its destined path as yet only slightly perturbed spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid round the sun every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger  and the result of that attraction  inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit into an elliptical path and the burning star swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush would describe a curved path and perhaps collide with and certainly pass very close to our earth  earthquakes volcanic outbreaks cyclones sea waves floods and a steady rise in temperature to i know not what limitso prophesied the master mathematician  and overhead to carry out his words lonely and cold and livid blazed the star of the coming doom  to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that it was visibly approaching  and that night too the weather changed and the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england softened towards a thaw  but you must not imagine because i have spoken of people praying through the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing toward mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star  as a matter of fact use and wont still ruled the world and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations  in all the cities the shops save one here and there opened and closed at their proper hours the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades the workers gathered in the factories soldiers drilled scholars studied lovers sought one another thieves lurked and fled politicians planned their schemes  the presses of the newspapers roared through the night and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic  the newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000for then too people had anticipated the end  the star was no starmere gasa comet and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth  there was no precedent for such a thing  common sense was sturdy everywhere scornful jesting a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful  that night at sevenfifteen by greenwich time the star would be at its nearest to jupiter  then the world would see the turn things would take  the master mathematicians grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate selfadvertisement  common sense at last a little heated by argument signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed so too barbarism and savagery already tired of the novelty went about their nightly business and save for a howling dog here and there the beast world left the star unheeded  and yet when at last the watchers in the european states saw the star rise an hour later it is true but no larger than it had been the night before there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematicianto take the danger as if it had passed  but hereafter the laughter ceased  the star grewit grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour a little larger each hour a little nearer the midnight zenith and brighter and brighter until it had turned night into a second day  had it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path had it lost no velocity to jupiter it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet  the next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to english eyes and the thaw was assured  it rose over america near the size of the moon but blinding white to look at and hot and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength and in virginia and brazil and down the st lawrence valley it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunderclouds flickering violet lightning and hail unprecedented  in manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods  and upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that night and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid and soonin their upper reacheswith swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men they rose steadily steadily in the ghostly brilliance and came trickling over their banks at last behind the flying population of their valleys  and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic the tides were higher than had ever been in the memory of man and the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland drowning whole cities  and so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow  the earthquakes began and grew until all down america from the arctic circle to cape horn hillsides were sliding fissures were opening and houses and walls crumbling to destruction  the whole side of cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day it reached the sea  so the star with the wan moon in its wake marched across the pacific trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe and the growing tidal wave that toiled behind it frothing and eager poured over island and island and swept them clear of men  until that wave came at lastin a blinding light and with the breath of a furnace swift and terrible it camea wall of water fifty feet high roaring hungrily upon the long coasts of asia and swept inland across the plains of china  for a space the star hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its strength showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country towns and villages with their pagodas and trees roads wide cultivated fields millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the incandescent sky and then low and growing came the murmur of the flood  and thus it was with millions of men that nighta flight nowhither with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant and the flood like a wall swift and white behind  and then death  china was lit glowing white but over japan and java and all the islands of eastern asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its coming  above was the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks  soon the immemorial snows of thibet and the himalaya were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains of burmah and hindostan  the tangled summits of the indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected the bloodred tongues of fire  and in a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad riverways to that one last hope of menthe open sea  larger grew the star and larger hotter and brighter with a terrible swiftness now  the tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly speckled with stormtossed ships  and then came a wonder  it seemed to those who in europe watched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation  in a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain  hour followed hour through a terrible suspense and the star rose not once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had counted lost to them forever  in england it was hot and clear overhead though the ground quivered perpetually but in the tropics sirius and capella and aldebaran showed through a veil of steam  and when at last the great star rose near ten hours late the sun rose close upon it and in the centre of its white heart was a disc of black  over asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the sky and then suddenly as it hung over india its light had been veiled  all the plain of india from the mouth of the indus to the mouths of the ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night out of which rose temples and palaces mounds and hills black with people  every minaret was a clustering mass of people who fell one by one into the turbid waters as heat and terror overcame them  the whole land seemed awailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair and a breath of cold wind and a gathering of clouds out of the cooling air  men looking up near blinded at the star saw that a black disc was creeping across the light  it was the moon coming between the star and the earth  and even as men cried to god at this respite out of the east with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun  and then star sun and moon rushed together across the heavens  so it was that presently to the european watchers star and sun rose close upon each other drove headlong for a space and then slower and at last came to rest star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of the sky  the moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilliance of the sky  and though those who were still alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger fatigue heat and despair engender there were still men who could perceive the meaning of these signs  star and earth had been at their nearest had swung about one another and the star had passed  already it was receding swifter and swifter in the last stage of its headlong journey downward into the sun  and then the clouds gathered blotting out the vision of the sky the thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world all over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of mud  everywhere the waters were pouring off the land leaving mudsilted ruins and the earth littered like a stormworn beach with all that had floated and the dead bodies of the men and brutes its children  for days the water streamed off the land sweeping away soil and trees and houses in the way and piling huge dykes and scooping out titanic gullies over the country side  those were the days of darkness that followed the star and the heat  all through them and for many weeks and months the earthquakes continued  but the star had passed and men hungerdriven and gathering courage only slowly might creep back to their ruined cities buried granaries and sodden fields  such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports  and as the storms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore and the sun larger and the moon shrunk to a third of its former size took now fourscore days between its new and new  but of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men of the saving of laws and books and machines of the strange change that had come over iceland and greenland and the shores of baffins bay so that the sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious and could scarce believe their eyes this story does not tell  nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter northward and southward towards the poles of the earth  it concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the star  the martian astronomersfor there are astronomers on mars although they are very different beings from menwere naturally profoundly interested by these things  they saw them from their own standpoint of course  considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun one wrote it is astonishing what a little damage the earth which it missed so narrowly has sustained  all the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration supposed to be frozen water round either pole  which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophes may seem at a distance of a few million miles     a dream of armageddon  the man with the white face entered the carriage at rugby  he moved slowly in spite of the urgency of his porter and even while he was still on the platform i noted how ill he seemed  he dropped into the corner over against me with a sigh made an incomplete attempt to arrange his travelling shawl and became motionless with his eyes staring vacantly  presently he was moved by a sense of my observation looked up at me and put out a spiritless hand for his newspaper  then he glanced again in my direction  i feigned to read  i feared i had unwittingly embarrassed him and in a moment i was surprised to find him speaking  i beg your pardon said i  that book he repeated pointing a lean finger is about dreams  obviously i answered for it was fortnum roscoes dream states and the title was on the cover  he hung silent for a space as if he sought words yes he said at last but they tell you nothing  i did not catch his meaning for a second  they dont know he added  i looked a little more attentively at his face  there are dreams he said and dreams  that sort of proposition i never dispute  i suppose he hesitated do you ever dream  i mean vividly  i dream very little i answered  i doubt if i have three vivid dreams in a year  ah he said and seemed for a moment to collect his thoughts  your dreams dont mix with your memories he asked abruptly you dont find yourself in doubt did this happen or did it not  hardly ever  except just for a momentary hesitation now and then  i suppose few people do  does he say  he indicated the book  says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about intensity of impression and the like to account for its not happening as a rule  i suppose you know something of these theories  very littleexcept that they are wrong  his emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time  i prepared to resume reading and that seemed to precipitate his next remark  he leant forward almost as though he would touch me  isnt there something called consecutive dreamingthat goes on night after night  i believe there is  there are cases given in most books on mental trouble  mental trouble  yes  i daresay there are  its the right place for them  but what i mean  he looked at his bony knuckles  is that sort of thing always dreaming  is it dreaming or is it something else  mightnt it be something else  i should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn anxiety of his face  i remember now the look of his faded eyes and the lids red stainedperhaps you know that look  im not just arguing about a matter of opinion he said the things killing me  dreams  if you call them dreams  night after night  vividso vivid     this he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window seems unreal in comparison  i can scarcely remember who i am what business i am on      he paused  even now  the dream is always the samedo you mean i asked  its over  you mean  i died  died  smashed and killed and now so much of me as that dream was is dead  dead forever  i dreamt i was another man you know living in a different part of the world and in a different time i dreamt that night after night  night after night i woke into that other life  fresh scenes and fresh happeningsuntil i came upon the last  when you died  when i died  and since then  no he said  thank god  that was the end of the dream     it was clear i was in for this dream  and after all i had an hour before me the light was fading fast and fortnum roscoe has a dreary way with him  living in a different time i said do you mean in some different age  yes  past  no to cometo come  the year three thousand for example  i dont know what year it was  i did when i was asleep when i was dreaming that is but not nownot now that i am awake theres a lot of things i have forgotten since i woke out of these dreams though i knew them at the time when i wasi suppose it was dreaming  they called the year differently from our way of calling the year    what did they call it  he put his hand to his forehead  no said he i forget  he sat smiling weakly  for a moment i feared he did not mean to tell me his dream  as a rule i hate people who tell their dreams but this struck me differently  i proffered assistance even  it began i suggested  it was vivid from the first  i seemed to wake up in it suddenly  and its curious that in these dreams i am speaking of i never remembered this life i am living now  it seemed as if the dream life was enough while it lasted  perhapsbut i will tell you how i find myself when i do my best to recall it all  i dont remember anything clearly until i found myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea  i had been dozing and suddenly i woke upfresh and vividnot a bit dreamlikebecause the girl had stopped fanning me  the girl  yes the girl  you must not interrupt or you will put me out  he stopped abruptly  you wont think im mad he said  no i answered  youve been dreaming  tell me your dream  i woke up i say because the girl had stopped fanning me i was not surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort you understand  i did not feel i had fallen into it suddenly  i simply took it up at that point  whatever memory i had of this life this nineteenthcentury life faded as i woke vanished like a dream  i knew all about myself knew that my name was no longer cooper but hedon and all about my position in the world  ive forgotten a lot since i woketheres a want of connectionbut it was all quite clear and matter of fact then  he hesitated again gripping the window strap putting his face forward and looking up to me appealingly  this seems bosh to you  no no i cried  go on  tell me what this loggia was like  it was not really a loggiai dont know what to call it  it faced south  it was small  it was all in shadow except the semicircle above the balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl stood  i was on a couchit was a metal couch with light striped cushionsand the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me  the light of the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek  her pretty white neck and the little curls that nestled there and her white shoulder were in the sun and all the grace of her body was in the cool blue shadow  she was dressedhow can i describe it  it was easy and flowing  and altogether there she stood so that it came to me how beautiful and desirable she was as though i had never seen her before and when at last i sighed and raised myself upon my arm she turned her face to me  he stopped  i have lived threeandfifty years in this world  i have had mother sisters friends wife and daughtersall their faces the play of their faces i know  but the face of this girlit is much more real to me  i can bring it back into memory so that i see it againi could draw it or paint it  and after all  he stoppedbut i said nothing  the face of a dreamthe face of a dream  she was beautiful not that beauty which is terrible cold and worshipful like the beauty of a saint nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions but a sort of radiation sweet lips that softened into smiles and grave gray eyes  and she moved gracefully she seemed to have part with all pleasant and gracious things  he stopped and his face was downcast and hidden  then he looked up at me and went on making no further attempt to disguise his absolute belief in the reality of his story  you see i had thrown up my plans and ambitions thrown up all i had ever worked for or desired for her sake  i had been a master man away there in the north with influence and property and a great reputation but none of it had seemed worth having beside her  i had come to the place this city of sunny pleasures with her and left all those things to wreck and ruin just to save a remnant at least of my life  while i had been in love with her before i knew that she had any care for me before i had imagined that she would darethat we should dare all my life had seemed vain and hollow dust and ashes  it was dust and ashes  night after night and through the long days i had longed and desiredmy soul had beaten against the thing forbidden  but it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things  its emotion its a tint a light that comes and goes only while its there everything changes everything  the thing is i came away and left them in their crisis to do what they could  left whom i asked puzzled  the people up in the north there  you seein this dream anyhowi had been a big man the sort of man men come to trust in to group themselves about  millions of men who had never seen me were ready to do things and risk things because of their confidence in me  i had been playing that game for years that big laborious game that vague monstrous political game amidst intrigues and betrayals speech and agitation  it was a vast weltering world and at last i had a sort of leadership against the gangyou know it was called the ganga sort of compromise of scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast public emotional stupidities and catchwordsthe gang that kept the world noisy and blind year by year and all the while that it was drifting drifting towards infinite disaster  but i cant expect you to understand the shades and complications of the yearthe year something or other ahead i had it alldown to the smallest detailsin my dream  i suppose i had been dreaming of it before i awoke and the fading outline of some queer new development i had imagined still hung about me as i rubbed my eyes  it was some grubby affair that made me thank god for the sunlight  i sat up on the couch and remained looking at the woman and rejoicingrejoicing that i had come away out of all that tumult and folly and violence before it was too late  after all i thought this is lifelove and beauty desire and delight are they not worth all those dismal struggles for vague gigantic ends  and i blamed myself for having ever sought to be a leader when i might have given my days to love  but then thought i if i had not spent my early days sternly and austerely i might have wasted myself upon vain and worthless women and at the thought all my being went out in love and tenderness to my dear mistress my dear lady who had come at last and compelled mecompelled me by her invincible charm for meto lay that life aside  you are worth it i said speaking without intending her to hear you are worth it my dearest one worth pride and praise and all things  love to have you is worth them all together  and at the murmur of my voice she turned about  come and see she criedi can hear her nowcome and see the sunrise upon monte solaro  i remember how i sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony  she put a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of limestone flushing as it were into life  i looked  but first i noted the sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck  how can i describe to you the scene we had before us  we were at capri  i have been there i said  i have clambered up monte solaro and drunk vero caprimuddy stuff like ciderat the summit  ah said the man with the white face then perhaps you can tell meyou will know if this is indeed capri  for in this life i have never been there  let me describe it  we were in a little room one of a vast multitude of little rooms very cool and sunny hollowed out of the limestone of a sort of cape very high above the sea  the whole island you know was one enormous hotel complex beyond explaining and on the other side there were miles of floating hotels and huge floating stages to which the flying machines came  they called it a pleasure city  of course there was none of that in your timerather i should say is none of that now  of course  nowyes  well this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape so that one could see east and west  eastward was a great cliffa thousand feet high perhapscoldly gray except for one bright edge of gold and beyond it the isle of the sirens and a falling coast that faded and passed into the hot sunrise  and when one turned to the west distinct and near was a little bay a little beach still in shadow  and out of that shadow rose solaro straight and tall flushed and golden crested like a beauty throned and the white moon was floating behind her in the sky  and before us from east to west stretched the manytinted sea all dotted with little sailing boats  to the eastward of course these little boats were gray and very minute and clear but to the westward they were little boats of goldshining goldalmost like little flames  and just below us was a rock with an arch worn through it  the blue seawater broke to green and foam all round the rock and a galley came gliding out of the arch  i know that rock  i said  i was nearly drowned there  it is called the faraglioni  i faraglioni  yes she called it that answered the man with the white face  there was some storybut that  he put his hand to his forehead again  no he said i forget that story  well that is the first thing i remember the first dream i had that little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of mine with her shining arms and her graceful robe and how we sat and talked in half whispers to one another  we talked in whispers not because there was any one to hear but because there was still such a freshness of mind between us that our thoughts were a little frightened i think to find themselves at last in words  and so they went softly  presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment going by a strange passage with a moving floor until we came to the great breakfast roomthere was a fountain and music  a pleasant and joyful place it was with its sunlight and splashing and the murmur of plucked strings  and we sat and ate and smiled at one another and i would not heed a man who was watching me from a table near by  and afterwards we went on to the dancinghall  but i cannot describe that hall  the place was enormouslarger than any building you have ever seenand in one place there was the old gate of capri caught into the wall of a gallery high overhead light girders stems and threads of gold burst from the pillars like fountains streamed like an aurora across the roof and interlaced likelike conjuring tricks  all about the great circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures strange dragons and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights the place was inundated with artificial light that shamed the newborn day  and as we went through the throng the people turned about and looked at us for all through the world my name and face were known and how i had suddenly thrown up pride and struggle to come to this place  and they looked also at the lady beside me though half the story of how at last she had come to me was unknown or mistold  and few of the men who were there i know but judged me a happy man in spite of all the shame and dishonour that had come upon my name  the air was full of music full of harmonious scents full of the rhythm of beautiful motions  thousands of beautiful people swarmed about the hall crowded the galleries sat in a myriad recesses they were dressed in splendid colours and crowned with flowers thousands danced about the great circle beneath the white images of the ancient gods and glorious processions of youths and maidens came and went  we two danced not the dreary monotonies of your daysof this time i meanbut dances that were beautiful intoxicating  and even now i can see my lady dancingdancing joyously  she danced you know with a serious face she danced with a serious dignity and yet she was smiling at me and caressing mesmiling and caressing with her eyes  the music was different he murmured  it wenti cannot describe it but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has ever come to me awake  and thenit was when we had done dancinga man came to speak to me  he was a lean resolute man very soberly clad for that place and already i had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall and afterwards as we went along the passage i had avoided his eye  but now as we sat in a little alcove smiling at the pleasure of all the people who went to and fro across the shining floor he came and touched me and spoke to me so that i was forced to listen  and he asked that he might speak to me for a little time apart  no i said  i have no secrets from this lady  what do you want to tell me  he said it was a trivial matter or at least a dry matter for a lady to hear  perhaps for me to hear said i  he glanced at her as though almost he would appeal to her then he asked me suddenly if i had heard of a great and avenging declaration that evesham had made  now evesham had always before been the man next to myself in the leadership of that great party in the north  he was a forcible hard and tactless man and only i had been able to control and soften him  it was on his account even more than my own i think that the others had been so dismayed at my retreat  so this question about what he had done reawakened my old interest in the life i had put aside just for a moment  i have taken no heed of any news for many days i said what has evesham been saying  and with that the man began nothing loth and i must confess even i was struck by eveshams reckless folly in the wild and threatening words he had used  and this messenger they had sent to me not only told me of eveshams speech but went on to ask counsel and to point out what need they had of me  while he talked my lady sat a little forward and watched his face and mine  my old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves  i could even see myself suddenly returning to the north and all the dramatic effect of it  all that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the party indeed but not to its damage  i should go back stronger than i had come  and then i thought of my lady  you seehow can i tell you  there were certain peculiarities of our relationshipas things are i need not tell you about thatwhich would render her presence with me impossible  i should have had to leave her indeed i should have had to renounce her clearly and openly if i was to do all that i could do in the north  and the man knew that even as he talked to her and me knew it as well as she did that my steps to duty werefirst separation then abandonment  at the touch of that thought my dream of a return was shattered  i turned on the man suddenly as he was imagining his eloquence was gaining ground with me  what have i to do with these things now i said  i have done with them  do you think i am coquetting with your people in coming here  no he said  but  why  cannot you leave me alone  i have done with these things  i have ceased to be anything but a private man  yes he answered  but have you thoughtthis talk of war these reckless challenges these wild aggressions  i stood up  no i cried  i wont hear you  i took count of all those things i weighed themand i have come away  he seemed to consider the possibility of persistence  he looked from me to where the lady sat regarding us  war he said as if he were speaking to himself and then turned slowly from me and walked away  i stood caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set going  i heard my ladys voice  dear she said but if they had need of you  she did not finish her sentence she let it rest there  i turned to her sweet face and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled  they want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves i said  if they distrust evesham they must settle with him themselves  she looked at me doubtfully  but war she said  i saw a doubt on her face that i had seen before a doubt of herself and me the first shadow of the discovery that seen strongly and completely must drive us apart for ever  now i was an older mind than hers and i could sway her to this belief or that  my dear one i said you must not trouble over these things  there will be no war  certainly there will be no war the age of wars is past  trust me to know the justice of this case  they have no right upon me dearest and no one has a right upon me  i have been free to choose my life and i have chosen this  but war she said  i sat down beside her  i put an arm behind her and took her hand in mine  i set myself to drive that doubt awayi set myself to fill her mind with pleasant things again  i lied to her and in lying to her i lied also to myself  and she was only too ready to believe me only too ready to forget  very soon the shadow had gone again and we were hastening to our bathingplace in the grotta del bovo marino where it was our custom to bathe every day  we swam and splashed one another and in that buoyant water i seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man  and at last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks  and then i put on a dry bathingdress and we sat to bask in the sun and presently i nodded resting my head against her knee and she put her hand upon my hair and stroked it softly and i dozed  and behold as it were with the snapping of the string of a violin i was awakening and i was in my own bed in liverpool in the life of today  only for a time i could not believe that all these vivid moments had been no more than the substance of a dream  in truth i could not believe it a dream for all the sobering reality of things about me  i bathed and dressed as it were by habit and as i shaved i argued why i of all men should leave the woman i loved to go back to fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north  even if evesham did force the world back to war what was that to me  i was a man with the heart of a man and why should i feel the responsibility of a deity for the way the world might go  you know that is not quite the way i think about affairs about my real affairs  i am a solicitor you know with a point of view  the vision was so real you must understand so utterly unlike a dream that i kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details even the ornament of the bookcover that lay on my wifes sewingmachine in the breakfastroom recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran about the seat in the alcove where i had talked with the messenger from my deserted party  have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality like that  like  so that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten  i thought  i had never noticed the point before but he was right  never i said  that is what you never seem to do with dreams  no he answered  but that is just what i did  i am a solicitor you must understand in liverpool and i could not help wondering what the clients and business people i found myself talking to in my office would think if i told them suddenly i was in love with a girl who would be born a couple of hundred years or so hence and worried about the politics of my greatgreatgreatgrandchildren  i was chiefly busy that day negotiating a ninetynineyear building lease it was a private builder in a hurry and we wanted to tie him in every possible way  i had an interview with him and he showed a certain want of temper that sent me to bed still irritated  that night i had no dream  nor did i dream the next night at least to remember  something of that intense reality of conviction vanished  i began to feel sure it was a dream  and then it came again  when the dream came again nearly four days later it was very different  i think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the dream  many things had happened in the north and the shadow of them was back again between us and this time it was not so easily dispelled  i began i know with moody musings  why in spite of all should i go back go back for all the rest of my days to toil and stress insults and perpetual dissatisfaction simply to save hundreds of millions of common people whom i did not love whom too often i could do no other than despise from the stress and anguish of war and infinite misrule  and after all i might fail  they all sought their own narrow ends and why should not iwhy should not i also live as a man  and out of such thoughts her voice summoned me and i lifted my eyes  i found myself awake and walking  we had come out above the pleasure city we were near the summit of monte solaro and looking towards the bay  it was the late afternoon and very clear  far away to the left ischia hung in a golden haze between sea and sky and naples was coldly white against the hills and before us was vesuvius with a tall and slender streamer feathering at last towards the south and the ruins of torre dell annunziata and castellammare glittering and near  i interrupted suddenly you have been to capri of course  only in this dream he said only in this dream  all across the bay beyond sorrento were the floating palaces of the pleasure city moored and chained  and northward were the broad floating stages that received the aeroplanes  aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon each bringing its thousands of pleasureseekers from the uttermost parts of the earth to capri and its delights  all these things i say stretched below  but we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that evening had to show  five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered useless in the distant arsenals of the rhinemouth were manoeuvring now in the eastward sky  evesham had astonished the world by producing them and others and sending them to circle here and there  it was the threat material in the great game of bluff he was playing and it had taken even me by surprise  he was one of those incredibly stupid energetic people who seem sent by heaven to create disasters  his energy to the first glance seemed so wonderfully like capacity  but he had no imagination no invention only a stupid vast driving force of will and a mad faith in his stupid idiot luck to pull him through  i remember how we stood upon the headland watching the squadron circling far away and how i weighed the full meaning of the sight seeing clearly the way things must go  and then even it was not too late i might have gone back i think and saved the world  the people of the north would follow me i knew granted only that in one thing i respected their moral standards  the east and south would trust me as they would trust no other northern man  and i knew i had only to put it to her and she would have let me go     not because she did not love me  only i did not want to go my will was all the other way about  i had so newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility i was still so fresh a renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what i ought to do had no power at all to touch my will  my will was to live to gather pleasures and make my dear lady happy but though this sense of vast neglected duties had no power to draw me it could make me silent and preoccupied it robbed the days i had spent of half their brightness and roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night  and as i stood and watched eveshams aeroplanes sweep to and frothose birds of infinite ill omenshe stood beside me watching me perceiving the trouble indeed but not perceiving it clearlyher eyes questioning my face her expression shaded with perplexity  her face was gray because the sunset was fading out of the sky  it was no fault of hers that she held me  she had asked me to go from her and again in the night time and with tears she had asked me to go  at last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood i turned upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes  no she said as if i had jarred with her gravity but i was resolved to end that gravity and make her runno one can be very gray and sad who is out of breathand when she stumbled i ran with my hand beneath her arm  we ran down past a couple of men who turned back staring in astonishment at my behaviourthey must have recognised my face  and half way down the slope came a tumult in the air clangclank clangclank and we stopped and presently over the hillcrest those war things came flying one behind the other  the man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description  what were they like i asked  they had never fought he said  they were just like our ironclads are nowadays they had never fought  no one knew what they might do with excited men inside them few even cared to speculate  they were great driving things shaped like spearheads without a shaft with a propeller in the place of the shaft  steel  not steel  aluminum  no no nothing of that sort  an alloy that was very commonas common as brass for example  it was calledlet me see  he squeezed his forehead with the fingers of one hand  i am forgetting everything he said  and they carried guns  little guns firing high explosive shells  they fired the guns backwards out of the base of the leaf so to speak and rammed with the beak  that was the theory you know but they had never been fought  no one could tell exactly what was going to happen  and meanwhile i suppose it was very fine to go whirling through the air like a flight of young swallows swift and easy i guess the captains tried not to think too clearly what the real thing would be like  and these flying war machines you know were only one sort of the endless war contrivances that had been invented and had fallen into abeyance during the long peace  there were all sorts of these things that people were routing out and furbishing up infernal things silly things things that had never been tried big engines terrible explosives great guns  you know the silly way of these ingenious sort of men who make these things they turn em out as beavers build dams and with no more sense of the rivers theyre going to divert and the lands theyre going to flood  as we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again in the twilight i foresaw it all i saw how clearly and inevitably things were driving for war in eveshams silly violent hands and i had some inkling of what war was bound to be under these new conditions  and even then though i knew it was drawing near the limit of my opportunity i could find no will to go back  he sighed  that was my last chance  we didnt go into the city until the sky was full of stars so we walked out upon the high terrace to and fro andshe counselled me to go back  my dearest she said and her sweet face looked up to me this is death  this life you lead is death  go back to them go back to your duty  she began to weep saying between her sobs and clinging to my arm as she said it go backgo back  then suddenly she fell mute and glancing down at her face i read in an instant the thing she had thought to do  it was one of those moments when one sees  no i said  no she asked in surprise and i think a little fearful at the answer to her thought  nothing i said shall send me back  nothing  i have chosen  love i have chosen and the world must go  whatever happens i will live this lifei will live for you  itnothing shall turn me aside nothing my dear one  even if you diedeven if you died  yes she murmured softly  theni also would die  and before she could speak again i began to talk talking eloquentlyas i could do in that lifetalking to exalt love to make the life we were living seem heroic and glorious and the thing i was deserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing to set aside  i bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it seeking not only to convert her but myself to that  we talked and she clung to me torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet  and at last i did make it heroic made all the thickening disaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at last clad in that splendid delusion drunken rather with that glorious delusion under the still stars  and so my moment passed  it was my last chance  even as we went to and fro there the leaders of the south and east were gathering their resolve and the hot answer that shattered eveshams bluffing for ever took shape and waited  and all over asia and the ocean and the south the air and the wires were throbbing with their warnings to prepareprepare  no one living you know knew what war was no one could imagine with all these new inventions what horror war might bring  i believe most people still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and shouting charges and triumphs and flags and bandsin a time when half the world drew its food supply from regions ten thousand miles away  the man with the white face paused  i glanced at him and his face was intent on the floor of the carriage  a little railway station a string of loaded trucks a signalbox and the back of a cottage shot by the carriage window and a bridge passed with a clap of noise echoing the tumult of the train  after that he said i dreamt often  for three weeks of nights that dream was my life  and the worst of it was there were nights when i could not dream when i lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life and theresomewhere lost to methings were happeningmomentous terrible things    i lived at nightsmy days my waking days this life i am living now became a faded faraway dream a drab setting the cover of the book  he thought  i could tell you all tell you every little thing in the dream but as to what i did in the daytimeno  i could not telli do not remember  my memorymy memory has gone  the business of life slips from me  he leant forward and pressed his hands upon his eyes  for a long time he said nothing  and then said i  the war burst like a hurricane  he stared before him at unspeakable things  and then i urged again  one touch of unreality he said in the low tone of a man who speaks to himself and they would have been nightmares but they were not nightmaresthey were not nightmares  no  he was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger of losing the rest of the story  but he went on talking again in the same tone of questioning selfcommunion  what was there to do but flight  i had not thought the war would touch caprii had seemed to see capri as being out of it all as the contrast to it all but two nights after the whole place was shouting and bawling every woman almost and every other man wore a badgeeveshams badgeand there was no music but a jangling warsong over and over again and everywhere men enlisting and in the dancing halls they were drilling  the whole island was awhirl with rumours it was said again and again that fighting had begun  i had not expected this  i had seen so little of the life of pleasure that i had failed to reckon with this violence of the amateurs  and as for me i was out of it  i was like the man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine the time had gone  i was no one the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more than i  the crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears that accursed song deafened us a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her and we two went back to our own place again ruffled and insultedmy lady white and silent and i aquiver with rage  so furious was i i could have quarrelled with her if i could have found one shade of accusation in her eyes  all my magnificence had gone from me  i walked up and down our rock cell and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that flared and passed and came again  we must get out of this place i said over and over  i have made my choice and i will have no hand in these troubles  i will have nothing of this war  we have taken our lives out of all these things  this is no refuge for us  let us go  and the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered the world  and all the rest was flightall the rest was flight  he mused darkly  how much was there of it  he made no answer  how many days  his face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched  he took no heed of my curiosity  i tried to draw him back to his story with questions  where did you go i said  when  when you left capri  southwest he said and glanced at me for a second  we went in a boat  but i should have thought an aeroplane  they had been seized  i questioned him no more  presently i thought he was beginning again  he broke out in an argumentative monotone  but why should it be  if indeed this battle this slaughter and stress is life why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty  if there is no refuge if there is no place of peace and if all our dreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare why have we such dreams  surely it was no ignoble cravings no base intentions had brought us to this it was love had isolated us love had come to me with her eyes and robed in her beauty more glorious than all else in life in the very shape and colour of life and summoned me away  i had silenced all the voices i had answered all the questionsi had come to her  and suddenly there was nothing but war and death  i had an inspiration  after all i said it could have been only a dream  a dream he cried flaming upon me a dreamwhen even now  for the first time he became animated  a faint flush crept into his cheek  he raised his open hand and clenched it and dropped it to his knee  he spoke looking away from me and for all the rest of the time he looked away  we are but phantoms he said and the phantoms of phantoms desires like cloudshadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind the days pass use and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of its lightsso be it  but one thing is real and certain one thing is no dreamstuff but eternal and enduring  it is the centre of my life and all other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain  i loved her that woman of a dream  and she and i are dead together  a dream  how can it be a dream when it drenched a living life with unappeasable sorrow when it makes all that i have lived for and cared for worthless and unmeaning  until that very moment when she was killed i believed we had still a chance of getting away he said  all through the night and morning that we sailed across the sea from capri to salerno we talked of escape  we were full of hope and it clung about us to the end hope for the life together we should lead out of it all out of the battle and struggle the wild and empty passions the empty arbitrary thou shalt and thou shalt not of the world  we were uplifted as though our quest was a holy thing as though love for another was a mission      even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock caprialready scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and hidingplaces that were to make it a fastnesswe reckoned nothing of the imminent slaughter though the fury of preparation hung about in the puffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amidst the gray but indeed i made a text of that and talked  there you know was the rock still beautiful for all its scars with its countless windows and arches and ways tier upon tier for a thousand feet a vast carving of gray broken by vineclad terraces and lemon and orange groves and masses of agave and prickly pear and puffs of almond blossom  and out under the archway that is built over the piccola marina other boats were coming and as we came round the cape and within sight of the mainland another little string of boats came into view driving before the wind towards the southwest  in a little while a multitude had come out the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the eastward cliff  it is love and reason i said fleeing from all this madness of war  and though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the southern sky we did not heed it  there it wasa line of little dots in the skyand then more dotting the southeastern horizon and then still more until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks  now they were all thin little strokes of blue and now one and now a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of light  they came rising and falling and growing larger like some huge flight of gulls or rooks or suchlike birds moving with a marvellous uniformity and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky  the southward wind flung itself in an arrowheaded cloud athwart the sun  and then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed eastward growing smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until they vanished from the sky  and after that we noted to the northward and very high eveshams fighting machines hanging high over naples like an evening swarm of gnats  it seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds  even the mutter of guns far away in the southeast seemed to us to signify nothing     each day each dream after that we were still exalted still seeking that refuge where we might live and love  fatigue had come upon us pain and many distresses  for though we were dusty and stained by our toilsome tramping and half starved and with the horror of the dead men we had seen and the flight of the peasantsfor very soon a gust of fighting swept up the peninsulawith these things haunting our minds it still resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape  oh but she was brave and patient  she who had never faced hardship and exposure had courage for herself and me  we went to and fro seeking an outlet over a country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of war  always we went on foot  at first there were other fugitives but we did not mingle with them  some escaped northward some were caught in the torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads many gave themselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward  many of the men were impressed but we kept away from these things we had brought no money to bribe a passage north and i feared for my lady at the hands of these conscript crowds  we had landed at salerno and we had been turned back from cava and we had tried to cross towards taranto by a pass over mount alburno but we had been driven back for want of food and so we had come down among the marshes by paestum where those great temples stand alone  i had some vague idea that by paestum it might be possible to find a boat or something and take once more to sea  and there it was the battle overtook us  a sort of soulblindness had me  plainly i could see that we were being hemmed in that the great net of that giant warfare had us in its toils  many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north going to and fro and had come upon them in the distance amidst the mountains making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of the guns  once we fancied they had fired at us taking us for spiesat any rate a shot had gone shuddering over us  several times we had hidden in woods from hovering aeroplanes  but all these things do not matter now these nights of flight and pain     we were in an open place near those great temples at paestum at last on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes empty and desolate and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its stems  how i can see it  my lady was sitting down under a bush resting a little for she was very weak and weary and i was standing up watching to see if i could tell the distance of the firing that came and went they were still you know fighting far from each other with those terrible new weapons that had never before been used guns that would carry beyond sight and aeroplanes that would dowhat they would do no man could foretell  i knew that we were between the two armies and that they drew together  i knew we were in danger and that we could not stop there and rest  though all these things were in my mind they were in the background  they seemed to be affairs beyond our concern chiefly i was thinking of my lady  an aching distress filled me for the first time she had owned herself beaten and had fallen aweeping  behind me i could hear her sobbing but i would not turn round to her because i knew she had need of weeping and had held herself so far and so long for me  it was well i thought that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on again for i had no inkling of the thing that hung so near  even now i can see her as she sat there her lovely hair upon her shoulder can mark again the deepening hollow of her cheek  if we had parted she said if i had let you go  no said i  even now i do not repent  i will not repent i made my choice and i will hold on to the end  and then  overhead in the sky flashed something and burst and all about us i heard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown  they chipped the stones about us and whirled fragments from the bricks and passed      he put his hand to his mouth and then moistened his lips  at the flash i had turned about     you knowshe stood up  she stood up you know and moved a step towards meas though she wanted to reach me  and she had been shot through the heart  he stopped and stared at me  i felt all that foolish incapacity an englishman feels on such occasions  i met his eyes for a moment and then stared out of the window  for a long space we kept silence  when at last i looked at him he was sitting back in his corner his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles  he bit his nail suddenly and stared at it  i carried her he said towards the temples in my armsas though it mattered  i dont know why  they seemed a sort of sanctuary you know they had lasted so long i suppose  she must have died almost instantly  onlyi talked to her all the way  silence again  i have seen those temples i said abruptly and indeed he had brought those still sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me  it was the brown one the big brown one  i sat down on a fallen pillar and held her in my arms    silent after the first babble was over  and after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again as though nothing unusual was going on as though nothing had changed     it was tremendously still there the sun high and the shadows still even the shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were stillin spite of the thudding and banging that went all about the sky  i seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south and that the battle went away to the west  one aeroplane was struck and overset and fell  i remember thatthough it didnt interest me in the least  it didnt seem to signify  it was like a wounded gull you knowflapping for a time in the water  i could see it down the aisle of the templea black thing in the bright blue water  three or four times shells burst about the beach and then that ceased  each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space  that was all the mischief done except that once a stray bullet gashed the stone hard bymade just a fresh bright surface  as the shadows grew longer the stillness seemed greater  the curious thing he remarked with the manner of a man who makes a trivial conversation is that i didnt thinkat all  i sat with her in my arms amidst the stonesin a sort of lethargystagnant  and i dont remember waking up  i dont remember dressing that day  i know i found myself in my office with my letters all slit open in front of me and how i was struck by the absurdity of being there seeing that in reality i was sitting stunned in that paestum temple with a dead woman in my arms  i read my letters like a machine  i have forgotten what they were about  he stopped and there was a long silence  suddenly i perceived that we were running down the incline from chalk farm to euston  i started at this passing of time  i turned on him with a brutal question with the tone of now or never  and did you dream again  yes  he seemed to force himself to finish  his voice was very low  once more and as it were only for a few instants  i seemed to have suddenly awakened out of a great apathy to have risen into a sitting position and the body lay there on the stones beside me a gaunt body  not her you know  so soonit was not her      i may have heard voices  i do not know  only i knew clearly that men were coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage  i stood up and walked through the temple and then there came into sightfirst one man with a yellow face dressed in a uniform of dirty white trimmed with blue and then several climbing to the crest of the old wall of the vanished city and crouching there  they were little bright figures in the sunlight and there they hung weapon in hand peering cautiously before them  and further away i saw others and then more at another point in the wall  it was a long lax line of men in open order  presently the man i had first seen stood up and shouted a command and his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the temple  he scrambled down with them and led them  he came facing towards me and when he saw me he stopped  at first i had watched these men with a mere curiosity but when i had seen they meant to come to the temple i was moved to forbid them  i shouted to the officer  you must not come here i cried i am here  i am here with my dead  he stared and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown tongue  i repeated what i had said  he shouted again and i folded my arms and stood still presently he spoke to his men and came forward  he carried a drawn sword  i signed to him to keep away but he continued to advance i told him again very patiently and clearly you must not come here  these are old temples and i am here with my dead  presently he was so close i could see his face clearly  it was a narrow face with dull gray eyes and a black moustache  he had a scar on his upper lip and he was dirty and unshaven  he kept shouting unintelligible things questions perhaps at me  i know now that he was afraid of me but at the time that did not occur to me  as i tried to explain to him he interrupted me in imperious tones bidding me i suppose stand aside  he made to go past me and i caught hold of him  i saw his face change at my grip  you fool i cried  dont you know  she is dead  he started back  he looked at me with cruel eyes  i saw a sort of exultant resolve leap into themdelight  then suddenly with a scowl he swept his sword backsoand thrust  he stopped abruptly  i became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train  the brakes lifted their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked this present world insisted upon itself became clamourous  i saw through the steamy window huge electric fights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog saw rows of stationary empty carriages passing by and then a signalbox hoisting its constellation of green and red into the murky london twilight marched after them i looked again at his drawn features  he ran me through the heart  it was with a sort of astonishmentno fear no painbut just amazement that i felt it pierce me felt the sword drive home into my body  it didnt hurt you know  it didnt hurt at all  the yellow platform lights came into the field of view passing first rapidly then slowly and at last stopping with a jerk  dim shapes of men passed to and fro without  euston cried a voice  do you mean  there was no pain no sting or smart  amazement and then darkness sweeping over everything  the hot brutal face before me the face of the man who had killed me seemed to recede  it swept out of existence  euston clamoured the voices outside euston  the carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound and a porter stood regarding us  the sounds of doors slamming and the hoofclatter of cabhorses and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the london cobblestones came to my ears  a truckload of lighted lamps blazed along the platform  a darkness a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out all things  any luggage sir said the porter  and that was the end i asked  he seemed to hesitate  then almost inaudibly he answered no  you mean  i couldnt get to her she was there on the other side of the temple and then  yes i insisted  yes  nightmares he cried nightmares indeed  my god  great birds that fought and tore     the cone  the night was hot and overcast the sky red rimmed with the lingering sunset of midsummer  they sat at the open window trying to fancy the air was fresher there  the trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark beyond in the roadway a gaslamp burnt bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening farther were the three lights of the railway signal against the lowering sky  the man and woman spoke to one another in low tones  he does not suspect said the man a little nervously  not he she said peevishly as though that too irritated her  he thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel he has no imagination no poetry  none of these men of iron have he said sententiously they have no hearts  he has not she said  she turned her discontented face towards the window  the distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew in volume the house quivered one heard the metallic rattle of the tender  as the train passed there was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult of smoke one two three four five six seven eight black oblongseight truckspassed across the dim grey of the embankment and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the tunnel which with the last seemed to swallow down train smoke and sound in one abrupt gulp  this country was all fresh and beautiful once he said and nowit is gehenna  down that waynothing but potbanks and chimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heaven      but what does it matter  an end comes an end to all this cruelty      tomorrow  he spoke the last word in a whisper  tomorrow she said speaking in a whisper too and still staring out of the window  dear he said putting his hand on hers  she turned with a start and their eyes searched one anothers  hers softened to his gaze  my dear one she said and then it seems so strangethat you should have come into my life like thisto open  she paused  to open he said  all this wonderful world she hesitated and spoke still more softlythis world of love to me  then suddenly the door clicked and closed  they turned their heads and he started violently back  in the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy figuresilent  they saw the face dimly in the halflight with unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows  every muscle in rauts body suddenly became tense  when could the door have opened  what had he heard  had he heard all what had he seen  a tumult of questions  the newcomers voice came at last after a pause that seemed interminable  well he said  i was afraid i had missed you horrocks said the man at the window gripping the windowledge with his hand  his voice was unsteady  the clumsy figure of horrocks came forward out of the shadow he made no answer to rauts remark  for a moment he stood above them  the womans heart was cold within her  i told mr raut it was just possible you might come back she said in a voice that never quivered  horrocks still silent sat down abruptly in the chair by her little worktable  his big hands were clenched one saw now the fire of his eyes under the shadow of his brows  he was trying to get his breath  his eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted and then back to the woman  by this time and for the moment all three half understood one another  yet none dared say a word to ease the pentup things that choked them  it was the husbands voice that broke the silence at last  you wanted to see me he said to raut  raut started as he spoke  i came to see you he said resolved to lie to the last  yes said horrocks  you promised said raut to show me some fine effects of moonlight and smoke  i promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke repeated horrocks in a colourless voice  and i thought i might catch you tonight before you went down to the works proceeded raut and come with you  there was another pause  did the man mean to take the thing coolly  did he after all know  how long had he been in the room yet even at the moment when they heard the door their attitudes    horrocks glanced at the profile of the woman shadowy pallid in the halflight  then he glanced at raut and seemed to recover himself suddenly  of course he said i promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic conditions  its odd how i could have forgotten  if i am troubling you began raut  horrocks started again  a new light had suddenly come into the sultry gloom of his eyes  not in the least he said  have you been telling mr raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow you think so splendid said the woman turning now to her husband for the first time her confidence creeping back again her voice just one halfnote too high  that dreadful theory of yours that machinery is beautiful and everything else in the world ugly  i thought he would not spare you mr raut  its his great theory his one discovery in art  i am slow to make discoveries said horrocks grimly damping her suddenly  but what i discover       he stopped  well she said  nothing and suddenly he rose to his feet  i promised to show you the works he said to raut and put his big clumsy hand on his friends shoulder  and you are ready to go  quite said raut and stood up also  there was another pause  each of them peered through the indistinctness of the dusk at the other two  horrocks hand still rested on rauts shoulder  raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial after all  but mrs horrocks knew her husband better knew that grim quiet in his voice and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical evil  very well said horrocks and dropping his hand turned towards the door  my hat  raut looked round in the halflight  thats my workbasket said mrs horrocks with a gust of hysterical laughter  their hands came together on the back of the chair  here it is he said  she had an impulse to warn him in an undertone but she could not frame a word  dont go and beware of him struggled in her mind and the swift moment passed  got it said horrocks standing with the door half open  raut stepped towards him  better say goodbye to mrs horrocks said the ironmaster even more grimly quiet in his tone than before  raut started and turned  goodevening mrs horrocks he said and their hands touched  horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him towards men  raut went out and then after a wordless look at her her husband followed  she stood motionless while rauts light footfall and her husbands heavy tread like bass and treble passed down the passage together  the front door slammed heavily  she went to the window moving slowly and stood watchingleaning forward  the two men appeared for a moment at the gateway in the road passed under the street lamp and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery  the lamplight fell for a moment on their faces showing only unmeaning pale patches telling nothing of what she still feared and doubted and craved vainly to know  then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big armchair her eyes wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky  an hour after she was still there her attitude scarcely changed  the oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon raut  they went side by side down the road in silence and in silence turned into the cindermade byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley  a blue haze half dust half mist touched the long valley with mystery  beyond were hanley and etruria grey and dark masses outlined thinly by the rare golden dots of the street lamps and here and there a gaslit window or the yellow glare of some lateworking factory or crowded publichouse  out of the masses clear and slender against the evening sky rose a multitude of tall chimneys many of them reeking a few smokeless during a season of play  here and there a pallid patch and ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a potbank or a wheel black and sharp against the hot lower sky marked some colliery where they raise the iridescent coal of the place  nearer at hand was the broad stretch of railway and half invisible trains shunteda steady puffing and rumbling with every run a ringing concussion and a rhythmic series of impacts and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam across the further view  and to the left between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond dominating the whole view colossal inkyblack and crowned with smoke and fitful flames stood the great cylinders of the jeddah company blast furnaces the central edifices of the big ironworks of which horrocks was the manager  they stood heavy and threatening full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron and about the feet of them rattled the rollingmills and the steam hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither  even as they looked a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants and the red flames gleamed out and a confusion of smoke and black dust came boiling upwards towards the sky  certainly you get some fine effects of colour with your furnaces said raut breaking a silence that had become apprehensive  horrocks grunted  he stood with his hands in his pockets frowning down at the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond frowning as if he were thinking out some knotty problem  raut glanced at him and away again  at present your moonlight effect is hardly ripe he continued looking upward the moon is still smothered by the vestiges of daylight  horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly awakened  vestiges of daylight     of course of course  he too looked up at the moon pale still in the midsummer sky  come along he said suddenly and gripping rauts arm in his hand made a move towards the path that dropped from them to the railway  raut hung back  their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that their eyes came near to say  horrocks hand tightened and then relaxed  he let go and before raut was aware of it they were arm in arm and walking one unwillingly enough down the path  you see the fine effect of the railway signals towards burslem said horrocks suddenly breaking into loquacity striding fast and tightening the grip of his elbow the while  little green lights and red and white lights all against the haze  you have an eye for effect raut  its a fine effect  and look at those furnaces of mine how they rise upon us as we come down the hill  that to the right is my petseventy feet of him  i packed him myself and hes boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts for five long years  ive a particular fancy for him  that line of red therea lovely bit of warm orange youd call it rautthats the puddlers furnaces and there in the hot light three black figuresdid you see the white splash of the steamhammer thenthats the rolling mills  come along clang clatter how it goes rattling across the floor  sheet tin rautamazing stuff  glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes from the mill  and squelchthere goes the hammer again come along  he had to stop talking to catch at his breath  his arm twisted into rauts with benumbing tightness  he had come striding down the black path towards the railway as though he was possessed raut had not spoken a word had simply hung back against horrocks pull with all his strength  i say he said now laughing nervously but with an undernote of snarl in his voice why on earth are you nipping my arm off horrocks and dragging me along like this  at length horrocks released him  his manner changed again nipping your arm off he said  sorry  but its you taught me the trick of walking in that friendly way  you havent learnt the refinements of it yet then said raut laughing artificially again  by jove  im black and blue horrocks offered no apology  they stood now near the bottom of the hill close to the fence that bordered the railway  the ironworks had grown larger and spread out with their approach  they looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of down the further view of etruria and hanley had dropped out of sight with their descent before them by the stile rose a noticeboard bearing still dimly visible the words beware of the trains half hidden by splashes of coaly mud  fine effects said horrocks waving his arm  here comes a train  the puffs of smoke the orange glare the round eye of light in front of it the melodious rattle  fine effects  but these furnaces of mine used to be finer before we shoved cones in their throats and saved the gas  how said raut  cones  cones my man cones  ill show you one nearer  the flames used to flare out of the open throats greatwhat is itpillars of cloud by day red and black smoke and pillars of fire by night now we run it off in pipes and burn it to heat the blast and the top is shut by a cone  youll be interested in that cone  but every now and then said raut you get a burst of fire and smoke up there  the cones not fixed its hung by a chain from a lever and balanced by an equipoise  you shall see it nearer  else of course thered be no way of getting fuel into the thing  every now and then the cone dips and out comes the flare  i see said raut  he looked over his shoulder  the moon gets brighter he said  come along said horrocks abruptly gripping his shoulder again and moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing  and then came one of those swift incidents vivid but so rapid that they leave one doubtful and reeling  halfway across horrocks hand suddenly clenched upon him like a vice and swung him backward and through a halfturn so that he looked up the line  and there a chain of lamplit carriagewindows telescoped swiftly as it came towards them and the red and yellow lights of an engine grew larger and larger rushing down upon them  as he grasped what this meant he turned his face to horrocks and pushed with all his strength against the arm that held him back between the rails the struggle did not last a moment  just as certain as it was that horrocks held him there so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of danger  out of the way said horrocks with a gasp as the train came rattling by and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks  i did not see it coming said raut still even in spite of his own apprehensions trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse  horrocks answered with a grunt  the cone he said and then as one who recovers himself i thought you did not hear  i didnt said raut  i wouldnt have had you run over then for the world said horrocks  for a moment i lost my nerve said raut  horrocks stood for half a minute then turned abruptly towards the ironworks again  see how fine these great mounds of mine these clinkerheaps look in the night  that truck yonder up above there  up it goes and outtilts the slag  see the palpitating red stuff go sliding down the slope  as we get nearer the heap rises up and cuts the blast furnaces  see the quiver up above the big one  not that way  this way between the heaps that goes to the puddling furnaces but i want to show you the canal first  he came and took raut by the elbow and so they went along side by side  raut answered horrocks vaguely  what he asked himself had really happened on the line  was he deluding himself with his own fancies or had horrocks actually held him back in the way of the train  had he just been within an ace of being murdered  suppose this slouching scowling monster did know anything for a minute or two then raut was really afraid for his life but the mood passed as he reasoned with himself  after all horrocks might have heard nothing  at any rate he had pulled him out of the way in time  his odd manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before  he was talking now of the ashheaps and the canal  eigh said horrocks  what said raut  rather  the haze in the moonlight fine  our canal said horrocks stopping suddenly  our canal by moonlight and firelight is an immense effect  youve never seen it  fancy that  youve spent too many of your evenings philandering up in newcastle there  i tell you for real florid effectsbut you shall see  boiling water     as they came out of the labyrinth of clinkerheaps and mounds of coal and ore the noises of the rollingmill sprang upon them suddenly loud near and distinct  three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to horrocks  their faces were vague in the darkness  raut felt a futile impulse to address them and before he could frame his words they passed into the shadows  horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now a weirdlooking place it seemed in the bloodred reflections of the furnaces  the hot water that cooled the tuyeres came into it some fifty yards upa tumultuous almost boiling affluent and the steam rose up from the water in silent white wisps and streaks wrapping damply about them an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red eddies a white uprising that made the head swim  the shining black tower of the larger blastfurnace rose overhead out of the mist and its tumultuous riot filled their ears  raut kept away from the edge of the water and watched horrocks  here it is red said horrocks bloodred vapour as red and hot as sin but yonder there where the moonlight falls on it and it drives across the clinkerheaps it is as white as death  raut turned his head for a moment and then came back hastily to his watch on horrocks  come along to the rollingmills said horrocks  the threatening hold was not so evident that time and raut felt a little reassured  but all the same what on earth did horrocks mean about white as death and red as sin coincidence perhaps  they went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while and then through the rollingmills where amidst an incessant din the deliberate steamhammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron and black halfnaked titans rushed the plastic bars like hot sealingwax between the wheels  come on said horrocks in rauts ear and they went and peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres and saw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blastfurnace  it left one eye blinded for a while  then with green and blue patches dancing across the dark they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime were raised to the top of the big cylinder  and out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace rauts doubts came upon him again  was it wise to be here  if horrocks did knoweverything  do what he would he could not resist a violent trembling  right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet  it was a dangerous place  they pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the place  the reek of the furnace a sulphurous vapor streaked with pungent bitterness seemed to make the distant hillside of hanley quiver  the moon was riding out now from among a drift of clouds halfway up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines of newcastle  the steaming canal ran away from below them under an indistinct bridge and vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields towards burslem  thats the cone ive been telling you of shouted horrocks and below that sixty feet of fire and molten metal with the air of the blast frothing through it like gas in sodawater  raut gripped the handrail tightly and stared down at the cone  the heat was intense  the boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a thunderous accompaniment to horrocks voice  but the thing had to be gone through now  perhaps after all     in the middle bawled horrocks temperature near a thousand degrees  if you were dropped into it     flash into flame like a pinch of gunpowder in a candle  put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath  why even up here ive seen the rainwater boiling off the trucks  and that cone there  its a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes  the top side of its three hundred degrees  three hundred degrees said raut  three hundred centigrade mind said horrocks  it will boil the blood out of you in no time  eigh said raut and turned  boil the blood out of you in    no you dont  let me go screamed raut  let go my arm  with one hand he clutched at the handrail then with both for a moment the two men stood swaying  then suddenly with a violent jerk horrocks had twisted him from his hold  he clutched at horrocks and missed his foot went back into empty air in midair he twisted himself and then cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together  he clutched the chain by which the cone hung and the thing sank an infinitesimal amount as he struck it  a circle of glowing red appeared about him and a tongue of flame released from the chaos within flickered up towards him  an intense pain assailed him at the knees and he could smell the singeing of his hands  he raised himself to his feet and tried to climb up the chain and then something struck his head  black and shining with the moonlight the throat of the furnace rose about him  horrocks he saw stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the rail  the gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight and shouting fizzle you fool  fizzle you hunter of women  you hotblooded hound  boil boil boil  suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck and flung it deliberately lump after lump at raut  horrocks cried raut  horrocks  he clung crying to the chain pulling himself up from the burning of the cone  each missile horrocks flung hit him  his clothes charred and glowed and as he struggled the cone dropped and a rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame  his human likeness departed from him  when the momentary red had passed horrocks saw a charred blackened figure its head streaked with blood still clutching and fumbling with the chain and writhing in agonya cindery animal an inhuman monstrous creature that began a sobbing intermittent shriek  abruptly at the sight the ironmasters anger passed  a deadly sickness came upon him  the heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his nostrils  his sanity returned to him  god have mercy upon me he cried  o god what have i done  he knew the thing below him save that it still moved and felt was already a dead manthat the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in his veins  an intense realisation of that agony came to his mind and overcame every other feeling  for a moment he stood irresolute and then turning to the truck he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling thing that had once been a man  the mass fell with a thud and went radiating over the cone with the thud the shriek ended and a boiling confusion of smoke dust and flame came rushing up towards him  as it passed he saw the cone clear again  then he staggered back and stood trembling clinging to the rail with both hands  his lips moved but no words came to them  down below was the sound of voices and running steps  the clangour of rolling in the shed ceased abruptly     a moonlight fable  there was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit of clothes  it was green and gold and woven so that i cannot describe how delicate and fine it was and there was a tie of orange fluffiness that tied up under his chin  and the buttons in their newness shone like stars  he was proud and pleased by his suit beyond measure and stood before the long lookingglass when first he put it on so astonished and delighted with it that he could hardly turn himself away  he wanted to wear it everywhere and show it to all sorts of people  he thought over all the places he had ever visited and all the scenes he had ever heard described and tried to imagine what the feel of it would be if he were to go now to those scenes and places wearing his shining suit and he wanted to go out forthwith into the long grass and the hot sunshine of the meadow wearing it just to wear it  but his mother told him no  she told him he must take great care of his suit for never would he have another nearly so fine he must save it and save it and only wear it on rare and great occasions  it was his wedding suit she said  and she took his buttons and twisted them up with tissue paper for fear their bright newness should be tarnished and she tacked little guards over the cuffs and elbows and wherever the suit was most likely to come to harm  he hated and resisted these things but what could he do  and at last her warnings and persuasions had effect and he consented to take off his beautiful suit and fold it into its proper creases and put it away  it was almost as though he gave it up again  but he was always thinking of wearing it and of the supreme occasion when some day it might be worn without the guards without the tissue paper on the buttons utterly and delightfully never caring beautiful beyond measure  one night when he was dreaming of it after his habit he dreamed he took the tissue paper from one of the buttons and found its brightness a little faded and that distressed him mightily in his dream  he polished the poor faded button and polished it and if anything it grew duller  he woke up and lay awake thinking of the brightness a little dulled and wondering how he would feel if perhaps when the great occasion whatever it might be should arrive one button should chance to be ever so little short of its first glittering freshness and for days and days that thought remained with him distressingly  and when next his mother let him wear his suit he was tempted and nearly gave way to the temptation just to fumble off one little bit of tissue paper and see if indeed the buttons were keeping as bright as ever  he went trimly along on his way to church full of this wild desire  for you must know his mother did with repeated and careful warnings let him wear his suit at times on sundays for example to and fro from church when there was no threatening of rain no dust nor anything to injure it with its buttons covered and its protections tacked upon it and a sunshade in his hand to shadow it if there seemed too strong a sunlight for its colours and always after such occasions he brushed it over and folded it exquisitely as she had taught him and put it away again  now all these restrictions his mother set to the wearing of his suit he obeyed always he obeyed them until one strange night he woke up and saw the moonlight shining outside his window  it seemed to him the moonlight was not common moonlight nor the night a common night and for a while he lay quite drowsily with this odd persuasion in his mind  thought joined on to thought like things that whisper warmly in the shadows  then he sat up in his little bed suddenly very alert with his heart beating very fast and a quiver in his body from top to toe  he had made up his mind  he knew now that he was going to wear his suit as it should be worn he had no doubt in the matter  he was afraid terribly afraid but glad glad  he got out of his bed and stood a moment by the window looking at the moonshineflooded garden and trembling at the thing he meant to do  the air was full of a minute clamor of crickets and murmurings of the infinitesimal shouting of little living things he went very gently across the creaking boards for fear that he might wake the sleeping house to the big dark clothespress wherein his beautiful suit lay folded and he took it out garment by garment and softly and very eagerly tore off its tissuepaper covering and its tacked protections until there it was perfect and delightful as he had seen it when first his mother had given it to hima long time it seemed ago  not a button had tarnished not a thread had faded on this dear suit of his he was glad enough for weeping as in a noiseless hurry he put it on  and then back he went soft and quick to the window and looked out upon the garden and stood there for a minute shining in the moonlight with his buttons twinkling like stars before he got out on the sill and making as little of a rustling as he could clambered down to the garden path below  he stood before his mothers house and it was white and nearly as plain as by day with every windowblind but his own shut like an eye that sleeps  the trees cast still shadows like intricate black lace upon the wall  the garden in the moonlight was very different from the garden by day moonshine was tangled in the hedges and stretched in phantom cobwebs from spray to spray  every flower was gleaming white or crimson black and the air was aquiver with the thridding of small crickets and nightingales singing unseen in the depths of the trees  there was no darkness in the world but only warm mysterious shadows and all the leaves and spikes were edged and lined with iridescent jewels of dew  the night was warmer than any night had ever been the heavens by some miracle at once vaster and nearer and spite of the great ivorytinted moon that ruled the world the sky was full of stars  the little man did not shout nor sing for all his infinite gladness  he stood for a time like one awestricken and then with a queer small cry and holding out his arms he ran out as if he would embrace at once the whole warm round immensity of the world  he did not follow the neat set paths that cut the garden squarely but thrust across the beds and through the wet tall scented herbs through the night stock and the nicotine and the clusters of phantom white mallow flowers and through the thickets of southernwood and lavender and kneedeep across a wide space of mignonette  he came to the great hedge and he thrust his way through it and though the thorns of the brambles scored him deeply and tore threads from his wonderful suit and though burs and goosegrass and havers caught and clung to him he did not care  he did not care for he knew it was all part of the wearing for which he had longed  i am glad i put on my suit he said i am glad i wore my suit  beyond the hedge he came to the duckpond or at least to what was the duckpond by day  but by night it was a great bowl of silver moonshine all noisy with singing frogs of wonderful silver moonshine twisted and clotted with strange patternings and the little man ran down into its waters between the thin black rushes kneedeep and waistdeep and to his shoulders smiting the water to black and shining wavelets with either hand swaying and shivering wavelets amid which the stars were netted in the tangled reflections of the brooding trees upon the bank  he waded until he swam and so he crossed the pond and came out upon the other side trailing as it seemed to him not duckweed but very silver in long clinging dripping masses  and up he went through the transfigured tangles of the willowherb and the uncut seeding grass of the farther bank  and so he came glad and breathless into the highroad  i am glad he said beyond measure that i had clothes that fitted this occasion  the highroad ran straight as an arrow flies straight into the deep blue pit of sky beneath the moon a white and shining road between the singing nightingales and along it he went running now and leaping and now walking and rejoicing in the clothes his mother had made for him with tireless loving hands  the road was deep in dust but that for him was only soft whiteness and as he went a great dim moth came fluttering round his wet and shimmering and hastening figure  at first he did not heed the moth and then he waved his hands at it and made a sort of dance with it as it circled round his head  soft moth he cried dear moth  and wonderful night wonderful night of the world  do you think my clothes are beautiful dear moth  as beautiful as your scales and all this silver vesture of the earth and sky  and the moth circled closer and closer until at last its velvet wings just brushed his lips       and next morning they found him dead with his neck broken in the bottom of the stone pit with his beautiful clothes a little bloody and foul and stained with the duckweed from the pond  but his face was a face of such happiness that had you seen it you would have understood indeed how that he had died happy never knowing the cool and streaming silver for the duckweed in the pond     the diamond maker  some business had detained me in chancery lane nine in the evening and thereafter having some inkling of a headache i was disinclined either for entertainment or further work  so much of the sky as the high cliffs of that narrow canon of traffic left visible spoke of a serene night and i determined to make my way down to the embankment and rest my eyes and cool my head by watching the variegated lights upon the river  beyond comparison the night is the best time for this place a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the waters and the lights of this transitional age red glaring orange gasyellow and electric white are set in shadowy outlines of every possible shade between grey and deep purple  through the arches of waterloo bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the embankment and above its parapet rise the towers of westminster warm grey against the starlight  the black river goes by with only a rare ripple breaking its silence and disturbing the reflections of the lights that swim upon its surface  a warm night said a voice at my side  i turned my head and saw the profile of a man who was leaning over the parapet beside me  it was a refined face not unhandsome though pinched and pale enough and the coat collar turned up and pinned round the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a uniform  i felt i was committed to the price of a bed and breakfast if i answered him  i looked at him curiously  would he have anything to tell me worth the money or was he the common incapableincapable even of telling his own story  there was a quality of intelligence in his forehead and eyes and a certain tremulousness in his nether lip that decided me  very warm said i but not too warm for us here  no he said still looking across the water it is pleasant enough here     just now  it is good he continued after a pause to find anything so restful as this in london  after one has been fretting about business all day about getting on meeting obligations and parrying dangers i do not know what one would do if it were not for such pacific corners  he spoke with long pauses between the sentences  you must know a little of the irksome labour of the world or you would not be here  but i doubt if you can be so brainweary and footsore as i am     bah  sometimes i doubt if the game is worth the candle  i feel inclined to throw the whole thing overname wealth and positionand take to some modest trade  but i know if i abandoned my ambitionhardly as she uses mei should have nothing but remorse left for the rest of my days  he became silent  i looked at him in astonishment  if ever i saw a man hopelessly hardup it was the man in front of me  he was ragged and he was dirty unshaven and unkempt he looked as though he had been left in a dustbin for a week  and he was talking to me of the irksome worries of a large business i almost laughed outright  either he was mad or playing a sorry jest on his own poverty  if high aims and high positions said i have their drawbacks of hard work and anxiety they have their compensations influence the power of doing good of assisting those weaker and poorer than ourselves and there is even a certain gratification in display        my banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste  i spoke on the spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech  i was sorry even while i was speaking  he turned a haggard but very composed face upon me  said he i forgot myself  of course you would not understand  he measured me for a moment  no doubt it is very absurd you will not believe me even when i tell you so that it is fairly safe to tell you  and it will be a comfort to tell someone  i really have a big business in hand a very big business  but there are troubles just now  the fact is     i make diamonds  i suppose said i you are out of work just at present  i am sick of being disbelieved he said impatiently and suddenly unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little canvas bag that was hanging by a cord round his neck  from this he produced a brown pebble  i wonder if you know enough to know what that is  he handed it to me  now a year or so ago i had occupied my leisure in taking a london science degree so that i have a smattering of physics and mineralogy  the thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort though far too large being almost as big as the top of my thumb  i took it and saw it had the form of a regular octahedron with the curved faces peculiar to the most precious of minerals  i took out my penknife and tried to scratch itvainly leaning forward towards the gaslamp i tried the thing on my watchglass and scored a white line across that with the greatest ease  i looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity  it certainly is rather like a diamond  but if so it is a behemoth of diamonds  where did you get it  i tell you i made it he said  give it back to me  he replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket  i will sell it you for one hundred pounds he suddenly whispered eagerly with that my suspicions returned  the thing might after all be merely a lump of that almost equally hard substance corundum with an accidental resemblance in shape to the diamond  or if it was a diamond how came he by it and why should he offer it at a hundred pounds  we looked into one anothers eyes  he seemed eager but honestly eager  at that moment i believed it was a diamond he was trying to sell  yet i am a poor man a hundred pounds would leave a visible gap in my fortunes and no sane man would buy a diamond by gaslight from a ragged tramp on his personal warranty only  still a diamond that size conjured up a vision of many thousands of pounds  then thought i such a stone could scarcely exist without being mentioned in every book on gems and again i called to mind the stories of contraband and lightfingered kaffirs at the cape i put the question of purchase on one side  how did you get it said i  i made it  i had heard something of moissan but i knew his artificial diamonds were very small  i shook my head  you seem to know something of this kind of thing  i will tell you a little about myself  perhaps then you may think better of the purchase  he turned round with his back to the river and put his hands in his pockets  he sighed  i know you will not believe me  diamonds he beganand as he spoke his voice lost its faint flavour of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an educated manare to be made by throwing carbon out of combination in a suitable flux and under a suitable pressure the carbon crystallises out not as blacklead or charcoalpowder but as small diamonds  so much has been known to chemists for years but no one yet had hit upon exactly the right flux in which to melt up the carbon or exactly the right pressure for the best results consequently the diamonds made by chemists are small and dark and worthless as jewels  now i you know have given up my life to this problemgiven my life to it  i began to work at the conditions of diamond making when i was seventeen and now i am thirtytwo  it seemed to me that it might take all the thought and energies of a man for ten years or twenty years but even if it did the game was still worth the candle  suppose one to have at last just hit the right trick before the secret got out and diamonds became as common as coal one might realize millions  millions  he paused and looked for my sympathy  his eyes shone hungrily  to think said he that i am on the verge of it all and here  i had he proceeded about a thousand pounds when i was twentyone and this i thought eked out by a little teaching would keep my researches going  a year or two was spent in study at berlin chiefly and then i continued on my own account  the trouble was the secrecy  you see if once i had let out what i was doing other men might have been spurred on by my belief in the practicability of the idea and i do not pretend to be such a genius as to have been sure of coming in first in the case of a race for the discovery  and you see it was important that if i really meant to make a pile people should not know it was an artificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the ton so i had to work all alone  at first i had a little laboratory but as my resources began to run out i had to conduct my experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in kentish town where i slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor among all my apparatus  the money simply flowed away  i grudged myself everything except scientific appliances  i tried to keep things going by a little teaching but i am not a very good teacher and i have no university degree nor very much education except in chemistry and i found i had to give a lot of time and labour for precious little money  but i got nearer and nearer the thing three years ago i settled the problem of the composition of the flux and got near the pressure by putting this flux of mine and a certain carbon composition into a closedup gunbarrel filling up with water sealing tightly and heating  he paused  rather risky said i  yes  it burst and smashed all my windows and a lot of my apparatus but i got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless following out the problem of getting a big pressure upon the molten mixture from which the things were to crystallise i hit upon some researches of daubrees at the paris laboratorie des poudres et salpetres  he exploded dynamite in a tightly screwed steel cylinder too strong to burst and i found he could crush rocks into a muck not unlike the south african bed in which diamonds are found  it was a tremendous strain on my resources but i got a steel cylinder made for my purpose after his pattern  i put in all my stuff and my explosives built up a fire in my furnace put the whole concern in andwent out for a walk  i could not help laughing at his matteroffact manner  did you not think it would blow up the house  were there other people in the place  it was in the interest of science he said ultimately  there was a costermonger family on the floor below a beggingletter writer in the room behind mine and two flowerwomen were upstairs  perhaps it was a bit thoughtless  but possibly some of them were out  when i came back the thing was just where i left it among the whitehot coals  the explosive hadnt burst the case  and then i had a problem to face  you know time is an important element in crystallisation  if you hurry the process the crystals are smallit is only by prolonged standing that they grow to any size  i resolved to let this apparatus cool for two years letting the temperature go down slowly during the time  and i was now quite out of money and with a big fire and the rent of my room as well as my hunger to satisfy i had scarcely a penny in the world  i can hardly tell you all the shifts i was put to while i was making the diamonds  i have sold newspapers held horses opened cabdoors  for many weeks i addressed envelopes  i had a place as assistant to a man who owned a barrow and used to call down one side of the road while he called down the other  once for a week i had absolutely nothing to do and i begged what a week that was  one day the fire was going out and i had eaten nothing all day and a little chap taking his girl out gave me sixpenceto show off  thank heaven for vanity  how the fishshops smelt  but i went and spent it all on coals and had the furnace bright red again and thenwell hunger makes a fool of a man  at last three weeks ago i let the fire out  i took my cylinder and unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it punished my hands and i scraped out the crumbling lavalike mass with a chisel and hammered it into a powder upon an iron plate and i found three big diamonds and five small ones  as i sat on the floor hammering my door opened and my neighbour the beggingletter writer came in  he was drunkas he usually is nerchist said he  youre drunk said i structive scoundrel said he  go to your father said i meaning the father of lies  never you mind said he and gave me a cunning wink and hiccuped and leaning up against the door with his other eye against the doorpost began to babble of how he had been prying in my room and how he had gone to the police that morning and how they had taken down everything he had to saysiffiwas a gem said he  then i suddenly realised i was in a hole either i should have to tell these police my little secret and get the whole thing blown upon or be lagged as an anarchist  so i went up to my neighbour and took him by the collar and rolled him about a bit and then i gathered up my diamonds and cleared out the evening newspapers called my den the kentish town bomb factory and now i cannot part with the things for love or money  if i go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait and go and whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman and then i say i cannot wait  and i found out a receiver of stolen goods and he simply stuck to the one i gave him and told me to prosecute if i wanted it back  i am going about now with several hundred thousand poundsworth of diamonds round my neck and without either food or shelter  you are the first person i have taken into my confidence but i like your face and i am harddriven  he looked into my eyes  it would be madness said i for me to buy a diamond under the circumstances  besides i do not carry hundreds of pounds about in my pocket yet i more than half believe your story  i will if you like do this come to my office tomorrow      you think i am a thief said he keenly  you will tell the police  i am not coming into a trap  somehow i am assured you are no thief  here is my card take that anyhow  you need not come to any appointment  come when you will  he took the card and an earnest of my goodwill  think better of it and come said i  he shook his head doubtfully  i will pay back your halfcrown with interest some daysuch interest as will amaze you said he  anyhow you will keep the secret     dont follow me  he crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little steps under the archway leading into essex street and i let him go  and that was the last i ever saw of him  afterwards i had two letters from him asking me to send banknotesnot chequesto certain addresses  i weighed the matter over and took what i conceived to be the wisest course once he called upon me when i was out  my urchin described him as a very thin dirty and ragged man with a dreadful cough  he left no message  that was the finish of him so far as my story goes i wonder sometimes what has become of him  was he an ingenious monomaniac or a fraudulent dealer in pebbles or has he really made diamonds as he asserted  the latter is just sufficiently credible to make me think at times that i have missed the most brilliant opportunity of my life  he may of course be dead and his diamonds carelessly thrown asideone i repeat was almost as big as my thumb  or he may be still wandering about trying to sell the things  it is just possible he may yet emerge upon society and passing athwart my heavens in the serene altitude sacred to the wealthy and the welladvertised reproach me silently for my want of enterprise  i sometimes think i might at least have risked five pounds     the lord of the dynamos  the chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at camberwell and kept the electric railway going came out of yorkshire and his name was james holroyd  he was a practical electrician but fond of whisky a heavy redhaired brute with irregular teeth  he doubted the existence of the deity but accepted carnots cycle and he had read shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry  his helper came out of the mysterious east and his name was azumazi  but holroyd called him poohbah  holroyd liked a nigger because he would stand kickinga habit with holroydand did not pry into the machinery and try to learn the ways of it  certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought into abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation holroyd never fully realised though just at the end he got some inkling of them  to define azumazi was beyond ethnology  he was perhaps more negroid than anything else though his hair was curly rather than frizzy and his nose had a bridge  moreover his skin was brown rather than black and the whites of his eyes were yellow his broad cheekbones and narrow chin gave his face something of the viperine v his head too was broad behind and low and narrow at the forehead as if his brain had been twisted round in the reverse way to a europeans  he was short of stature and still shorter of english  in conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known marketable value and his infrequent words were carved and wrought into heraldic grotesqueness  holroyd tried to elucidate his religious beliefs andespecially after whiskylectured to him against superstition and missionaries  azumazi however shirked the discussion of his gods even though he was kicked for it  azumazi had come clad in white but insufficient raiment out of the stokehole of the lord clive from the straits settlements and beyond into london  he had heard even in his youth of the greatness and riches of london where all the women are white and fair and even the beggars in the streets are white and he arrived with newly earned gold coins in his pocket to worship at the shrine of civilisation  the day of his landing was a dismal one the sky was dun and a windworried drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets but he plunged boldly into the delights of shadwell and was presently cast up shattered in health civilised in costume penniless and except in matters of the direst necessity practically a dumb animal to toil for james holroyd and to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at camberwell and to james holroyd bullying was a labour of love  there were three dynamos with their engines at camberwell the two that had been there since the beginning were small machines the larger one was new  the smaller machines made a reasonable noise their straps hummed over the drums every now and then the brushes buzzed and fizzled and the air churned steadily whoo whoo whoo between their poles  one was loose in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating  but the big dynamo drowned these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron core which somehow set part of the ironwork humming  the place made the visitors head reel with the throb throb throb of the engines the rotation of the big wheels the spinning ballvalves the occasional spittings of the steam and over all the deep unceasing surging note of the big dynamo  this last noise was from an engineering point of view a defect but azumazi accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride  if it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about the reader as he reads we would tell all our story to such an accompaniment  it was a steady stream of din from which the ear picked out first one thread and then another there was the intermittent snorting panting and seething of the steam engines the suck and thud of their pistons the dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great drivingwheels came round a note the leather straps made as they ran tighter and looser and a fretful tumult from the dynamos and over all sometimes inaudible as the ear tired of it and then creeping back upon the senses again was this trombone note of the big machine  the floor never felt steady and quiet beneath ones feet but quivered and jarred  it was a confusing unsteady place and enough to send anyones thoughts jerking into odd zigzags  and for three months while the big strike of the engineers was in progress holroyd who was a blackleg and azumazi who was a mere black were never out of the stir and eddy of it but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty between the shed and the gates  holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine soon after azumazi came  he had to shout to be heard in the din  look at that said holroyd wheres your eathen idol to match im  and azumazi looked  for a moment holroyd was inaudible and then azumazi heard kill a hundred men  twelve per cent on the ordinary shares said holroyd and thats something like a gord  holroyd was proud of his big dynamo and expatiated upon its size and power to azumazi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that and the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black cranium  he would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so ways in which a man might be killed by it and once he gave azumazi a shock as a sample of its quality after that in the breathingtimes of his labourit was heavy labour being not only his own but most of holroydsazumazi would sit and watch the big machine  now and then the brushes would sparkle and spit blue flashes at which holroyd would swear but all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing  the band ran shouting over the shaft and ever behind one as one watched was the complacent thud of the piston  so it lived all day in this big airy shed with him and holroyd to wait upon it not prisoned up and slaving to drive a ship as the other engines he knewmere captive devils of the british solomonhad been but a machine enthroned  those two smaller dynamos azumazi by force of contrast despised the large one he privately christened the lord of the dynamos  they were fretful and irregular but the big dynamo was steady  how great it was  how serene and easy in its working  greater and calmer even than the buddhas he had seen at rangoon and yet not motionless but living  the great black coils spun spun spun the rings ran round under the brushes and the deep note of its coil steadied the whole  it affected azumazi queerly  azumazi was not fond of labour  he would sit about and watch the lord of the dynamos while holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get whisky although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but behind the engines and moreover if holroyd caught him skulking he got hit for it with a rod of stout copper wire  he would go and stand close to the colossus and look up at the great leather band running overhead  there was a black patch on the band that came round and it pleased him somehow among all the clatter to watch this return again and again  odd thoughts spun with the whirl of it  scientific people tell us that savages give souls to rocks and treesand a machine is a thousand times more alive than a rock or a tree  and azumazi was practically a savage still the veneer of civilisation lay no deeper than his slop suit his bruises and the coal grime on his face and hands his father before him had worshipped a meteoric stone kindred blood it may be had splashed the broad wheels of juggernaut  he took every opportunity holroyd gave him of touching and handling the great dynamo that was fascinating him  he polished and cleaned it until the metal parts were blinding in the sun  he felt a mysterious sense of service in doing this  he would go up to it and touch its spinning coils gently  the gods he had worshipped were all far away  the people in london hid their gods  at last his dim feelings grew more distinct and took shape in thoughts and at last in acts  when he came into the roaring shed one morning he salaamed to the lord of the dynamos and then when holroyd was away he went and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant and prayed it to have pity on him and save him from holroyd  as he did so a rare gleam of light came in through the open archway of the throbbing machineshed and the lord of the dynamos as he whirled and roared was radiant with pale gold  then azumazi knew that his service was acceptable to his lord  after that he did not feel so lonely as he had done and he had indeed been very much alone in london  and even when his work time was over which was rare he loitered about the shed  then the next time holroyd maltreated him azumazi went presently to the lord of the dynamos and whispered thou seest o my lord and the angry whir of the machinery seemed to answer him thereafter it appeared to him that whenever holroyd came into the shed a different note came into the sounds of the dynamo  my lord bides his time said azumazi to himself  the iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe  and he waited and watched for the day of reckoning  one day there was evidence of short circuiting and holroyd making an unwary examinationit was in the afternoongot a rather severe shock  azumazi from behind the engine saw him jump off and curse at the peccant coil  he is warned said azumazi to himself  surely my lord is very patient  holroyd had at first initiated his nigger into such elementary conceptions of the dynamos working as would enable him to take temporary charge of the shed in his absence  but when he noticed the manner in which azumazi hung about the monster he became suspicious  he dimly perceived his assistant was up to something and connecting him with the anointing of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one place he issued an edict shouted above the confusion of the machinery dont ee go nigh that big dynamo any more poohbah or all take thy skin off besides if it pleased azumazi to be near the big machine it was plain sense and decency to keep him away from it  azumazi obeyed at the time but later he was caught bowing before the lord of the dynamos  at which holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he turned to go away  as azumazi presently stood behind the engine and glared at the back of the hated holroyd the noises of the machinery took a new rhythm and sounded like four words in his native tongue  it is hard to say exactly what madness is  i fancy azumazi was mad  the incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his little store of knowledge and his big store of superstitious fancy at last into something akin to frenzy  at any rate when the idea of making holroyd a sacrifice to the dynamo fetich was thus suggested to him it filled him with a strange tumult of exultant emotion  that night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed together  the shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and flickered purple  the shadows lay black behind the dynamos the ball governors of the engines whirled from light to darkness and their pistons beat loud and steady  the world outside seen through the open end of the shed seemed incredibly dim and remote  it seemed absolutely silent too since the riot of the machinery drowned every external sound  far away was the black fence of the yard with grey shadowy houses behind and above was the deep blue sky and the pale little stars  azumazi suddenly walked across the centre of the shed above which the leather bands were running and went into the shadow by the big dynamo  holroyd heard a click and the spin of the armature changed  what are you dewin with that switch he bawled in surprise hant i told you  then he saw the set expression of azumazis eyes as the asiatic came out of the shadow towards him  in another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the great dynamo  you coffeeheaded fool gasped holroyd with a brown hand at his throat  keep off those contact rings  in another moment he was tripped and reeling back upon the lord of the dynamos  he instinctively loosened his grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine  the messenger sent in furious haste from the station to find out what had happened in the dynamo shed met azumazi at the porters lodge by the gate  azumazi tried to explain something but the messenger could make nothing of the blacks incoherent english and hurried on to the shed  the machines were all noisily at work and nothing seemed to be disarranged  there was however a queer smell of singed hair  then he saw an oddlooking crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big dynamo and approaching recognised the distorted remains of holroyd  the man stared and hesitated a moment  then he saw the face and shut his eyes convulsively  he turned on his heel before he opened them so that he should not see holroyd again and went out of the shed to get advice and help  when azumazi saw holroyd die in the grip of the great dynamo he had been a little scared about the consequences of his act  yet he felt strangely elated and knew that the favour of the lord dynamo was upon him  his plan was already settled when he met the man coming from the station and the scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious conclusion of suicide  this expert scarcely noticed azumazi except to ask a few questions  did he see holroyd kill himself  azumazi explained that he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo  it was not a difficult examination being untinctured by suspicion  the distorted remains of holroyd which the electrician removed from the machine were hastily covered by the porter with a coffeestained tablecloth  somebody by a happy inspiration fetched a medical man  the expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again for seven or eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the electric railway  azumazi answering or misunderstanding the questions of the people who had by authority or impudence come into the shed was presently sent back to the stokehole by the scientific manager  of course a crowd collected outside the gates of the yarda crowd for no known reason always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden death in london two or three reporters percolated somehow into the engineshed and one even got to azumazi but the scientific expert cleared them out again being himself an amateur journalist  presently the body was carried away and public interest departed with it azumazi remained very quietly at his furnace seeing over and over again in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still  an hour after the murder to anyone coming into the shed it would have looked exactly as if nothing had ever happened there  peeping presently from his engineroom the black saw the lord dynamo spin and whirl beside his little brothers and the driving wheels were beating round and the steam in the pistons went thud thud exactly as it had been earlier in the evening  after all from the mechanical point of view it had been a most insignificant incidentthe mere temporary deflection of a current  but now the slender form and slender shadow of the scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of holroyd travelling up and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps between the engines and the dynamos  have i not served my lord said azumazi inaudibly from his shadow and the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear as he looked at the big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had been a little in abeyance since holroyds death resumed its sway  never had azumazi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly  the big humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from its steady beating  it was indeed a mighty god  the unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him scribbling on a piece of paper  his shadow lay at the foot of the monster  was the lord dynamo still hungry  his servant was ready  azumazi made a stealthy step forward then stopped  the scientific manager suddenly stopped writing and walked down the shed to the endmost of the dynamos and began to examine the brushes  azumazi hesitated and then slipped across noiselessly into shadow by the switch  there he waited  presently the managers footsteps could be heard returning  he stopped in his old position unconscious of the stoker crouching ten feet away from him  then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled and in another moment azumazi had sprung out of the darkness upon him  first the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung towards the big dynamo then kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonists head down with his hands he loosened the grip on his waist and swung round away from the machine  then the black grasped him again putting a curly head against his chest and they swayed and panted as it seemed for an age or so  then the scientific manager was impelled to catch a black ear in his teeth and bite furiously  the black yelled hideously  they rolled over on the floor and the black who had apparently slipped from the vice of the teeth or parted with some earthe scientific manager wondered which at the timetried to throttle him  the scientific manager was making some ineffectual attempts to claw something with his hands and to kick when the welcome sound of quick footsteps sounded on the floor  the next moment azumazi had left him and darted towards the big dynamo there was a splutter amid the roar  the officer of the company who had entered stood staring as azumazi caught the naked terminals in his hands gave one horrible convulsion and then hung motionless from the machine his face violently distorted  im jolly glad you came in when you did said the scientific manager still sitting on the floor  he looked at the still quivering figure  its not a nice death to die apparentlybut it is quick  the official was still staring at the body  he was a man of slow apprehension  there was a pause  the scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly he ran his fingers along his collar thoughtfully and moved his head to and fro several times  poor holroyd  i see now  then almost mechanically he went towards the switch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit again  as he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine and fell forward on its face  the core of the dynamo roared out loud and clear and the armature beat the air  so ended prematurely the worship of the dynamo deity perhaps the most shortlived of all religions  yet withal it could at least boast a martyrdom and a human sacrifice     the country of the blind  three hundred miles and more from chimborazo one hundred from the snows of cotopaxi in the wildest wastes of ecuadors andes there lies that mysterious mountain valley cut off from all the world of men the country of the blind  long years ago that valley lay so far open to the world that men might come at last through frightful gorges and over an icy pass into its equable meadows and thither indeed men came a family or so of peruvian halfbreeds fleeing from the lust and tyranny of an evil spanish ruler  then came the stupendous outbreak of mindobamba when it was night in quito for seventeen days and the water was boiling at yaguachi and all the fish floating dying even as far as guayaquil everywhere along the pacific slopes there were landslips and swift thawings and sudden floods and one whole side of the old arauca crest slipped and came down in thunder and cut off the country of the blind for ever from the exploring feet of men  but one of these early settlers had chanced to be on the hither side of the gorges when the world had so terribly shaken itself and he perforce had to forget his wife and his child and all the friends and possessions he had left up there and start life over again in the lower world  he started it again but ill blindness overtook him and he died of punishment in the mines but the story he told begot a legend that lingers along the length of the cordilleras of the andes to this day  he told of his reason for venturing back from that fastness into which he had first been carried lashed to a llama beside a vast bale of gear when he was a child  the valley he said had in it all that the heart of man could desiresweet water pasture an even climate slopes of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit and on one side great hanging forests of pine that held the avalanches high  far overhead on three sides vast cliffs of greygreen rock were capped by cliffs of ice but the glacier stream came not to them but flowed away by the farther slopes and only now and then huge ice masses fell on the valley side  in this valley it neither rained nor snowed but the abundant springs gave a rich green pasture that irrigation would spread over all the valley space  the settlers did well indeed there  their beasts did well and multiplied and but one thing marred their happiness  yet it was enough to mar it greatly  a strange disease had come upon them and had made all the children born to them thereand indeed several older children alsoblind  it was to seek some charm or antidote against this plague of blindness that he had with fatigue and danger and difficulty returned down the gorge  in those days in such cases men did not think of germs and infections but of sins and it seemed to him that the reason of this affliction must he in the negligence of these priestless immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered the valley  he wanted a shrinea handsome cheap effectual shrineto be erected in the valley he wanted relics and suchlike potent things of faith blessed objects and mysterious medals and prayers  in his wallet he had a bar of native silver for which he would not account he insisted there was none in the valley with something of the insistence of an inexpert liar  they had all clubbed their money and ornaments together having little need for such treasure up there he said to buy them holy help against their ill  i figure this dimeyed young mountaineer sunburnt gaunt and anxious hat brim clutched feverishly a man all unused to the ways of the lower world telling this story to some keeneyed attentive priest before the great convulsion i can picture him presently seeking to return with pious and infallible remedies against that trouble and the infinite dismay with which he must have faced the tumbled vastness where the gorge had once come out  but the rest of his story of mischances is lost to me save that i know of his evil death after several years  poor stray from that remoteness  the stream that had once made the gorge now bursts from the mouth of a rocky cave and the legend his poor illtold story set going developed into the legend of a race of blind men somewhere over there one may still hear today  and amidst the little population of that now isolated and forgotten valley the disease ran its course  the old became groping the young saw but dimly and the children that were born to them never saw at all  but life was very easy in that snowrimmed basin lost to all the world with neither thorns nor briers with no evil insects nor any beasts save the gentle breed of llamas they had lugged and thrust and followed up the beds of the shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they had come  the seeing had become purblind so gradually that they scarcely noticed their loss  they guided the sightless youngsters hither and thither until they knew the whole valley marvellously and when at last sight died out among them the race lived on  they had even time to adapt themselves to the blind control of fire which they made carefully in stoves of stone  they were a simple strain of people at the first unlettered only slightly touched with the spanish civilisation but with something of a tradition of the arts of old peru and of its lost philosophy  generation followed generation  they forgot many things they devised many things their tradition of the greater world they came from became mythical in colour and uncertain  in all things save sight they were strong and able and presently chance sent one who had an original mind and who could talk and persuade among them and then afterwards another  these two passed leaving their effects and the little community grew in numbers and in understanding and met and settled social and economic problems that arose  generation followed generation  generation followed generation  there came a time when a child was born who was fifteen generations from that ancestor who went out of the valley with a bar of silver to seek gods aid and who never returned  thereabout it chanced that a man came into this community from the outer world  and this is the story of that man  he was a mountaineer from the country near quito a man who had been down to the sea and had seen the world a reader of books in an original way an acute and enterprising man and he was taken on by a party of englishmen who had come out to ecuador to climb mountains to replace one of their three swiss guides who had fallen ill  he climbed here and he climbed there and then came the attempt on parascotopetl the matterhorn of the andes in which he was lost to the outer world  the story of that accident has been written a dozen times  pointers narrative is the best  he tells how the little party worked their difficult and almost vertical way up to the very foot of the last and greatest precipice and how they built a night shelter amidst the snow upon a little shelf of rock and with a touch of real dramatic power how presently they found nunez had gone from them  they shouted and there was no reply shouted and whistled and for the rest of that night they slept no more  as the morning broke they saw the traces of his fall  it seems impossible he could have uttered a sound  he had slipped eastward towards the unknown side of the mountain far below he had struck a steep slope of snow and ploughed his way down it in the midst of a snow avalanche  his track went straight to the edge of a frightful precipice and beyond that everything was hidden  far far below and hazy with distance they could see trees rising out of a narrow shutin valleythe lost country of the blind  but they did not know it was the lost country of the blind nor distinguish it in any way from any other narrow streak of upland valley  unnerved by this disaster they abandoned their attempt in the afternoon and pointer was called away to the war before he could make another attack  to this day parascotopetl lifts an unconquered crest and pointers shelter crumbles unvisited amidst the snows  and the man who fell survived  at the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet and came down in the midst of a cloud of snow upon a snowslope even steeper than the one above  down this he was whirled stunned and insensible but without a bone broken in his body and then at last came to gentler slopes and at last rolled out and lay still buried amidst a softening heap of the white masses that had accompanied and saved him  he came to himself with a dim fancy that he was ill in bed then realized his position with a mountaineers intelligence and worked himself loose and after a rest or so out until he saw the stars  he rested flat upon his chest for a space wondering where he was and what had happened to him  he explored his limbs and discovered that several of his buttons were gone and his coat turned over his head  his knife had gone from his pocket and his hat was lost though he had tied it under his chin  he recalled that he had been looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the shelter wall  his iceaxe had disappeared  he decided he must have fallen and looked up to see exaggerated by the ghastly light of the rising moon the tremendous flight he had taken  for a while he lay gazing blankly at the vast pale cliff towering above rising moment by moment out of a subsiding tide of darkness  its phantasmal mysterious beauty held him for a space and then he was seized with a paroxysm of sobbing laughter      after a great interval of time he became aware that he was near the lower edge of the snow  below down what was now a moonlit and practicable slope he saw the dark and broken appearance of rockstrewn turf he struggled to his feet aching in every joint and limb got down painfully from the heaped loose snow about him went downward until he was on the turf and there dropped rather than lay beside a boulder drank deep from the flask in his inner pocket and instantly fell asleep      he was awakened by the singing of birds in the trees far below  he sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at the foot of a vast precipice that sloped only a little in the gully down which he and his snow had come  over against him another wall of rock reared itself against the sky  the gorge between these precipices ran east and west and was full of the morning sunlight which lit to the westward the mass of fallen mountain that closed the descending gorge  below him it seemed there was a precipice equally steep but behind the snow in the gully he found a sort of chimneycleft dripping with snowwater down which a desperate man might venture  he found it easier than it seemed and came at last to another desolate alp and then after a rock climb of no particular difficulty to a steep slope of trees  he took his bearings and turned his face up the gorge for he saw it opened out above upon green meadows among which he now glimpsed quite distinctly a cluster of stone huts of unfamiliar fashion  at times his progress was like clambering along the face of a wall and after a time the rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge the voices of the singing birds died away and the air grew cold and dark about him  but the distant valley with its houses was all the brighter for that  he came presently to talus and among the rocks he notedfor he was an observant manan unfamiliar fern that seemed to clutch out of the crevices with intense green hands  he picked a frond or so and gnawed its stalk and found it helpful  about midday he came at last out of the throat of the gorge into the plain and the sunlight  he was stiff and weary he sat down in the shadow of a rock filled up his flask with water from a spring and drank it down and remained for a time resting before he went on to the houses  they were very strange to his eyes and indeed the whole aspect of that valley became as he regarded it queerer and more unfamiliar  the greater part of its surface was lush green meadow starred with many beautiful flowers irrigated with extraordinary care and bearing evidence of systematic cropping piece by piece high up and ringing the valley about was a wall and what appeared to be a circumferential water channel from which the little trickles of water that fed the meadow plants came and on the higher slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty herbage  sheds apparently shelters or feedingplaces for the llamas stood against the boundary wall here and there  the irrigation streams ran together into a main channel down the centre of the valley and this was enclosed on either side by a wall breast high  this gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded place a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that a number of paths paved with black and white stones and each with a curious little kerb at the side ran hither and thither in an orderly manner  the houses of the central village were quite unlike the casual and higgledypiggledy agglomeration of the mountain villages he knew they stood in a continuous row on either side of a central street of astonishing cleanness here and there their particoloured facade was pierced by a door and not a solitary window broke their even frontage  they were particoloured with extraordinary irregularity smeared with a sort of plaster that was sometimes grey sometimes drab sometimes slatecoloured or dark brown and it was the sight of this wild plastering first brought the word blind into the thoughts of the explorer  the good man who did that he thought must have been as blind as a bat  he descended a steep place and so came to the wall and channel that ran about the valley near where the latter spouted out its surplus contents into the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread of cascade  he could now see a number of men and women resting on piled heaps of grass as if taking a siesta in the remoter part of the meadow and nearer the village a number of recumbent children and then nearer at hand three men carrying pails on yokes along a little path that ran from the encircling wall towards the houses  these latter were clad in garments of llama cloth and boots and belts of leather and they wore caps of cloth with back and ear flaps  they followed one another in single file walking slowly and yawning as they walked like men who have been up all night  there was something so reassuringly prosperous and respectable in their bearing that after a moments hesitation nunez stood forward as conspicuously as possible upon his rock and gave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round the valley  the three men stopped and moved their heads as though they were looking about them  they turned their faces this way and that and nunez gesticulated with freedom  but they did not appear to see him for all his gestures and after a time directing themselves towards the mountains far away to the right they shouted as if in answer  nunez bawled again and then once more and as he gestured ineffectually the word blind came up to the top of his thoughts  the fools must be blind he said  when at last after much shouting and wrath nunez crossed the stream by a little bridge came through a gate in the wall and approached them he was sure that they were blind  he was sure that this was the country of the blind of which the legends told conviction had sprung upon him and a sense of great and rather enviable adventure  the three stood side by side not looking at him but with their ears directed towards him judging him by his unfamiliar steps  they stood close together like men a little afraid and he could see their eyelids closed and sunken as though the very balls beneath had shrunk away  there was an expression near awe on their faces  a man one said in hardly recognisable spanish  a man it isa man or a spiritcoming down from the rocks  but nunez advanced with the confident steps of a youth who enters upon life  all the old stories of the lost valley and the country of the blind had come back to his mind and through his thoughts ran this old proverb as if it were a refrain  in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  and very civilly he gave them greeting  he talked to them and used his eyes  where does he come from brother pedro asked one  down out of the rocks  over the mountains i come said nunez out of the country beyond therewhere men can see  from near bogotawhere there are a hundred thousands of people and where the city passes out of sight  sight muttered pedro  sight  he comes said the second blind man out of the rocks  the cloth of their coats nunez saw was curious fashioned each with a different sort of stitching  they startled him by a simultaneous movement towards him each with a hand outstretched  he stepped back from the advance of these spread fingers  come hither said the third blind man following his motion and clutching him neatly  and they held nunez and felt him over saying no word further until they had done so  carefully he cried with a finger in his eye and found they thought that organ with its fluttering lids a queer thing in him  they went over it again  a strange creature correa said the one called pedro feel the coarseness of his hair  like a llamas hair  rough he is as the rocks that begot him said correa investigating nunezs unshaven chin with a soft and slightly moist hand  perhaps he will grow finer  nunez struggled a little under their examination but they gripped him firm  carefully he said again  he speaks said the third man  certainly he is a man  ugh said pedro at the roughness of his coat  and you have come into the world asked pedro  out of the world  over mountains and glaciers right over above there halfway to the sun  out of the great big world that goes down twelve days journey to the sea  they scarcely seemed to heed him  our fathers have told us men may be made by the forces of nature said correa  it is the warmth of things and moisture and rottennessrottenness  let us lead him to the elders said pedro  shout first said correa lest the children be afraid this is a marvellous occasion  so they shouted and pedro went first and took nunez by the hand to lead him to the houses  he drew his hand away  i can see he said  see said correa  yes see said nunez turning towards him and stumbled against pedros pail  his senses are still imperfect said the third blind man he stumbles and talks unmeaning words  lead him by the hand  as you will said nunez and was led along laughing  it seemed they knew nothing of sight  well all in good time he would teach them  he heard people shouting and saw a number of figures gathering together in the middle roadway of the village  he found it tax his nerve and patience more than he had anticipated that first encounter with the population of the country of the blind  the place seemed larger as he drew near to it and the smeared plasterings queerer and a crowd of children and men and women the women and girls he was pleased to note had some of them quite sweet faces for all that their eyes were shut and sunken came about him holding on to him touching him with soft sensitive hands smelling at him and listening at every word he spoke  some of the maidens and children however kept aloof as if afraid and indeed his voice seemed coarse and rude beside their softer notes  they mobbed him  his three guides kept close to him with an effect of proprietorship and said again and again a wild man out of the rocks  bogota he said  bogota  over the mountain crests  a wild manusing wild words said pedro  did you hear that  bogota  his mind has hardly formed yet  he has only the beginnings of speech  a little boy nipped his hand  bogota he said mockingly  aye  a city to your village  i come from the great worldwhere men have eyes and see  his names bogota they said  he stumbled said correastumbled twice as we came hither  bring him in to the elders  and they thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as black as pitch save at the end there faintly glowed a fire  the crowd closed in behind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer of day and before he could arrest himself he had fallen headlong over the feet of a seated man  his arm outflung struck the face of someone else as he went down he felt the soft impact of features and heard a cry of anger and for a moment he struggled against a number of hands that clutched him  it was a onesided fight  an inkling of the situation came to him and he lay quiet  i fell down he said i couldnt see in this pitchy darkness  there was a pause as if the unseen persons about him tried to understand his words  then the voice of correa said he is but newly formed  he stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean nothing with his speech  others also said things about him that he heard or understood imperfectly  may i sit up he asked in a pause  i will not struggle against you again  they consulted and let him rise  the voice of an older man began to question him and nunez found himself trying to explain the great world out of which he had fallen and the sky and mountains and suchlike marvels to these elders who sat in darkness in the country of the blind  and they would believe and understand nothing whatever that he told them a thing quite outside his expectation  they would not even understand many of his words  for fourteen generations these people had been blind and cut off from all the seeing world the names for all the things of sight had faded and changed the story of the outer world was faded and changed to a childs story and they had ceased to concern themselves with anything beyond the rocky slopes above their circling wall  blind men of genius had arisen among them and questioned the shreds of belief and tradition they had brought with them from their seeing days and had dismissed all these things as idle fancies and replaced them with new and saner explanations  much of their imagination had shrivelled with their eyes and they had made for themselves new imaginations with their ever more sensitive ears and fingertips slowly nunez realised this that his expectation of wonder and reverence at his origin and his gifts was not to be borne out and after his poor attempt to explain sight to them had been set aside as the confused version of a newmade being describing the marvels of his incoherent sensations he subsided a little dashed into listening to their instruction  and the eldest of the blind men explained to him life and philosophy and religion how that the world meaning their valley had been first an empty hollow in the rocks and then had come first inanimate things without the gift of touch and llamas and a few other creatures that had little sense and then men and at last angels whom one could hear singing and making fluttering sounds but whom no one could touch at all which puzzled nunez greatly until he thought of the birds  he went on to tell nunez how this time had been divided into the warm and the cold which are the blind equivalents of day and night and how it was good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold so that now but for his advent the whole town of the blind would have been asleep  he said nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the wisdom they had acquired and that for all his mental incoherency and stumbling behaviour he must have courage and do his best to learn and at that all the people in the doorway murmured encouragingly  he said the nightfor the blind call their day nightwas now far gone and it behooved everyone to go back to sleep  he asked nunez if he knew how to sleep and nunez said he did but that before sleep he wanted food  they brought him food llamas milk in a bowl and rough salted bread and led him into a lonely place to eat out of their hearing and afterwards to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening roused them to begin their day again  but nunez slumbered not at all  instead he sat up in the place where they had left him resting his limbs and turning the unanticipated circumstances of his arrival over and over in his mind  every now and then he laughed sometimes with amusement and sometimes with indignation  unformed mind he said  got no senses yet  they little know theyve been insulting their heavensent king and master       i see i must bring them to reason  let me think  let me think  he was still thinking when the sun set  nunez had an eye for all beautiful things and it seemed to him that the glow upon the snowfields and glaciers that rose about the valley on every side was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen  his eyes went from that inaccessible glory to the village and irrigated fields fast sinking into the twilight and suddenly a wave of emotion took him and he thanked god from the bottom of his heart that the power of sight had been given him  he heard a voice calling to him from out of the village  yaho there bogota  come hither  at that he stood up smiling  he would show these people once and for all what sight would do for a man  they would seek him but not find him  you move not bogota said the voice  he laughed noiselessly and made two stealthy steps aside from the path  trample not on the grass bogota that is not allowed  nunez had scarcely heard the sound he made himself  he stopped amazed  the owner of the voice came running up the piebald path towards him  he stepped back into the pathway  here i am he said  why did you not come when i called you said the blind man must you be led like a child  cannot you hear the path as you walk  nunez laughed  i can see it he said  there is no such word as see said the blind man after a pause  cease this folly and follow the sound of my feet  nunez followed a little annoyed  my time will come he said  youll learn the blind man answered  there is much to learn in the world  has no one told you in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  what is blind asked the blind man carelessly over his shoulder  four days passed and the fifth found the king of the blind still incognito as a clumsy and useless stranger among his subjects  it was he found much more difficult to proclaim himself than he had supposed and in the meantime while he meditated his coup detat he did what he was told and learnt the manners and customs of the country of the blind  he found working and going about at night a particularly irksome thing and he decided that that should be the first thing he would change  they led a simple laborious life these people with all the elements of virtue and happiness as these things can be understood by men  they toiled but not oppressively they had food and clothing sufficient for their needs they had days and seasons of rest they made much of music and singing and there was love among them and little children  it was marvellous with what confidence and precision they went about their ordered world  everything you see had been made to fit their needs each of the radiating paths of the valley area had a constant angle to the others and was distinguished by a special notch upon its kerbing all obstacles and irregularities of path or meadow had long since been cleared away all their methods and procedure arose naturally from their special needs  their senses had become marvellously acute they could hear and judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces awaycould hear the very beating of his heart  intonation had long replaced expression with them and touches gesture and their work with hoe and spade and fork was as free and confident as garden work can be  their sense of smell was extraordinarily fine they could distinguish individual differences as readily as a dog can and they went about the tending of llamas who lived among the rocks above and came to the wall for food and shelter with ease and confidence  it was only when at last nunez sought to assert himself that he found how easy and confident their movements could be  he rebelled only after he had tried persuasion  he tried at first on several occasions to tell them of sight look you here you people he said  there are things you do not understand in me  once or twice one or two of them attended to him they sat with faces downcast and ears turned intelligently towards him and he did his best to tell them what it was to see  among his hearers was a girl with eyelids less red and sunken than the others so that one could almost fancy she was hiding eyes whom especially he hoped to persuade  he spoke of the beauties of sight of watching the mountains of the sky and the sunrise and they heard him with amused incredulity that presently became condemnatory  they told him there were indeed no mountains at all but that the end of the rocks where the llamas grazed was indeed the end of the world thence sprang a cavernous roof of the universe from which the dew and the avalanches fell and when he maintained stoutly the world had neither end nor roof such as they supposed they said his thoughts were wicked  so far as he could describe sky and clouds and stars to them it seemed to them a hideous void a terrible blankness in the place of the smooth roof to things in which they believedit was an article of faith with them that the cavern roof was exquisitely smooth to the touch  he saw that in some manner he shocked them and gave up that aspect of the matter altogether and tried to show them the practical value of sight  one morning he saw pedro in the path called seventeen and coming towards the central houses but still too far off for hearing or scent and he told them as much  in a little while he prophesied pedro will be here  an old man remarked that pedro had no business on path seventeen and then as if in confirmation that individual as he drew near turned and went transversely into path ten and so back with nimble paces towards the outer wall  they mocked nunez when pedro did not arrive and afterwards when he asked pedro questions to clear his character pedro denied and outfaced him and was afterwards hostile to him  then he induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping meadows towards the wall with one complaisant individual and to him he promised to describe all that happened among the houses  he noted certain goings and comings but the things that really seemed to signify to these people happened inside of or behind the windowless housesthe only things they took note of to test him byand of those he could see or tell nothing and it was after the failure of this attempt and the ridicule they could not repress that he resorted to force  he thought of seizing a spade and suddenly smiting one or two of them to earth and so in fair combat showing the advantage of eyes  he went so far with that resolution as to seize his spade and then he discovered a new thing about himself and that was that it was impossible for him to hit a blind man in cold blood  he hesitated and found them all aware that he had snatched up the spade  they stood all alert with their heads on one side and bent ears towards him for what he would do next  put that spade down said one and he felt a sort of helpless horror  he came near obedience  then he had thrust one backwards against a house wall and fled past him and out of the village  he went athwart one of their meadows leaving a track of trampled grass behind his feet and presently sat down by the side of one of their ways  he felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all men in the beginning of a fight but more perplexity  he began to realise that you cannot even fight happily with creatures who stand upon a different mental basis to yourself  far away he saw a number of men carrying spades and sticks come out of the street of houses and advance in a spreading line along the several paths towards him  they advanced slowly speaking frequently to one another and ever and again the whole cordon would halt and sniff the air and listen  the first time they did this nunez laughed  but afterwards he did not laugh  one struck his trail in the meadow grass and came stooping and feeling his way along it  for five minutes he watched the slow extension of the cordon and then his vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic  he stood up went a pace or so towards the circumferential wall turned and went back a little way  there they all stood in a crescent still and listening  he also stood still gripping his spade very tightly in both hands  should he charge them  the pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  should he charge them  he looked back at the high and unclimbable wall behindunclimbable because of its smooth plastering but withal pierced with many little doors and at the approaching line of seekers  behind these others were now coming out of the street of houses  should he charge them  bogota called one  bogota where are you  he gripped his spade still tighter and advanced down the meadows towards the place of habitations and directly he moved they converged upon him  ill hit them if they touch me he swore by heaven i will  ill hit  he called aloud look here im going to do what i like in this valley  do you hear im going to do what i like and go where i like  they were moving in upon him quickly groping yet moving rapidly  it was like playing blind mans buff with everyone blindfolded except one  get hold of him cried one  he found himself in the arc of a loose curve of pursuers  he felt suddenly he must be active and resolute  you dont understand he cried in a voice that was meant to be great and resolute and which broke  you are blind and i can see  leave me alone  bogota  put down that spade and come off the grass  the last order grotesque in its urban familiarity produced a gust of anger  ill hurt you he said sobbing with emotion by heaven ill hurt you  leave me alone  he began to runnot knowing clearly where to run  he ran from the nearest blind man because it was a horror to hit him  he stopped and then made a dash to escape from their closing ranks he made for where a gap was wide and the men on either side with a quick perception of the approach of his paces rushed in on one another  he sprang forward and then saw he must be caught and swish the spade had struck  he felt the soft thud of hand and arm and the man was down with a yell of pain and he was through  through  and then he was close to the street of houses again and blind men whirling spades and stakes were running with a reasoned swiftness hither and thither  he heard steps behind him just in time and found a tall man rushing forward and swiping at the sound of him  he lost his nerve hurled his spade a yard wide of this antagonist and whirled about and fled fairly yelling as he dodged another  he was panicstricken  he ran furiously to and fro dodging when there was no need to dodge and in his anxiety to see on every side of him at once stumbling  for a moment he was down and they heard his fall  far away in the circumferential wall a little doorway looked like heaven and he set off in a wild rush for it he did not even look round at his pursuers until it was gained and he had stumbled across the bridge clambered a little way among the rocks to the surprise and dismay of a young llama who went leaping out of sight and lay down sobbing for breath  and so his coup detat came to an end  he stayed outside the wall of the valley of the blind for two nights and days without food or shelter and meditated upon the unexpected  during these meditations he repeated very frequently and always with a profounder note of derision the exploded proverb in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  he thought chiefly of ways of fighting and conquering these people and it grew clear that for him no practicable way was possible  he had no weapons and now it would be hard to get one  the canker of civilisation had got to him even in bogota and he could not find it in himself to go down and assassinate a blind man  of course if he did that he might then dictate terms on the threat of assassinating them all  butsooner or later he must sleep      he tried also to find food among the pine trees to be comfortable under pine boughs while the frost fell at night andwith less confidenceto catch a llama by artifice in order to try to kill itperhaps by hammering it with a stoneand so finally perhaps to eat some of it  but the llamas had a doubt of him and regarded him with distrustful brown eyes and spat when he drew near  fear came on him the second day and fits of shivering finally he crawled down to the wall of the country of the blind and tried to make his terms  he crawled along by the stream shouting until two blind men came out to the gate and talked to him  i was mad he said  but i was only newly made  they said that was better  he told them he was wiser now and repented of all he had done   then he wept without intention for he was very weak and ill now and they took that as a favourable sign  they asked him if he still thought he could see  no he said  that was folly  the word means nothing less than nothing  they asked him what was overhead  about ten times ten the height of a man there is a roof above the worldof rockand very very smooth  so smoothso beautifully smooth   he burst again into hysterical tears before you ask me any more give me some food or i shall die  he expected dire punishments but these blind people were capable of toleration  they regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his general idiocy and inferiority and after they had whipped him they appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone to do and he seeing no other way of living did submissively what he was told  he was ill for some days and they nursed him kindly  that refined his submission  but they insisted on his lying in the dark and that was a great misery  and blind philosophers came and talked to him of the wicked levity of his mind and reproved him so impressively for his doubts about the lid of rock that covered their cosmic casserole that he almost doubted whether indeed he was not the victim of hallucination in not seeing it overhead  so nunez became a citizen of the country of the blind and these people ceased to be a generalised people and became individualities to him and familiar to him while the world beyond the mountains became more and more remote and unreal  there was yacob his master a kindly man when not annoyed there was pedro yacobs nephew and there was medinasarote who was the youngest daughter of yacob  she was little esteemed in the world of the blind because she had a clearcut face and lacked that satisfying glossy smoothness that is the blind mans ideal of feminine beauty but nunez thought her beautiful at first and presently the most beautiful thing in the whole creation  her closed eyelids were not sunken and red after the common way of the valley but lay as though they might open again at any moment and she had long eyelashes which were considered a grave disfigurement  and her voice was weak and did not satisfy the acute hearing of the valley swains  so that she had no lover  there came a time when nunez thought that could he win her he would be resigned to live in the valley for all the rest of his days  he watched her he sought opportunities of doing her little services and presently he found that she observed him  once at a restday gathering they sat side by side in the dim starlight and the music was sweet  his hand came upon hers and he dared to clasp it  then very tenderly she returned his pressure  and one day as they were at their meal in the darkness he felt her hand very softly seeking him and as it chanced the fire leapt then and he saw the tenderness of her face  he sought to speak to her  he went to her one day when she was sitting in the summer moonlight spinning  the light made her a thing of silver and mystery  he sat down at her feet and told her he loved her and told her how beautiful she seemed to him  he had a lovers voice he spoke with a tender reverence that came near to awe and she had never before been touched by adoration  she made him no definite answer but it was clear his words pleased her  after that he talked to her whenever he could take an opportunity  the valley became the world for him and the world beyond the mountains where men lived by day seemed no more than a fairy tale he would some day pour into her ears  very tentatively and timidly he spoke to her of sight  sight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies and she listened to his description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet whitelit beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence she did not believe she could only half understand but she was mysteriously delighted and it seemed to him that she completely understood  his love lost its awe and took courage  presently he was for demanding her of yacob and the elders in marriage but she became fearful and delayed  and it was one of her elder sisters who first told yacob that medinasarote and nunez were in love  there was from the first very great opposition to the marriage of nunez and medinasarote not so much because they valued her as because they held him as a being apart an idiot incompetent thing below the permissible level of a man  her sisters opposed it bitterly as bringing discredit on them all and old yacob though he had formed a sort of liking for his clumsy obedient serf shook his head and said the thing could not be  the young men were all angry at the idea of corrupting the race and one went so far as to revile and strike nunez  he struck back  then for the first time he found an advantage in seeing even by twilight and after that fight was over no one was disposed to raise a hand against him but they still found his marriage impossible  old yacob had a tenderness for his last little daughter and was grieved to have her weep upon his shoulder  you see my dear hes an idiot  he has delusions he cant do anything right  i know wept medinasarote  but hes better than he was hes getting better  and hes strong dear father and kindstronger and kinder than any other man in the world  and he loves meand father i love him  old yacob was greatly distressed to find her inconsolable and besideswhat made it more distressinghe liked nunez for many things  so he went and sat in the windowless councilchamber with the other elders and watched the trend of the talk and said at the proper time hes better than he was  very likely some day we shall find him as sane as ourselves  then afterwards one of the elders who thought deeply had an idea  he was a great doctor among these people their medicineman and he had a very philosophical and inventive mind and the idea of curing nunez of his peculiarities appealed to him one day when yacob was present he returned to the topic of nunez i have examined nunez he said and the case is clearer to me i think very probably he might be cured  this is what i have always hoped said old yacob  his brain is affected said the blind doctor  the elders murmured assent  now what affects it  ah said old yacob  this said the doctor answering his own question  those queer things that are called the eyes and which exist to make an agreeable depression in the face are diseased in the case of nunez in such a way as to affect his brain  they are greatly distended he has eyelashes and his eyelids move and consequently his brain is in a state of constant irritation and distraction  yes said old yacob  yes  and i think i may say with reasonable certainty that in order to cure him complete all that we need to do is a simple and easy surgical operationnamely to remove these irritant bodies  and then he will be sane  then he will be perfectly sane and a quite admirable citizen  thank heaven for science said old yacob and went forth at once to tell nunez of his happy hopes  but nunezs manner of receiving the good news struck him as being cold and disappointing  one might think he said from the tone you take that you did not care for my daughter  it was medinasarote who persuaded nunez to face the blind surgeons  you do not want me he said to lose my gift of sight  she shook her head  my world is sight  her head drooped lower  there are the beautiful things the beautiful little thingsthe flowers the lichens amidst the rocks the light and softness on a piece of fur the far sky with its drifting dawn of clouds the sunsets and the stars  and there is you  for you alone it is good to have sight to see your sweet serene face your kindly lips your dear beautiful hands folded together     it is these eyes of mine you won these eyes that hold me to you that these idiots seek  instead i must touch you hear you and never see you again  i must come under that roof of rock and stone and darkness that horrible roof under which your imaginations stoop    no you would not have me do that  a disagreeable doubt had arisen in him  he stopped and left the thing a question  i wish she said sometimes she paused  yes he said a little apprehensively  i wish sometimesyou would not talk like that  like what  i know its prettyits your imagination  i love it but now  he felt cold  now he said faintly  she sat quite still  you meanyou thinki should be better better perhaps  he was realising things very swiftly  he felt anger perhaps anger at the dull course of fate but also sympathy for her lack of understandinga sympathy near akin to pity  dear he said and he could see by her whiteness how tensely her spirit pressed against the things she could not say he put his arms about her he kissed her ear and they sat for a time in silence  if i were to consent to this he said at last in a voice that was very gentle  she flung her arms about him weeping wildly  oh if you would she sobbed if only you would  for a week before the operation that was to raise him from his servitude and inferiority to the level of a blind citizen nunez knew nothing of sleep and all through the warm sunlit hours while the others slumbered happily he sat brooding or wandered aimlessly trying to bring his mind to bear on his dilemma  he had given his answer he had given his consent and still he was not sure  and at last worktime was over the sun rose in splendour over the golden crests and his last day of vision began for him he had a few minutes with medinasarote before she went apart to sleep  tomorrow he said i shall see no more  dear heart she answered and pressed his hands with all her strength  they will hurt you but little she said and you are going through this pain you are going through it dear lover for me     dear if a womans heart and life can do it i will repay you  my dearest one my dearest with the tender voice i will repay  he was drenched in pity for himself and her  he held her in his arms and pressed his lips to hers and looked on her sweet face for the last time  goodbye he whispered to that dear sight goodbye  and then in silence he turned away from her  she could hear his slow retreating footsteps and something in the rhythm of them threw her into a passion of weeping  he walked away  he had fully meant to go to a lonely place where the meadows were beautiful with white narcissus and there remain until the hour of his sacrifice should come but as he walked he lifted up his eyes and saw the morning the morning like an angel in golden armour marching down the steeps      it seemed to him that before this splendour he and this blind world in the valley and his love and all were no more than a pit of sin  he did not turn aside as he had meant to do but went on and passed through the wall of the circumference and out upon the rocks and his eyes were always upon the sunlit ice and snow  he saw their infinite beauty and his imagination soared over them to the things beyond he was now to resign for ever  he thought of that great free world that he was parted from the world that was his own and he had a vision of those further slopes distance beyond distance with bogota a place of multitudinous stirring beauty a glory by day a luminous mystery by night a place of palaces and fountains and statues and white houses lying beautifully in the middle distance  he thought how for a day or so one might come down through passes drawing ever nearer and nearer to its busy streets and ways  he thought of the river journey day by day from great bogota to the still vaster world beyond through towns and villages forest and desert places the rushing river day by day until its banks receded and the big steamers came splashing by and one had reached the seathe limitless sea with its thousand islands its thousands of islands and its ships seen dimly far away in their incessant journeyings round and about that greater world  and there unpent by mountains one saw the skythe sky not such a disc as one saw it here but an arch of immeasurable blue a deep of deeps in which the circling stars were floating      his eyes began to scrutinise the great curtain of the mountains with a keener inquiry  for example if one went so up that gully and to that chimney there then one might come out high among those stunted pines that ran round in a sort of shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed above the gorge  and then  that talus might be managed thence perhaps a climb might be found to take him up to the precipice that came below the snow and if that chimney failed then another farther to the east might serve his purpose better and then  then one would be out upon the amberlit snow there and halfway up to the crest of those beautiful desolations  and suppose one had good fortune  he glanced back at the village then turned right round and regarded it with folded arms  he thought of medinasarote and she had become small and remote  he turned again towards the mountain wall down which the day had come to him  then very circumspectly he began his climb  when sunset came he was not longer climbing but he was far and high his clothes were torn his limbs were bloodstained he was bruised in many places but he lay as if he were at his ease and there was a smile on his face  from where he rested the valley seemed as if it were in a pit and nearly a mile below  already it was dim with haze and shadow though the mountain summits around him were things of light and fire  the mountain summits around him were things of light and fire and the little things in the rocks near at hand were drenched with light and beauty a vein of green mineral piercing the grey a flash of small crystal here and there a minute minutelybeautiful orange lichen close beside his face  there were deep mysterious shadows in the gorge blue deepening into purple and purple into a luminous darkness and overhead was the illimitable vastness of the sky  but he heeded these things no longer but lay quite still there smiling as if he were content now merely to have escaped from the valley of the blind in which he had thought to be king  and the glow of the sunset passed and the night came and still he lay there under the cold clear stars
