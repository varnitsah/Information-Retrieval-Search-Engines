66010048	maintravelled roads   by  hamlin garland     to  my father and mother whose halfcentury pilgrimage on the maintravelled road of life has brought them only toil and deprivation this book of stories is dedicated by a son to whom every day brings a deepening sense of his parents silent heroism     the maintravelled road in the west as everywhere is hot and dusty in summer and desolate and drear with mud in fall and spring and in winter the winds sweep the snow across it but it does sometimes cross a rich meadow where the songs of the larks and bobolinks and blackbirds are tangled follow it far enough it may lead past a bend in the river where the water laughs eternally over its shallows  mainly it is long and wearyful and has a dull little town at one end and a home of toil at the other like the maintravelled road of life it is traversed by many classes of people but the poor and the weary predominate     table of contents    preface   a branch road   up the coulee   among the corn rows   the return of a private   under the lions paw   the creamery man   a days pleasure   mrs ripleys trip   uncle ethan ripley   gods ravens   a good fellows wife     preface  in the summer of 1887 after having been three years in boston and six years absent from my old home in northern iowa i found myself with money enough to pay my railway fare to ordway south dakota where my father and mother were living and as it cost very little extra to go by way of dubuque and charles city i planned to visit osage iowa and the farm we had opened on dry run prairie in 1871  up to this time i had written only a few poems and some articles descriptive of boy life on the prairie although i was doing a good deal of thinking and lecturing on land reform and was regarded as a very intense disciple of herbert spencer and henry george a singular combination as i see it now on my way westward that summer day in 1887 rural life presented itself from an entirely new angle the ugliness the endless drudgery and the loneliness of the farmers lot smote me with stern insistence i was the militant reformer  the farther i got from chicago the more depressing the landscape became it was bad enough in our former home in mitchell county but my pity grew more intense as i passed from northwest iowa into southern dakota the houses bare as boxes dropped on the treeless plains the barbedwire fences running at right angles and the towns mere assemblages of flimsy wooden sheds with paintedpine battlement produced on me the effect of an almost helpless and sterile poverty  my dark mood was deepened into bitterness by my fathers farm where i found my mother imprisoned in a small cabin on the enormous sunburned treeless plain with no expectation of ever living anywhere else deserted by her sons and failing in health she endured the discomforts of her life uncomplaininglybut my resentment of things as they are deepened during my talks with her neighbors who were all housed in the same unshaded cabins in equal poverty and loneliness the fact that at twentyseven i was without power to aid my mother in any substantial way added to my despairing mood  my savings for the two years of my teaching in boston were not sufficient to enable me to purchase my return ticket and when my father offered me a stackers wages in the harvest field i accepted and for two weeks or more proved my worth with the fork which was still mightierwith methan the pen  however i did not entirely neglect the pen in spite of the dust and heat of the wheat rieks i dreamed of poems and stories my mind teemed with subjects for fiction and one sunday morning i set to work on a story which had been suggested to me by a talk with my mother and a few hours later i read to her seated on the low sill of that treeless cottage the first two thousand words of mrs ripleys trip the first of the series of sketches which became maintravelled roads  i did not succeed in finishing it however till after my return to boston in september during the fall and winter of 87 and the winter and spring of 88 i wrote the most of the stories in maintravelled roads a novelette for the century magazine and a play called under the wheel the actual work of the composition was carried on in the south attic room of doctor crosss house at 21 seaverns avenue jamaica plain  the mood of bitterness in which these books were written was renewed and augmented by a second visit to my parents in 1889 for during my stay my mother suffered a stroke of paralysis due to overwork and the dreadful heat of the summer she grew better before the time came for me to return to my teaching in boston but i felt like a sneak as i took my way to the train leaving my mother and sister on that bleak and sunbaked plain  old paps flaxen jason edwards a spoil of office and most of the stories gathered into the second volume of maintravelled roads were written in the shadow of these defeats if they seem unduly austere let the reader remember the times in which they were composed that they were true of the farms of that day no one can know better than i for i was therea farmer  life on the farms of iowa and wisconsineven on the farms of dakotahas gained in beauty and security i will admit but there are still wide stretches of territory in kansas and nebraska where the farmhouse is a lonely shelter groves and lawns better roads the rural free delivery the telephone and the motorcar have done much to bring the farmer into a frame of mind where he is contented with his lot but much remains to be done before the stream of young life from the country to the city can be checked  the two volumes of maintravelled roads can now be taken to be what william dean howells called them historical fiction for they form a record of the farmers life as i lived it and studied it in these two books is a record of the privations and hardships of the men and women who subdued the midland wilderness and prepared the way for the present golden age of agriculture  hg  march 1 1922      a branch road   i  keep the maintravelled road till you come to a branch leading offkeep to the right  in the windless september dawn a voice went singing a mans voice singing a cheap and common air yet something in the elan of it all told he was young jubilant and a happy lover  above the level belt of timber to the east a vast dome of pale undazzling gold was rising silently and swiftly jays called in the thickets where the maples flamed amid the green oaks with irregular splashes of red and orange the grass was crisp with frost under the feet the road smooth and graywhite in color the air was indescribably sweet resonant and stimulating no wonder the man sang  he came into view around the curve in the lane he had a fork on his shoulder a graceful and polished tool his straw hat was tilted on the back of his head his rough faded coat was buttoned close to the chin and he wore thin buckskin gloves on his hands he looked muscular and intelligent and was evidently about twentytwo or three years of age  as he walked on and the sunrise came nearer to him he stopped his song the broadening heavens had a majesty and sweetness that made him forget the physical joy of happy youth he grew almost sad with the great vague thoughts and emotions which rolled in his brain as the wonder of the morning grew  he walked more slowly mechanically following the road his eyes on the evershifting streaming banners of rose and pale green which made the east too glorious for any words to tell the air was so still it seemed to await expectantly the coming of the sun  then his mind flew back to agnes would she see it she was at work getting breakfast but he hoped she had time to see it he was in that mood so common to him now when he could not fully enjoy any sight or sound unless he could share it with her far down the road he heard the sharp clatter of a wagon the roosters were calling near and far in many keys and tunes the dogs were barking cattle bells jangling in the wooded pastures and as the youth passed farmhouses lights in the kitchen windows showed that the women were astir about breakfast and the sound of voices and currycombs at the barn told that the men were at their daily chores  and the east bloomed broader the dome of gold grew brighter the faint clouds here and there flamed with a flush of red the frost began to glisten with a reflected color the youth dreamed as he walked his broad face and deep earnest eyes caught and reflected some of the beauty and majesty of the sky  but as he passed a farm gate and a young man of about his own age joined him his brow darkened the other man was equipped for work like himself  hello will  hello ed  going down to help dingman thrash  yes replied will shortly it was easy to see he didnt welcome company  som i whos goin to do your thrashindave mcturg  yes i guess so havent spoken to anybody yet  they walked on side by side will didnt feel like being rudely broken in on in this way the two men were rivals but will being the victor would have been magnanimous only he wanted to be alone with his lovers dream  when do you go back to the sem ed asked after a little  term begins next week ill make a break about second week  les see you graduate next year dont yeh  i expect to if i dont slip up on it  they walked on side by side both handsome fellows ed a little more showy in his face which had a certain cleancut precision of line and a peculiar clear pallor that never browned under the sun he chewed vigorously on a quid of tobacco one of his most noticeable bad habits  teams could be heard clattering along on several roads now and jovial voices singing one team coming along behind the two men the driver sung out in goodnatured warning get out o the way there and with a laugh and a chirp spurred his horses to pass them  ed with a swift understanding of the drivers trick flung out his left hand and caught the endgate threw his fork in and leaped after it will walked on disdaining attempt to catch the wagon on all sides now the wagons of the plowmen or threshers were getting out into the fields with a pounding rumbling sound  the pale red sun was shooting light through the leaves and warming the boles of the great oaks that stood in the yard and melting the frost off the great gaudy threshing machine that stood between the stacks the interest picturesqueness of it all got hold of will hannan accustomed to it as he was the homes stood about in a circle hitched to the ends of the six sweeps all shining with frost  the driver was oiling the great tarry cogwheels underneath laughing fellows were wrestling about the yard ed kinney had scaled the highest stack and stood ready to throw the first sheaf the sun lighting him where he stood made his fork handle gleam like dull gold cheery words jests and snatches of song everywhere dingman bustled about giving his orders and placing his men and the voice of big dave mcturg was heard calling to the men as they raised the long stacker into place  heaveho there up she rises  and best of all will caught a glirnpse of a smiling girl face at the kitchen window that made the blood beat in his throat  hello will was the general greeting given with some constraint by most of the young fellows for will had been going to rock river to school for some years and there was a little feeling of jealousy on the part of those who pretended to sneer at the seminary chaps like will hannan and milton jennings  dingrnan came up will i guess youd better go on the stack with ed  all ready hurrah there said david in his soft but resonant bass voice that always had a laugh in it come come every sucker of yeh git hold o something all ready he waved his hand at the driver who climbed upon his platform everybody scrambled into place  chk chk all ready boys stiddy there dan chk chk all ready boys stiddy there boys all ready now the horses began to strain at the sweeps the cylinder began to hum  grab a root there wheres my band cutter here you climb on here and david reached down and pulled shep watson up by the shoulder with his gigantic hand  boooooom boowoowoooomoomowowm yarryarr the whirling cylinder boomed roared and snarled as it rose in speed at last when its tone became a rattling yell david nodded to the pitchers rasped his hands together the sheaves began to fall from the stack the band cutter knife in hand slashed the bands in twain and the feeder with easy majestic motion gathered them under his arm rolled them out into an even belt of entering wheat on which the cylinder tore with its frightful ferocious snarl  will was very happy in its quiet way he enjoyed the smooth roll of his great muscles the sense of power he felt in his hands as he lifted turned and swung the heavy sheaves two by two down upon the table where the band cutter madly slashed away his frame sturdy rather than tall was nevertheless lithe and he made a fine figure to look at so agnes thought as she came out a moment and bowed and smiled to both the young men  this scene one of the jolliest and most sociable of the western farm had a charm quite aside from human companionship the beautiful yellow straw entering the cylinder the clear yellowbrown wheat pulsing out at the side the broken straw chaff and dust puffing out on the great stacker the cheery whistling and calling of the driver the keen crisp air and the bright sun somehow weirdly suggestive of the passage of time  will and agnes had arrived at a tacit understanding of mutual love only the night before and will was powerfully moved to glance often toward the house but feared somehow the jokes of his companions he worked on therefore methodically eagerly but his thoughts were on the futurethe rustle of the oak tree nearby the noise of whose sere leaves he could distinguish beneath the booming snarl of the machine on the sky where great fleets of clouds were sailing on the rising wind like merchantmen bound to some land of love and plenty  when the dingmans first came in only a couple of years before agnes had been at once surrounded by a swarm of suitors her pleasant face and her abounding good nature made her an instant favorite with all will however had disdained to become one of the crowd and held himself aloof as he could easily do being away at school most of the time  the second winter however agnes also attended the seminary and will saw her daily and grew to love her he had been just a bit jealous of ed kinney all the time for ed had a certain rakish grace in dancing and a dashing skill in handling a team which made him a dangerous rival  but as will worked beside him all this monday he felt so secure in his knowledge of the caress agnes had given him at parting the night before that he was perfectly happyso happy that he didnt care to talk only to work on and dream as he worked  shrewd david mcturg had his joke when the machine stopped for a few minutes well you fellers do bettern i expected yeh to after bein out so late last night the first feller i find gappin has got to treat to the apples  keep your eye on me said shep  you laughed one of the others anybody knows if a girl so much as looked crossways at you youd fall in a fit  another thing said david i cant have you fellers carryin grain going to the house too often for fried cakes or cookies  now you git out said bill young from the straw pile you aint goin to have all the fun to yerself  wills blood began to grow hot in his face if bill had said much more or mentioned her name he would have silenced him to have this rough joking come so close upon the holiest and most exquisite evening of his life was horrible it was not the words they said but the tones they used that vulgarized it all he breathed a sigh of relief when the sound of the machine began again  this jesting made him more wary and when the call for dinner sounded and he knew he was going in to see her he shrank from it he took no part in the race of the dustblackened halffamished men to get at the washing place first he took no part in the scurry to get seats at the first table  threshing time was always a season of great trial to the housewife to have a dozen men with the appetites of dragons to cook for was no small task for a couple of women in addition to their other everyday duties preparations usually began the night before with a raid on a hen roost for biled chickun formed the piece de resistance of the dinner the table enlarged by boards filled the sitting room extra seats were made out of planks placed on chairs and dishes were borrowed of neighbors who came for such aid in their turn  sometimes the neighboring women came in to help but agnes and her mother were determined to manage the job alone this year and so the girl with a neat dark dress her eyes shining her cheeks flushed with the work received the men as they came in dusty coatless with grime behind their ears but a jolly good smile on every face  most of them were farmers of the neighborhood and schoolmates the only one she shrank from was young with his hard glittering eyes and red sordid face she received their jokes their noise with a silent smile which showed her even teeth and dimpled her round cheek she was good for sore eyes as one of the fellows said to shep she seemed deliciously sweet and dainty to these roughly dressed fellows  they ranged along the table with a great deal of noise boots thumping squeaking knives and forks rattling voices bellowing out  now hold on steve cant have yeh so near that chickun  move along shep i want to be next to the kitchen door i wont get nothin with you on that side o me  oh thats too thin i see what youre  no i wont need any sugar if you just smile into it this from gallant david greeted with roars of laughter  now dave spose your wife ud hear o that  shed snatch im baldheaded thats what shed do  say somebody drive that ceow down this way said bill  dont get off that drive its too old criticised shep passing the milk jug  potatoes were seized cut in halves sopped in gravy and taken one two corn cakes went into great jaws like coal into a steam engine knives in the right hand cut and scooped gravy up great muscular grimy but wholesome fellows they were feeding like ancient norse and capable of working like demons they were deep in the process halfhidden by steam from the potatoes and stew in less than sixty seconds from their entrance  with a shrinking from the comments of the others upon his regard for agnes will assumed a reserved and almost haughty air toward his fellow workmen and a curious coldness toward her as he went in she came forward smiling brightly  theres one more place will a tender involuntary droop in her voice betrayed her and will felt a wave of hot blood surge over him as the rest roared  ha ha oh thered be a place for him  dont worry will always room for you here  will took his seat with a sudden angry flame why cant she keep it from these fools was his thought he didnt even thank her for showing him the chair  she flushed vividly but smiled back she was so proud and happy she didnt care very much if they did know it but as will looked at her with that quick angry glance and took his seat with scowling brow she was hurt and puzzled she redoubled her exertions to please him and by so doing added to the amusement of the crowd that gnawed chicken bones rattled cups knives and forks and joked as they ate with small grace and no material loss of time  will remained silent through it all eating in marked contrast to the others using his fork instead of his knife in eating his potato and drinking his tea from his cup rather than from his saucerfinickies which did not escape the notice of the girl nor the sharp eyes of  the other workmen  see that thats the way we do down to the sem see fork for pie in yer right hand hey i cant do it watch me  when agnes leaned over to say wont you have some more tea will they nudged each other and grinned aha what did i tell you  agnes saw at last that for some reason will didnt want her to show her regard for him that be was ashamed of it in some way and she was wounded to cover it up she resorted to the feminine device of smiling and chatting with the others she asked ed if he wouldnt have another piece of pie  i willwith a fork please  this is bout the only place you can use a fork said bill young anticipating a laugh by his own broad grin  oh thats too old said shep watson dont drag that out agin a man thatll eat seven taters  shows who docs the work  yes with his jaws put in jim wheelock the driver if youd put in a little more work with soap n water before comin in to dinner it ud be a religious idee said david  it aint healthy to wash  well youll live forever then  he aint washed his face sence i knew  im  oh thats a little too tought he washes once a week said ed kinney  back of his ears inquired david who was munching a doughnut his black eyes twinkling with fun  whats the cause of it  dade says she wont kiss im if he dont everybody roared  good fer dade i wouldnt if i was in her place  wheelock gripped a chicken leg imperturbably and left it bare as a toothpick with one or two bites at it his face shone in two clean sections around his nose and mouth behind his ears the dirt lay undisturbed the grease on his hands could not be washed off  will began to suffer now because agnes treated the other fellows too well with a lovers exacting jealousy he wanted her in some way to hide their tenderness from the rest but to show her indifference to men like young and kinney he didnt stop to inquire of himself the justice of such a demand nor just how it was to be done he only insisted she ought to do it  he rose and left the table at the end of his dinner without having spoken to her without even a tender significant glance and he knew too that she was troubled and hurt but he was suffering it seemed as if he had lost something sweet lost it irrecoverably  he noticed ed kinney and bill young were the last to come out just before the machine started up again after dinner and he saw them pause outside the threshold and laugh back at agnes standing in the doorway why couldnt she keep those fellows at a distance not go out of her way to bandy jokes with them  some way the elation of the morning was gone he worked on doggedly now without looking up without listening to the leaves without seeing the sunlighted clouds of course he didnt think that she meant anything by it but it irritated him and made him unhappy she gave herself too freely  toward the middle of the afternoon the machine stopped for a time for some repairing and while will lay on his stack in the bright yellow sunshine shelling wheat in his hands and listening to the wind in the oaks he heard his name and her name mentioned on the other side of the machine where the measuring box stood he listened  shes pretty sweet on him aint she did yeh notus how she stood around over him  yes an did yeh see him when she passed the cup o tea down over his shoulder  will got up white with wrath as they laughed  some way he didnt seem to enjoy it as i would i wish shed reach her arm over my neck that way  will walked around the machine and came on the group lying on the chaff near the straw pile  say i want you fellers to understand that i wont have any more of this talk i wont have it  there was a dead silence then bill young rose up  what yeh goen to do about it he sneered  im going to stop it  the wolf rose in young he moved forward his ferocious soul flaming from his eyes  wy you damned seminary dude i can break you in two  an answering glare came into wills eyes he grasped and slightly shook his fork which he had brought with him unconsciously  if you make one motion at me ill smash your head like an eggshell his voice was low but terrific there was a tone in it that made his own blood stop in his veins if you think im going to roll around on this ground with a hyena like you youve mistaken your man ill kill you but i wont fight with such men as you are  bill quailed and slunk away muttering some epithet like coward  i dont care what you call me but just remember what i say you keep your tongue off that girls affairs  thats the talk said david stand up for your girl always but dont use a fork you can handle him without that  i dont propose to try said will as he turned away as be did so he caught a glimpse of ed kinney at the well pumping a pail of water for agnes who stood beside him the sun on her beautiful yellow hair she was laughing at something ed was saying as he slowly moved the handle up and down  instantly like a foaming turbid flood his rage swept out toward her its all her fault he thought grinding his teeth shes a fool if shed hold herself in like other girls but no she must smile and smile at everybody it was a beautiful picture but it sent a shiver through him  he worked on with teeth set white with rage he had an impulse that would have made him assault her with words as with a knife he was possessed with a terrible passion which was hitherto latent in him and which he now felt to be his worst self but he was powerless to exorcise it his set teeth ached with the stress of his muscular tension and his eyes smarted with the strain  he had always prided himself on being cool calm above these absurd quarrels that his companions had so often indulged in he didnt suppose he could be so moved as he worked on his rage settled down into a sort of stubborn bitternessstubborn bitterness of conflict between this evil nature and his usual self it was the instinct of possession the organic feeling of proprietorship of a woman which rose to the surface and mastered him he was not a selfanalyst of course being young though he was more introspective than the ordinary farmer  he had a great deal of time to think it over as he worked on there pitching the heavy bundles but still he did not get rid of the miserable desire to punish agnes and when she came out looking very pretty in her straw hat and came around near his stack he knew she came to see him to have an explanation a smile and yet he worked away with his hat pulled over his eyes hardly noticing her  ed went over to the edge of the stack and chatted with her and shepoor girlfeeling wills neglect could only put a good face on the matter and show that she didnt mind it by laughing back at ed  all this will saw though he didnt appear to be looking and when jim wheelockdirty jimwith his whip in his hand came up and playfully pretended to pour oil on her hair and she laughingly struck at him with a handful of straw will wouldnt have looked at her if she had called him by name  she looked so bright and charming in her snowy apron and her boys straw hat tipped jauntily over one pink ear that david and steve and bill and even shep found a way to get a word with her and the poor fellows in the high straw pile looked their disappoimment and shook their forks in mock rage at the lucky dogs on the ground but will worked on like a fiend while the dapples of light and shade fell on the bright face of the merry girl  to save his soul from hell flames he couldnt have gone over there and smiled at her it was impossible a wall of bronze seemed to have arisen between them yesterday last night seemed a dream the clasp of her hands at his neck the touch of her lips were like the caresses of an ideal in some dim reverie  as night drew on the men worked with a steadier more mechanical action no one spoke now each man was intent on his work no one had any strength or breath to waste the driver on his power changed his weight on weary feet and whistled and sang at the tired horses the feeder his face gray with dust rolled the grain into the cylinder so even so steady so swift that it ran on with a sullen booming roar far up on the straw pile the stackers worked with the steady rhythmic action of men rowing a boat their figures looming vague and dim in the flying dust and chaff outlined against the glorious yellow and orangetinted clouds  pheeeewee whistled the driver with the sweet cheery rising notes of a bird chk chk chk pheeeewee go on there boys chk chk chk step up there dan step up snap pheeeewee gwangwan gwan chk clik chk wheest wheest wheest clik chk  in the house the women were setting the table for supper the sun had gone down behind the oaks flinging glorious rose color and orange shadows along the edges of the slateblue clouds agnes stopped her work at the kitchen window to look up at the sky and cry silently what was the matter with will she felt a sort of distrust of him now she thought she knew him so well but now he was so strange  come aggie said mrs dingman theyre gettin most down to the bottom of the stack theyll be pilin in here soon  pheeeewee gwan doll gwan boys chk chk chk pheeeewee called the driver out in the dusk cheerily swinging the whip over the horses backs boomoooooom roared the machine with a muffled monotonous solemn tone gwan boys gwan gwan  will had worked unceasingly all day his muscles ached with fatigue his hands trembled he clenched his teeth however and worked on determined not to yield he wanted them to understand that he could do as much pitching as any of them and read caesars commentaries besides it seemed as if each bundle were the last he could raise the sinews of his wrist pained him so they seemed swollen to twice their natural size but still he worked on grimly while the dusk fell and the air grew chill  at last the bottom bundle was pitched up and he got down on his knees to help scrape the loose wheat into baskets what a sweet relief it was to kneel down to release the fork and let the worn and cramping muscles settle into rest a new note came into the drivers voice a soothing tone full of kindness and admiration for the work his team had done  wooo lads stiddyyy boys wooo there dan stiddy stiddy old man ho there the cylinder took on a lower key with short rising yells as it ran empty for a moment the horses had been going so long that they came to a stop reluctantly at last david called turn out the men seized the ends of the sweep david uncoupled the tumbling rods and shep threw a sheaf of grain into the cylinder choking it into silence  the stillness and the dusk were very impressive so long had the bellmetal cogwheel sung its deafening song into wills ear that as he walked away into the dusk he had a weird feeling of being suddenly deaf and his legs were so numb that he could hardly feel the earth he stumbled away like a man paralyzed  he took out his handkerchief wiped the dust from his face as best he could shook his coat dusted his shoulders with a grain sack and was starting away when mr dingman a rather feeble elderly man came up  come will suppers all ready go in and eat  i guess ill go home to supper  oh no that wont do the womenll be expecting yeh to stay  the men were laughing at the well the warm yellow light shone from the kitchen the chill air making it seem very inviting and she was there waiting but the demon rose in him he knew agnes would expect him that she would cry that night with disappointment but his face hardened i guess ill go home he said and his tone was relentless he turned and walked away hungry tiredso tired he stumbled and so unhappy he could have wept   ii  on thursday the county fair was to be held the fair is one of the gala days of the year in the country districts of the west and one of the times when the country lover rises above expense to the extravagance of hiring a top buggy in which to take his sweetheart to the neighboring town  it was customary to prepare for this long beforehand for the demand for top buggies was so great the liverymen grew dictatorial and took no chances slowly but surely the country beaux began to compete with the clerks and in many cases actually outbid them as they furnished their own horses and could bid higher in consequence on the carriages  will had secured his brothers rig and early on thursday morning he was at work busily washing the mud from the carriage dusting the cushions and polishing up the buckles and rosettes on his horses harnesses it was a beautiful crisp clear dawnthe ideal day for a ride and will was singing as he worked he had regained his real sell and having passed through a bitter period of shame was now joyous with anticipation of forgiveness he looked forward to the day with its chances of doing a thousand little things to show his regret and his love  he had not seen agnes since monday because tuesday he did not go back to help thresh and wednesday he had been obliged to go to town to see about board for the coming term but he felt sure of her it had all been arranged the sunday before shed expect him and he was to call at eight oclock  he polished up the colts with merry ticktack of the brush and comb and after the last stroke on their shining limbs threw his tools in the box and went to the house  pretty sharp last night said his brother john who was scrubbing his face at the cistern  should say so by that rim of ice will replied dipping his hands into the icy water  i oughto stay home today an dig tates continued the older man thoughtfully as they went into the woodshed and wiped consecutively on the long roller towel some o them early rose lay right on top o the ground theyll get nipped sure  oh i guess not youd better go jack you dont get away very often and then it would disappoint nettie and the children so their little hearts are overflowing he ended as the door opened and two sturdy little boys rushed out  bekfuss poppa all yeady  the kitchen table was set near the stove the room was full of sun and the smell of sizzling sausages and the aroma of coffee filled the room the kettle was doing its duty cheerily and the wife with flushed face and smiling eyes was hurrying to and fro her heart full of anticipation of the days outing  there was a hilarity almost like some strange intoxication on the part of the two children they danced and chattered and clapped their chubby brown hands and ran to the windows ceaselessly  is yuncle will goin yide flour buggy  yus the buggy and the colts  is he goin to take his girl  will blushed a little and john roared  yes im goin  is aggie your girl  hyer hyer young man called john youre gettin personal  well set up said nettie and with a good deal of clatter they drew around the cheerful table  will had already begun to see the pathos the pitiful significance of this great joy over a days outing and he took himself a little to task at his own selfish freedom he resolved to stay at home some time and let nettie go in his place a few hours in the middle of the day on sunday three or four holidays in summer the rest for this cheerful little wife and her patient husband was workwork that some way accomplished so little and left no trace on their souls that was beautiful  while they were eating breakfast teams began to clatter by huge lumber wagons with three seats across and a boy or two jouncing up and down with the dinner baskets near the endgate the children rushed to the window each time to announce who it was and how many there were in  but as johnny said firteen each time and ned wavered between seven and sixteen it was doubtful if they could be relied upon they had very little appetite so keen was their anticipation of the ride and the wonderful sights before them their little hearts shuddered with joy at every fresh token of preparationa joy that made will say poor little men  they vibrated between the house and the barn while the chores were being finished and their happy cries started the young roosters into a renewed season of crowing and when at last the wagon was brought out and the horses hitched to it they danced like mad sprites  after they had driven away will brought out the colts hitched them in and drove them to the hitching post then he leisurely dressed himself in his best suit blacked his boots with considerable exertion and at about 730 oclock climbed into his carriage and gathered up the reins  he was quite happy again the crisp bracing air the strong pull of the spirited young team put all thought of sorrow behind him he had planned it all out he would first put his arm around her and kiss herthere would not need to be any words to tell her how sorry and ashamed he was she would know  now when he was alone and going toward her on a beautiful morning the anger and bitterness of monday fled away became unreal and the sweet dream of the sunday parting grew the reality she was waiting for him now she had on her pretty blue dress and the wide hat that always made her look so arch he had said about eight oclock  the swift team was carrying him along the crossroad which was little travelled and he was alone with his thoughts he fell again upon his plans another year at school for them both and then hed go into a law office judge brown had told him hed give himwhoa ho  there was a swift lurch that sent him flying over the dasher a confused vision of a roadside ditch full of weeds and bushes and then he felt the reins in his hands and heard the snorting horses trample on the hard road  he rose dizzy bruised and covered with dust the team he held securely and soon quieted he saw the cause of it all the right forewheel had come off letting the front of the buggy drop he unhitched the excited team from the carriage drove them to the fence and tied them securely then went back to find the wheel and the nut whose failure to hold its place had done all the mischief he soon had the wheel on but to find the burr was a harder task back and forth he ranged looking scraping in the dust searching the weeds  he knew that sometimes a wheel will run without the burr for many rods before corning off and so each time he extended his search he traversed the entire halfmile several times each time his rage and disappointment getting more bitter he ground his teeth in a fever of vexation and dismay  he had a vision of agnes waiting wondering why he did not come it was this vision that kept him from seeing the burr in the wheeltrack partly covered by a clod  once he passed it looking wildly at his watch which was showing nine oclock another time he passed it with eyes dimmed with a mist that was almost tears of anger  there is no contrivance that will replace an axle burr and farmyards have no unused axle burrs and so will searched each moment he said ill give it up get onto one of the horses and go down and tell her but searching for a lost axle burr is like fishing the searcher expects each moment to find it and so he groped and ran breathlessly furiously back and forth and at last kicked away the clod that covered it and hurried hot and dusty cursing his stupidity back to the team  it was ten oclock as he climbed again into the buggy and started his team on a swift trot down the road what would she think he saw her now with tearful eyes and pouting lips she was sitting at the window with hat and gloves on the rest had gone and she was waiting for him  but shed know something had happened because he had promised to be there at eight he had told her what team hed have he had forgotten at this moment the doubt and distrust he had given her on monday shed know hed surely come  but there was no smiling or tearful face watching at the window as he came down the lane at a tearing pace and turned into the yard the house was silent and the curtains down the silence sent a chill to his heart something rose up in his throat to choke him  agnes he called hello im here at last  there was no reply as he sat there the part he had played on monday came back to him she may be sick he thought with a cold thrill of fear  an old man came around the corner of the house with a potato fork in his hands his teeth displayed in a grin  she aint here shes gone  gone  yesmoren an hour ago  whod she go with  ed kinney said the old fellow with a malicious grin i guess your goose is cooked  will lashed the horses into a run and swung round the yard and out of the gate his face was white as a dead mans and his teeth were set like a vise he glared straight ahead the team ran wildly steadily homeward while their driver guided them unconsciously he did not see them his mind was filled with a tempest of rages despairs and shames  that ride he will never forget in it he threw away all his plans he gave up his years schooling he gave up his law aspirations he deserted his brother and his friends in the dizzying whirl of passions he had only one clear ideato get away to go west to get away from the sneers and laughter of his neighbors and to make her suffer by it all  he drove into the yard did not stop to unharness the team but rushed into the house and began packing his trunk his plan was formed which was to drive to cedarville and hire someone to bring the team back he had no thought of anything but the shame the insult she had put upon him her action on monday took on the same levity it wore then and excited him in the same way he saw her laughing with ed over his dismay he sat down and wrote a letter to her at lasta letter that came from the ferocity of the medieval savage in him  it you want to go to hell with ed kinney you can i wont say a word thats where hell take you you wont see me again  this he signed and sealed and then he bowed his head and wept like a girl but his tears did not soften the effect of the letter it went as straight to its mark as he meant it should it tore a seared and ragged path to an innocent happy heart and be took a savage pleasure in the thought of it as he rode away on the cars toward the south   iii  the seven years lying between 1880 and 1887 made a great change in rock river and in the adjacent farming land signs changed and firms went out of business with characteristic western ease of shift the trees grew rapidly dwarfing the houses beneath them and contrasts of newness and decay thickened  will found the country changed as he walked along the dusty road from rock river toward the corners the landscape was at its fairest and liberalest with its seas of corn deep green and moving with a mournful rustle in sharp contrast to its flashing blades its gleaming fields of barley and its wheat already mottled with soft gold in the midst of its peagreen  the changes were in the hedges grown higher in the greater predominance of cornfields and cattle pastures but especially in the destruction of homes as he passed on will saw the grass growing and cattle feeding on a dozen places where homes had once stood they had given place to the large farm and the stock raiser still the whole scene was bountiful and very beautiful to the eye  it was especially grateful to will for he had spent nearly all his years of absence among the rocks treeless swells and bleak cliffs of the southwest the crickets rising before his dusty feet appeared to him something sweet and suggestive and the cattle feeding in the clover moved him to deep thoughtthey were so peaceful and slowmotioned  as he reached a little popple tree by the roadside he stopped removed his broadbrimmed hat put his elbows on the fence and looked hungrily upon the scene the sky was deeply blue with only here and there a huge heavy slowmoving massive sharply outlined cloud sailing like a berg of ice in a shoreless sea of azure  in the fields the men were harvesting the ripened oats and barley and the sound of their machines clattering now low now loud came to his ears flies buzzed near him and a king bird clattered overhead he noticed again as he had many a time when a boy that the softened sound of the faroff reaper was at times exactly like the hum of a bluebottle fly buzzing heedlessly about his ears  a slender and very handsome young man was shocking grain near the fence working so desperately he did not see will until greeted by him he looked up replied to the greeting but kept on till he had finished his last stook then he came to the shade of the tree and took off his hat  nice day to sit under a tree and fish  will smiled i ought to know you i suppose i used to live here years ago  guess not we came in three years ago  the young man was quickspoken and very pleasant to look at will felt freer with him  are the kinneys still living over there he nodded at a group of large buildings  tom lives there old man lives with ed tom ousted the old man some way nobody seems to know how and so he lives with ed  will wanted to ask after agnes but hardly felt able i spose john hannan is on his old farm  yes got a good crop this year  will looked again at the fields of rustling wheat over which the clouds rippled and said with an air of conviction this lays over arizona dead sure  youre from arizona then  yesa good ways from it will replied in a way that stopped further question good luck he added as he walked on down the road toward the creek musing and the springi wonder if thats there yet id like a drink the sun seemed hotter than at noon and he walked slowly at the bridge that spanned the meadow brook just where it widened over a sandy ford he paused again he hung over the rail and looked at the minnows swimming there  i wonder if theyre the same identical chaps that used to boil and glitter there when i was a boylooks so men change from one generation to another but the fish remain the same the same eternal procession of types i suppose darwin ud say their environment remains the same  he hung for a long time over the railing thinking of a vast number of things mostly vague flitting things looking into the clear depths of the brook and listening to the delicious liquid note of a blackbird swinging on the willow red lilies starred the grass with fire and goldenrod and chicory grew everywhere purple and orange and yellowgreen the prevailing tints  suddenly a water snake wriggled across the dark pool above the ford and the minnows disappeared under the shadow of the bridge then will sighed lifted his head and walked on there seemed to be something prophetic in it and he drew a long breath thats the way his plans broke and faded away  human life does not move with the regularity of a clock in living there are gaps and silences when the soul stands still in its flight through abyssesand then there come times of trial and times of struggle when we grow old without knowing it body and soul change appallingly  seven years of hard busy life had made changes in will  his face had grown bold resolute and rugged some of its delicacy and all of its boyish quality gone his figure was stouter erect as of old but less graceful he bore himself like a man accustomed to look out for himself in all kinds of places it was only at times that there came into his deep eyes a preoccupied almost sad look that showed kinship with his old self  this look was on his face as he walked toward the clump of trees on the right of the road  he reached the grove of popple trees and made his way at once to the spring when he saw it it gave him a shock they had let it fill up with leaves and dirt  overcome by the memories of the past he flung himsell down on the cool and shadowy bank and gave himsell up to the bittersweet reveries of a man returning to his boyhoods home he was filled somehow with a strange and powerful feeling of the passage of time with a vague feeling of the mystery and elusiveness of human life the leaves whispered it overhead the birds sang it in chorus with the insects and far above in the measureless spaces of sky the hawk told it in the silence and majesty of his flight from cloud to cloud  it was a feeling hardly to be expressed in wordsone of those emotions whose springs lie far back in the brain he lay so still the chipmunks came curiously up to his very feet only to scurry away  when he stirred like a sleeper in pain  he had cut himself off entirely from the life at the corners he had sent money home to john but had concealed his own address carefully the enormity of this folly now came back to him racking him till he groaned  he heard the patter of feet and the halfmumbled monologue of a running child he roused up and faced a small boy who started back in terror like a wild fawn he was deeply surprised to find a man there where only boys and squirrels now came he stuck his fist in his eye and was backing away when will spoke  hold on sonny nobodys hit you come i aint goin to eat yeh he took a bit of money from his pocket come here and tell me your name i want to talk with you  the boy crept upon the dime  will smiled you ought to be a kinney what is your name  tomath dickinthon kinney im thix and a half ive got a colt lisped the youngster breathlessly as he crept toward the money  oh you are eh well now are you toms boy or eds  tomths boy uncle ed hith gal  ed got a boy  yeth thir lii baby aunt agg letth me hold im  agg is that her name  thats what uncle ed callth her  the mans head fell and it was a long time before he asked his next question  how is she anyhow  purty well piped the boy with a prolongation of the last words into a kind of chirp sheth been thick though he added  been sick how long  oh a long time but she aint thick abed sheth awuul poor though granpa thayth sheth poor ath a rake  oh he does eh  yeth thir uncle ed he jawth her then she crieth  wills anger and remorse broke out in a groaning curse o my god i see it all that great lunkin houn has made life a hell fer her then that letter came back to his mind he had never been able to put it out of his mindhe never would till he saw her and asked her pardon  here my boy i want you to tell me some more where does your aunt agnes live  at granpath you know where my granpa livth  well you do now i want you to take this letter to her give it to her he wrote a little note and folded it now dust out o here  the boy slipped away through the trees like a rabbit his little brown feet hardly rustled he was like some little wood animal left alone the man went back into a reverie that lasted till the shadows fell on the thick little grove around the spring he rose  last and taking his stick in hand walked out to the wood again and stood there gazing at the sky he seemed loath to go farther the sky was full of flamecolored clouds floating in a yellowgreen sea where bars of faint pink streamed broadly away  as he stood there feeling the wind lift his hair listening to the crickets everpresent crying and facing the majesty of space a strange sadness and despair came into his eyes  drawing a quick breath he leaped the fence and was about going on up the road when he heard at a little distance the sound of a drove of cattle approaching and he stood aside to allow them to pass they snuffed and shied at the silent figure by the fence and hurried by with snappug heelsa peculiar sound that made the man smile with pleasure  an old man was driving the cows crying out  st boy there go on there whay boss  will knew that hardfeatured wiry old man now entering his second childhood and beginning to limp painfully he had his hands full of hard clods which he threw impatiently at the lumbering animals  good evening uncle  i aint yr uncle young man  his dim eyes did not recognize the boy he had chased out of his plum patch years before  i dont know yeh neither  oh you will later on im from the east im a sort of a relative to john hannan  i wanto know if y be the old man exclaimed peering closer  yes im just up from rock

 but how is it made whats the fellers trade  hes a gamblerthats his trade he plays cards and every cent is bloody i wouldnt touch such money no how you could fix it  wouldnt hay the young man straightened up well lookahere old man did you ever hear of a man foreclosing a mortgage on a widow and two boys getting a farm fr one quarter what it was really worth you damned old hypocrite i know all about you and your whole tribeyou old bloodsucker  the old mans jaw fell he began to back away  your neighbors tell some good stories about you now skip along after those cows or ill tickle your old legs for you  the old man appalled and dazed at this sudden change of manner backed away and at last turned and racked off up the road looking back with a wild face at which the young man laughed remorselessly  the doggoned old skeesucks will soliloquized as he walked up the road so thats the kind of a character hes been givin me  hullo a whippoorwrn takes a man back into childhoodno dont whip poor will hes got all he can bear now  he came at last to the little farm dingman had owned and he stopped in sorrowful surprise the barn had been moved away the garden plowed up and the house turned into a granary stood with boards nailed across its dusty cobwebbed windows the tears started into the mans eyes he stood staring at it silently  in the face of this house the seven years that he had last lived stretched away into a wild waste of time it stood as a symbol of his wasted ruined life it was personal intimately personal this decay of her home  all that last scene came back to him the booming roar of the threshing machine the cheery whistle of the driver the loud merry shouts of the men he remembered how warmly the lamplight streamed out of that door as he turned away tired hungry sullen with rage and jealousy oh if he had only had the courage of a man  then he thought of the boys words she was sick ed abused her she had met her punishment a hundred times he had been over the whole scene a thousand times he had seen her at the pump smiling at ed kinney the sun lighting her bare head and he never thought of it without hardening  at this very gate he had driven up that last forenoon to find that she had gone with ed he had lived that sickening depressing moment over many times but not times enough to keep down the bitter passion he had felt then and felt now as he went over it in detail  he was so happy and confident that morning so perfectly certain that all would be made right by a kiss and a cheery jest and now here he stood sick with despair and doubt of all the world he turned away from the desolate homestead and walked on  but ill see herjust once more and then and again the mighty significance responsibility of life fell upon him he felt as young people seldom do the irrevocableness of living the determinate unalterable character of living he determined to begin to live in some new wayjust how he could not say  iv  old man kinney and his wife were getting their sunday school lessons with much bickering when will drove up the next day to the dilapidated gate and hitched his team to a leaning post under the oaks will saw the old mans head at the open window but no one else though he looked eagerly for agnes as he walked up the familiar path there stood the great oak under whose shade he had grown to be a man how close the great tree seemed to stand to his heart some way as the wind stirred in the leaves it was like a rustle of greeting  in that low old house they had all lived and his mother had toiled for thirty years a sort of prison after all there they were all born and there his father and his little sister had died and then it had passed into old kinneys hands  walking along up the path he felt a serious weakness in his limbs and he made a pretense of stopping to look at a flowerbed containing nothing but weeds after seven years of separation he was about to face once more the woman whose life came so near being a part of his agnes now a wife and a mother  how would she look would her face have that oldtime peachy bloom her mouth that peculiar beautiful curve she was large and fair he recalled hair yellow and shining eyes bluehe roused himself this was nonsense he was trembling he composed himself by looking around again  the old scoundrel has let the weeds choke out the flowers and surround the beehives old man kinney neverbelieved in anything but a petty utility  will set his teeth and marched up to the door and struck it like a man delivering a challenge kinney opened the door and started back in fear when he saw who it was  how de do how de do said will walking in his eyes fixed on a woman seated beyond a child in her lap  agnes rose without a word a fawnlike startled widening of the eyes her breath coming quick and her face flushing they couldnt speak they only looked at each other an instant then will shivered passed his hand over his eyes and sat down  there was no one there but the old people who were looking at him in bewilderment they did not notice any confusion in agness face she recovered first  im glad to see you back will she said rising and putting the sleeping child down in a neighboring room as she gave him her hand he said  im glad to get back agnes i hadnt ought to have gone then he turned to the old people im will hannan you neednt be scared daddy i was jokin last night  dew tell i wanto know exclaimed granny wal i never an youre my little willy boy who ust o he in my class well well wy pa aint he growed tall growed handsome tew i ust o think he was a drelful humly boy but my sakes that mustache  wal he give me a tumble scare last night my land scared me out of a years growth cackled the old man  this gave them all a chance to laugh and the air was cleared it gave agnes time to recover herself and to be able to meet wills eyes will himself was powerfully moved his throat swelled and tears came to his eyes everytime he looked at her  he was worn and wasted incredibly the blue of her eyes seemed dimmed and faded by weeping and the oldtime scariet of her lips had been washed away the sinews of her neck showed painfully when she turned her head and her trembling hands were worn discolored and lumpy at the joints  poor girl she felt that she was under scrutiny and her eyes felt hot and restless she wished to run away and cry but she dared not she stayed while will began to tell her of his life and to ask questions about old friends  the old people took it up and relieved her of any share in it and will seeing that she was suffering told some funny stories which made the old people cackle in spite of themselves  but it was forced merriment on wills part once in a while agnes smiled with just a little flash of the oldtime sunny temper but there was no dimple in the cheek now and the smile had more suggestion of an invalidr even a skeleton he was almost ready to take her in his arms and weep her face appealed so pitifully to him  its most time fr ed to be gittin back aint it pa  shd say twas he jist went over to hobkirks to trade horses its dretful tryin to me to have him go off tradin horses on sunday seems if he might wait till

you wish it  i do wish it  thank you i want to have a good visit with you i dont know when ill see you again  as she moved about getting dinner on the table will sat with gloomy face listening to the clack of the old man the room was a poor little sitting room with furniture worn and shapeless hardly a touch of pleasant color save here and there a little bit of agness handiwork the lounge covered with calico was rickety the rocking chair matched it and the carpet of rags was patched and darned with twine in twenty places everywhere was the influence of the kinneys the furniture looked like them in fact  agnes was outwardly calm but her real distraction did not escape mrs kinneys hawklike eyes  well i declare if you haint put the butter on in one o my blue chainy saucers now you know i dont allow that saucer to be took down by nobody i dont see whats got into yeh anybodyd spose you never see any compny bforewouldnt they pa  shd say th would said pa stopping short in a long story about ed seems if we couldnt keep anything in this house seprit from the rest ed he uses my currycomb  he launched out a long list of grievances which will shut his ears to as completely as possible and was thinking how to stop him when there was a sudden crash agnes had dropped a plate  good land o goshen screamed granny if you aint the worst i ever see ill bet thats my grapevine plate if it

stirring up the old folks everytime im out o the house  the speaker was ed now a tail and slouchily dressed man of thirtytwo or three his face still handsome in a certain dark cleanly cut style but he wore a surly look and lounged along in a sort of hangdog style in greasy overalls and vest unbuttoned  hello will i heard youd got home john told me as i came along  they shook bands and ed slouched down on the lounge will could have kicked him for laying the blame of the dispute upon agnes it showed him in a flash just how he treated her he disdained to quarrel he simply silenced and dominated her  will asked a few questions about crops with such grace as he could show and ed with keen eyes in his face talked easily and stridently  dinner ready he asked of agnes wheres pete  hes asleep  all right let im sleep well lets go out an set up come dad sling away that bible and come to grub mother what the devul are you sniffling at say now look here if i hear any more about this row ill simply

ones winked ed  no thank goodness it was a white one  well now ill git into that dodgasted cubberd some day an break the whole eternal outfit i aint goin to have this damned jawin goin on he ended brutally unconscious of his own jawin  after this the dinner proceeded in comparative silence agnes sobbing under breath the room was small and very hot the table was warped so badly that the dishes had a tendency to slide to the center the walls were bare plaster grayed with time the food was poor and scant and the flies absolutely swarmed upon everything like bees otherwise the room was clean and orderly  they say youve made a pile o money out west bill im glad of it we fellers back here dont make anything its a dam tight squeeze agg it seems to me the flies are devilish thick today cant you drive em out  agnes felt that she must vindicate herself a little i do drive em out but they come right in again the screen door is broken and they come right in  i told dad to fix that door  but

too much to do i havent strength left and im not fit anyway  agnes i want to say something to you not nowafter theyre gone  he went into the other room leaving her to wash the dinner things she worked on in a curious almost dazed way a dream of something sweet and irrevocable in her eyes he represented so much to her his voice brought up times and places that thrilled her like song he was associated with all that was sweetest and most carefree and most girlish in her life  ever since the boy had handed her that note she had been reliving those days in the midst of her drudgery she stopped to dreamto let some picture come back into her mind she was a student again at the seminary and stood in the recitation room with suffocating beat of the heart will was waiting outsidewaiting in a tremor like her own to walk home with her under the maples  then she remembered the painfully sweet mixture of pride and fear with which she walked up the aisle of the little church behind him her pretty new gown rustled the dim light of the church had something like romance in it and he was so strong and handsome her heart went out in a great silent cry to godoh let me be a girl again  she did not look forward to happiness she hadnt power to look forward at all  as she worked she heard the high shrill voices of the old people as they bustled about and nagged at each other  ma wheres my specticles  i aint seen yr specticles  you have too  i aint neither  you had em this forenoon  didnt no such thing them was my own brassbowed ones you had yourn jest fore goin to dinner if youd put em

agnes stood at the door to watch them drive away will studied her a smothering ache in his heart as he saw how thin and bent and weary she was in his soul he felt that she was a dying woman unless she had rest and tender care  as she turned she saw something in his facea pity and an agony of selfaccusationthat made her weak and white she sank into a chair putting her hand on her chest as if she felt a failing of breath then the blood came back to her face and her eyes filled with tears  dontdont look at me like that she said in a whisper his pity hurt her  at sight of her sitting there pathetic abashed bewildered like some gentle animal wills throat contracted so that he could not speak his voice came at last in one terrible cryoh agnes for gods sake forgive me he knelt by her side and put his arm about her shoulders and kissed her bowed head a curious numbness involved his whole body his voice was husky the tears burned in his eyes his whole soul and body ached with his pity and remorseful selfaccusing wrath  it was all my fault lay it all to me  i am the one to bear it    oh ive dreamed a thousand times of sayin this to you aggie i thought if i could only see you again and ask your forgiveness id he ground his teeth together in his assault upon himself i threw my life away an killed youthats what i did  he rose and raged up and down the room till he had mastered himself  what did you think i meant that day of the thrashing he said turning suddenly he spoke of it as if it were but a month or two past  she lifted her head and looked at him in a slow way she seemed to be remembering the tears lay on her hollow cheeks  i thought you was ashamed of me i didnt knowwhy  he uttered a snarl of selldisgust  you couldnt know nobody could tell what i meant but why didnt you write i was ready to come back i only wanted an excuseonly a line  how could i willafter your letter  he groaned and turned away  and will ii got mad too i couldnt write  oh that letteri can see every line of it fr gods sake dont think of it again but i didnt think even when i wrote that letter that id find you where you are i didnt think i hoped anyhow ed kinney wouldnt  she stopped him with a startled look in her great eyes dont talk about himit aint right i mean it dont do any good what could i do after father died mother and i besides i waited three years to hear from you will  he gave a strange choking cry it burst from his throatthat terrible thing a mans sob of agony she went on curiously calm now  ed was good to me and he offered a home anyway for mother  and all the time i was waiting for some line to break down my cussed pride so i could write to you and explain but you did go with ed to the fair he ended suddenly seeking a morsel of justification for himself  yes but i waited an waited and i thought you was mad at me and so when they came ino i didnt really go with ed there was a wagonload of them  but i started he explained but the wheel came off i didnt send word because i thought youd feel sure id come if youd only trusted me a little more no it was all my fault i acted like a crazy fool i didnt stop to reason about anything  they sat in silence alter these explanations the sound of the snapping wings of the grasshoppers came through thewindows and a locust high in a poplar sent down his ringing whir  it cant be helped now will agnes said at last her voice full of the womans resignation weve got to bear it  will straightened up bear it he paused yes i spose so if you hadnt married ed kinney anybody but him how did you do it  oh i dont know she answered wearily brushing her hair back from her eyes it seemed best when i did itand it cant be helped now there was infinite dull despair and resignation in her voice  will went over to the window he thought how bright and handsome ed used to be and he felt after all that it was no wonder that she married him life pushes us into such things suddenly he turned something resolute and imperious in his eyes and voice  it can be helped aggie he said now just listen to me weve made an awful mistake weve lost seven years o life but thats no reason why we should waste the rest of it now hold on dont interrupt me just yet i come back thinking just as much of you as ever i aint going to say a word more about ed let the past stay past im going to talk about the future  she looked at him in a daze of wonder as he went on now ive got some money ive got a third interest in a ranch and ive got a standing offer to go back on the sante fee road as conductor there is a team standing out there id like to make another trip to cedarvillewith you  oh will dont she cried for pitys sake dont talk  wait he said imperiously now look at it here you are in hell caged up with two old crows picking the life out of you theyll kill youi can see it youre being killed by inches you cant go anywhere you cant have anything life is just torture for you  she gave a little moan of anguish and despair and turned her face to her chairback her shoulders shook with weeping but she listened he went to her and stood with his hand on the chairback  his voice trembled and broke theres just one way to get out of this agnes come with me he dont care for you his whole idea of women is that they are created for his pleasure and to keep house your whole life is agony come dont cry theres a chance for life yet  she didnt speak but her sobs were less violent his voice growing stronger reassured her  im going east maybe to europe and the woman who goes with me will have nothing to do but get strong and well again ive made you suffer so i ought to spend the rest of my life making you happy come my wife will sit with me on the deck of the steamer and see the moon rise and walk with me by the sea till she gets strong and happy againtill the dimples get back into her cheeks i never will rest till i see her eyes laugh again  she rose flushed wideeyed breathing hard with the emotion his vibrant voice called up but she could not speak he put his hand gently upon her shoulder and she sank down again and he went on with his appeal there was something hypnotic dominating in his voice and eyes  on his part there was no passion of an ignoble sort only a passion of pity and remorse and a sweet tender reminiscent love he did not love the woman before him so much as the girl whose ghost she wasthe woman whose promise she was he held himself responsible for it all and he throbbed with desire to repair the ravage he had indirectly caused there was nothing equivocal in his positionnothing to disown how others might look at it he did not consider and did not care his impetuous soul was carried to a point where nothing came in to mar or divert  and then after youre well after our trip well come back to houston and ill build my wife a house thatil make her eyes shine my cattle and my salary will give us a good living and she can have a piano and books and go to the theater and concerts come what do you think of that  then she heard his words beneath his voice somehow and they produced pictures that dazzled her luminous shadows moved before her eyes drifting across the gray background of her poor starved workweary life  as his voice ceased the rosy clouds faded and she realized again the faded musty little room the calico covered furniture and looking down at her own cheap and illfitting dress she saw her ugly hands lying there then she cried out with a gush of tears  oh will im so old and homely now i aint fit to go with you now oh why couldnt we have married then  she was seeing herself as she was then and so was he but it deepened his resolution how beautiful she used to be he seemed to see her there as if she stood in perpetual sunlight with a warm sheen in her hair and dimples in her cheeks  she saw her thin red wrists her gaunt and knotted hands there was a pitiful droop in the thin pale lips and the tears fell slowly from her drooping lashes he went on  well its no use to cry over what was we must think of what were going to do dont worry about your looks youll be the prettiest woman in the country when we get back dont wait aggie make up your mind  she hesitated and was lost  what will people say  i dont care what they say he flamed out theyd say stay here and be killed by inches i say youve had your share of suffering theyd saythe liberal onesstay and get a divorce but how do we know we can get one after youve been dragged through the mud of a trial we can get one just as well in some other state why should you be worn out at thirty what right or justice is there in making you bear all your life the consequences of ourmy schoolboy folly  as he went on his argument rose to the level of brownings philosophy  we can make this experience count for us yet but we mustnt let a mistake ruin usit should teach us what right has anyone to keep you in a hole god dont expect a toad to stay in a stump and starve if it can get out he dont ask the snakes to suffer as you do  she had lost the threads of right and wrong out of her hands she was lost in a maze she was not moved by passion flesh had ceased to stir her but there was vast power in the new and thrilling words her deliverer spoke he seemed to open a door for her and through it turrets shone and great ships crossed on dim blue seas  you cant live here aggie youll die in less than five years it would kill me to see you die here come its suicide  she did not move save the convulsive motion of her breath and the nervous action of her fingers she stared down at a spot in the carpet she couldnt face him  he grew insistent a sterner note creeping into his voice  if i leave this time of course you know i never come back  her hoarse breathing growing quicker each moment was her only reply  im done he said with a note of angry disappointment he did not give her up however ive told you what id do for you now if you think  oh give me time to think will she cried out lifting her face  he shook his head no you might as well decide now it wont be any easier tomorrow come one minute more and i go out o that doorunless he crossed the room slowly doubtful himself of his desperate last measure my hand is on the knob shall i open it  she stopped breathing her fingers closed convulsively on the chair as he opened the door she sprang up  dont go will dont go please dont i need you herei  that aint the question are you going with me agnes  yes yes i tried to speak before i trust you will your  he flung the door open wide see the sunlight out there shining on that field o wheat thats where ill take youout into the sunshine you shall see it shining on the bay of naples come get on your hat dont take anything moren you actually need leave the past behind you  the woman turned wildly and darted into the little bedroom the man listened he whistled in surprise almost comical he had forgotten the baby he could hear the mother talking cooing  mommies ittle pet she wasnt goin to leave her ittle manno she wasnt there there dont e cry mommie aint goin away and leave himwicked mommie aintittle treasure  she was confused again and when she reappeared at the door with the child in her arms there was a wandering look on her face pititul to see she tried to speak tried to say please go will  he designedly failed to understand her whisper he stepped forward the baby sure enough why certainly to the mother belongs the child blue eyes thank heaven  he put his arm about them both she obeyed silently there was something irresistible in his frank clear eyes his sunny smile his strong brown hand he slammed the door behind them  that closes the door on your sufferings he said smiling down at her goodbye to it all  the baby laughed and stretched out its hands toward the light  boo boo he cried  whats he talking about  she smiled in perfect trust and fearlessness seeing her childs face beside his own he says its beautiful  oh he does i cant follow his french accent  she smiled again in spite of herself will shuddered with a thrill of fear she was so weak and worn but the sun shone on the dazzling rustling wheat the fathomless sky blue as a sea bent above themand the world lay before them  up the coulee  a story of wisconsin  keep the maintravelled road up the couleeits the second house after crossin the crick  the ride from milwaukee to the mississippi is a fine ride at any time superb in summer to lean back in a reclining chair and whirl away in a breezy july day past lakes groves of oak past fields of barley being reaped past hayfields where the heavy grass is toppling before the swift sickle is a panorama of delight a road full of delicious surprises where down a sudden vista lakes open or a distant wooded hill looms darkly blue or swift streams foaming deep down the solid rock send whiffs of cool breezes in at the window  it has majesty breadth the farming has nothing apparently petty about it all seems vigorous youthful and prosperous mr howard mclane in his chair let his newspaper fall on his lap and gazed out upon it with dreaming eyes it had a certain mysterious glamour to him the lakes were cooler and brighter to his eye the greens fresher and the grain more golden than to anyone else for he was coming back to it all after an absence of ten years it was besides his west he still took pride in being a western man  his mind all day flew ahead of the train to the little town far on toward the mississippi where he had spent his boyhood and youth as the train passed the wisconsin river with its curiously carved cliffs its cold dark swiftswirling water eating slowly under cedarclothed banks howard began to feel curious little movements of the heart like a lover as he nears his sweetheart  the hills changed in character growing more intimately recognizable they rose higher as the train left the ridge and passed down into the black river valley and specifically into the la crosse valley they ceased to have any hint of upheavals of rock and became simply parts of the ancient level left standing after the water had practically given up its postglacial scooping action  it was about six oclock as he caught sight of the dear broken line of hills on which his baby eyes had looked thirtyfive years ago a few minutes later and the train drew up at the grimy little station set in at the hillside and giving him just time to leap off plunged on again toward the west howard felt a ridiculous weakness in his legs as he stepped out upon the broiling hot splintery planks of the station and faced the few idlers lounging about he simply stood and gazed with the same intensity and absorption one of the idlers might show standing before the brooklyn bridge  the town caught and held his eyes first how poor and dull and sleepy and squalid it seemed the one main street ended at the hillside at his left and stretched away to the north between two rows of the usual village stores unrelieved by a tree or a touch of beauty an unpaved street drabcolored miserable rotting wooden buildings with the inevitable battlementsthe same only worse was the town  the same only more beautiful still was the majestic amphitheater of green wooded hills that circled the horizon and toward which he lifted his eyes he thrilled at the sight  glorious he cried involuntarily  accustomed to the white mountains to the allghenies he had wondered if these hills would retain their oldtime charm they did he took off his hat to them as he stood there richly wooded with gently sloping green sides rising to massive square or rounded tops with dim vistas they glowed down upon the squalid town gracious lofty in their greeting immortal in their vivid and delicate beauty  he was a goodly figure of a man as he stood there beside his valise portly erect handsomely dressed and with something unusually winning in his brown mustache and blue eyes something scholarly suggested by the pinchnose glasses something strong in the repose of the head he smiled as he saw how unchanged was the grouping of the old loafers on the salt barrels and nail kegs he recognized most of thema little dirtier a little more bent and a little grayer  they sat in the same attitudes spat tobacco with the same calm delight and joked each other breaking into short and sudden fits of laughter and pounded each other on the back just as when he was a student at the la crosse seminary and going to and fro daily on the train  they ruminated on him as he passed speculating in a perfectly audible way upon his business  looks like a drummer  no he aint no drummer see them boston glasses  thats so guess hes a teacher  looks like a moneyed cuss  bosn i guess  he knew the one who spoke lastfreeme cole a man who was the fighting wonder of howards boyhood now degenerated into a stoopshouldered faded garrulous and quarrelsome old man yet there was something epic in the old mans stories something enthralling in the dramatic power of recital  over by the blacksmith shop the usual game of quaits was in progress and the drug clerk on the corner was chasing a crony with the squirt pump with which he was about to wash the windows a few teams stood ankledeep in the mud tied to the fantastically gnawed pine pillars of the wooden awnings a man on a load of hay was jawing with the attendant of the platform scales who stood below pad and pencil in hand  hit im hit im jump off and knock im suggested a bystander jovially  howard knew the voice  talks cheap takes money t buy whiskey he said when the man on the load repeated his threat of getting off and whipping the scalesman  youre william mcturg howard said coming up to him  i am sir replied the softvoiced giant turning and looking down on the stranger with an amused twinkle in his deep brown eyes he stood as erect as an indian though his hair and beard were white  im howard mclane  ye begin t look it said mcturg removing his right hand from his pocket how are yeh  im firstrate hows mother and grant  saw im plowing corn as i came down guess hes all right want a boost  well yes are you down with a team  yep bout goin home climb right in thats my rig right there nodding at a sleek bay colt hitched in a covered buggy heave yr grip under the seat  they climbed into the seat after william had lowered the buggy top and unhitched the horse from the post the loafers were mildly curious guessed bill had got hooked onto by a lightninrod peddler or somethin o that kind  want to go by river or round by the hills  hills i guess  the whole matter began to seem trivial as if he had only been away for a month or two  william mcturg was a man little given to talk even the coming back of a nephew did not cause any flow of questions or reminiscences they rode in silence he sat a little bent forward the lines held carelessly in his hands his great leonine head swaying to and fro with the movement of the buggy  as they passed familiar spots the younger man broke the silence with a question  thats old man mcelvaines place aint it  old man living  i guess he is husk more corn n any man he cn hire  on the edge of the village they passed an open lot on the left marked with circus rings of different eras  theres the old ball ground do they have circuses on it just the same as ever  just the same  what fun that field calls up the games of ball we used to have do you play yet  sometimes cant stoop so well as i used to he smiled a little too much fat  it all swept back upon howard in a flood of names and faces and sights and sounds something sweet and stirring somehow though it had little of esthetic charm at the time they were passing along lanes now between superb fields of corn wherein plowmen were at work kingbirds flew from post to post ahead of them the insects called from the grass the valley slowly outspread below them the workmen in the fields were turning out for the night they all had a word of chaff with mcturg  over the western wall of the circling amphitheater the sun was setting a few scattering clouds were drifting on the west wind their shadows sliding down the green and purple slopes the dazzling sunlight flamed along the luscious velvety grass and shot amid the rounded distant purple peaks and streamed in bars of gold and crimson across the blue mist of the narrower upper coulee  the heart of the young man swelled with pleasure almost like pain and the eyes of the silent older man took on a faroff dreaming look as he gazed at the scene which had repeated itself a thousand times in his life but of whose beauty he never spoke  far down to the left was the break in the wall through which the river ran on its way to join the mississippi as they climbed slowly among the hills the valley they had left grew still more beautiful as the squalor of the little town was hid by the dusk of distance both men were silent for a long time howard knew the peculiarities of his companion too well to make any remarks or ask any questions and besides it was a genuine pleasure to ride with one who could feel that silence was the only speech amid such splendors  once they passed a little brook singing in a mournfully sweet way its eternal song over its pebbles it called back to howard the days when he and grant his younger brother had fished in this little brook for trout with trousers rolled above the knee and wrecks of hats upon their heads  any trout left he asked  not many little fellers finding the silence broken william asked the first question since he met howard les see youre a show feller now blong to a troupe  yes yes im an actor  pay much  pretty well  that seemed to end williams curiosity about the matter  ah theres our old house aint it howard broke out pointing to one of the houses farther up the coulee itll be a surprise to them wont it  yep only they dont live there  what they dont  who does  dutchman  howard was silent for some moments who lives on the dunlap place  nother dutchman  wheres grant living anyhow  farther up the conlee  well then id better get out here hadnt i  oh ill drive yeh up  no id rather walk  the sun had set and the coulee was getting dusk when howard got out of mcturgs carriage and set off up the winding lane toward his brothers house he walked slowly to absorb the coolness and fragrance and color of the hour the katydids sang a rhythmic song of welcome to him fireflies were in the grass a whippoorwill in the deep of the wood was calling weirdly and an occasional night hawk flying high gave his grating shriek or hollow boom suggestive and resounding  he had been wonderfully successful and yet had carried into his success as a dramatic author as well as actor a certain puritanism that made him a paradox to his fellows he was one of those actors who are always in luck and the best of it was he kept and made use of his luck jovial as he appeared he was inflexible as granite against drink and tobacco he retained through it all a certain freshness of enjoyment that made him one of the best companions in the profession and now as he walked on the hour and the place appealed to him with great power it seemed to sweep away the life that came between  how close it all was to him after all in his restless life surrounded by the giare of electric lights painted canvas hot colors creak of machinery mock trees stones and brooks he had not lost but gained appreciation for the coolness quiet and low tones the shyness of the wood and field  in the farmhouse ahead of him a light was shining as he peered ahead and his heart gave another painful movement his brother was awaiting him there and his mother whom he had not seen for ten years and who had grown unable to write and when grant wrote which had been more and more seldom of late his letters had been cold and curt  he began to feel that in the pleasure and excitement of his life he had grown away from his mother and brother each summer he had said well now ill go home this year sure but a new play to be produced or a yachting trip or a tour of europe had put the homecoming off and now it was with a distinct consciousness of neglect of duty that he walked up to the fence and looked into the yard where william had told him his brother lived  it was humble enougha small white house storyandahalf structure with a wing set in the midst of a few locust trees a small drabcolored barn with a sagging ridge pole a barnyard full of mud in which a few cows were standing fighting the flies and waiting to be milked an old man was pumping water at the well the pigs were squealing from a pen nearby a child was crying  instantly the beautiful peaceful valley was forgotten a sickening chill struck into howards soul as he looked at it all in the dim light he could see a figure milking a cow leaving his valise at the gate he entered and walked up to the old man who had finished pumping and was about to go to feed the hogs  good evening howard began does mr grant mclane live here  yes sir he does hes right over there milkin  ill go over there an  dont blieve i would its darn muddy over there its been turrible rainy hell be done in a minute anyway  very well ill wait  as he waited he could hear a womans fretful voice and the impatient jerk and jar of kitchen things indicative of ill temper or worry the longer he stood absorbing this farm scene with all its sordidness dullness triviality and its endless drudgeries the lower his heart sank all the joy of the homecoming was gone when the figure arose from the cow and approached the gate and put the pail of milk down on the platform by the pump  good evening said howard out of the dusk  grant stared a moment good evening  howard knew the voice though it was older and deeper and more sullen dont you know me grant i am howard  the man approached him gazing intently at his face you are after a pause well im glad to see yeh but i cant shake hands that damned cow had laid down in the mud  they stood and looked at each other howards cuffs collar and shirt alien in their elegance showed through the dusk and a glint of light shot out from the jewel of his necktie as the light from the house caught it at the right angle as they gazed in silence at each other howard divined something of the hard bitter feeling which came into grants heart as he stood there ragged ankledeep in muck his sleeves rolled up a shapeless old straw hat on his head  the gleam of howards white hands angered him when he spoke it was in a hard gruff tone full of rebellion  well go in the house and set down ill be in soons i strain the milk and wash the dirt off my hands  but mother  shes round somewhere just knock on the door under the porch round there  howard went slowly around the corner of the house past a vilely smelling rain barrel toward the west a grayhaired woman was sitting in a rocking chair on the porch her hands in her lap her eyes fixed on the faintly yellow sky against which the hills stood dim purple silhouettes and the locust trees were etched as fine as lace there was sorrow resignation and a sort of dumb despair in her attitude  howard stood his throat swelling till it seemed as if he would suffocate this was his motherthe woman who bore him the being who had taken her life in her hand for him and he in his excited and pleasurable life had neglected her  he stepped into the faint light before her she turned and looked at him without fear mother he said she uttered one little breathing gasping cry called his name rose and stood still he bounded up the steps and took her in his arms  mother dear old mother  in the silence almost painful which followed an angry womans voice could be heard inside i dont care i amt goin to wear myself out fer him he cn eat out here with us or else  mrs mclane began speaking oh ive longed to see yeh howard i was afraid you wouldnt come tilltoo late  what do you mean mother aint you well  i dont seem to be able to do much now cept sit around and knit a little i tried to pick some berries the other day and i got so dizzy i had to give it up  you mustnt work you neednt work why didnt you write to me how you were howard asked in an agony of remorse  well we felt as if you probably had all you could do to take care of yourself  are you married howard  no mother and there aint any excuse for menot a bit he said dropping back into her colloquialismsim ashamed when i think of how long its been since i saw you i could have come  it dont matter now she interrupted gently its the way things go our boys grow up and leave us  well come in to supper said grants ungracious voice from the doorway come mother  mrs mclane moved with difficulty howard sprang to her aid and leaning on his arm she went through the little sitting room which was unlighted out into the kitchen where the supper table stood near the cookstove  how this is my wife said grant in a cold peculiar tone  howard bowed toward a remarkably handsome young woman on whose forehead was a scowl which did not change as she looked at him and the old lady  set down anywhere was the young womans cordial invitation  howard sat down next to his mother and facing the wife who had a small fretful child in her arms at howards left was the old man lewis the supper was spread upon a gaycolored oilcloth and consisted of a pan of milk set in the midst with bowls at each plate beside the pan was a dipper and a large plate of bread and at one end of the table was a dish of fine honey  a boy of about fourteen leaned upon the table his bent shoulders making him look like an old man his hickory shirt like that of grant was still wet with sweat and discolored here and there with grease or green from grass his hair freshly wet and combed was smoothed away from his face and shone in the light of the kerosene lamp as he ate he stared at howard as if he would make an inventory of each thread of the visitors clothing  did i look like that at his age thought howard  you see we live jest about the sames ever said grant as they began eating speaking with a grim almost challenging inflection  the two brothers studied each other curiously as they talked of neighborhood scenes howard seemed incredibly elegant and handsome to them all with his rich soft clothing his spotless linen and his exquisite enunciation and ease of speech he had always been smoothspoken and he had become elegantly persuasive as his friends said of him and it was a large factor in his success  every detail of the kitchen the heat the flies buzzing aloft the poor furniture the dress of the peopleall smote him like the lash of a wire whip his brother was a man of great character he could see that now his deepset gray eyes and rugged face showed at thirty a man of great natural ability he had more of the scotch in his face than howard and he looked much older  he was dressed like the old man and the boy in a checked shirt without vest his suspenders once gaycolored had given most of their color to his shirt and had marked irregular broad bands of pink and brown and green over his shoulders his hair was uncombed merely pushed away from his face he wore a mustache only though his face was covered with a weeks growth of beard his face was rather gaunt and was brown as leather  howard could not eat much he was disturbed by his mothers strange silence and oppression and sickened by the longdrawn gasps with which the old man ate his bread and milk and by the way the boy ate he had his knife gripped tightly in his fist knuckles up and was scooping honey upon his bread  the baby having ceased to be afraid was curious gazing silently at the stranger  hello little one come and see your uncle eh course e will cooed howard in the attempt to escape the depressing atmosphere the little one listened to his inflections as a kitten does and at last lifted its arms in sign of surrender  the mothers face cleared up a little i declare she wants to go to you  course she does dogs and kittens always come to me when i call em why shouldnt my own niece come  he took the little one and began walking up and down the kitchen with her while she pulled at his beard and nose i ought to have you my lady in my new comedy youd bring down the house  you dont mean to say you put babies on the stage howard said his mother in surprise  oh yes domestic comedy must have a baby these days  well thats another way of makin a livin sure said grant the baby had cleared the atmosphere a little i spose you fellers make a pile of money  sometimes we make a thousand a week oftener we dont  a thousand dollars they all stared  a thousand dollars sometimes and then lose it all the next week in another town the dramatic business is a good deal like gamblingyou take your chances  i wish you werent in it howard i dont like to have my son  i wish i was in somethin that paid bettern farmin anything under gods heavens is bettern farmin said grant  no i aint laid up much howard went on as if explaining why he hadnt helped them costs me a good deal to live and i need about ten thousand dollars leeway to work on ive made a good living but ii aint made any money  grant looked at him darkly meditative  howard went on  howd ye come to sell the old farm i was in hopes  howd we come to sell it said grant with terrible bitterness we had something on it that didnt leave anything to sell you probably dont remember anything about it but there was a mortgage on it that eat us up in just four years by the almanac most killed mother to leave it we wrote to you for money but i dont spose you remember that  no you didnt  yes i did  when was it i dontwhy itsi never received it it must have been that summer i went with rob mannmg to europe howard put the baby down and faced his brother why grant you didnt think i refused to help  well it locked that way we never heard a word from yeh all summer and when y did write it was all about yerself n plays n things we didnt know anything about i swore to god id never write to you again and i wont  but good heavens i never got it  suppose you didnt you might of known we were poor as jobs offox everybody is that earns a living we fellers on the farm have to earn a livin for ourselves and you fellers that dont work i dont blame yeh id do it if i could  grant dont talk so howard didnt realize  i tell yeh i dont blame im only i dont want him to come the brotherly business over me after livin as he hasthats all there was a bitter accusation in the mans voice  howard leaped to his feet his face twitching by god ill go back tomorrow morning he threatened  go an be damned i dont care what yeh do grant growled rising and going out  boys called the mother piteously its terrible to see you quarrel  but im not to blame mother cried howard in a sickness that made him white as chalk the man is a savage i came home to help you all not to quarrel  grants got one o his fits on said the young wife speaking for the first time dont pay any attention to him hell be all right in the morning  if it wasnt for you mother id leave now and never see that savage again  he lashed himself up and down in the room in horrible disgust and hate of his brother and of this home in his heart he remembered his tender anticipations of the homecoming with a kind of selfpity and disgust this was his greeting  he went to bed to toss about on the hard strawfilled mattress in the stuffy little best room tossing writhing under the bludgeoning of his brothers accusing inflections a dozen times he said with a halfarticulate snarl  he can go to hell ill not try to do anything more for him i dont care if he is my brother he has no right to jump on me like that on the night of my return too my god he is a brute a savage  he thought of the presents in his trunk and valise which he couldnt show to him that night after what had been said he had intended to have such a happy evening of it such a tender reunion it was to be so bright and cheery  in the midst of his cursings his hot indignation would come visions of himself in his own modest rooms he seemed to be yawning and stretching in his beautiful bed the sun shining in his books foils pictures around him to say good morning and tempt him to rise while the squat little clock on the mantel struck eleven warningly  he could see the olive walls the unique copperandcrimson arabesque frieze his own selection and the delicate draperies an open grate full of glowing coals to temper the sea winds and in the midst of it between a landscape by enneking and an indian in a canoe in a canyon by brush he saw a somber landscape by a master greater than millet a melancholy subject treated with pitiless fidelity  a farm in the valley over the mountains swept jagged gray angry sprawling clouds sending a freezing thin drizzle of rain as they passed upon a man following a plow the horses had a sullen and weary look and their manes and tails streamed sidewise in the blast the plowman clad in a ragged gray coat with uncouth muddy boots upon his feet walked with his head inclined t ward the sleet to shield his face from the cold and sting of it the soil rolled away black and sticky and with a dull sheen upon it nearby a boy with tears on his cheeks was watching cattle a dog seated near his back to the gale  as he looked at this picture his heart softened he looked down at the sleeve of his soft and fleecy nightshirt at his white rounded arm muscular yet fine as a womans and when he looked for the picture it was gone then came again the assertive odor of stagnant air laden with camphor he felt the springless bed under him and caught dimly a few soapadvertising lithographs on the walls he thought of his brother in his still more inhospitable bedroom disturbed by the child condemned to rise at five oclock and begin another days pitiless labor his heart shrank and quivered and the tears started to his eyes  i forgive him poor fellow hes not to blame  ii  he woke however with a dull languid pulse and an oppressive melancholy on his heart he looked around the little room clean enough but oh how poor how barren cold plaster walls a cheap washstand a wash set of three pieces with a blue band around each the windows rectangular and fitted with fantastic green shades  outside he could hear the bees humming chickens were merrily moving about cowbells far up the road were sounding irregularly a jay came by and yelled an insolent reveille and howard sat up he could hear nothing in the house but the rattle of pans on the back side of the kitchen he looked at his watch and saw it was halfpast seven his brother was in the field by this time after milking currying the horses and eating breakfasthad been at work two hours and a half  he dressed himself hurriedly in a neglige shirt with a windsor scad lightcolored serviceable trousers with a belt russet shoes and a tennis hata knockabout costume he considered his mother good soul thought it a special suit put on for her benefit and admired it through her glasses  he kissed her with a bright smile nodded at laura the young wife and tossed the baby all in a breath and with the manner as he himself saw of the returned captain in the war dramas of the day  been to breakfast he frowned reproachfully why didnt you call me i wanted to get up just as i used to at sunrise  we thought you was tired and so we didnt  tired just wait till you see me help grant pitch hay or something hasnt finished his haying has he  no i guess not he will today if it dont rain again  well breakfast is all readyhoward said laura hesitating a little on his name  good i am ready for it bacon and eggs as im a jay just what i was wanting i was saying to myself now if theyll only get bacon and eggs and hot biscuits and honey oh say mother i heard the bees humming this morning same noise they used to make when i was a boy exactly must be the same bees hey you young rascal come here and have some breakfast with your uncle  i never saw her take to anyone so quick laura smiled howard noticed her in particular for the first time she had on a clean calico dress and a gingham apron and she looked strong and fresh and handsome her head was intellectual her eyes full of power she seemed anxious to remove the impression of her unpleasant looks and words the night before indeed it would have been hard to resist howards sunny good nature  the baby laughed and crowed the old mother could not take her dim eyes off the face of her son but sat smiling at him as he ate and rattled on when he rose from the table at last after eating heartily and praising it all he said with a smile  well now ill just telephone down to the express and have my trunk brought up ive got a few little things in there youll enjoy seeing but this fellow indicating the baby i didnt take into account but never mind uncle howard make that all right  you aint goin to lay it up agin grant be you my son mrs mclane faltered as they went out into the best room  of course not he didnt mean it now cant you send word down and have my trunk brought up or shall i have to walk down  i guess ill see somebody goin down said laura  all right now for the hayfield he smiled and went out into the glorious morning  the circling hills the same yet not the same as at night a cooler tenderer more subdued cloak of color upon them far down the valley a cool deep impalpable blue mist lay under which one divined the river ian under its elms and basswoods and wild grapevines on the shaven slopes of the hills cattle and sheep were feeding their cries and bells coming to the ear with a sweet suggestiveness there was something immemorial in the sunny slopes dotted with red and brown and gray cattle  walking toward the haymakers howard felt a twinge of pain and distrust would he ignore it all and smile  he stopped short he had not seen grant smile in so longhe couldnt quite see him smiling he had been cold and bitter for years when he came up to them grant was pitching on the old man was loading and the boy was raking after  good morning howard cried cheerily the old man nodded the boy stared grant growled something without looking up these finical things of saying good morning and good night are not much practiced in such homes as grant mclanes  need some help im ready to take a hand got on my regimentals this morning  grant looked at him a moment  you look like it  gimme a hold on that fork and ill show you im not so soft as i look now you bet  he laid hold upon the fork in grants hands who r leased it sullenly and stood back sneering howard struck the fork into the pile in the old way threw his left hand to the end of the polished handle brought it down into the hollow of his thigh and laid out his strength till the handle bent like a bow oop she rises he called laughingly as the whole pile began slowly to rise and finally rolled upon the high load  oh i aint forgot how to do it he laughed as he looked around at the boy who was studying the jacket and hat with a devouring gaze  grant was studying him too but not in admiration  i shouldnt say you had said the old man tugging at the forkful  mighty funny to come out here and do a little of this but if you had to come here and do it all the while you wouldnt look so white and soft in the hands grant said as they moved on to another pile give me that fork youll be spoiling your fine clothes  oh these dont matter theyre made for this kind of thing  oh are they i guess ill dress in that kind of a rig what did that shirt cost i need one  six dollars a pair but then its old  and them pants he pursued they cost six dollars too didnt they  howards face darkened he saw his brothers purpose he resented it they cost fifteen dollars if you want to know and the shoes cost sixfifty this ring on my cravat cost sixty dollars and the suit i had on last night cost eightyfive my suits are made by breckstein on fifth avenue and twentieth street if you want to patronize him he ended brutally spurred on by the sneer in his brothers eyes ill introduce you  good idea said grant with a forced mocking smile i need just such a get up for haying and corn plowing singular i never thought of it now my pants cost eightyfive cents spenders fifteen hat twenty shoes onefifty stockins i dont bother about  he had his brother at a disadvantage and he grew fluent and caustic as he went on almost changing places with howard who took the rake out of the boys hands and followed raking up the scatterings  singular we fellers here are discontented and mulish amt it singular we dont believe your letters when you write sayin i just about make a live of it singular we think the countrys goin to hell we fellers in a two dollar suit wadin around in the mud or sweatin around in the hayfield while you fellers lay around new york and smoke and wear good clothes and toady to millionaires  howard threw down the rake and folded his arms my god youre enough to make a man forget the same mother bore us  i guess it wouldnt take much to make you forget that you aint put much thought on me nor her for ten years  the old man cackled the boy grinned and howard sick and weak with anger and sorrow turned away and walked down toward the brook he had tried once more to get near his brother and had failed o god how miserably pitiably the hot blood gushed all over him as he thought of the shame and disgrace of it  he a man associating with poets artists sought after by brilliant women accustomed to deference even from such people to be sneered at outfaced shamed shoved aside by a man in a stained hickory shirt and patched overalls and that man his brother he lay down on the bright grass with the sheep all around him and writhed and groaned with the agony and despair of it  and worst of all underneath it was a consciousness that grant was right in distrusting him he had neglected him he had said i guess theyre getting along all right he had put them behind him when the invitation to spend summer on the mediterranean or in the adirondacks came  what can i do what can i do he groaned  the sheep nibbled the grass near him the jays called pertly shame shame a quail piped somewhere on the hillside and the brook sung a soft soothing melody that took away at last the sharp edge of his pain and he sat up and gazed down the valley bright with the sun and apparently filled with happy and prosperous people  suddenly a thought seized him he stood up so suddenly the sheep fled in affright he leaped the brook crossed the flat and began searching in the bushes on the hillside hurrah he said with a smile  he had found an old road which he used to travel when a boya road that skirted the edge of the valley now grown up to brush but still passable for footmen  as he ran lightly along down the beautiful path under oaks and hickories past masses of poison ivy under hanging grapevines through clumps of splendid hazelnut bushes loaded with great sticky rough green burrs his heart threw off part of its load  how it all came back to him how many days when  up the coulee  73  the autumn sun burned the frost off the bushes had he gathered hazelnuts here with his boy and girl friendshugh and shelley mcturg rome sawyer orrin mcilvaine and the rest what had become of them all how he had forgotten them  this thought stopped him again and he fell into a deep muse leaning against an oak tree and gazing into the vast fleckless space above the thrilling inscrutable mystery of life fell upon him like a blinding light why was he living in the crush and thunder and mental unrest of a great city while his companions seemingly his equal in powers were milking cows making butter and growing corn and wheat in the silence and drear monotony of the farm  his boyish sweethearts their names came back to his ear now with a dull sweet sound as of faint bells he saw their faces their pink sunbonnets tipped back upon their necks their brown ankles flying with the swift action of the scurrying partridge his eyes softened he took off his hat the sound of the wind and the leaves moved him almost to tears  a woodpecker gave a shrill highkeyed sustained cry ki ki ki and he started from his reverie the dapples of sun and shade falling upon his lithe figure as he hurried on down the path  he came at last to a field of corn that tan to the very wall of a large weatherbeaten house the sight of which made his breathing quicker it was the place where he was born the mystery of his life began there in the branches of those poplar and hickory trees he had swung and sung in the rushing breeze fearless as a squirrel here was the brook where like a larger kildee he with grant had waded after crawfish or had stolen upon some wary trout roughcut pole in hand  seeing someone in the garden he went down along the corn row through the rustling ranks of green leaves an old woman was picking berries a squat and shapeless figure  good morning he called cheerily  morgen she said looklng up at him with a startled and very red face she was german in every line of her body  ich bin herr mclane he said after a pause  so she replied with a questioning inflection  yah ich bin herr grants bruder  ach so she said with a downward inflection ich no spick inglish no spick inglis  ich bin durstig he said leaving her pans she went with him to the house which was what he wanted to see  ich bin hier geboren  ach so she recognized the little bit of sentiment and said some sentences in german whose general meaning was sympathy she took him to the cool cellar where the spring had been trained to run into a tank containing pans of cream and milk she gave him a cool draught from a large tin cup and then at his request they went upstairs the house was the same but somehow seemed cold and empty it was clean and sweet but it had so little evidence of being lived in the old part which was built of logs was used as best room and modeled after the best rooms of the neighboring yankee homes only it was emptier without the cabinet organ and the rag carpet and the chromoes  the old fireplace was bricked up and plasteredthe fireplace beside which in the faroff days he had lain on winter nights to hear his uncles tell tales of hunting or to hear them play the violin great dreaming giants that they were  the old woman went out and left him sitting there the center of a swarm of memories coming and going like so many ghostly birds and butterflies  a curious heartache and listlessness a nerveless mood came on him what was it worth anyhowsuccess struggle strife trampling on someone else his play crowding out some other poor fellows hope the hawk eats the partridge the partridge eats the flies and bugs the bugs eat each other and the hawk when he in his turn is shot by man so in the world of business the life of one man seemed to him to be drawn from the life of another man each success to spring from other failures  he was like a man from whom all motives had been withdrawn he was sick sick to the heart oh to be a boy again an ignorant baby pleased with a block and string with no knowledge and no care of the great unknown to lay his head again on his mothers bosom and rest to watch the flames on the hearth  why not was not that the very thing to do to buy back the old farm it would cripple him a little for the next season but he could do it think of it to see his mother back in the old home with the fireplace restored the old furniture in the sitting room around her and fine new things in the parlor  his spirits rose again grant couldnt stand out when he brought to him a deed of the farm surely his debt would be canceled when he had seen them all back in the wide old kitchen he began to plan and to dream he went to the windows and looked out on the yard to see how much it had changed  hed build a new barn and buy them a new carriage his heart glowed again and his lips softened into their usual feminine gracelips a little full and falling easily into curves  the old german woman came in at length bringing some cakes and a bowl of milk smiling broadly and hospitably as she waddled forward  ach goot he said smacking his lips over the pleasant draught  wo ist ihre goot mann he inquired ready for business  iii  when grant came in at noon mrs mclane met him at the door with a tender smile on her face  wheres howard grant  i dont know he replied in a tone that implied i dont care  the dim eyes clouded with quick tears  aint you seen him  not since nine oclock  where dyou think he is  i tell yeh i dont know hell take care of himself dont worry  he flung off his hat and plunged into the wash basin his shirt was wet with sweat and covered with dust of the hay and fragments of leaves he splashed his burning face with the water paying no further attention to his mother she spoke again very gently in reproof  grant why do you stand out against howard so  i dont stand out against him he replied harshly pausing with the towel in his hands his eyes were hard and piercing but if he expects me to gush over his coming back hes fooled thats all hes left us to paddle our own canoe all this while and so far as im concerned he can leave us alone hereafter he looked out for his precious hide mighty well and now he comes back here to play big gun and pat us on the head i dont propose to let him come that over me  mrs mclane knew too well the temper of her son to say any more but she inquired about howard of the old hired man  he went off down the valley he n grant had sm words and he pulled out down toward the old farm thats the last i see of im  laura took howards part at the table pity you cant be decent she said brutally direct as usual you treat howard as if he was aai do know what  wrn you let me alone  no i wont if you think im going to set by an agree to your bullyraggin him youre mistaken its a shame youre mad cause hes succeeded and you aint he aint to blame for his brains if you and id had any wed a succeeded too it aint our fault and it aint his so whats the use  there was a look came into grants face that the wife knew it meant bitter and terrible silence he ate his dinner without another word  it was beginning to cloud up a thin whitish allpervasive vapor which meant rain was dimming the sky and be forced his hands to their utmost during the afternoon in order to get most of the down hay in before the rain came he was pitching hay up into the barn when howard came by just before one oclock  it was windless there the sun fell through the white mist with undiminished fury and the fragrant hay sent up a breath that was hot as an oven draught grant was a powerful man and there was something majestic in his action as he rolled the huge flakes of hay through the door the sweat poured from his face like rain and he was forced to draw his dripping sleeve across his face to clear away the blinding sweat that poured into his eyes  howard stood and looked at him in silence remembering how often he had worked there in that furnace heat his muscles quivering cold chills running over his flesh red shadows dancing before his eyes  his mother met him at the door anxiously but smiled as she saw his pleasant face and cheerful eyes  youre a little late m son  howard spent most of the afternoon sitting with his mother on the porch or under the trees lying sprawled out like a boy resting at times with sweet forgetfulness of the whole world but feeling a dull pain whenever he remembered the stern silent man pitching hay in the hot sun on the torrid side of the barn  his mother did not say anything about the quarrel she feared to reopen it she talked mainly of old times in a gentle monotone of reminiscence while he listened looking up into her patient face  the heat slowly lessened as the sun sank down toward the dun clouds rising like a more distant and majestic line of mountains beyond the western hills the sound of cowbells came irregularly to the ear and the voices and sounds of the haying fields had a jocund thrilling effect on the ear of the city dweller  he was very tender everything conspired to make him simple direct and honest  mother if youll only forgive me for staying away so long ill surely come to see you every summer  she had nothing to forgive she was so glad to have him there at her feether great handsome successful boy she could only love him and enjoy him every moment of the precious days if grant would only reconcile himself to howard that was the great thorn in her flesh  howard told her how he had succeeded  it was luck mother first i met cooke and he introduced me to jake saulsman of chicago jake asked me to go to new york with him andi dont know whytook a fancy to me some way he introduced me to a lot of the fellows in new york and they all helped me along i did nothing to merit it everybody helps me anybody can succeed in that way  the doting mother thought it not at all strange that they all helped him  at the supper table grant was gloomily silent ignoring howard completely mrs mclane sat and grieved silently not daring to say a word in protest laura and the baby tried to amuse howard and under cover of their talk the meal was eaten  the boy fascinated howard he sawed wood with a rapidity and uninterruptedness which gave alarm he had the air of coaling up for a long voyage  at that age howard thought i must have gripped my knife in my right hand so and poured my tea into my saucer so i must have buttered and bit into a huge slice of bread just so and chewed at it with a smacking sound in just that way i must have gone to the length of scooping up honey with my knife blade  it was magically mystically beautiful over all this squalor and toil and bitterness from five till sevena moving hour again the falling sun streamed in broad banners across the valleys again the blue mist lay far down the coulee over the river the cattle called from the hills in the moistening sonorous air the bells came in a pleasant tangle of sound the air pulsed with the deepening chorus of katydids and other nocturnal singers  sweet and deep as the very springs of his life was all this to the soul of the elder brother but in the midst of it the younger man in illsmelling clothes and great boots that chafed his feet went out to milk the cowson whose legs the flies and mosquitoes swarmed bloated with bloodto sit by the hot side of the cow and be lashed with her tall as she tried frantically to keep the savage insects from eating her raw  the poet who writes of milking the cows does it from the hammock looking on howard soliloquized as he watched the old man lewis racing around the filthy yard after one of the young heifers that had kicked over the pail in her agony with the flies and was unwilling to stand still and be eaten alive  so so you beast roared the old man as he finally cornered the shrinking nearly frantic creature  dont you want to look at the garden asked mrs mclane of howard and they went out among the vegetables and berries  the bees were coming home heavily laden and crawling slowly into the hives the level red light streamed through the trees blazed along the grass and lighted a few oldfashioned flowers into red aid gold flame it was beautiful and howard looked at it through his halfshut eyes as the painters do and turned away with a sigh at the sound of blows where the wet and grimy men were assailing the frantic cows  theres wesley with your trunk mrs mclane said recalling him to himself  wesley helped him carry the trunk in and waved off thanks  oh thats all right he said and howard knew the western man too well to press the matter of pay  as he went in an hour later and stood by the trunk the dull ache came back into his heart how he had failed it seemed like a bitter mockery now to show his gifts  grant had come in from his work and with his feet released from his chafing boots in his wet shirt and milksplashed overalls sat at the kitchen table reading a newspaper which he held close to a small kerosene lamp he paid no attention to anyone his attitude curiously like his fathers was perfectly definite to howard it meant that from that time forward there were to be no words of any sort between them it meant that they were no longer brothers not even acquaintances how inexorable that face thought howard  he turned sick with disgust and despair and would have closed his trunk without showing any of the presents only for the childish expectancy of his mother and laura  heres something for you mother he said assuming a cheerful voice as he took a fold of fine silk from the trunk and held it up all the way from paris  he laid it on his mothers lap and stooped and kissed her and then turned hastily away to hide the tears that came to his own eyes as he saw her keen pleasure  and heres a parasol for laura i dont know how i came to have that in here and heres general grants autobiography for his namesake he said with an effort at carelessness and waited to hear grant rise  grant wont you come in asked his mother quiveringly  grant did not reply nor move laura took the handsome volumes out and laid them beside him on the table he simply pushed them to one side and went on with his reading  again that horrible anger swept hot as flame over howard he could have cursed him his hands shook as he handed out other presents to his mother and laura and the baby he tried to joke  i didnt know how old the baby was so shell have to grow to some of these things  but the pleasure was all gone for him and for the rest his heart swelled almost to a feeling of pain as he looked at his mother there she sat with the presents in her lap the shining silk came too late for her it threw into appalling relief her age her poverty her workweary frame my god he almost cried aloud how little it would have taken to lighten her life  upon this moment when it seemed as if he could endure no more came the smooth voice of william mcturg  hello folkses  hello uncle bill come in  thats what we came for laughed a womans voice  is that you rose asked laura  its merose replied the laughing girl as she bounced into the room and greeted everybody in a breathless sort of way  you dont mean little rosy  big rosy now said william  howard looked at the handsome girl and smiled saying in a nasal sort of tone wal wal rosy how youve growed since i saw yeh  oh look at all this purple and fine linen am i left out  rose was a large girl of twentyfive or thereabouts and was called an old maid she radiated good nature from every line of her buxom self her black eyes were full of drollery and she was on the best of terms with howard at once she had been a teacher but that did not prevent her from assuming a peculiar directness of speech of course they talked about old friends  wheres rachel howard inquired her smile faded away  shellie married orrin mcilvaine theyre way out in dakota shellies havin a hard row of stumps  there was a little silence  and tommy  gone west most all the boys have gone west thats the reason theres so many old maids  you dont mean to say  i dont need to sayim an old maid lots of the girls are  it dont pay to marry these days  are you married  not yet his eyes lighted up again in a humorous way  not yet thats good thats the way old maids all talk  you dont mean to tell me that no young fellow comes prowling around  oh a young dutchrnan or norwegian once in a while nobody that counts fact is were getting like bostonfour women to one man and when you consider that were getting more particular each year the outlook iswell its dreadful  it certainly is  marriage is a failure these days for most of us we cant live on the farm and cant get a living in the city and there we are she laid her hand on his arm i declare howard youre the same boy you used to be i aint a bit afraid of you for all your success  and youre the same girl no i cant say that it seems to me youve grown more than i havei dont mean physically i mean mentally he explained as he saw her smile in the defensive way a fleshy girl has alert to ward off a joke  they were in the midst of talk howard telling one of his funny stories when a wagon clattered up to the door and merry voices called loudly  whoa there sampson  hullo the house  rose looked at her father with a smile in her black eyes exactly like his they went to the door  hullo whats wanted  grant mclane live here  yup right here  a moment later there came a laughing chatting squad of women to the door mrs mclane and laura stared at each other in amazement grant went outdoors  rose stood at the door as if she were hostess  come in nettie glad to see yehglad to see yeh mrs mcilvaine come right in take a seat make yerself  to home do and mrs peavey wal i never this must be a surprise party well i swan how many more o ye air they  all was confusion merriment handshakings as rose introduced them in her roguish way  folks this is mr howard mclane of new york hes an actor but it haint spoiled him a bit as i can see how this is nettie mcilvainewilson that was  howard shook hands with nettie a tall plain girl with prominent teeth  this is ma mcilvaine  she looks just the same said howard shaking her hand and feeling how hard and workworn it was  and so amid bustle chatter and invitations to lay off yr things an stay awhile the women got disposed about the room at last those that had rocking chairs rocked vigorously to and fro to hide their embarrassment they all talked in loud voices  howard felt nervous under this furtive scrutiny he wished his clothes didnt look so confoundedly dressy why didnt he have sense enough to go and buy a fifteendollar suit of diagonals for everyday wear  rose was the life of the party her tongue rattled on in the most delightful way  its all rose an bills doins mrs mcilvaine explained they told us to come over an pick up anybody we see on the road so we did  howard winced a little at her familiarity of tone he couldnt help it for the life of him  well i wanted to come tonight because im going away next week and i wanted to see how hed act at a surprise party again rose explained  married i spose said mrs mcilvaine abruptly  no not yet  good land why y inns be thirtyfive how must a dispinted yr mam not to have a young un to call er granny  the men came clumping in talking about haying and horses some of the older ones howard knew and greeted but the younger ones were mainly too much changed they were all very ill at ease most of them were in compromise dresssomething lying between working rig and sunday dress most of them had on clean shirts and paper collars and wore their sunday coats thick woolen garments over rough trousers all of them crossed their legs at once and most of them sought the wall and leaned back perilouslyupon the hind legs of their chairs eyeing howard slowly  for the first few minutes the presents were the subjects of conversation the women especially spent a good deal of talk upon them  howard found himself forced to taking the initiative so he inquired about the crops and about the farms  i see you dont plow the hills as we used to and reap what a job it ust to be it makes the hills more beautiful to have them covered with smooth grass and cattle  there was only dead silence to this touching upon the idea of beauty  i spose it pays reasonably  not enough to kill said one of the younger men you cn see that by the houses we live inthat is most of us a few that came in early an got land cheap like mcilvaine herehe got a lift that the rest of us cant get  im a free trader myself said one young fellow blushing and looking away as howard turned and said cheerily  som i  the rest semed to feel that this was a tabooed subjecta subject to be talked out of doors where one could prance about and yell and do justice to it  grant sat silently in the kitchen doorway not saying a word not looking at his brother  well i dont never use hot vinegar for mine mrs mcilvaine was heard to say i jest use hot water an i rinse em out good and set em bottomside up in the sun i do know but what hot vinegar would be more cleansin  rose had the younger folks in a giggle with a droll telling of a joke on herself  howd y stop em from laffin  i let em laugh oh my school is a disgraceso one director says but i like to see children laugh it broadens their cheeks  yes thats all handwork laura was showing the babys sunday clothes  goodness peter how do you find time to do so much  i take time  howard being the lion of the evening tried his best to be agreeable he kept near his mother because it afforded her so much pride and satisfaction and because he was obliged to keep away from grant who had begun to talk to the men howard talled mainly about their affairs but still was forced more and more into talking of life in the city as he told of the theater and the concerts a sudden change fell upon them they grew sober and he felt deep down in the hearts of these people a melancholy which was expressed only elusively with little tones or sighs their gaiety was fitful  they were hungry for the world for artthese young people discontented and yet hardly daring to acknowledge it indeed few of them could have made definite statement of their dissatisfaction the older people felt it less they practically said with a sigh of pathetic resignation  well i dont expect ever to see these things now  a casual observer would have said what a pleasant bucolicthis little surprise party of welcome but howard with his native ear and eye had no such pleasing illusion he knew too well these suggestions of despair and bitterness he knew that like the smile of the slave this cheerfulness was selfdefense deep down was another self  seeing grant talking with a group of men over by the kitchen door he crossed over slowly and stood listening wesley cosgrovea tall rawboned young fellow with a grave almost tragic facewas saying  of course i aint who is a man thats satisfied to live as we do is a fool  the worst of it is said grant without seeing howard a man cant get out of it during his lifetime and l dont know that hell have any chance in the nextthe speculatorll be there ahead of us  the rest laughed but grant went on grily  ten years ago wes here could have got land in dakota pretty easy but now its about all a fellers lifes worth to try it i tell you things seem shuttin down on us fellers  plenty o land to rent suggested someone  yes in terms that skin a man alive more than that farmin aint so free a life as it used to be this cattleraisin and buttermakin makes a nigger of a man binds him right down to the grindstone and he gets nothin out of itthats what rubs it in he simply wallers around in the manure for somebody else id like to know what a mans life is worth who lives as we do how much higher is it than the lives the niggers used to live  these brutally bald words made howard thrill witb emotion like some great tragic poem a silence fell on the group  thats the gods truth grant said young cosgrove after a pause  a man like me is helpless grant was saying just like a fly in a pan of molasses there aint any escape for him the more he tears around the more liable he is to rip his legs off  what can he do  the men listened in silence  oh come dont talk politics all night cried rose breaking in come lets have a dance wheres that fiddle  fiddle cried howard glad of a chance to laugh well now bring out that fiddle is it williams  yes paps old fiddle  oh gosh he dont want to hear me play pr tested william hes heard s many fiddlers  fiddlers ive heard a thousand violinists but not fiddlers come give us honest john  william took the fiddle in his workcalloused and crooked hands and began tuning it the group at the kitchen door turned to listen their faces lighting up a little rose tried to get a set on the floor  oh good land said some were all tuckered out what makes you so anxious  she wants a chance to dance with the new yorker  thats it exactly rose admitted  wal if youd churned and mopped and cooked for hayin hands as i have today you wouldnt be so full o nonsense  oh bother lifes short come quick get bettie out come wes never mind your hobbyhorse  by incredible exertion she got a set on the floor and william got the fiddle in tune howard looked across at wesley and thought the change in him splendidly dramatic his face had lighted up into a kind of deprecating boyish smile rose could do anything with him  william played some of the old tunes that had a thousand associated memories in howards brain memories of harvest moons of melon feasts and of clear cold winter nights as he danced his eyes filled with a tender luminous light he came closer to them all than he had been able to do before grant had gone out into the kitchen  after two or three sets had been danced the company took seats and could not be stirred again so laura and rose disappeared for a few moments and returning served strawberries and cream which she just happened to have in the house  and then william played again his fingers now grown more supple brought out clearer firmer tones as he played silence fell on these people the magic of music sobered every face the women looked older and more careworn the men slouched sullenly in their chairs or leaned back against the wall  it seemed to howard as if the spirit of tragedy had entered this house music had always been williams unconscious expression of his unsatisfied desires he was never melancholy except when he played then his eyes grew somber his drooping face full of shadows  he played on slowly softly wailing scotch tunes and mournful irish songs he seemed to find in the songs of these people and especially in a wild sweet lowkeyed negro song some expression for his indefinable inner melancholy  he played on forgetful of everybody his long beard sweeping the violin his toilworn hands marvelously obedient to his will  at last he stopped looked up with a faint deprecating smile and said with a sigh  well folkses time to go home  the going was quiet not much laughing howard stood at the door and said good night to them all his heart very tender  come and see us they said  i will he replied cordially ill try and get around to see everybody and talk over old times before i go back  after the wagons had driven out of the yard howard turned and put his arm about his mothers neck  tired  a little  well now good night im going for a little stroll his brain was too active to sleep he kissed his mother good night and went out into the road his hat in his hand the cool moist wind on his hair  it was very dark the stars being partly hidden by a thin vapor on each side the hills rose every line familiar as the face of an old friend a whippoorwill called occasionally from the hillside and the spasmodic jangle of a bell now and then told of some cows battle with the mosquitoes  as he walked he pondered upon the tragedy he had rediscovered in these peoples lives out here under the inexorable spaces of the sky a deep distaste of his own life took possession of him he felt like giving it all up he thought of the infinite tragedy of these lives which the world loves to call peaceful and pastoral his mind went out in the aim to help them what could he do to make life better worth living nothing they must live and die practically as he saw them tonight  and yet he knew this was a mood and that in a few hours the love and the habit of life would come back upon him and upon them that he would go back to the city in a few days that these people would live on and make the best of it  ill make the best of it he said at last and his thought came back to his mother and grant  iv  the next day was a rainy day not a shower but a steady rainan unusual thing in midsummer in the west a cold dismal day in the fireless colorless farmhouses it came to howard in that peculiar reaction which surely comes during a visit of this character when thought is a weariness when the visitor longs for his own familiar walls and pictures and books and longs to meet his friends feeling at the same time the tragedy of life which makes friends nearer and more congenial than blood relations  howard ate his breakfast alone save baby and laura its mother going about the room baby and mother alike insisted on feeding him to death already dyspeptic pangs were setting in  now aint there something more i can  good heavens no he cried in dismay im likely to die of dyspepsia now this honey and milk and these delicious hot biscuits  im afraid it aint much like the breakfasts you have in the city  well no it aint he confessed but this is the kind a man needs when he lives in the open air  she sat down opposite him with her elbows on the table her chin in her palm her eyes full of shadows  id like to go to a city once i never saw a town biggern lumberville ive never seen a play but ive read of em in the magazines it must be wonderful they say they have wharves and real ships coming up to the wharf and people getting off and on how do they do it  oh thats too long a story to tell its a lot of machinery and paint and canvas if i told you how it was done you wouldnt enjoy it so well when you come on and see it  do you ever expect to see me in new york  why yes why not i expect grant to come on and bring you all some day especially tonikins here tonikins you hear sir i expect you to come on you for birfday sure he tried thus to stop the womans gloomy confidence  i hate farm life she went on with a bitter inflection its nothing but fret fret and work the whole time never going any place never seeing anybody but a lot of neighbors just as big fools as you are i spend my time fighting flies and washing dishes and churning im sick of it all  howard was silent what could he say to such an indictment the ceiling swarmed with flies which the cold rain had driven to seek the warmth of the kitchen the gray rain was falling with a dreary sound outside and down the kitchen stovepipe an occasional drop fell on the stove with a hissing angry sound  the young wife went on with a deeper note  i lived in lumberville two years going to school and i know a little something of what city life is if i was a man i bet i wouldnt wear my life out on a farm as grant does id get away and id do something i wouldnt care what but id get away  there was a certain volcanic energy back of all the woman said that made howard feel shed make the attempt she didnt know that the struggle for a place to stand on this planet was eating the heart and soul out of men and women in the city just as in the country but he could say nothing if be had said in conventional phrase sitting there in his soft clothing we must make the best of it all the woman could justly have thrown the dishcloth in his face he could say nothing  i was a fool for ever marrying she went on while the baby pushed a chair across the room i made a decent living teaching i was free to come and go my money was my own now im fled right down to a churn or a dishpan i never have a cent of my own hes growlin round half the time and theres no chance of his ever being different  she stopped with a bitter sob in her throat she forgot she was talking to her husbands brother she was conscious only of his sympathy  as if a great black cloud had settled down upon him howard felt it allthe horror hopelessness immanent tragedy of it all the glory of nature the bounty and splendor of the sky only made it the more benumbing he thought of a sentence millet once wrote  i see very well the aureole of the dandelions and the sun also far down there behind the hills flinging his glory upon the clouds but not alone thati see in the  plains the smoke of the tired horses at the plough or on a stonyhearted spot of ground a backbroken man trying to raise himself upright for a moment to breathe  the tragedy is surrounded by gloriesthat is no invention of mine  howard arose abruptly and went back to his little bedroom where he walked up and down the floor till he was calm enough to write and then he sat down and poured it all out to dearest margaret and his first sentence was this  if it were not for you just to let you know the mood im inif it were not for you and i had the world in my hands id crush it like a puffball evil so predominates suffering is so universal and persistent happiness so fleeting and so infrequent  he wrote on for two hours and by the time he had sealed and directed several letters he felt calmer but still terribly depressed the rain was still falling sweeping down from the halfseen hills wreathing the wooded peaks with a gray garment of mist and filling the valley with a whitish cloud  it fell around the house drearily it ran down into the tubs placed to catch it dripped from the mossy pump and drummed on the upturned milk pails and upon the brown and yellow beehives under the maple trees the chickens seemed depressed but the irrepressible bluejay screamed amid it all with the same insolent spirit his plumage untarnished by the wet the barnyard showed a horrible mixture of mud and mire through which howard caught glimpses of the men slumping to and fro without more additional protection than a ragged coat and a shapeless felt hat  in the sitting room where his mother sat sewing there was not an ornament save the etching he had brought the clock stood on a small shell its dial so much defaced that one could not tell the time of day and when it struck it was with noticeably disproportionate deliberation as if it wished to correct any mistake into which the family might have fallen by reason of its illegible dial  the paper on the walls showed the first concession of the puritans to the spirit of beauty and was made up of a heterogeneous mixture of flowers of unheardof shapes and colors arranged in four different ways along the wall there were no books no music and only a few newspapers in sighta bare blank cold drabcolored shelter from the rain not a home nothing cozy nothing heartwarming a grim and horrible shed  what are they doing it cant be theyre at work such a day as this howard said standing at the window  they find plenty to do even on rainy days answered his mother grant always has some job to set the men at its the only way to live  ill go out and see them he turned suddenly mother why should grant treat me so have i deserved it  mrs mclane sighed in pathetic hopelessness i dont know howard im worried about grant he gets more an more downhearted an gloomy every day seems if hed go crazy he dont care how he looks any more wont dress up on sunday days an days hell go aroun not sayin a word i was in hopes you could help him howard  my coming seems to have had an opposite effect he hasnt spoken a word to me except when he had to since i came mother what do you say to going home with me to new york  oh i couldnt do that she cried in terror i couldnt live in a big citynever  there speaks the truly rural mind smiled howard at his mother who was looking up at him through her glasses with a pathetic forlornness which sobered him again why mother you could live in orange new jersey or out in connecticut and be just as lonesome as you are here you wouldnt need to live in the city i could see you then every day or two  well i couldnt leave grant an the baby anyway she replied not realizing how one could live in new jersey and do business daily in new york  well then how would you like to go back into the old house he said facing her  the patient hands fell to the lap the dim eyes fixed in searching glance on his face there was a wistful cry in the voice  oh howard do you mean  up the coulee  93  he came and sat down by her and put his arm about her and hugged her hard i mean you dear good patient workwear old mother im going to buy back the old farm and put you in it  there was no refuge for her now except in tears and she put up her thin trembling old hands about his neck and cried in that easy placid restful way age has  howard could not speak his throat ached with remorse and pity he saw his forgetfulness of them all once more without reliefthe black thing it was  there there mother dont cry he said torn with anguish by her tears measured by mans tearlessness her weeping seemed terrible to him i didnt realize how things were going here it was all my faultor at least most of it grants letter didnt reach me i thought you were still on the old farm but no matter its all over now come dont cry any more mother dear im going to take care of you now  it had been years since the poor lonely woman had felt such warmth of love her sons had been like her husband chary of expressing their affection and like most puritan families there was little of caressing among them sitting there with the rain on the roof and driving through the trees they planned getting back into the old house howards plan seemed to her full of splendor and audacity she began to understand his power and wealth now as he put it into concrete form before her  i wish i could eat thanksgiving dinner there with you he said at last but it cant be thought of however ill have you all in there before i go home im going out now and tell grant now dont worry any more im going to fix it all up with him sure he gave her a parting hug  laura advised him not to attempt to get to the barn but as he persisted in going she hunted up an old rubber coat for him youll mire down and spoil your shoes she said glancing at his neat calf gaiters  darn the difference he laughed in his old way besides ive got rubbers  better go round by the fence she advised as he stepped out into the pouring rain  how wretchedly familiar it all was the miry cow yard with the hollow trampled out around the horse trough the disconsolate hens standing under the wagons and sheds a pig wallowing across its sty and for atmosphere the desolate falling rain it was so familiar he felt a pang of the old rebellious despair which seized him on such days in his boyhood  catching up courage he stepped out on the grass opened the gate and entered the barnyard a narrow ribbon of turf ran around the fence on which he could walk by clinging with one hand to the rough boards in this way he slowly made his way around the periphery and came at last to the open barn door without much harm  it was a desolate interior in the open floorway grant seated upon a halfbushel was mending a harness the old man was holding the trace in his hard brown hands the boy was lying on a wisp of hay it was a small barn and poor at that there was a bad smell as of dead rats about it and the rain fell through the shingles here and there to the right and below the horses stood looking up with their calm and beautiful eyes in which the whole scene was idealized  grant looked up an instant and then went on with his work  did yeh wade through grinned lewis exposing his broken teeth  no i kinder circumambiated the pond he sat down on the little toolbox near grant your barn is good deal like that in the arkansas traveller needs a new roof grant his voice had a pleasant sound full of the tenderness of the scene through which he had just been in fact you need a new barn  i need a good many things moren ill ever get grant replied shortly  how long did you say youd been on this farm  three years this fall  i dont spose youve been able to think of buyingnow hold on grant he cried as grant threw his head back for gods sake dont get mad again wait till you see what im driving at  i dont see what youre drivin at and i dont care  all i want you to do is to let us alone that ought to be easy enough for you  i tell you i didnt get your letter i didnt know youd lost the old farm howard was determined not to quarrel i didnt suppose  you might a come to see  well ill admit that all i can say in excuse is that since i got to managing plays ive kept looking ahead to making a big hit and getting a barrel of moneyjust as the old miners used to hope and watch besides you dont understand how much pressure there is on me a hundred different people pulling and hauling to have me go here or go there or do this or do that when it isnt yachting its canoeing or  he stopped his heart gave a painful throb and a shiver ran through him again he saw his life so rich so bright so free set over against the routine life in the little low kitchen the barren sitting room and this still more horrible barn why should his brother sit there in wet and grimy clothing mending a broken trace while he enjoyed all the light and civilization of the age  he looked at grants fine figure his great strong face recalled his deep stern masterful voice am i so much superior to him have not circumstances made me and destroyed him  grant for gods sake dont sit there like that ill admit ive been negligent and careless i cant understand it all myself but let me do something for you now ive sent to new york for five thousand dollars ive got terms on the old farm let me see you all back there once more before i return  i dont want any of your charity  it aint charity its only justice to you he rose come now lets get at an understanding grant i cant go on this way i cant go back to new york and leave you here like this  grant rose too i tell you i dont ask your help you cant fix this thing up with money if youve got more brains n i have why its all right i aint got any right to take anything that i dont earn  but you dont get what you do earn it aint your fault i begin te see it now being the oldest i had the best chance i was going to town to school while you were plowing and husking corn of course i thought youd be going soon yourself i had three years the start of you if youd been in my place you might have met a man like cooke you might have gone to new york and have been where i am  well it cant be helped now so drop it  but it must be howard said pacing about his hands in his coat pockets grant had stopped work and was gloomily looking out of the door at a pig nosing in the mud for stray grains of wheat at the granary door  good god i see it all now howard burst out in an impassioned tone i went ahead with my education got my start in life then father died and you took up his burdens circumstances made me and crushed you thats all there is about that luck made me and cheated you it aint right  his voice faltered both men were now oblivious of their companions and of the scene both were thinking of the days when they both planned great things in the way of an education two ambitious dreamful boys  i used to think of you grant when i pulled out monday morning in my best suitcost fifteen dollars in those days he smiled a little at the recollection while you in overalls and an old wammus was going out into the field to plow or husk corn in the mud it made me feel uneasy but as i said i kept saying to myself his turnll come in a year or two but it didnt  his voice choked he walked to the door stood a moment came back his eyes were full of tears  i tell you old man many a time in my boardinghouse down to the city when i thought of the jolly times i was having my heart hurt me but i said its no use to cry better go on and do the best you can and then help them afterward therell only be one more miserable member of the family if you stay at home besides it seemed right to me to have first chance but i never thought youd be shut off grant if i had i never would have gone on come old man i want you to believe that his voice was very tender now and almost humble  i dont know as i blame yeh for that how said grant slowly it was the first time he had called howard by his boyish nickname his voice was softer too and higher in key but he looked steadily away  i went to new york people liked my work i was very successful grant more successful than you realize i could have helped you at any time theres no use lying about it and i ought to have done it but some wayits no excuse i dont mean it for an excuse only an explanationsome way i got in with the boys i dont mean i was a drinker and all that but i bought pictures and kept a horse and a yacht and of course i had to pay my share of all expeditions andoh whats the use  he broke off turned and threw his open palms out toward his brother as if throwing aside the last attempt at an excuse  i did neglect you and its a damned shame and i ask your forgiveness come old man  he held out his hand and grant slowly approached and took it there was a little silence then howard went on his voice trembling the tears on his face  i want you to let me help you old man thats the way to forgive me will  you  yes if you can help me  howard squeezed his hand thats right old man now you make me a boy again course i can help you ive got ten  i dont mean that how grants voice was very grave money cant give me a chance now  what do you mean  i mean life aint worth very much to me im too old to take a new start im a dead failure ive come to the conclusion that lifes a failure for ninetynine per cent of us you cant help me now its too late  the two men stood there face to face hands clasped the one fairskinned fulllipped handsome in his neat sult the other tragic somber in his softened mood his large long rugged scotch face bronzed with sun and scarred with wrinkles that had histories like saber cuts on a veteran the record of his battles  among the corn rows  i  but the road sometimes passes a rich meadow where the songs o larks and bobolinks and blackbirds are tangled  rob held up his hands from which the dough depended in ragged strings  biscuits he said with an elaborate working of his jaws intended to convey the idea that they were going to be specially delicious  seagraves laughed but did not enter the shanty door how do you like baching it  oh dont mention it entreated rob mauling the dough again come in an sit down why in thunder y standin out there for  oh id rather be where i can see the prairie great weather  immense  how goes breaking  tiptop a leette dry now but the bulls pull the plow through two acres a day hows things in boomtown  oh same old grind  judge still lyin  still at it  major mullens still swearin to it  you hit it like a mallet railroad schemes are thickern prairie chickens youve got grit rob i dont have anything but crackers and sardines over to my shanty and here you are making soda biscuit  i have t do it couldnt break if i didnt you editors cn take things easy lay around on the prairie and watch the plovers and medderlarks but we settlers have got to work  leaving rob to sputter over his cooking seagraves took his slow way off down toward the oxen grazing in a little hollow the scene was characteristically wonderfully beautiful it was about five oclock in a day in late june and the level plain was green and yellow and infinite in reach as a sea the lowering sun was casting over its distant swells a faint impalpable mist through which the breaking teams on the neighboring claims plowed noiselessly as figures in a dream the whistle of gophers the faint wailing fluttering cry of the falling plover the whir of the swiftwinged prairie pigeon or the quack of a lonely duck came through the shimmering air the larks infrequent whistle piercingly sweet broke from the longer grass in the swales nearby no other climate sky plain could produce the same unnamable weird charm no tree to wave no grass to rustle scarcely a sound of domestic life only the faint melancholy soughing of the wind in the short grass and the voices of the wild things of the prairie  seagraves an impressionable young man junior editor of the boomtown spike threw himself down on the sod pulled his hat rim down over his eyes and looked away over the plain it was the second year of boomtowns existence and seagraves had not yet grown restless under its monotony around him the gophers played saucily teams were moving here and there across the sod with a peculiar noiseless effortless motion that made them seem as calm lazy and unsubstantial as the mist through which they made their way even the sound of passing wagons was a sort of low wellfed selfsatisfied chuckle  seagraves holding down a claim near rob had come to see his neighboring bach because of feeling the need of company but now that he was near enough to hear him prancing about getting supper he was content to lie alone on a slope of the green sod  the silence of the prairie at night was wellnigh terrible many a night as seagraves lay in his bunk against the side of his cabin he would strain his ear to hear the slightest sound and he listening thus sometimes for minutes before the squeak of a mouse or the step of a passing fox came as a relief to the aching sense in the daytime however and especially on a morning the prairie was another thing the pigeons the larks the cranes the multitudinous voices of the ground birds and snipes and insects made the air pulsate with sounda chorus that died away into an infinite murmur of music  hello seagraves yelled rob from the door the biscuit are most done  seagraves did not speak only nodded his head and slowly rose the faint clouds in the west were getting a superb flame color above and a misty purple below and the sun had shot them with lances of yellow light as the air grew denser with moisture the sounds of neighboring life began to reach the ear children screamed and laughed and afar off a woman was singing a lullaby the rattle of wagons and voices of men speaking to their teams multiplied ducks in a neighboring lowland were quacking the whole scene took hold upon seagraves with irresistible power  it is american he exclaimed no other land or time can match this mellow air this wealth of color much less the strange social conditions of life on this sunlit dakota prairie  rob though visibly affected by the scene also couldnt let his biscuit spoil or go without proper attention  say aint y comin t grub he asked impatiently  th a minute replied his friend taking a last wistful look at the scene i want one more look at the landscape  landscape be blessed if youd been breakin all daycome take that stool an draw up  no ill take the candle box  not much i know what manners are if i am a bull driver  seagraves took the threelegged and rather precariouslooking stool and drew up to the table which was a flat broad box nailed up against the side of the wall with two strips of board nailed at the outer corners for legs  hows that fr a layout rob inquired proudly  well you have spread yourself biscuit and canned peaches and sardines and cheese why this isis prodigal  it aint nothin else  rob was from one of the finest counties of wisconsin over toward milwaukee he was of german parentage a middlesized cheery wideawake goodlooking young fellowa typical claimholder he was always confident jovial and full of plans for the future he had dug his own well built his own shanty washed and mended his own clothing he could do anything and do it well he had a fine field of wheat and was finishing the plowing of his entire quarter section  this is what i call settin under a fellers own vine an fig treeafter seagravess complimentsan i like it im my own boss no man can say come here n go there to me i get up when im a min to an go t bed when im a min t  some drawbacks i spose  yes mice fr instance give me a devilish lot o trouble they get into my flour barrel eat up my cheese an fall into my well but it aint no use t swear  the rats and the mlce they made such a strife he had to go to london to buy him a wife  quoted seagraves dont blush ive probed your secret thought  well to tell the honest truth said rob a little sheepishly leaning across the table i aint satisfied with my style o cookin its good but a little too plain y know id like a change it aint much fun to break all day and then go to work an cook yr own supper  no i should say not  this fall im going back to wisconsin girls are thick as huckleberries back there and im goin t bring one back now you hear me  good thats the plan laughed seagraves amused at a certain timid and apprehensive look in his companions eye just think what a woman d do to put this shanty in shape and think how nice it would be to take her arm and saunter out after supper and look at the farm and plan and lay out gardens and paths and tend the chickens  robs manly and selfreliant nature had the settlers typical buoyancy and hopefulness as well as a certain power of analysis which enabled him now to say the fact is we fellers holdin down claims out here aint fools clear to the rine we know a couple o things now i didnt leave waupac county fr fun did y ever see wanpac well its one o the handsomest counties the sun ever shone on full o lakes and rivers and groves of timber i miss em all out here and i miss the boys an girls but they want no chance there fr a feller land that was good was so blamed high you couldnt touch it with a tenfoot pole from a balloon rent was high if you wanted t rent an so a feller like me had t get out an now im out here im goin f make the most of it an other thing he went on after a pausewe fellers workin out back there got more n more like hands an less like human beings yknow waupac is a kind of a summer resort and the people that use t come in summers looked down on us cusses in the fields an shops i couldnt stand it by god he said with a sudden im pulse of rage quite unlike him id rather live on an iceberg and claw crabs fr a livin than have some feller passin me on the road an callin me fellah  seagraves knew what he meant and listened in astonishment at this outburst  i consider myself a sight better n any man who lives on somebody elses hard work ive never had a cent i didnt earn with them hands he held them up and broke into a grin beauties aint they but they never wore gloves that some other poor cuss earned  seagraves thought them grand hands worthy to grasp the hand of any man or woman living  well so i come west just like a thousand other fellers to get a start where the cussed european aristocracy hadnt got a holt on the people i like it herecourse id like the lakes an meadows of waupac betterbut im my own boss as i say an im goin to stay my own boss if i haf to live on crackers an wheat coffee to do it thats the kind of a hairpin i am  in the pause which followed seagraves plunged deep into thought by robs words leaned his head on his hand this working farmer had voiced the modem idea it was an absolute overturn of all the ideas of nobility and special privilege born of the feudal past rob had spoken upon impulse but that impulse appeared to seagraves to be right  id like to use your idea for an editorial rob he said  my ideas exclaimed the astounded host pausing in the act of filling his pipe my ideas why i didnt know i had any  well youve given me some anyhow  seagraves felt that it was a wild grand upstirring of the modem democrat against the aristocratic against the idea of caste and the privilege of living on the labor of others this atom of humanity how infinitesimal this drop in the ocean of humanity was feeling the nameless longing of expanding personality and had already pierced the conventions of society and declared as nil the laws of the landlaws that were survivals of hate and prejudice he had exposed also the native spring of the emigrant by uttering the feeling that it is better to be an equal among peasants than a servant before nobles  so i have good reasons fr liking the country rob resumed in a quiet way the soil is rich the climate good so far an if i have a couple o decent crops youll see a neat upright goin up here with a porch and a bay winder  and youll still be livin here alone frying leathery slapjacks an choppin taters and bacon  i think i see myself drawled rob goin around all summer wearin the same shirt without washin an wipin on the same towel four straight weeks an wearin holes in my socks an eatin musty gingersnaps moldy bacon an canned boston beans fr the rest o my endurin days oh yes i guess not well see y later must go water my bulls  as he went off down the slope seagraves smiled to hear him sing  i wish that some kindhearted girl would pity on me take and extricate me from the mess im in the angelhow id bless her li this her home shed make in my little old sod shanty on the plain  the boys nearly fell off their chairs in the western house dining room a few days later at seeing rob come into supper with a collar and necktie as the finishing touch of a remarkable outfit  hit him somebody  its a clean collar  hes started fr congress  hes going to get married put in seagraves in a tone that brought conviction  what screamed jack adams oneill and wilson in one breath that man  that man replied seagraves amazed at rob who coolly took his seat squared his elbows pressed his collar down at the back and called for the bacon and eggs  the crowd stared at him in a dead silence  wheres he going to do it asked jack adarns wheres he going to find a girl  ask him said seagraves  i aint tellin put in rob with his mouth full of potato  youre afraid of our competition  thats right our competition jack not your competition come now rob tell us where you found her  i aint found her  what and yet youre goin away t get married  im goin t bring a wife back with me ten days frm date  i see his scheme put in jim rivers hes goin back east somewhere an hes goin to propose to every girl he meets  hold on interrupted rob holding up his fork aint quite right every goodlookin girl i meet  well ill be blanked exclaimed jack impatientiy that simply lets me out any man with such a cheek ought to  succeed interrupted seagraves  thats what i say bawled hank whiting the proprietor of the house you fellers aint got any enterprise to yeh why dont you go to work an help settle the country like men cause y aint got no sand girls are thickern huckleberries back east i say its a dum shame  easy henry said the elegant bank clerk wilson looking gravely about through his spectacles i commend the courage and the resolution of mr rodemaker i pray the lady may not  mislike him for his complexion the shadowed livery of the burning sun  shakespeare said adams at a venture  brother in adversity when do you embark another 3ason on an untried sea  hay said rob winking at seagraves oh i go tonightnight train  and return  ten days from date  ill wager a wedding supper he brings a blonde said wilson in his cleancut languid speech  oh come now wilson thats too thin we all know that rule about dark marryin light  ill wager shell be tall continued wilson ill wager you friend rodemaker shell be blonde and tall  the rest roared at robs astonishment and contusion the absurdity of it grew and they went into spasms of laughter but wilson remained impassive not the twitching of a muscle betraying that he saw anything to laugh at in the proposition  mrs whiting and the kitchen girls came in wondering at the merriment rob began to get uneasy  what is it what is it said mrs whiting a jolly little matron  rivers put the case robs on his way back to wisconsin t get married and wilson has offered to bet him that his wife will be a blonde and tall and rob dassent bet and they roared again  why the idea the mans crazy said mrs whiting the crowd looked at each other this was hint enough they sobered nodding at each other  aha i see i understand  its the heat  and the boston beans  let up on him wilson dont badger a poor irresponsible fellow i thought something was wrong when i saw the collar  oh keep it up said rob a little nettled by their evident intention to have fun with him  soothe himsooooothe him said wilson dont be harsh  rob rose from the table go to thunder you make me tired  the fit is on him again  he rose disgustedly and went out they followed him in singie file the rest of the town caught on frank graham heaved an apple at him and joined the procession rob went into the store to buy some tobacco they followed and perched like crows on the counters till he went out then they followed him as before they watched him check his trunk they witnessed the purchase of the ticket the town had turned out by this time  waupac announced the one nearest the victim  waupac said the next man and the word was passed along the street up town  make a note of it said wilson waupaa county where a mans proposal for marriage is honored upon presentation sight drafts  rivers struck up a song while rob stood around patientiy bearing the jokes of the crowd  were lookin rather seedy now while holdin down our claims and our vittles are not always of the best and the mice play slyly round us as we lay down to sleep in our little old tarred shanties on the claim  yet we rather like the novelty of livin in this way though the bill of fare is often rather tame an were happy as a clam on the land of uncle sam in our little old tarred shanty on the claim  the train drew up at length to the immense relief of rob whose stoical resiguation was beginning to weaken  dont y wish y had sand he yelled to the crowd as he plunged into the car thinking he was rid of them  but no their last stroke was to follow him into the car nodding pointing to their heads and whispering managing in the halfminute the train stood at the platform to set every person in the car staring at the crazy man rob groaned and pulled his hat down over his eyesan action which confirmed his tormentors words and made several ladies click their tongues in sympathytick tick poor fellow  all aboooard said the conductor grinning his appreciation at the crowd and the train was off  oh wont we make him groan when he gets back said barney the young lawyer who sang the shouting tenor  well meet him with the timbrel and the harp anybody want to wager ive got two to one on a short brunette said wilson  ii  follow it far enough and it may pass the bend in the river where the water laughs eternally over its shallows  a cornfield in july is a hot place the soil is hot and dry the wind comes across the lazily murmuring leaves laden with a warm sickening smell drawn from the rapidly growing broadflung banners of the corn the sun nearly vertical drops a flood of dazzing light and heat upon the field over which the cool shadows run only to make the heat seem the more intense  julia peterson faint with fatigue was tolling back and forth between the corn rows holding the handles of the doubleshovel corn plow while her little brother otto rode the steaming horse her heart was full of bitterness and her face flushed with heat and her muscles aching with fatigue the heat grew terrible the corn came to her shoulders and not a breath seemed to reach her while the sun nearing the noon mark lay pitilessly upon her shoulders protected only by a calico dress the dust rose under her feet and as she was wet with perspiration it soiled her till with a womans instinctive cleanliness she shuddered her head throbbed dangerously what matter to her that the king bird pitched jovially from the maples to catch a wandering bluebottle fly that the robin was feeding its young that the bobolink was singing all these things if she saw them only threw her bondage to labor into greater relief  across the field in another patch of corn she could see her fathera big gruffvoiced widebearded norwegianat work also with a plow the corn must be plowed and so she toiled on the tears dropping from the shadow of the ugly sunbonnet she wore her shoes coarse and squaretoed chafed her feet her hands large and strong were browned or more properly burned on the backs by the sun the horses harness creakcracked as he swung steadily and patientiy forward the moisture pouring from his sides his nostrils distended  the field ran down to a road and on the other side of the road ran a rivera broad clear shallow expanse at that point and the eyes of the boy gazed longingly at the pond and the cool shadow each time that he turned at the fence  say jule im goin in come cant i comesay he pleaded as they stopped at the fence to let the horse breathe  ive let you go wade twice  but that dont do any good my legs is all smarty cause ol jack sweats so the boy turned around on the horses back and slid back to his rump i cant stand it he burst out sliding off and darting under the fence father cant see  the girl put her elbows on the fence and watched her little brother as be sped away to the pool throwing off his clothes as he ran whooping with uncontrollable delight soon she could hear him splashing about in the water a short distance up the stream and caught glimpses of his little shiny body and happy face how cool that water looked and the shadows there by the big basswood how that water would cool her blistered feet an impulse seized her and she squeezed between the rails of the fence and stood in the road looking up and down to see that the way was clear it was not a maintravelled road no one was likely to come why not  she hurriedly took off her shoes and stockingshow delicious the cool soft velvet of the grassand sitting down on the bank under the great basswood whose roots formed an abrupt bank she slid her poor blistered chafed feet into the water her bare head leaned against the huge tree trunk  and now as she rested the beauty of the scene came to her over her the wind moved the leaves a jay screamed far off as if answering the cries of the boy a kingfisher crossed and recrossed the stream with dipping sweep of his wings the river sang with its lips to the pebbles the vast clouds went by majestically far above the treetops and the snap and buzzing and ringing whir of july insects made a ceaseless slumberous undertone of song solvent of all else the tired girl forgot her work she began to dream this would not last always some one would come to release her from such drudgery this was her constant tenderest and most secret dream he would be a yankee not a norwegian the yankees didnt ask their wives to work in the field he would have a home perhaps hed live in townperhaps a merchant and then she thought of the drug clerk in rock river who had looked at her a voice broke in on her dream a fresh manly voice  well by jinks if it aint julia just the one i wanted to see  the girl turned saw a pleasantfaced young fellow in a derby hat and a fifteendollar suit of diagonals  rod rodemaker how come  she remembered her situation and flushed looked down at the water and remained perfectly still  aint ye goin to shake hands y dont seem very glad t see me  she began to grow angry if you had any eyes youd see  rob looked over the edge of the bank whistled turned away oh i see excuse me dont blame yeh a bit though good weather fr corn he went on looking up at the trees corn seems to be pretty well forward he continued in a louder voice as he walked away still gazing into the air crops is looking firstclass in boomtown hello this otto hyare y little scamp get onto that horse agin quick r ill take yr skin off an hang it on the fence what y been doing  ben in swimmm jimminy aint it fun when d y get back said the boy grinning  never you mind replied rob leaping the fence by laying his left hand on the top rail get onto that horse he tossed the boy up on the horse hung his coat on the fence i spose the ol man makes her plow same as usual  yup said otto  dod ding a man thatll do that i dont mind if its necessary but it aint necessary in his case he continued to mutter in this way as he went across to the other side of the field as they turned to come back rob went up and looked at the horses mouth gettin purty near of age say whos sparkin julia nowanybody  nobody cept some ol norwegians she wont have them por wants her to but she wont  good fr her nobody comes t see her sunday nights eh  nope only tias anderson an ole hoover but she goes off an leaves em  chk said rob starting old jack across the field  it was almost noon and jack moved reluctantly he knew the time of day as well as the boy he made this round after distinct protest  in the meantime julia putting on her shoes and stockings went to the fence and watched the mans shining white shirt as he moved across the cornfield there had never been any special tenderness between them but she had always liked him they had been at school together she wondered why he had come back at this time of the year and wondered how long he would stay how long had he stood looking at her she flushed again at the thought of it but he wasnt to blame it was a public road she might have known better  she stood under a little popple tree whose leaves shook musically at every zephyr and her eyes through halfshut lids roved over the sea of deepgreen glossy leaves dappled here and there by cloudshadows stirred here and there like water by the wind and out of it all a longing to be free from such toil rose like a breath filling her throat and quickening the motion of her heart must this go on forever this life of heat and dust and labor what did it all mean  the girl laid her chin on her strong red wrists and looked up into the blue spaces between the vast cloudsaerial mountains dissolving in a shoreless azure sea how cool and sweet and restful they looked li she might only lie out on the billowy snowwhite sunlit edge the voices of the driver and the plowman recalled her and she fixed her eyes again upon the slowly nodding head of the patient horse on the boy turned half about on the horse talking to the whitesleeved man whose derby hat bobbed up and down quite curiously like the horses head would she ask him to dinner what would her people say  phew its hot was the greeting the young fellow gave as he came up he smiled in a frank boyish way as he hung his hat on the top of a stake and looked up at her d y know i kind o enjoy getting at it again fact it aint no work for a girl though he added  when d you get back she asked the flush not yet out of her face rob was looking at her thick fine hair and full scandinavian face rich as a rose in color and did not reply for a few seconds she stood with her hideous sun bonnet pushed back on her shoulders a kingbird was chattering overhead  oh a few days ago  how long y goin t stay  oh i d know a week mebbe  a faroff halloo came pulsing across the shimmering air the boy screamed dinner and waved his hat with an answering whoop then flopped off the horse like a turtle off a stone into water he had the horse unhooked in an instant and had flung his toes up over the horses back in act to climb on when rob said  hyare young feller wat a minute tired he asked the girl with a tone that was more than kindly it was almost tender  yes she replied in a low voice my shoes hurt me  well here y go he replied taking his stand by the horse and holding out his hand like a step she colored and smiled a little as she lifted her foot into his huge hard sunburned hand  oopadaisy he called she gave a spring and sat the horse like one at home there  rob had a deliciously unconscious abstracted businesslike air he really left her nothing to do but enjoy his company while he went ahead and did precisely as he pleased  we dont raise much corn out there an so i kind o like to see it once more  i wish i didnt have to see another hill of corn as long as i live replied the girl bitterly  dont know as i blame yeh a bit but all the same im glad you was working in it today he thought to hiniseif as he walked beside her horse toward the house  will you stop to dinner she inquired bluntly almost surmy it was evident that there were reasons why she didnt mean to press hirn to do so  you bet i will he replied that is if you want i should  you know how we live she replied evasively i you cn stand it why she broke off abruptly  yes he remembered how they lived in that big square dirty white frame house it had been three or four years since he had been ill it but the smell of the cabbage and onions the penetrating peculiar mixture of odors assailed his memory as something unforgettable  i guess ill stop he said as she hesitated she said no more but tried to act as if she were not in any way responsible for what came afterward  i guess i cn stand fr one meal what you stand all the while he added  as she left them at the well and went to the house he saw her limp painfully and the memory of her face so close to his 1ips as he helped her down from the horse gave him pleasure at the same time that he was touched by its tired and gloomy look mrs peterson came to the door of the kitchen looking just the same as ever broadfaced unwieldly flabby apparently wearing the same dress he remembered to have seen her in years before a dirty drabcolored thingshe looked as shapeless as a sack of wool her english was limited to how de do rob  he washed at the pump while the girl in the attempt to be hospitable held the clean towel for him  youre purty well used up eh he said to her  yes its awful hot out there  cant you lay off this afternoon it aint right  no he wont listen to that  well let me take your place  no there aint any use o that  peterson a brawny widebearded norwegian came up at this moment and spoke to rob in a sullen gruff way  he aint very glad to see me said rob winking at julia he aint bilin over with enthusiasm but i cn stand it for your sake he added with amazing assurance but the girl had turned away and it was wasted  at the table he ate heartily of the bean swaagen which filled a large wooden bowl in the center of the table and which was ladled into smaller wooden bowls at each plate julia had tried hard to convert her mother to yankee ways and had at last given it up in despair rob kept on safe subjects mainly asking questions about the crops of peterson and when addressing the girl inquired of the schoolmates by skillful questioning he kept the subject of marriage uppermost and seemingly was getting an inventory of the girls not yet married or engaged  it was embarrassing for the girl she was all too well aware of the difference between her home and the home of her schoolmates and friends she knew that it was not pleasant for her yankee friends to come to visit her when they could not feel sure of a welcome from the tireless silent and grimvisaged old norse if indeed they could escape insult julia ate her food mechanically and it could hardly be said that she enjoyed the brisk talk of the young man his eyes were upon her so constantly and his smile so obviously addressed to her she rose as soon as possible and going outside took a seat on a chair under the trees in the yard she was not a coarse or dull girl in fact she had developed so rapidly by contact with the young people of the neighborhood that she no longer found pleasure in her own home she didnt believe in keeping up the oldfashioned norwegian customs and her life with her mother was not one to breed love or confidence she was more like a hired hand the love of the mother for her yulyie was sincere though rough and inarticulate and it was her jealousy of the young yankees that widened the chasm between the girl and herselfan inevitable result  rob followed the girl out into the yard and threw himself on the grass at her feet perfectly unconscious of the fact that this attitude was exceedingly graceful and becoming to them both he did it because he wanted to talk to her and the grass was cool and easy there wasnt any other chair anyway  do they keep up the lyceum and the sociables same as ever  yes the others go a good eal but i dont were gettin such a stock round us and father thinks he needs me s much i dont get out often fm gettin sick of it  i shd think y would he replied his eyes on her face  i cd stand the churnin and housework but when it comes it comes t workin outdoors in the dirt an hot sun gettin all sunburned and chapped up its another thing an then it seems as if he gets stingier n stingier every year i aint had a new dress ini dknowhowlong he says its all nonsense an mothers just about as bad she dont want a new dress an so she thinks i dont the girl was feeling the influence of a sympathetic listener and was making up for her long silence ive tried t go out t work but they wont let me theyd have t pay a hand twenty dollars a month fr the work i do an they like cheap help but im not goin t stand it much longer i can tell you that  rob thought she was yery handsome as she sat there with her eyes fixed on the horizon while these rebellious thoughts found utterance in her quivering passionate voice  yulie kom heat roared the old man from the well a frown of anger and pain came into her face she looked at rob that means more work  say let me go out in your place come now whats the use  no it wouldnt do no good it aint tday s much its every day and  yulie called peterson again with a string of impatient norwegian  well all right only id like to  well goodbye she said with a little touch of feeling when dye go back  i dont know ill see y again before i go goodbye he stood watching her slow painful pace till she reached the well where otto was standing with the horse he stood watching them as they moved out into the road and turned down toward the field he felt that she had sent him away but still there was a look in her eyes which was not altogether  he gave it up in despair at last he was not good at analyses of this nature he was used to plain blunt expressions there was a womans subtlety here quite beyond his reach  he sauntered slowly off up the road after his talk with julia his head was low on his breast he was thinking as one who is about to take a decided and important step  he stopped at length and turning watched the girl moving along in the deeps of the corn hardly a leaf was stirring the untempered sunlight fell in a burning flood upon the field the grasshoppers rose snapped buzzed and fell the locust uttered its dry heatintensifving cry the man lifted his head  its a dn shame he said beginning rapidly to retrace his steps he stood leaning on the fence awaiting the girls coming very much as she had waited his on the round he had made before dinner he grew impatient at the slow gait of the horse and drummed on their rail while he whistled then he took off his hat and dusted it nervously as the horse got a little nearer he wiped his face carefully pushed his hat back on his head and climbed over the fence where he stood with elbows on the middle rail as the girl and boy and horse came to the end of the furrow  hot aint it he said as she looked up  jimminy peters its awful puffed the boy the girl did not reply trn she swung the plow about after the horse and set it upright into the next row her powerful body had a superb swaying motion at the waist as she did thisa motion which affected rob vaguely but massively  i thought youd gone she said gravely pushing hack her bonnet trn he could see her face dewed with sweat and pink as a rose she had the high cheekbones of her race but she had also their exquisite fairess of color  say otto asked rob alluringiy wan to go swimming  you bet replied otto  well ill go a round if  the boy dropped off the horse not waiting to hear any more rob grinned but the girl dropped her eyes then looked away  got rid o him mighty quick say julyie i hate like thunder t see you out here it aint right i wish youdi wish  she could not look at him now and her bosom rose and fell with a motion that was not due to fatigue her moist hair matted around her forehead gave her a boyish look  rob nervously tried again tearing splinters from the fence say now ill tell yeh what i came back here fer t git married and if youre willin ill do it tonight come now whaddy y say  what ve i got t do bout it she finally asked the color flooding her face and a faint smile coming to her lips go ahead i aint got anything  rob put a splinter in his mouth and faced her oh looky here now julyie you know what i mean ive got a good claim out near boomtowna rattlin good claim a shanty on it fourteen by sixteenno tarred paper about it and a suller to keep butter in and a hundred acres wheat just about ready to turn now i need a wife  here he straightened up threw away the splinter and took off his hat he was a very pleasant figure as the girl stole a look at him his black laughing eyes were especially earnest just now his voice had a touch of pleading the popple tree over their heads murmured applause at his eloquence then hushed to listen a cloud dropped a silent shadow down upon them and it sent a little thrill of fear through rob as if it were an omen of failure as the girl remained silent looking away he began manfashion to desire her more and more as he feared to lose her he put his hat on the post again and took out his jackknife her calico dress draped her supple and powerful figure simply but naturally the stoop in her shoulders given by labor disappeared as she partly leaned upon the fence the curves of her muscular arms showed through her sleeve  its allfired lonesome fr me out there on that claim and it aint no picnic fr you here now if youll come out there with me you neednt do anything but cook fr me and after harvest we can git a good layout o furniture an ill lath and plaster the house an put a little hell ell in the rear he smiled and so did she he felt encouraged to say an there we be as snug as y please were close t boomtown an we can go down there to church sociables an things and theyre a jolly lot there  the girl was still silent but the mans simple enthusiasm came to her charged with passion and a sort of romance such as her hard life had known little of there was something enticing about this trip to the west  what li my folks say she said at last  a virtual surrender but rob was not acute enough to see it he pressed on eagerly  i dont care do you theyll jest keep y plowin corn and milkin cows till the day of judgment come julyie i aint got no time to fool away ive got t get back t that grain its a whoopin old crop sures yr born an that means sompin purty scrumptious in furniture this fall come now he approached her and laid his hand on her shoulder very much as he would have touched albert seagraves or any other comrade whady y say  she neither started nor shrunk nor looked at him she simply moved a step away theyd never let me ge she replied bitterly im too cheap a hand i do a mans work an get no pay at all  youll have half o all i cn make he put in  how long cn you wait she asked looking down at her dress  just two minutes he said pulling out his watch it aint no use t wait the old man li be jest as mad a week from now as he is today why not go now  im of age day after tomorrow she mused wavering calculating  you cn be of age tonight if youll jest call on old square hatfield with me  all right rob the girl said turning and holding out her hand  thats the talk he exclaimed seizing it an now a kiss to bind the bargain as the fellah says  i guess we cn get along without that  no we cant it wont seem like an engagement without it  it aint goin to seem much like one anyway she answered with a sudden realization of how far from her dreams of courtship this reality was  say now julyie that aint fair it aint treatin me right you dont seem to understand that i like you but i do  rob was carried quite out of himself by the time the place and the girl he had said a very moving thing  the tears sprang involuntarily to the girls eyes do you mean it if y do you may  she was trembling with emotion for the first time the sincerity of the mans voice had gone deep  he put his arm around her almost timidly and kissed her on the cheek a great love for her springing up in his heart that setties it he said dont cry jalyie youll never be sorry for it dont cry it kind o hurts me to see it  he didnt understand her feelings he was only aware that she was crying and tried in a bungling way to soothe her but now that she had given way she sat down in the grass and wept bitterly  yulyie yelled the old norwegian like a distant foghorn  the girl sprang up the habit of obedience was strong  no you set right there and ill go round he said otto  the boy came scrambling out of the wood half dressed rob tossed him upon the horse snatched julias sunbonnet put his own hat on her head and moved off down the corn rows leaving the girl smiling throgh her tears as he whistled and chirped to the horse farmer peterson seeing the familiar sunbonnet above the corn rows went back to his work with a sentence of norwegian trailing after him like the tail of a kitesomething about lazy girls who didnt earn the crust of their bread etc  rob was wild with delight git up there jack hay you old corncrib say otto can you keep your mouth shet if it puts money in your pocket  jest try me n see said the keeneyed little scamp well you keep quiet about my being here this alternoon and ill put a dollar on yr tonguehaywhatunderstand  show me yr dollar said the boy turning about and showing his tongue  all right begin to practice now by not talkin to me  rob went over the whole situation on his way back and when he got in sight of the girl his plan was made she stood waiting for him with a new look on her face her sullenness had given way to a peculiar eagerness and anxiety to believe in him she was already living that free life in a faroff wonderful country no more would her stern father and sullen mother force her to tasks which she hated shed be a member of a new firm shed work of course but it would be because she wanted to and not because she was forced to the independence and the love promised grew more and more attractive she laughed back with a softer light in her eyes when she saw the smiling face of rob looking at her from her sunbonnet  now you mustnt do any more o this he said you go back to the house an tell yr mother youre too lame to plow any more today and its too late anyhow tonight he whispered quickiy eleven here  the girls heart leaped with fear im afraid  not of me are yeh  no im not afraid of you rob  im glad o that ii want you toto like me julyie wont you  ill try she answered with a smile  tonight then he said as she moved away  tonight goodbye  goodbye  he stood and watched her till her tall figure was lost among the drooping corn leaves there was a singular choking feeling in his throat the girls voice and face had brought up so many memories of parties and picnics and excursions on faroff holidays and at the same time such suggestions of the future he already felt that it was going to be an unconscionably long time before eleven oclock  he saw her go to the house and then he turned and walked slowly up the dusty road out of the may weed the grasshoppers sprang buzzing and snapping their dull red wings butterflies yellow and white fluttered around moist places in the ditch and slender striped water snakes glided across the stagnant pools at sound o footsteps  but the mind of the man was far away on his claim building a new house with a womans advice and presence                                                                it was a windless night the katydids and an occasional cricket were the only sounds rob could hear as he stood beside his team and strained his ear to listen at long intervals a little breeze ran through the corn like a swift serpent bringing to the nostrils the sappy smell of the growing corn the horses stamped uneasily as the mosquitoes settled on their shining limbs the sky was full of stars but there was no moon  what if she dont come he thought or cant come i cant stand that ill go to the old man an say looky here sh  he listened again there was a rustling in the corn it was not like the fitful movement of the wind it was steady slower and approaching it ceased he whistled the wailing sweet cry of the prairie chicken then a figure came out into the roada womanjulia  he took her in his arms as she came panting up to him  rob  julyie                                                                a few words the dull tread of swift horses the rising of a silent train of dust and then the wind wandered in the growing corn the dust fell a dog barked down the road and the katydids sang to the liquid contralto of the river in its shallows  the return of a private  on the road leading back to gods country and wile and babies  i  the nearer the train drew toward la crosse the soberer the little group of vets became on the long way from new orleans they had beguiled tedium with jokes and friendly chaff or with planning with elaborate detail what they were going to do now after the war a long journey slowly irregularly yet persistently pushing northward when they entered on wisconsin territory they gave a cheer and another when they reached madison but after that they sank into a dumb expectancy comrades dropped off at one or two points beyond until there were only four or five left who were bound for la crosse county  three of them were gaunt and brown the fourth was gaunt and pale with signs of fever and ague upon him one had a great scar down his temple one limped and they all had unnaturally large bright eyes showing emaciation there were no bands greeting them at the stations no banks of gaily dressed ladies waving handkerchiefs and shouting bravo as they came in on the caboose of a freight tram into the towns that had cheered and blared at them on their way to war as they looked out or stepped upon the platform for a moment as the train stood at the station the loafers looked at them indifferenfly their blue coats dusty and grimy were too familiar now to excite notice much less a friendly word they were the last of the army to return and the loafers were surfeited with such sights  the train jogged forward so slowly that it seemed likely to be midnight before they should reach la crosse the little squad of vets grumbled and swore but it was no use the train would not hurry and as a matter of fact rt was nearly two oclock when the engine whistled down brakes  most of the group were farmers living in districts several miles out of the town and all were poor  now boys said private smith he of the fever and ague we are landed in la crosse in the night weve got to stay somewhere till mornin now i aint got no two dollars to waste on a hotel ive got a wife and children so im goin to roost on a bench and take the cost of a bed out of my hide  same here put in one of the other men hidell grow on again dollars come hard its goin to be mighty hot skirmishin to find a dollar these days  dont think theyll be a deputation of citizens waitin to scort us to a hotel eh said another his sarcasm was too obvious to require an answer  smith went on then at daybreak well start fr home at least i will  well ill be dummed if ill take two dollars out o my hide one of the younger men said im goin to a hotel ef i dont never lay up a cent  thatll do fr you said smith but if you had a wife an three young uns dependin on yeh  which i aint thank the lord and dont intend havin while the court knows itself  the station was deserted chill and dark as they came into it at exactly a quarter to two in the morning lit by the oil lamps that flared a dull red light over the dingy benches the waiting room was not an inviting place the younger man went off to look up a hotel while the rest remained and prepared to camp down on the floor and benches smith was attended to tenderly by the other men who spread their blankets on the bench for him and by robbing themselves made quite a comfortable bed though the narrowness of the bench made his sleeping precarious  it was chill though august and the two men sitting with bowed heads grew stiff with cold and weariness and were forced to rise now and again and walk about to warm their stiffened limbs it didnt occur to them probably to contrast their coming home with their going forth or with the coming home of the generals colonels or even captainsbut to private smith at any rate there came a sickness at heart almost deadly as he lay there on his hard bed and went over his situation  in the deep of the night lying on a board in the town where he had enlisted three years ago all elation and enthusiasm gone out of him he faced the fact that with the joy of homecoming was mingled the bitter juice of care he saw himself sick worn out taking up the work on his halfcleared farm the inevitable mortgage standing ready with open jaw to swallow half his earnings he had given three years of his life for a mere pittance of pay and now  morning dawned at last slowly with a pale yellow dome of light rising silently above the bluffs which stand like some huge battlemented castle just east of the city out to the left the great river swept on its massive yet silent way to the south jays called across the river from hillside to hillside through the clear beautiful air and hawks began to skim the tops of the hills the two vets were astir early but private smith had fallen at last into a sleep and they went out without waking him he lay on his knapsack his gaunt face turned toward the ceiling his hands clasped on his breast with a curious pathetic effect of weakness and appeal  an engine switching near woke him at last and he slowly sat up and stared about he looked out of the window and saw that the sun was lightening the hills across the river he rose and brushed his hair as well as he could folded his blankets up and went out to find his companions they stood gazing silently at the river and at the hills  looks natcherl dont it they said as he came out  thats what it does he replied an it looks good dyeh see that peak he pointed at a beautiful symmetrical peak rising like a slightly truncated cone so high that it seemed the very highest of them all it was lighted by the morning sun till it glowed like a beacon and a light scarf of gray morning fog was rolling up its shadowed side  my farms just beyond that now ef i can only ketch a ride well be home by dinnertime  im talkin about breakfast said one of the others  i guess its one more meal o hardtack fr me said smith  they foraged around and finally found a restaurant with a sleepy old german behind the counter and procured some coffee which they drank to wash down their hardtack  timell come said smith holding up a piece by the corner when thisll be a curiosity  i hope to god it will i bet ive chawed hardtack enough to shingle every house in the coulee ive chawed it when my lampers was down and when they wasnt ive took it dry soaked and mashed ive had it wormy musty sour and bluemoldy ive had it in little bits and big bits fore coffee an after coffee im ready fr a change id like t git holt jest about now o some of the hot biscuits my wife cn make when she lays herself out fr company  well if you set there gablin youll never see yer wife  come on said private smith wait a moment boys less take suthin its on me he led them to the rusty tin dipper which hung on a nail beside the wooden water pail and they grinned and drank things were primitive in la crosse then then shouldering their blankets and muskets which they were taking home to the boys they struck out on their last march  they called that coffee jayvy grumbled one of them but it never went by the road where government jayvy resides i reckon i know coffee from peas  they kept together on the road along the turnpike and up the winding road by the river which they followed for some miles the river was very lovely curving down along its sandy beds pausing now and then under broad basswood trees or running in dark swift silent currents under tangles of wild grapevines and drooping alders and haw trees at one of these lovely spots the three vets sat down on the thick green sward to rest on smiths account the leaves of the trees were as fresh and green as in june the jays called cheery greetings to them and kingflshers darted to and fro with swooping noiseless flight  i tell yeh boys this knocks the swamps of loueesiana into kingdom come  you bet all they cn raise down there is snakes niggers and prticler hell  an fightin men put in the older man  an fightin men if i had a good hook an line id sneak a pickrel out o that pond say remember that time i shot that alligator  i guess wed better be crawlin along interrupted smith rising and shouldering his knapsack with considerable effort which he tried to hide  say smith lemme give you a lift on that  i guess i cn manage said smith grimly  course but yeh see i may not have a chance right off to pay yeh back for the times yeve carried my gun and hull caboodie say now girne that gun anyway  all right if yeh feel like it jim smith replied and they trudged along doggedly in the sun which was getting higher and hotter each half mile  aint it queer there aint no teams cornin along  well no seems its sunday  by jinks thats a fact it is sunday ill git home in time fr dinner sure she dont hev dinner usually tillabout one on sundays and he fell into a muse in which he smiled  well ill git home jest about six oclock jest about when the boys are milkin the cows said old jim cranby ill step into the barn an then ill say heah why aint this milkin done before this time o day an then wont they yell he added slapping his thigh in great glee  smith went on ill jest go up the path old roverll come down the road to meet me he wont bark hell know me an hell come down waggin his tail an shonin his teeth thats his way of laughin an so ill walk up to the kitchen door an ill say dinner fr a hungry man an then shell jump up an  he couldnt go on his voice choked at the thought of it saunders the third man hardly uttered a word he walked silently behind the others he had lost his wife the first year he was in the army she died of pneumonia caught in the autumn rains while working in the fields in his place  they plodded along till at last they came to a parting of the ways to the right the road continued up the main valley to the left it went over the ridge  well boys began smith as they grounded their muskets and looked away up the valley heres where we shake hands weve marched together a good many miles an now i spose were done  yes i dont think well do any more of it fr a while i dont want to i know  i hope ill see yeh once in a while boys to taik over old times  of course said saunders whose voice trembled a little too it aint exactly like dyin  but wed oughtr go home with you said the younger man you neverll climb that ridge with all them things on yer back  oh im all right dont worry about me every step takes me nearer home yeh see well goodbye boys  they shook hands goodbye good luck  same to you lemme know how you find things at home  he turned once before they passed out of sight and waved his cap and they did the same and all yelled then all marched away with their long steady loping veteran step the solitary climber in blue walked on for a time with his mind filled with the kindness of his comrades and musing upon the many jolly days they had had together in camp and field  he thought of his chum billy tripp poor billy a mime ball fell into his breast one day fell wailing like a cat and tore a great ragged hole in his heart he looked forward to a sad scene with billys mother and sweetheart they would want to know all about it he tried to recall all that billy had said and the particulars of it but there was little to remember just that wild wailing sound high in the air a dull slap a short quick expulsive groan and the boy lay with his face in the dirt in the plowed field they were marching across  that was all but all the scenes he had since been through had not dimmed the horror the terror of that moment when his boy comrade fell with only a breath between a laugh and a death groan poor handsome billy worth millions of dollars was his young wife  these somber recollections gave way at length to more cheerful feelings as he began to approach his home coulee the fields and houses grew familiar and in one or two he was greeted by people seated in the doorway but he was in no mood to talk and pushed on steadily though he stopped and accepted a drink of milk once at the wellside of a neighbor  the sun was getting hot on that slope and his step grew slower in spite of his iron resolution he sat down several times to rest slowly he crawled up the rough reddishbrown road which wound along the hillside under great trees through dense groves of jack oaks with treetops far below him on his left hand and the hills far above him on his right he crawled along like some minute wingless variety of fly  he ate some hardtack sauced with wild berries when he reached the summit of the ridge and sat there for some time looking down into his home coulee  somber pathetic figure his wide round gray eyes gazing down into the beautiful valley seeing and not seeing the splendid cloudshadows sweeping over the western hills and across the green and yellow wheat far below his head drooped forward on his palm his shoulders took on a tired stoop his cheekbones showed painfully an observer might have said he is looking down upon his own grave  ii  sunday comes in a western wheat harvest with such sweet and sudden relaxation to man and beast that it would be holy for that reason if for no other and sundays are usually fair in harvest time as one goes out into the field in the hot morning sunshine with no sound abroad save the crickets and the indescribably pleasant silken rustling of the ripened grain the reaper and the very sheaves in the stubble seem to be resting dreaming  around the house in the shade of the trees the men sit smoking dozing or reading the papers while the women never resting move about at the housework the men eat on sundays about the same as on other days and breakfast is no sooner over and out of the way than dinner begins  but at the smith farm there were no men dozing or reading mrs smith was alone with her three children mary nine tommy six and littie ted just past four her farm rented to a neighbor lay at the head of a coulee or narrow galley made at some faroff postglacial period by the vast and angry floods of water which gullied these trememdous furrows in the level prairiefurrows so deep that undisturbed portions of the original level rose like hills on either sidrose to quite considerable mountains  the chickens wakened her as usual that sabbath morning from dreams of her absent husband from whom she had not heard for weeks the shadows drifted over the hills down the slopes across the wheat and up the opposite wall in leisurely way as if being sunday they could take it easy also the fowls clustered about the housewife as she went out into the yard fuzzy little chickens swarmed out from the coops where their clucking and perpetually disgruntled mothers tramped about petulantly thrusting their heads through the spaces between the slats  a cow called in a deep musical bass and a call answered from a little pen nearby and a pig scurried guiltily out of the cabbages seeing all this seeing the pig in the cabbages the tangle of grass in the garden the broken fence which she had mended again and againthe little woman hardly more than a girl sat down and cried the bright sabbath morning was only a mockery without him  a few years ago they had bought this farm paying part mortgaging the rest in the usual way edward smith was a man of terrible energy he worked nights and sundays as the saying goes to clear the farm of its brush and of its insatiate mortgage in the midst of his herculean struggle came the call for volunteers and with the grirn and unselfish devotion to his country which made the eagle brigade able to whip its weight in wildcats he threw down his scythe and his grub ax turned his cattle loose and became a bluecoated cog in a vast machine for killing men and not thistles while the millionnaire sent his money to england for safekeeping this man with his girlwife and three babies left them on a mortgaged farm and went away to fight for an idea it was foolish but it was sublime for all that  that was three years before and the young wife sitting on the well curb on this bright sabbath harvest morning was righteously rebellious it seemed to her that she had borne her share of the countrys sorrow two brothers had been killed the renter in whose hands her husband had left the farm had proved a villain one year the farm was without crops and now the overripe grain was waiting the tardy hand of the neighbor who had rented it and who was cutting his own grain first  about six weeks before she had received a letter saying well be discharged in a little while but no other word had come from him she had seen by the papers that his army was being discharged and from day to day other soldiers slowly percolated in blue streams back into the state and county but still her private did not return  each week she had told the children that he was coming and she had watched the road so long that it had become unconscious and as she stood at the well or by the kitchen door her eyes were fixed unthinkingly on the road that wound down the coulee nothing wears on the human soul like waiting if the stranded mariner searching the sunbright seas could once give up hope of a ship that horrible grinding on his brain would cease it was this waiting hoping on the edge of despair that gave emma smith no rest  neighbors said with kind intentions hes sick maybe an cant start north just yet hell come along one o these days  why dont he write was her question which silenced them all this sunday morning it seemed to her as if she couldnt stand it any longer the house seemed intolerably lonely so she dressed the little ones in their best calico dresses and homemade jackets and closing up the house set off down the coulee to old mother grays  old widder gray lived at the mouth of the coulee she was a widow woman with a large family of stalwart boys and laughing girls she was the visible incarnation of hospitality and optimistic poverty with western openheartedness she fed every mouth that asked food of her and worked herself to death as cheerfully as her girls danced in the neighborhood harvest dances  she waddled down the path to meet mrs smith with a smile on her face that would have made the countenance of a convict expand  oh you little dears come right to yer granny gimme a kiss come right in mis smith how are yeh anyway nice mornin aint it come in an set down everythings in a clutter but that wont scare you any  she led the way into the best room a sunny square room carpeted with a faded and patched rag carpet and papered with a horrible whiteandgreenstriped wallpaper where a few ghastly effigies of dead members of the family hung in variously sized oval walnut frames the house resounded with singing laughter whistling tramping of boots and scufflings halfgrown boys came to the door and crooked their fingers at the children who ran out and were soon heard in the midst of the fun  dont spose youve heard from ed mrs smith shook her head hell turn up some day when you aint lookin for m the good old soul had said that so many times that poor mrs smith derived no comfort from it any longer  liz heard from al the other day hes comin some day this week anyhow they expect him  did he say anything of  no he didnt mrs gray admitted but then it was only a short letter anyhow al aint much for ritin anyhow but come out and see my new cheese i tell yeh i dont believe i ever had hetter luck in my life if ed should come i want you should take him up a piece of this cheese  it was beyond human nature to resist the influence of that noisy hearty loving household and in the midst of the singing and laughing the wife forgot her anxiety for the time at least and laughed and sang with the rest  about eleven oclock a wagonload more drove up to the door and bill gray the widows oldest son and his whole family from sand lake coulee piled out amid a goodnatured uproar as characteristic as it was ludicrous everyone talked at once except bill who sat in the wagon with his wrists on his knees a straw in his mouth and an amused twinkle in his blue eyes  aint heard nothin o ed i spose he asked in a kind of bellow mrs smith shook her head bill with a delicacy very striking in such a great giant rolled his quid in his mouth and said  didnt know but you had i hear two or three of the sand lake boys are comm left new orleenes some time this week didnt write nothin about ed but no news is good news in such cases mother always says  well go put out yer team said mrs gray an gon bring me in some taters an sim you go see if you cn find some corn sadie you put on the water to bile come now hustle yer boots all o yeh if i feed this yer crowd weve got to have some raw materials if y thinkim goin to feed yeh on pie  the children went off into the fields the girls put dinner on to bile and then went to change their dresses and fix their hair somebody might come they said  land sakes l hope not i dont know where in time id set em less theyd eat at the secont table mrs gray laughed in pretended dismay  the two older boys who had served their time in the army lay out on the grass before the house and whittied and talked desultorily about the war and the crops and planned buying a threshing machine the older girls and mrs smith helped enlarge the table and put on the dishes talking all the time in that cheery incoherent and meaningful way a group of such women havea conversation to be taken for its spirit rather than for its letter though mrs gray at last got the ear of them all and dissertated at length on girls  girls in love aint no use in the whole blessed week she said sundays theyre alookin down the road expectin hell come sunday afternoons they cant think o nothin else cause hes here monday mornins theyre sleepy and kind o dreamy and slimpsy and good fr nothin on tuesday and wednesday thursday they git absentminded an begin to look off toward sunday agin an mope aroun and let the dishwater git cold rtght under their noses friday they break dishes and go off in the best room an snivel an look out o the winder saturdays they have queer spurts o workin like all pssessed an spurts o frizzin their hair an sunday they begin it all over agin  the girls giggled and blushed all through this tirade from their mother their broad faces and powerful frames anything but suggestive of lackadaisical sentiment but mrs smith said  now mrs gray i hadnt ought to stay to dianer youve got  now you set right down if any of them girls beaus comes theyll have to take whats left thats all they aint sposed to have much appetite nohow no youre goin to stay if they starve an they aint no danger o that  at one oclock the long table was piled with boiled potatoes cords of boiled corn on the cob squash and pumpkin pies hot biscuit sweet pickles bread and butter and honey then one of the girls took down a conch shell from a nail and going to the door blew a long fine free blast that showed there was no weakness of lungs in her ample chest  then the children came out of the forest of corn out of the crick out of the loft of the barn and out of the garden the men shut up their jackknives and surrounded the horse trough to souse their faces in the cold hard water and in a few moments the table was filled with a merry crowd and a row of wistfuleyed youngsters circled the kitchen wail where they stood first on one leg and then on the other in impatient hunger  they come to their feed fr all the world jest like the pigs when y hoilder pooee see em scoot laughed mrs gray every wrinkle on her face shining with delight now pitch in mrs smith she said presiding over the table you know these men critters theyll eat every grain of it if yeh give em a chance i swan theyre made o indian rubber their stomachs is i know it  haft to eat to work said bill gnawing a cob with a swift circular motion that rivaled a corn sheller in results  more like workin to eat put in one of the girls with a giggle more eat n work with you  you neednt say anything net anyone thatll eat seven ears  i didnt no such thing you piled your cobs on my plate  thatll do to tell ed varney it wont go down here where we know yeh  good land eat all yeh want theys plenty more in the fiels but i cant afford to give you young uns tea the tea is for us womenfolks and specially fr mis smith an bills wife were agoin to tell fortunes by it  one by one the men filled up and shoved back and one by one the children slipped into their places and by two oclock the women alone remained around the debriscovered table sipping their tea and telling fortunes  as they got well down to the grounds in the cup they shook them with a circular motion in the hand and then turned them bottomsideup quickly in the saucer then twirled them three or four times one way and three or four times the other during a breathless pause then mrs gray lifted the cup and gazing into it with profound gravity pronounced the impending fate  it must be admitted that to a critical observer she had abundant preparation for hitting close to the mark as when she told the girls that somebody was coming it is a man she went on gravely he is crosseyed  oh you hush  he has red hair and is death on biled corn and hot biscuit  the others shrieked with delight  but hes goin to get the mitten that redheaded feller is for i see a feller comin up behind him  oh lemme see lemme see cried nettle  keep off said the priestess with a lofty gesture his hair is black he dont eat so much and he works more  the girls exploded in a shriek of laughter and pounded their sister on the back  at last came mrs smiths turn and she was trembling with excitement as mrs gray again composed her jolly face to what she considered a proper solemnity of expression  somebody is comin to you she said after a long pause hes got a musket on his back hes a soldier hes almost here see  she pointed at two little tea stems which formed a faint suggestion of a man with a musket on his back he had climbed nearly to the edge of the cup mrs smith grew pale with excitement she trembled so she could hardly hold the cup in her hand as she gazed into it  its ed cried the old woman hes on the way home heavens an earth there he is now she turned and waved her hand out toward the road they rushed to the door and looked where she pointed  a man in a blue coat with a musket on his back was toiling slowly up the hill on the sunbright dusty road toiling slowly with bent head halfhidden by a heavy knapsack so tired it seemed that walking was indeed a process of falling so eager to get home he would not stop would not look aside but plodded on amid the cries of the locusts the welcome of the crickets and the rustle of the yellow wheat getting back to gods country and his wife and babies  laughing crying trying to call him and the children at the same time the little wife almost hysterical snatched her hat and ran out into the yard but the soldier had disappeared over the hill into the hollowy beyond and by the time she had found the children he was too far away for her voice to reach him and besides she was not sure it was her husband for he had not turned his head at their shouts this seemed so strange why didnt he stop to rest at his old neighbors house tortured by hope and doubt she hurried up the coulee as fast as she could push the baby wagon the blue coated figure just ahead pushing steadily silently forward up the coulee  when the excited panting little group came in sight of the gate they saw the bluecoated figure standing leaning upon the rough rail fence his chin on his palms gazing at the empty house his knapsack canteen blankets and musket lay upon the dusty grass at his feet  he was like a man lost in a dream his wide hungry eyes devoured the scene the rough lawn the little unpainted house the field of clear yellow wheat behind it down across which streamed the sun now almost ready to touch the high hill to the west the crickets crying merrily a cat on the fence nearby dreaming unmmdful of the stranger in blue  how peaceful it all was o god how far removed from all camps hospitals battlelines a little cabin in a wisconsin coulee but it was majestic in its peace how did he ever leave it for those years of tramping thirsting killing  trembling weak with emotion her eyes on the silent figure mrs smith hurried up to the fence her feet made no noise in the dust and grass and they were close upon him before he knew of them the oldest boy ran a little ahead he will never forget that figure that face it will always remain as something epic that return of the private he fixed his eyes on the pale face covered with a ragged beard  who are you sir asked the wife or rather started to ask for he turned stood a moment and then cried  emma  edward  the children stood in a curious row to see their mother kiss this bearded strange man the elder girl sobbing sympathetically with her mother illness had left the soldier partly deaf and this added to the strangeness of his manner  but the boy of six years stood away even after the girl had recognized her father and kissed him the man turned then to the baby and said in a curiously unpaternal tone  come here my little man dont you know me but the baby backed away under the fence and stood peering at him critically  my little man what meaning in those words this baby seemed like some other womans child and not the infant he had left in his wifes arms the war had come between him and his babyhe was only a strange man with big eyes dressed in blue with mother hanging to his arm and talking in a loud voice  and this is tom he said drawing the oldest boy to him hell come and see me he knows his poor old pap when he comes home from the war  the mother heard the pain and reproach in his voice and hastened to apologize  youve changed so ed he cant know yeh this is papa teddy come and kiss himtom and mary do come wont you but teddy still peered through the fence with solemn eyes well out of reach he resembled a halfwild kitten that hesitates studying the tones of ones voice  ill fix him said the soldier and sat down to undo his knapsack out of which he drew three enormous and very red apples after giving one to each of the older children he said  now i guess hell come eh my little man now come see your pap  teddy crept slowly under the fence assisted by the overzealous tommy and a moment later was kicking and squalling in his fathers arms then they entered the house into the sitting room poor bare artforsaken little room too with its rag carpet its square clock and its two or three chromos and pictures from harpers weekly pinned about  emma im all tired out said private smith as he flung himself down on the carpet as he used to do while his wife brought a pillow to put under his head and the children stood about munching their apples  tommy you run and get me a pan of chips and mary you get the teakettle on and ill go and make some biscuit  and the soldier talked question after question he poured forth about the crops the cattle the renter the neighbors he slipped his heavy government brogan shoes off his poor tired blistered feet and lay out with utter sweet relaxation he was a free man again no longer a soldier under command at supper he stopped once listened and smiled thats old spot i know her voice i spose thats her calf out there in the pen i cant milk her tonight though im too tired but i tell you id like a drink o her milk whats become of old rove  he died last winter poisoned i guess there was a moment of sadness for them all it was some time before the husband spoke again in a voice that trembled a little  poor old feller hed a known me a half a mile away i expected him to come down the hill to meet me it ud a been more like comin home if i could a seen him comm down the road an waggin his tail an laughin that way he has i tell yeh it kin o took hold o me to see the blinds down an the house shut up  but yeh see wewe expected youd write again fore you started and then we thought wed see you if you did come she hastened to explain  well i aint worth a cent on writin besides its just as well yeh didnt know when i was comm i tell yeh it sounds good to hear them chickens out there an turkeys an the crickets do you know they dont have just the same kind o crickets down south whos sam hired t help cut yer grain  the ramsey boys  looks like a good crop but im afraid i wont do much gettin it cut this cussed fever an ague has got me down pretty low i dont know when ill get red of it ill bet ive took twentyfive pounds of quinine if ive taken a bit gimme another biscuit i tell yeh they taste good emma i aint had anything like it say if youd a heard me braggin to th boys about your butter n biscuits ill bet your ears ud a burnt  the privates wife colored with pleasure oh youre always abraggin about your things everybody makes good butter  yes old lady snyder for instance  oh well she aint to be mentioned shes dutch  or old mis snively one more cup o tea mary thats my girl im feeling better already i just blieve the matter with me is im starved  this was a delicious hour one long to be remembered they were like lovers again but their tenderness like that of a typical american found utterance in tones rather than in words he was praising her when praising her biscuit and she knew it they grew soberer when he showed where he had been struck one ball burning the back of his hand one cutting away a lock of hair from his temple and one passing through the calf of his leg the wife shuddered to think how near she had come to being a soldiers widow her waiting no longer seemed hard this sweet glorious hour effaced it all  then they rose and all went out into the garden and down to the barn he stood beside her while she milked old spot they began to plan fields and crops for next year here was the epic figure which whitman has in mind and which he calls the common american soldier with the livery of war on his limbs this man was facing his future his thoughts holding no scent of battle clean clearheaded in spite of physical weakness edward smith private turned futureward with a sublime courage  his farm was mortgaged a rascally renter had run away with his machinery departing between two days his children needed clothing the years were coming upon him he was sick and emaciated but his heroic soul did not quail with the same courage with which he faced his southern march be entered upon a still more hazardous future  oh that mystic hour the pale man with big eyes standing there by the well with his young wife by his side the vast moon swinging above the eastern peaks the cattle winding down the pasture slopes with jangling bells the crickets singing the stars blooming out sweet and far and serene the katydids rhythmically calling the little turkeys crying querulously as they settled to roost in the poplar tree near the open gate the voices at the well drop lower the little ones nestle in their fathers arms at last and teddy falls asleep there  the common soldier of the american volunteer army had returned his war with the south was over and his fight his daily running fight with nature and against the injustice of his fellow men was begun again in tlie dusk of that faroff valley his figure looms vast his personal peculiarities fade away he rises into a magnificent type  he is a grayhaired man of sixty now and on the brown hair of his wife the white is also showing they are fighting a hopeless battle and must fight till god gives them furlough  under the lions paw  along the maintravelled road trailed an endless line of prairie schooners coming into sight at the east and passing out of sight over the swell to the west  we children used to wonder where they were going and why they went  it was the last of autumn and first day of winter coming together all day long the ploughmen on their prairie farms had moved to and fro in their wide level fields through the falling snow which melted as it fell wetting them to the skin all day notwithstanding the frequent squalls of snow the dripping desolate clouds and the muck of the furrows black and tenacious as tar  under their dripping harness the horses swung to and fro silently with that marvellous uncomplaining patience which marks the horse all day the wild geese honking wildly as they sprawled sidewise down the wind seemed to be fleeing from an enemy behind and with neck outthrust and wings extended sailed down the wind soon lost to sight  yet the ploughman behind his plough though the snow lay on his ragged greatcoat and the cold clinging mud rose on his heavy boots fettering him like gyves whistled in the very beard of the gale as day passed the snow ceasing to melt lay along the ploughed land and lodged in the depth of the stubble till on each slow round the last furrow stood out black and shining as jet between the ploughed land and the gray stubble  when night began to fall and the geese flying low began to alight invisibly in the near cornfield stephen council was still at work finishing a land he rode on his sulky plough when going with the wind but walked when facing it sitting bent and cold but cheery under his slouch hat he talked encouragingly to his fourinhand  come round there boys round agin we got t finish this land come in there dan stiddy kate stiddy none o yr tantrums kittie its purty tuff but got a be did tchk tchk step along pete dont let kate git yr singletree on the wheel once more  they seemed to know what he meant and that this was the last round for they worked with greater vigor than before  once more boys an then sez i oats an a nice warm stall an  sleep fr all  by the time the last furrow was turned on the land it was too  dark to see the house and the snow was changing to rain again the tired and hungry man could see the light from the kitchen shining through the leafless hedge and he lifted a great shout supper fr a half a dozen  it was nearly eight oclock by the time he had finished his chores and started for supper he was picking his way carefully through the mud when the tall form of a man loomed up before him with a premonitory cough  waddy ye want was the rather startled question of the  farmer  well ye see began the stranger in a deprecating tone wed like t git in fr the night weve tried every house fr the last two miles but they hadnt any room fr us my wifes jest about sick  n the children are cold and hungry   oh y want o stay all night eh  yes sir it ud be a great accom   waal i dont make it a practice t turn anybuddy way hungry not on sech  nights as this drive right in we aint got much but sech as it is  but the stranger had disappeared and soon his steaming weary team with drooping heads and swinging singletrees moved past the well to the block beside the path council stood at the side of the schooner and helped the children out two little half sleeping children and then a small woman with a babe in her arms  there ye go he shouted jovially to the children now were  all right run right along to the house there an tell mam council you wants sumpthin t eat right this way mis keep right off  t the right there ill go an git a lantern come he said to the  dazed and silent group at his side  mother he shouted as he neared the fragrant and warmly lighted kitchen here are some wayfarers an folks who need sumpthin t eat an a place t snoot he ended by pushing them all in  mrs council a large jolly rather coarselooking woman too the children in her arms come right in you little rabbits mos asleep hey now heres a drink o milk fr each o ye ill have sam tea in a minute take off yr things and set up t the fire  while she set the children to drinking milk council got out his lantern and went out to the barn to help the stranger about his team where his loud hearty voice could be heard as it came and went between the haymow and the stalls  the woman came to light as a small timid and discouraged looking woman but still pretty in a thin and sorrowful way  land sakes an youve travelled all the way from clear lake tday in this mud waal waal no wonder youre all tired out dont wait fr the men mis  she hesitated waiting for the name  haskins  mis haskins set right up to the table an take a good swig o tea whilst i make y sm toast its green tea an its good i tell council as i git older i dont seem to enjoy young hyson nr gunpowder i want the reel green tea jest as it comes offn the vines seems t have more heart in it some way dont spose it has council says its all in m eye  going on in this easy way she soon had the children filled with bread and milk and the woman thoroughly at home eating some toast and sweetmelon pickles and sipping the tea  see the little rats she laughed at the children theyre full as they can stick now and they want to go to bed now dont git up mis haskins set right where you are an let me look after em i know all about young ones though im all alone now jane went an married last fall but as i tell council its lucky we keep our health set right there mis haskins i wont have you stir a finger  it was an unmeasured pleasure to sit there in the warm homely kitchen the jovial chatter of the housewife driving out and holding at bay the growl of the impotent cheated wind  the little womans eyes filled with tears which fell down upon  the sleeping baby in her arms the world was not so desolate and cold and hopeless after all  now i hope council wont stop out there and talk politics all night hes the greatest man to talk politics an read the tribunehow old is it  she broke off and peered down at the face of the babe  two months n five days said the mother with a mothers exactness  ye dont say i want o know the dear little pudzywudzy  she went on stirring it up in the neighborhood of the ribs with her  fat forefinger  pooty tough on oo to go gallivantn cross lots this way  yes thats so a man cant lift a mountain said council entering the door mother this is mr haskins from kansas hes been eat up n drove out by grasshoppers  glad t see yeh pa empty that washbasin n give him a chance t wash  haskins was a tall man with a thin gloomy face his hair was a  reddish brown like his coat and seemed equally faded by the wind  and sun and his sallow face though hard and set was pathetic  somehow you would have felt that he had suffered much by the  line of his mouth showing under his thin yellow mustache  hadnt ike got home yet sairy  hadnt seen im  waal set right up mr haskins wade right into what weve got taint much but we manage to live on it she gits fat on it  laughed council pointing his thumb at his wife  after supper while the women put the children to bed haskins and council talked on seated near the huge cookingstove the steam rising from their wet clothing in the western fashion council told as much of his own life as he drew from his guest he asked but few questions but by and by the story of haskins struggles and defeat came out the story was a terrible one but he told it  quietly seated with his elbows on his knees gazing most of the  time at the hearth  i didnt like the looks of the country anyhow haskins said partly rising and glancing at his wife i was ust t northern ingyannie where we have lots o timber n lots o rain n i didnt like the looks o that dry prairie what galled me the worst was goin s far away acrosst so much fine land layin all through here vacant  and the hoppers eat ye four years hand runnin did they  eat they wiped us out they chawed everything

followed im a gettin purty heavy t be on mlaigs all day but we cant afford t hire so i keep rackin around somehow like a foundered horse s lame i tell council he can t tell how lame i am fr im jest as lame in one laig as t other and the good soul laughed at the joke on herself as she took a handful of flour and dusted the biscuitboard to keep the dough from sticking  well i hadnt never been very strong said mrs haskins our folks was canadians an smallboned and then since my last child i hadnt got up again fairly i dont like t complain tim has about all he can bear now but they was days this

some ploughing t do anyhow an well see if somethin cant be done about your case ike you go out an see if the horses is all right an ill show the folks t bed  when the tired husband and wife were lying under the generous quilts of the spare bed haskins listened a moment to the wind in the eaves and then said with a slow and solemn tone  there are people in this world who are good enough t be angels an only haff t die to be angels  jim butler was one of those men called in the west land poor  early in the history of rock river he had come into the town and started in the grocery business in a small way occupying a small building in a mean part of the town at this period of his life he earned all he got and was up early and late sorting beans working over butter and carting his goods to and from the station but a change came over him at the end of the second year when he sold a lot of land for four times what he paid for it from that time forward he believed in land speculation as the surest way of getting rich every cent he could save or spare from his trade he put into land at forced sale or mortgages on land which were just as good as the wheat he was accustomed to say  farm after farm fell into his hands until he was recognized as one of the leading landowners of the county his mortgages were scattered all over cedar county and as they slowly but surely fell in he sought usually to retain the former owner as tenant  he was not ready to foreclose indeed he had the name of being one of the easiest men in the town he let the debtor off again and again extending the time whenever possible  i dont want yr land he said all im after is the intrest on my money thats all now if y want o stay on the farm why ill give y a good chance i cant have the land layin vacant  and in many cases the owner remained as tenant  in the meantime he had sold his store he couldnt spend time in ithe was mainly occupied now with sitting around town on rainy days smoking and gassin with the boys or in riding to and from his farms in fishingtime he fished a good deal doc grimes ben ashley and cal cheatham were his cronies on these fishing excursions or hunting trips in the time of chickens or partridges in winter they went to northern wisconsin to shoot deer  in spite of all these signs of easy life butler persisted in saying he hadnt enough money to pay taxes on his land and was careful to convey the impression that he was poor in spite of his twenty farms at one time he was said to be worth fifty thousand dollars but land had been a little slow of sale of late so that he was not worth so much  a fine farm known as the higley place had fallen into his hands in the usual way the previous year and he had not been able to find a tenant for it poor higley after working himself nearly to death on it in the attempt to lift the mortgage had gone off to dakota leaving the farm and his curse to butler  this was the farm which council advised haskins to apply for and the next day council hitched up his team and drove down to see butler  you jest let me do the talkin he said well find him wearin out his pants on some salt barrel somewers and if he thought you wanted a place hed sock it to you hot and heavy you jest keep quiet ill fix im  butler was seated in ben ashleys store telling fish yarns when council sauntered in casually  hello but lyin agin hey  hello

was coolly eating a dried apple which he had speared out of a barrel with his knife butler studied him carefully  well knocks me out of twentyfive dollars interest  my relationll need all hes got t

y cant git a start agin and he chirruped to the team which sprang forward with the rumbling clattering wagon  say looky here council you cant do this i never saw  shouted haskins in his neighbors ear  council moved about uneasily in his seat and stopped his stammering gratitude by saying hold on now dont make such a fuss over a little thing when i see a man down an things all on top of m i jest like t kick em off an help m up thats the kind of religion i got an its about the only kind  they rode the rest of the way home in silence and when the red light of the lamp shone out into the darkness of the cold and windy night and he thought of this refuge for his children and wife haskins could have put his arm around the neck of his burly companion and squeezed him like a lover but he contented himself with saying steve council youll git yr pay fr this some day  dont want any pay my religion aint run on such business principles  the wind was growing colder and the ground was covered with a white frost as they turned into the gate of the council farm and the children came rushing out shouting papas come they hardly looked like the same children who had sat at the table the night before their torpidity under the influence of sunshine and mother council had given way to a sort of spasmodic cheerfulness as insects in winter revive when laid on the hearth  haskins worked like a fiend and his wife like the heroic woman that she was bore also uncomplainingly the most terrible burdens they rose early and toiled without intermission till the darkness fell on the plain then tumbled into bed every bone and muscle aching with fatigue to rise with the sun next morning to the same round of the same ferocity of labor  the eldest boy drove a team all through the spring ploughing and seeding milked the cows and did chores innumerable in most ways taking the place of a man  an infinitely pathetic but common figure this boy on the american farm where there is no law against child labor to see him in his coarse clothing his huge boots and his ragged cap as he staggered with a pail of water from the well or trudged in the cold and cheerless dawn out into the frosty field behind his team gave the citybred visitor a sharp pang of sympathetic pain yet haskins loved his boy and would have saved him from this if he could but he could not  by june the first year the result of such herculean toil began to show on the farm the yard was cleaned up and sown to grass the garden ploughed and planted and the house mended  council had given them four of his cows  take em an run em on shares i dont want o milk s many ikes away s much now satdys an sundys i cant stand the bother anyhow  other men seeing the confidence of council in the newcomer had sold him tools on time and as he was really an able farmer he soon had round him many evidences of his care and thrift at the advice of council he had taken the farm for three years with the privilege of rerenting or buying at the end of the term  its a good bargain an y want o nail it said council if you have any kind ov a crop you cn pay yr debts an keep seed an bread  the new hope which now sprang up in the heart of haskins and his wife grew almost as a pain by the time the wide field of wheat began to wave and rustle and swirl in the winds of july day after day he would snatch a few moments after supper to go and look at it  have ye seen the wheat tday nettie he asked one night as he rose from supper  no tim i aint had time  well take time now les go look at it  she threw an old hat on her head tommys hat and looking almost pretty in her thin sad way went out with her husband to the hedge  aint it grand nettie just look at it  it was grand level russet here and there heavyheaded wide as a lake and full of multitudinous whispers and gleams of wealth it stretched away before the gazers like the fabled field of the cloth of gold  oh i think i hope well have a good crop tim and oh how good the people have been to us  yes i dont know where wed be tday if it hadnt teen fr council and his wife  theyre the best people in the world said the little woman with a great sob of gratitude  well be in the field on monday sure said haskins gripping the rail on the fences as if already at the work of the harvest  the harvest came bounteous glorious but the winds came and blew it into tangles and the rain matted it here and there close to the ground increasing the work of gathering it threefold  oh how they toiled in those glorious days clothing dripping with sweat arms aching filled with briers fingers raw and bleeding backs broken with the weight of heavy bundles haskins and his man toiled on tummy drove the harvester while his father and a hired man bound on the machine in this way they cut ten acres every day and almost every night after supper when the hand went to bed haskins returned to the field shocking the bound grain in the light of the moon many a night he worked till his anxious wife came out at ten oclock to call him in to rest and lunch  at the same time she cooked for the men took care of the children washed and ironed milked the cows at night made the butter and sometimes fed the horses and watered them while her husband kept at the shocking  no slave in the roman galleys could have toiled so frightfully and lived for this man thought himself a free man and that he was working for his wife and babes  when he sank into his bed with a deep groan of relief too tired to change his grimy dripping clothing he felt that he was getting nearer and nearer to a home of his own and pushing the wolf of want a little farther from his door  there is no despair so deep as the despair of a homeless man or woman to roam the roads of the country or the streets of the city to feel there is no rood of ground on which the feet can rest to halt weary and hungry outside lighted windows and hear laughter and song within these are the hungers and rebellions that drive men to crime and women to shame  it was the memory of this homelessness and the fear of its coming again that spurred timothy haskins and nettie his wife to such ferocious labor during that first year  m yes m yes firstrate said butler as his eye took in the  neat garden the pigpen and the wellfilled barnyard youre  gittn quite a stock around yeh done well eh  haskins was showing butler around the place he had not seen  it for a year having spent the year in washington and boston  with ashley his brotherinlaw who had been elected to congress  yes ive laid out a good deal of money durin the last three  years ive paid out three hundred dollars fr fencin  um hm i see i see said butler while haskins went on  the kitchen there cost two hundred the barn aint cost much in money but ive put a lot o time on it ive dug a new well and i   yes yes i see youve done well stock worth a thousand dollars  said butler picking his teeth with a straw  about that said haskins modestly we begin to feels if we was gittn a home fr ourselves but weve worked hard i tell you we begin to feel it mr butler and were goin t begin to ease up purty soon weve been kind o plannin a trip back t her folks after the fall ploughins done  eggsactly said butler who was evidently thinking of something else i suppose youve kind o calclated on stayin here three years more  well yes fact is i think i cn buy the farm this fall if youll give me a reasonable show  um m what do you call a reasonable show  well say a quarter down and three years time  butler looked at the huge stacks of wheat which filled the yard over which the chickens were fluttering and crawling catching grasshoppers and out of which the crickets were singing innumerably he smiled in a peculiar way as he said oh i wont be hard on yeh but what did you expect to pay fr the place  why about what you offered it for before two thousand five hundred or possibly three thousand dollars he added quickly as he saw the owner shake his head  this farm is worth five thousand and five hundred dollars said butler in a careless and decided voice  what almost shrieked the astounded haskins whats that five thousand why thats double what you offered it for three years ago  of course and its worth it it was all run down thennow its in good shape youve laid out fifteen hundred dollars in improvements according to your own story  but you had nothin t do about that its my work an my money   you bet it was but its my land  but whats to pay me for all my   aint you had the use of em replied butler smiling calmly into his face  haskins was like a man struck on the head with a sandbag he couldnt think he stammered as he tried to say but i neverd git the use youd rob me moren that you agreed you promised that i could buy or rent at the end of three years at   thats all right but i didnt say id let you carry off the improvements nor that id go on renting the farm at twofifty the land is doubled in value it dont matter how it dont enter into the question an now you can pay me five hundred dollars a year rent or take it on your own terms at fiftyfive hundred or git out  he was turning away when haskins the sweat pouring from his face fronted him saying again  but youve done nothing to make it so you hadnt added a cent i put it all there myself expectin to buy i worked an sweat to improve it i was workin for myself an babes   well why didnt you buy when i offered to sell what y kickin about  im kickin about payin you twice fr my own things my own fences my own kitchen my own garden  butler laughed youre too green t eat young feller your improvements the law will sing another tune  but i trusted your word  never trust anybody my friend besides i didnt promise not to do this thing why man dont look at me like that dont take me for a thief its the law the reglar thing everybody does it  i dont care if they do its stealin jest the same you take three thousand dollars of my money the work o my hands and my wifes he broke down at this point he was not a strong man mentally he could face hardship ceaseless toil but he could not face the cold and sneering face of butler  but i dont take it said butler coolly all youve got to do is to go on jest as youve been acoin or give me a thousand dollars down and a mortgage at ten per cent on the rest  haskins sat down blindly on a bundle of oats near by and with staring eyes and drooping head went over the situation he was under the lions paw he felt a horrible numbness in his heart and limbs he was hid in a mist and there was no path out  butler walked about looking at the huge stacks of grain and pulling now and again a few handfuls out shelling the heads in his hands and blowing the chaff away he hummed a little tune as he did so he had an accommodating air of waiting  haskins was in the midst of the terrible toil of the last year he was walking again in the rain and the mud behind his plough  he felt the dust and dirt of the threshing the ferocious husking time with its cutting wind and biting clinging snows lay hard upon him then he thought of his wife how she had cheerfully cooked and baked without holiday and without rest  well what do you think of it inquired the cool mocking insinuating voice of butler  i think youre a thief and a liar shouted haskins leaping up a blackhearted houn butlers smile maddened him with a sudden leap he caught a fork in his hands and whirled it in the air youll never rob another man damn ye he grated through his teeth a look of pitiless ferocity in his accusing eyes  butler shrank and quivered expecting the blow stood held hypnotized by the eyes of the man he had a moment before despised a man transformed into an avenging demon but in the deadly hush between the lift of the weapon and its fall there came a gush of faint childish laughter and then across the range of his vision far away and dim he saw the sunbright head of his baby girl as with the pretty tottering run of a twoyearold she moved across the grass of the dooryard his hands relaxed the fork fell to the ground his head lowered  make out yr deed an morgage an git offn my land an dont ye never cross my line agin if y do ill kill ye  butler backed away from the man in wild haste and climbing into his buggy with trembling limbs drove off down the road leaving haskins seated dumbly on the sunny pile of sheaves his head sunk into his hands  the creamery man  along these woods in storm and sun the busy people go  the tinpeddler has gone out of the west amiable gossip and sharp trader that he was his visits once brought a sharp business grapple to the farmers wife and daughters after which as the man of trade was repacking his unsold wares a moment of cheerful talk often took place it was his cue if he chanced to be a tactful peddler to drop all attempts at sale and become distinctly human and neighborly  his calls were not always well received but they were at their best pleasant breaks of a monotonous round of duties but he is no longer a familiar spot on the landscape he has passed into the limbo of the things no longer necessary his red wagon may be rumbling and rattling through some newer region but the coulee country knows him no more  the creamery man has taken his place every afternoon rain or shine the wagons of the north star creamery in dutchers coulee stop at the farmers windmills to skim the cream from the submerged cans his wagon is not gay it is generally battered and covered with mud and filled with tall cans but the driver himself is generally young and sometimes attractive the driver in molasses gap which is a small coulee leading into dutchers coulee was particularly goodlooking and amusing  he was aware of his good looks and his dress not only showed that he was single but that he hoped to be married soon he wore brown trousers which fitted him very well and a darkblue shirt which had a gay lacing of red cord in front and a pair of suspenders that were a vivid green on his head he wore a chinese straw helmet which was as ugly as anything could conceivably be but he was as proud of it as he was of his green suspenders in summer he wore no coat at all and even in pretty cold weather he left his vest on his wagon seat not being able to bring himself to the point of covering up the red and green of his attire  it was noticeable that the women of the neighborhood always came out even on washday to see that claude his name was claude willlams measured the cream properly there was much banter about this mrs kennedy always said she wouldnt trust him furs you can fling a yearlin bull by the tail  now thats the difference between us he would reply id trust you anywhere anybody with such a daughter as yourn  he seldom got further for lucindy always said in substance oh you go long  there need be no mystery in the matter cindy was the girl for whose delight he wore the green and red he made no secret of his love and she made no secret of her scorn she laughed at his green spenders and the red shoestring in his shirt but claude considered himself very learned in womens ways by reason of two years driving the creamery wagon and be merely winked at mrs kennedy when the girl was looking and kissed his hand at cindy when her mother was not looking  he looked forward every afternoon to these little exchanges of wit and was depressed when for any reason the womenfolks were away there were other places pleasanter than the kennedy farmsome of the dutchmen had fine big brick houses and finer and bigger barns but their women were mostly homely and went around barefooted and barelegged with ugly blue dresses hanging frayed and greasy round their lank ribs and big joints  some way their big houses have a look like a stable when you get close to em claude said to cindy once their women work so much in the field they dont have any time to fix upthe way you do i dont believe in women workin in the fields he said this looking cindy in the face my wife neednt set her foot outdoors less shes a mind to  oh you can talk replied the girl scornfully but youd be like the rest of em but she was glad that she had on a clean collar and apronif it was ironing day  what claude would have said further cindy could not divine for her mother called her away as she generally did when she saw her daughter lingering too long with the creamery man claude was not considered a suitable match for lucindy kennedy whose father owned one of the finest farms in the coulee worldly considerations hold in molasses gap as well as in bluff siding and tyre  but claude gave little heed to these moods in mrs kennedy if cindy sputtered he laughed and if she smiled he rode on whistling till he came to old man haldemans who owned the whole lower half of molasses gap and had one ummarried daughter who thought claude one of the handsomest men in the world she was always at the gate to greet him as he drove up and forced sections of cake and pieces of gooseberry pie upon him each day  shes good enoughfor a dutchman claude said of her but i hate to see a woman go around looking as if her clothes would drop off if it rained on her and on sundays when she dresses up she looks like a boy rigged out in some girls castoff duds  this was pretty hard on nina she was tall and lank and sandy with small blue eyes her limbs were heavy and she did wear her sunday clothes badly but she was a good generous soul and very much in love with the creamery man she was not very clean but then she could not help that the dust of the field is no respecter of sex no she was not lovely but she was the only daughter of old ernest haldeman and the old man was not very strong  claude was the daily bulletin of the gap he knew whose cow died the night before who was at the strawberry dance and all about abe andersons night in jail up at the siding if his coming was welcome to the kennedys who took the bluff siding gimlet and the county paper how much the more cordial ought his greeting to be at haldemans where they only took the milwaukee weekly freiheit  nina in her poor way had longings and aspirations she wanted to marry a yankee and not one of her own kind she had a little schooling obtained at the small brick shed under the towering cottonwood tree at the corner of her fathers farm but her life had been one of hard work and mighty little play her parents spoke in german about the farm and could speak english only very brokenly her only brother had adventured into the foreign parts of pine county and had been killed in a sawmill her life was lonely and hard  she had suitors among the germans plenty of them but she had a disgust of themconsidered as possible husbandsand though she went to their beery dances occasionally she had always in her mind the ease lightness and color of claude she knew that the yankee girls did not work in the fieldseven the norwegian girls seldom did so now they worked out in townbut she had been brought up to hoe and pull weeds from her childhood and her father and mother considered it good for her and being a gentle and obedient child she still continued to do as she was told claude pitied the girl and used to talk with her during his short stay in his cheeriest manner  hello nina how you vass aint it how much cream already you got this morning did you hear the news not  no vot hass happened  everything frank mcveys horse stepped through the bridge and broke his leg and hes going to sue the countymean frank is not the horse  iss dot so  sure and bill hetner had a fight and julia dooriliagers got home  vot wass bill fightding apoudt  oh drunkfighting for exercise haint got a fresh pie cut  her face lighted up and she turned so suddenly to go that her bare leg showed below her dress her unstockinged feet were thrust into coarse working shoes claude wrinkled his nose in disgust but he took the piece of green currant pie on the palm of his hand and bit the acute angle from it  firstrate you do make lickin good pies he said out of pure kindness of heart and nina was radiant  she wouldnt be so badlookin if they didnt work her in the fields like a horse he said to himself as he drove away  the neighbors were well aware of ninas devotion and mrs smith who lived two or three houses down the road said good evening claude seen nina today  sure and she gave me a piece of currant pieher own make  did you eat it  did i i guess yes i aint refusin pie from ninanot while her pa has five hundred acres of the best land in molasses gap  now it was this innocent joking on his part that started all claudes trouble mrs smith called a couple of days later and had her joke with cindy  cindy your cakes all dough  why whats the matter now  claude come along tother day grinnin from ear to ear and some currant pie in his musstache he had jest fixed it up with nina he jest as much as said he was after the old mans acres  well let him have em i dont know as it interests me replied cindy waving her head like a banner if he wants to sell himself to that greasy dutchwoman why let him thats all i dont care  her heated manner betrayed her to mrs smith who laughed with huge enjoyment  well you better watch out  the next day was very warm and when claude drove up under the shade of the big maples he was ready for a chat while his horses rested but cindy was nowhere to be seen mrs kennedy came out to get the amount of the skimming and started to reenter the house without talk  wheres the young folks asked claude carelessly  if you mean lucindy shes in the house  aint sick or nothin is she  not that anybody knows of dont expect her to be here to gass with you every time do ye  well i wouldnt mind replied claude he was too keen not to see his chance in fact id like to have her with me all the time mrs kennedy he said with engaging frankness  well you cant have her the mother replied ungraciously  whats the matter with me  oh i like you well enough but cindyd be a big fool to marry a man without a roof to cover his head  thats where you take your inning sure claude replied im not much better than a hired hand well now see here im going to make a strike one of these days and thenlook out for me you dont know but what ive invested in a gold mine i may be a dutch lord in disguise better not be brash  mrs kennedys sourness could not stand against sueb sweetness and drollery she smiled in wry fashion youd better be moving or youll be late  sure enough if i only had you for a motherinlawthats why im so poor nobody to keep me moving if i had someone to do the talking for me id work he grinned broadly and drove out  his irritation led him to say some things to nina which he would not have thought of saying the day before she had been working in the field and had dropped her hoe to see him  say nina i wouldnt work outdoors such a day as this if i was you id tell the old man to go to thunder and id go in and wash up and look decent yankee women dont do that kind of work and your old dads rich no use of your sweatin around a cornfield with a hoe in your hands i dont like to see a woman goin round without stockins and her hands all chapped and calloused it aint accordin to hoyle no sir i wouldnt stand it id serve an injunction on the old man right now  a dull slow flush crept into the girls face and she put one hand over the other as they rested on the fence one looked so much less monstrous than two  claude went on yes sir id brace up and go to yankee meeting instead of dutch youd pick up a yankee beau like as not  he gathered his cream while she stood silently by and when he looked at her again she was in deep thought  good day he said cheerily  goodbye she replied and her face flushed again  it rained that night and the roads were very bad and he was late the next time he arrived at haldemans nina came out in her best dress but he said nothing about it supposing she was going to town or something like that and he hurried through with his task and had mounted his seat before he realized that anything was wrong  then mrs haldeman appeared at the kitchen door and hurled a lot of unintelligible german at him he knew she was mad and mad at him and also at nina for she shook her fist at them alternately  singular to tell nina paid no attention to her mothers sputter she looked at claude with a certain timid audacity  how you like me today  thats better he said as he eyed her critically now youre talkin id do a little reading of the newspaper myself if i was you a womans business aint to work out in the hot sunits to cook and fix up things round the house and then put on her clean dress and set in the shade and read or sew on something stand up to em doggone me if id paddle round that hot cornfield with a mess o dutchmenit aint decent  he drove off with a chuckle at the old man who was seated at the back of the house with a newspaper in his hand he was lame or pretended he was and made his wife and daughter wait upon him claude had no conception of what was working in ninas mind but he could not help observing the changes for the better in her appearance each day he called she was neatly dressed and wore her shoes laced up to the very top hook  she was passing through tribulation on his account but she sald nothing about it the old man her father no longer spoke to her and the mother sputtered continually but the girl seemed sustained by some inner power she calmly went about doing as she pleased and no fury of words could check her or turn her aside  her hands grew smooth and supple once more and her face lost the parboiled look it once had  claude noticed all these gains and commented on them with the freedom of a man who had established friendly relations with a child  i tell you what nina youre coming along sure next ground hop youll be wearin silk stockins and highheeled shoes hows the old man still mad  he dont speak to me no more my mudder says i am a big fool  she does well you tell her i think youre just getting sensible  she smiled again and there was a subtle quality in the mixture of boldness and timidity of her manner his praise was so sweet and stimulating  i sold my pigs she said the old man he wass madt but i didnt mind i pought me a new dress with the money  thats right i like to see a woman have plenty of new dresses claude replied he was really enjoying the girls rebellion and growing womanliness  meanwhile his own affairs with lucindy were in a bad way he seldom saw her now mrs smith was careful to convey to her that claude stopped longer than was necessary at haldemans and so mrs kennedy attended to the matter of recording the cream kennedy hersell was always in the field and claude had no opportunity for a conversation with him as he very much wished to have once when he saw cindy in the kitchen at work he left his team to rest in the shade and sauntered to the door and looked in  she was kneading out cake dough and she looked the loveliest thing he had ever seen her sleeves were rolled up her neat brown dress was covered with a big apron and her collar was open a liffle at the throat for it was warm in the kitchen she frowned when she saw him  he began jocularly oh thank you i can wait till it bakes no trouble at all  well its a good deal of trouble to me to have you standin there gappin at me  aint gappin at you im waitin for the pie  taint pie its cake  oh well cakell do for a change say cindy  dont call me cindy  well lucindy its mighty lonesome when i dont see you on my trips  oh i guess you can stand it with nina to talk to  aha jealous are you  jealous of that dutchwoman i dont care who you talk to and you neednt think it  claude was learned in womans ways and this pleased him mightily  well when shall i speak to your daddy  i dont know what you mean and i dont care  oh yes you do im going to come up here next sunday in my best bib and tucker and im going to say mr kennedy  the sound of mrs kennedys voice and footsteps approaching made claude suddenly remember his duties  see ye later he said with a grin ill call for the cake next time  call till you split your throat if you want to said cindy  apparently this could have gone on indefinitely but it didnt lucindy went to minneapolis for a few weeks to stay with her brother and that threw claude deeper into despair than anything mrs kennedy might do or any word lucindy might say it was a dreadful blow to him to have her pack up and go so suddenly and without one backward look at him and besides he had planned taking her to tyre on the fourth of july  mr kennedy much betternatured than the mother told claude where she had gone  by mighty thats a knock on the nose for me when did she go  yistady i took her down to the siding  whens she coming back  oh after the hot weather is over four or five weeks  i hope ill be alive when she returns said claude gloomily  naturally he had a little more time to give to nina and her remarkable doings which had set the whole neighborhood to wondering what had come over the girl  she no longer worked in the field she dressed better and had taken to going to the most fashionable church in town she was a woman transformed nothing was able to prevent her steady progression and bloom she grew plumper and fairer and became so much more attractive that the young germans thickened round her and one or two yankee boys looked her way through it all claude kept up his halfhumorous banter and altogether serious daily advice without once realizing that anything sentimental connected him with it all he knew she liked him and sometimes he felt a little annoyed by her attempts to please him but that she was doing all that she did and ordering her whole life to please him never entered his selfsufficient head  there wasnt much room left in that head for anyone else except lucindy and his plans for wining her plan as he might he saw no way of making more than the two dollars a day he was earning as a cream collector  things ran along thus from week to week till it was nearly time for lucindy to return claude was having his top buggy repainted and was preparing for a vigorous campaign when lucindy should be at home again he owned his team and wagon and the buggynothing more  one saturday mr kennedy said lucindys coming home im going down after her tonight  let me bring her up said claude with suspicious eagerness  mr kennedy hesitated no i guess ill go myself i want to go to town anyway  claude was in high spirits as he drove into haldemans yard that afternoon  nina was leaning over the fence singing softly to herself but a fierce altercation was going on inside the house the walls resounded it was all dutch to claude but he knew the old people were quarreling  nina smiled and colored as claude drew up at the side gate she seemed not to hear the eloquent discussion inside  whats going on asked claude  dey tink i am in house  hows that  my mudder she lock me up  claude stared locked you up what for  she tondt like it dot i come out to see you  oh she dont said claude whats the matter o me i aint a dangerous chap i aint eatin up little girls  nina went on placidly she saidt dot you was goin to marry me undt get the farm  claude grinned then chuckied and at last roared and whooped with the delight of it he took off his hat and said  she said that did she why bless her old cabbage head  the opening of the door and the sudden irruption of frau haldeman interrupted him she came rushing toward him like a she grizzly bear uttering a torrent of german expletives and hurled herself upon him clutching at his hair and throat he leaped aside and struck down her hands with a sweep of his hard right arm as she turned to come again he shouted  keep off or ill knock you down  but before the blow came nina seized the infuriated woman from behind and threw her down and held her till the old man came hobbling to the rescue he seemed a little dazed by it all and made no effort to assault claude  the old woman who was already black in the face with rage suddenly fell limp and nina kneeling beside her grew white with fear  oh vat is the matter i hat kildt her  claude rushed for a bucket of water and dashed it in the old womans face he flooded her with slashings of it especially after he saw her open her eyes ending by emptying the bucket in her face he was a little malicious about that  the mother sat up soon wet scared bewildered gasping  mein gott mein gotd ich bin ertrinken  what does she sayshes been drinkin well that looks reasonable  no noshe thinks she is trouned  oh drowned claude roared again not much she aint shes only just getting cooled off  he helped the girl get her mother to the house and stretch her out on a bed the old woman seemed to have completely exhausted herself with her effort and submitted like a child to be waited upon her sudden fainting had subdued her  claude had never penetrated so far into the house before and was much pleased with the neatness and good order of the rooms though they were bare of furniture and carpets  as the girl came out with him to the gate he uttered the most serious word he had ever had with her  now i want you to notice he said that i did nothing to call out the old ladys rush at me id a hit her sure if shed a clinched me again i dont believe in striking a woman but she was after my hide for the time bein and i cant stand two such clutches in the same place you dont blame me i hope  no you done choost ride  what do you suppose the old woman went for me for  nina looked down uneasily  she know you an me lige one anudder an she is afrait you marry me an den ven she tie you get the farm aready  claude whisfied great jehosaphat she really thinks that does she well dog my cats what put that idea into her head  i told her said nina calmly  you told her claude turned and stared at her she looked down and her face slowly grew to a deep red she moved uneasily from one foot to the other like an awkward embarrassed child as he looked at her standing like a culprit before him his first impulse was to laugh he was not specially refined but he was a kindly man and it suddenly occurred to him that the girl was suffering  well you were mistaken he said at last gently enough i dont know why you should think so but i never thought of marrying younever thought of it  the flush faded from her face and she stopped swaying she lifted her eyes to his in a tearful appealing stare  i tought soyou made me tink so  i did how i never said a word to you aboutliking you ormarryingor anything like that i he was going to tell her he intended to marry lucindy but he checked himself  her lashes fell again and the tears began to stream down her cheeks she knew the worst now his face had convinced her she could not tell him the grounds of her beliefthat every time he had said i dont like to see a woman do this or that or i like to see a woman fix up around the house she had considered his words in the light of courtship believing that in such ways the yankees made love so she stood suffering dumbly while he loaded his cream can and stood by the wheel ready to mount his wagon  he turned im mighty sorry about it he said mebbe i was to blame i didnt mean nothing by itnot a thing it was all a mistake lets shake hands over it and call the whole business off  he held his hand out to her and with a low cry she seized it and laid her cheek upon it he started back in amazement and drew his hand away she fell upon her knees in the path and covered her face with her apron while he hastily mounted his seat and drove away  nothing so profoundly moving had come into his life since the death of his mother and as he rode on down the road he did a great deal of thinking first it gave him a pleasant sensation to think a woman should care so much for him he had lived a homeless life for years and had come into intimate relations with few women good or bad they had always laughed with him not at him for claude was able to take care of himself and no woman before had taken him seriously and there was a certain charm about the realization  then he fell to wondering what he had said or done to give the girl such a notion of his purposes perhaps he had been too free with his talk he was so troubled that he hardly smiled once during the rest of his circuit and at night he refrained from going up town and sat under the trees back of the creamery and smoked and pondered on the astounding situation  he came at last to the resolution that it was his duty to declare himself to lucindy and end all uncertainty so that no other woman would fall into ninas error he was as good as an engaged man and the world should know it  the next day with his newly painted buggy flashing in the sun and the extra dozen ivory rings he had purchased for his harnesses clashing together he drove up the road as a man of leisure and a resolved lover it was a beautiful day in august  lucindy was getting a light tea for some friends up from the siding when she saw claude drive up  well for the land sake she broke out using one of her mothers phrases if here isnt that creamery man in that phrase lay the answer to claudes questionif he had heard it he drove in and mr kennedy with impartial hospitality went out and asked hiin to light and put his team in the barn  he did so feeling very much exhilarated he never before had gone courting in this direct and aboveboard fashion he mistook the fathers hospitality for compliance in his designs he followed his host into the house and faced with very fair composure two girls who smiled broadly as they shook hands with him mrs kennedy gave him a lax hand and a curt howdedo and lucindy fairly scowled in answer to his radiant smile  she was much changed he could see she wore a dress with puffed sleeves and her hair was dressed differently she seemed strange and distant but he thought she was putting that on for the benefit of others at the table the three girls talked of things at the siding and ignored him so that he was obliged to turn to farmer kennedy for refuge he kept his courage up by thinking wait till we are alone  after supper when lucindy explained that the dishes would have to be washed he offered to help her in his best manner  thank you i dont need any help was lucindys curt reply  ordinarily he was a man of much facility and ease in addressing women but be was vastly disconcerted by her manner he sat rather silently waiting for the room to clear when the visitors intimated that they must go he rose with cheerful alacrity  ill get your horse for you  he helped hitch the horse into the buggy and helped the girls in with a return of easy gallantry and watched them drive off with joy at last the field was clear  they returned to the sitting room where the old folks remained for a decent interval and then left the young people alone his courage returned then and he turned toward her with resolution in his voice and eyes  lucindy he began  miss kennedy please interrupted lucindy with cutting emphasis  ill be darned if i do he replied hotly whats the matter with you since going to minneapolis you put on a lot of city airs it seems to me  if you dont like my airs you know what you can do  he saw his mistake  now see here lucindy theres no sense in our quarreling  i dont want to quarrel i dont want anything to do with you i wish id never seen you  oh you dont mean that after all the good talks weve had  she flushed red i never had any such talks with you  he pursued his advantage  oh yes you did and you took pains that i should see you  i didnt no such thing you came poking into the kitchen where youd no business to be  say now stop fooling you like me and  i dont i hate you and if you dont clear out ill call father youre one o these kind o men that think if a girl looks at em that they want to marry em i tell you i dont want anything more to do with you and im engaged to another man and i wish youd attend to your own business so there i hope youre satisfied  claude sat for nearly a minute in silence then he rose i guess youre right ive made a mistake ive made a mistake in the girl he spoke with a curious hardness in his voice good evening miss kennedy  he went out with dignity and in good order his retreat was not ludicrous he left the girl with the feeling that she had lost her temper and with the knowledge that she had uttered a lie  he put his horses to the buggy with a mournful selfpity as he saw the wheels glisten he had done all this for a scornful girl who could not treat him decently as he drove slowly down the road he mused deeply it was a knockdown blow surely he was a just man so far as he knew and as he studied the situation over he could not blame the girl in the light of her convincing wrath he comprehended that the sharp things she had said to him in the past were not makebelievenot love taps but real blows she had not been coquetting with him she had tried to keep him away she considered herself too good for a hired man well maybe she was anyhow she had gone out of his reach hopelessly  as he came past the haldemans he saw nina sitting out under the trees in the twifight on the impulse he pulled in his mind took another turn here was a woman who was open and aboveboard in her affection her words meant what they stood for he remembered how she had bloomed out the last few months she has the making of a handsome woman in her he thought  she saw him and came out to the gate and while he leaned out of his carriage she rested her arms on the gate and looked up at him she looked pale and sad and he was touched  hows the old lady he asked  oh shes up she is much changeed she is veak and quiet  quiet is she well thats good  she tinks god strike her fer her vickedness never before did she fainted like dot  well dont spoil that notion in her it may do her a world of good  der priest come he saidt it wass a punishment she saidt i should marry who i like  claude looked at her searchingly she was certainly much improved all she needed was a little encouragement and advice and she would make a handsome wife if the old lady had softened down her soninlaw could safely throw up the creamery job and become the boss of the farm the old man was used up and the farm needed someone right away  he straightened up suddenly get your hat he sald and well take a ride  she started erect and he could see her pale face glow with joy  with you  with me get your best hat we may turn up at the ministers and get marriedif a sunday marriage is legal  as she hurried up the walk he said to himself ill bet it gives lucindy a shock  and the thought pleased him mightily  a days pleasure  mainly it is long and weariful and has a home o toil at one end and a dull little town at the other  when markham came in from shoveling his last wagonload of corn into the crib he found that his wife had put the children to bed and was kneading a batch of dough with the dogged action of a tired and sullen woman  he slipped his soggy boots off his feet and having laid a piece of wood on top of the stove put his heels on it comfortably his chair squeaked as he leaned back on its hind legs but he paid no attention he was used to it exactly as he was used to his wifes lameness and ceaseless toil  that closes up my corn he said after a silence i guess ill go to town tomorrow to git my horses shod  i guess ill git ready and go along said his wife in a sorry attempt to be firm and confident of tone  what do you want to go to town fer he grumbled what does anybody want to go to town fer she burst out facing him i aint been out o this house fer six months while you go an go  oh it aint six months you went down that day i got the mower  when was that the tenth of july and you know it  well mebbe twas i didnt think it was so long ago i aint no objection to your goin only im goin to take a load of wheat  well jest leave off a sack an thatll balance me an the baby she said spiritedly  all right he replied goodnaturedly seeing she was roused only that wheat ought to be put up tonight if youre goin you wont have any time to hold sacks for me in the morning with them young ones to get off to school  well lets go do it then she said sullenly resolute  i hate to go out agin but i spose wed better  he yawned dismally and began pulling his boots on again stamping his swollen feet into them with grunts of pain she put on his coat and one of the boys caps and they went out to the granary the night was cold and clear  dont look so much like snow as it did last night said sam it may turn warm  laying out the sacks in the light of the lantern they sorted out those which were whole and sam climbed into the bin with a tin pail in his hand and the work began  he was a sturdy fellow and he worked desperately fast the shining tin pail dived deep into the cold wheat and dragged heavily on the womans tired hands as it came to the mouth of the sack and she trembled with fatigue but held on and dragged the sacks away when filled and brought others till at last sam climbed out puffing and wheezing to tie them up  i guess ill load em in the morning he said you neednt wait fer me ill tie em up alone  oh i dont mind she replied feeling a little touched by his unexpectedly easy acquiescence to her request when they went back to the house the moon had risen  it had scarcely set when they were wakened by the crowing roosters the man rolled stiffly out of bed and began rattling at the stove in the dark cold kitchen  his wife arose lamer and stiffer than usual and began twisting her thin hair into a knot  sam did not stop to wash but went out to the barn the woman however hastily soused her face into the hard limestone water at the sink and put the kettle on then she called the children she knew it was early and they would need several callings she pushed breakfast forward running over in her mind the things she must have two spools of thread six yards of cotton flannel a can of coffee and mittens for kitty these she must havethere were oceans of things she needed  the children soon came scudding down out of the darkness of the upstairs to dress tumultuously at the kitchen stove they humped and shivered holding up their bare feet from the cold floor like chickens in new fallen snow they were irritable and snarled and snapped and struck like cats and dogs mrs markham stood it for a while with mere commands to hush up but at last her patience gave out and she charged down on the struggling mob and cuffed them right and left  they ate their breakfast by lamplight and when sam went back to his work around the barnyard it was scarcely dawn the children left alone with their mother began to tease her to let them go to town also  no sirnobody goes but baby your fathers goin to take a load of wheat  she was weak with the worry of it all when she had sent the older children away to school and the kitchen work was finished she went into the cold bedroom off the little sitting room and put on her best dress it had never been a good fit and now she was getting so thin it hung in wrinkled folds everywhere about the shoulders and waist she lay down on the bed a moment to ease that dull pam in her back she had a moments distaste for going out at all the thought of sleep was more alluring then the thought of the long long day and the sickening sameness of her life swept over her again and she rose and prepared the baby for the journey  it was but little after sunrise when sam drove out into the road and started for belleplain his wife sat perched upon the wheat sacks behind him holding the baby in her lap a cotton quilt under her and a cotton horse blanket over her knees  sam was disposed to be very goodnatured and he talked back at her occasionally though she could only understand him when he turned his face toward her the baby stared out at the passing fence posts and wiggled his hands out of his mittens at every opportunity he was merry at least  it grew warmer as they went on and a strong south wind arose the dust settled upon the womans shawl and hat her hair loosened and blew unkemptly about her face the road which led across the high level prairie was quite smooth and dry but still it jolted her and the pam in her back increased she had nothing to lean against and the weight of the child grew greater till she was forced to place him on the sacks beside her though she could not loose her hold for a moment  the town drew in sighta cluster of small frame houses and stores on the dry prairie beside a railway station there were no trees yet which could be called shade trees the pitilessly severe light of the sun flooded everything a few teams were hitched about and in the lee of the stores a few men could be seen seated comfortably their broad hat rims flopping up and down their faces brown as leather  markham put his wife out at one of the grocery stores and drove off down toward the elevators to sell his wheat  the grocer greeted mrs markham in a perfunctorily kind manner and offered her a chair which she took gratefully she sat for a quarter of an hour almost without moving leaning against the back of the high chair at last the child began to get restless and troublesome and she spent half an hour helping him amuse himself around the nail kegs  at length she rose and went out on the walk carrying the baby she went into the drygoods store and took a seat on one of the little revolving stools a woman was buying some woolen goods for a dress it was worth twentyseven cents a yard the clerk said but he would knock off two cents if she took ten yards it looked warm and mrs markham wished she could afford it for mary  a pretty young girl came in and laughed and chatted with the clerk and bought a pair of gloves she was the daughter of the grocer her happiness made the wife and mother sad when sam came back she asked him for some money  want you want to do with it he asked  i want to spend it she said  she was not to be trifled with so he gave her a dollar  i need a dollar more  well ive got to go take up that note at the bank  well the childrens got to have some new undercloes she said  he handed her a twodollar bill and then went out to pay his note  she bought her cotton flannel and mittens and thread and then sat leaning against the counter it was noon and she was hungry she went out to the wagon got the lunch she had brought and took it into the grocery to eat itwhere she could get a drink of water  the grocer gave the baby a stick of candy and handed the mother an apple  itll kind o go down with your doughnuts he said after eating her lunch she got up and went out she felt ashamed to sit there any longer she entered another drygoods store but when the clerk came toward her saying anything today mrs she answered no i guess not and turned away with foolish face  she walked up and down the street desolately homeless she did not know what to do with herself she knew no one except the grocer she grew bitter as she saw a couple of ladies pass holding their demitrains in the latest city fashion another woman went by pushing a baby carriage in which sat a child just about as big as her own it was bouncing itself up and down on the long slender springs and laughing and shouting its clean round face glowed from its pretty fringed hood she looked down at the dusty clothes and grimy face of her own little one and walked on savagely  she went into the drugstore where the soda fountain was but it made her thirsty to sit there and she went out on the street again she heard sam laugh and saw him in a group of men over by the blacksmith shop he was having a good time and had forgotten her  her back ached so intolerably that she concluded to go in and rest once more in the grocers chair the baby was growing cross and fretful she bought five cents worth of candy to take home to the children and gave baby a little piece to keep him quiet she wished sam would come it must be getting late the grocer said it was not much after one time seemed terribly long she felt that she ought to do something while she was in town she ran over her purchasesyes that was all she had planned to buy she fell to figuring on the things she needed it was terrible it ran away up into twenty or thirty dollars at the least sam as well as she needed underwear for the cold winter but they would have to wear the old ones even if they were thin and ragged she would not need a dress she thought bitterly because she never went anywhere she rose and went out on the street once more and wandered up and down looking at everything in the hope of enjoying something  a man from boon creek backed a load of apples up to the sidewalk and as he stood waiting for the grocer he noticed mrs markham and the baby and gave the baby an apple this was a pleasure he had such a hearty way about him he on his part saw an ordinary farmers wife with dusty dress unkempt hair and tired face he did not know exactly whey she appealed to him but he tried to cheer her up  the grocer was familiar with these bedraggled and weary wives he was accustomed to see them sit for hours in his big wooden chair and nurse tired and fretful children their forlorn aimless pathetic wandering up and down the street was a daily occurrence and had never possessed any special meaning to him  ii  in a cottage around the corner from the grocery store two men and a woman were finishing a dainty luncheon the woman was dressed in cool white garments and she seemed to make the day one of perfect comfort  the home of the honorable mr hall was by no means the costliest in the town but his wife made it the most attractive he was one of the leading lawyers of the county and a man of culture and progressive views he was entertaining a friend who had lectured the night before in the congregational church  they were by no means in serious discussion the talk was rather frivolous hall had the ability to caricature men with a few gestures and attitudes and was giving to his eastern friend some descriptions of the oldfashioned western lawyers he had met in his practice he was very amusing and his guest laughed heartily for a time  but suddenly hall became aware that otis was not listening then he perceived that he was peering out of the window at someone and that on his face a look of bitter sadness was falling  hall stopped what do you see otis  otis replied i see a forlorn weary woman  mrs hall rose and went to the window mrs markham was walking by the house her baby in her arms savage anger and weeping were in her eyes and on her lips and there was hopeless tragedy in her shambling walk and weak back  in the silence otis went on i saw the poor dejected creature twice this morning i couldnt forget her  who is she asked mrs hall very softly  her name is markham shes sam markhams wife said hall  the young wife led the way into the sitting room and the men took seats and lit their cigars hall was meditating a diversion when otis resumed suddenly  that woman came to town today to get a change to have a little play spell and shes wandering around like a starved and weary cat i wonder if there is a woman in this town with sympathy enough and courage enough to go out and help that woman the saloonkeepers the politicians and the grocers make it pleasant for the manso pleasant that he forgets his wife but the wife is left without a word  mrs halls work dropped and on her pretty face was a look of pain the mans harsh words had wounded herand wakened her she took up her hat and hurried out on the walk the men looked at each other and then the husband said  its going to be a little sultry for the men around these diggings suppose we go out for a walk  delia felt a hand on her arm as she stood at the corner you look tired mrs markham wont you come in a little while im mrs hall  mrs markham turned with a scowl on her face and a biting word on her tongue but something in the sweet round little face of the other woman silenced her and her brow smoothed out  thank you kindly but its most time to go home im looking fer mr markham now  oh come in a little while the baby is cross and tried out please do  mrs markham yielded to the friendly voice and t gether the two women reached the gate just as two men hurriedly turned the other corner  let me relieve you said mrs hall  the mother hesitated hes so dusty  oh that wont matter oh what a big fellow he is i havent any of my own said mrs hall and a look passed like an electric spark between the two women and delia was her willing guest from that moment  they went into the little sitting room so dainty and lovely to the farmers wife and as she sank into an easychair she was faint and drowsy with the pleasure of it she submitted to being brushed she gave the baby into the hands of the swedish girl who washed its face and hands and sang it to sleep while its mother sipped some tea through it all she lay back in her easychair not speaking a word while the ache passed out of her back and her hot swollen head ceased to throb  but she saw everythingthe piano the pictures the curtains the wallpaper the little tea stand they were almost as grateful to her as the food and fragrant tea such housekeeping as this she had never seen her mother had worn her kitchen floor thin as brown paper in keeping a speckless house and she had been in houses that were larger and costlier but something of the charm of her hostess was in the arrangement of vases chairs or pictures it was tasteful  mrs hall did not ask about her affairs she talked to her about the sturdy little baby and about the things upon which delias eyes dwelt if she seemed interested in a vase she was told what it was and where it was made she was shown all the pictures and books mrs hall seemed to read her visitors mind she kept as far from the farm and her guests affairs as possible and at last she opened the piano and sang to hernot slowmoving hymns but catchy love songs full of sentiment and then played some simple melodies knowing that mrs markhams eyes were studying her hands her rings and the flash of her fingers on the keysseeing more than she heardand through it all mrs hall conveyed the impression that she too was having a good time  the rattle of the wagon outside roused them both sam was at the gate for her mrs markham rose hastily oh its almost sundown she gasped in astonishment as she looked out of the window  oh that wont kill anybody replied her hostess dont hurry carrie take the baby out to the wagon for mrs markham while i help her with her things  oh ive had such a good time mrs markham said as they went down the little walk  so have i replied mrs hall she took the baby a moment as her guest climbed in oh you big fat fellow she cried as she gave him a squeeze you must bring your wife in oftener mr markham she said as she handed the baby up  sam was staring with amazement  thank you i will he finally managed to say  good night said mrs markham  good night dear called mrs hall and the wagon began to rattle off  the tenderness and sympathy in her voice brought the tears to delias eyes not hot nor bitter tears but tears that cooled her eyes and cleared her mind  the wind had gone down and the red sunlight fell mistily over the world of corn and stubble the crickets were strn chirping and the feeding cattle were drifting toward the farmyards the day had been made beautiful by human sympathy  mrs ripleys trip  and in winter the winds sweep the snows across it  thn night was in windy november and the blast threatening rain roared around the poor little shanty of uncle ripley set like a chicken trap on the vast iowa prairie uncle ethan was mending his old violin with many york state dums and i gal darns totally oblivious of his tireless old wife who having finished the supper dishes sat knitting a stocking evidently for the little grandson who lay before the stove like a cat neither of the old people wore glasses and their light was a tallow candle they couldnt afford none o them newfangled lamps the room was small the chairs wooden and the walls barea home where poverty was a neverabsent guest the old lady looked pathetically little wizened and hopeless in her illfitting garments whose original color had long since vanished intent as she was on the stocking in her knotted stiffened fingers but there was a peculiar sparkle in her little black eyes and an unusual resolution in the straight line of her withered and shapeless lips suddenly she paused stuck a needle in the spare knob of hair at the back of her head and looking at ripley said decisively ethan ripley youll haff to do your own cooking from now on to new years im goin back to yaark state  the old mans leatherbrown face stiffened into a look of quizzical surprise for a moment then he cackled incredulously ho ho har sho be y now i want to know if y be  well youll find out  goin to start tomorrow mother  no sir i aint but i am on thursday i want to get to sallys by sunday sure an to silass on thanksgivin  there was a note in the old womans voice that brought genuine stupefaction into the face of uncle ripley of course in this case as in all others the money consideration was uppermost  howgy xpect to get the money mother anybody died an left yeh a pile  never you mind where i get the mony so s t tiy dont haff to bear it the land knows if id awaited for you to pay my way  you neednt twit me of bein poor old woman said ripley flaming up after the manner of many old people ive done my part t get along ive worked day in and day out  oh i aint done no work have i snapped she laying down the stocking and leveling a needle at him and putting a frightful emphasis on i  i didnt say you hadnt done no work  yes you did  i didnt neither i said  i know what you said  i said id done my part roared the husband dominating her as usual by superior lung power i didnt say you hadnt done your part he added with an unfortunate touch of emphasis on say  i know y didnt say it but y meant it i dont know what y call doin my part ethan ripley but if cookin for a drove of harvest hands and thrashin hands takin care o the eggs and butter n diggin taters an milkin aint my part i dont never expect to do my part n you might as well know it fust s last im sixty years old she went on with a little break in her harsh voice dominating him now by womans logic an ive never had a day to myself not even fourth o july if ive went avisitin r to a picnic ive had to come home an milk n get supper for you menfolks i aint been away t stay overnight for thirteen years in this house n it was just so in davis county for ten more for twentythree years ethan ripley ive stuck right to the stove an churn without a day or a night off her voice choked again but she rarned and continued impressively and now im agoin back to yaark state  ethan was vanquished he stared at her in speechless surprise his jaw hanging it was incredible  for twentythree years she went on musingly ive just about promised myself every year id go back an see my folks she was distinctly talking to herself now and her voice had a touching wistful cadence ive wanted to go back an see the old folks an the hills where we played an eat apples off the old tree down by the old well ive had them trees an hills in my mind days and daysnights tooan the girls i used to know an my own folks  she fell into a silent muse which lasted so long that the ticking of the clock grew loud as the gong in the mans ears and the wind outside seemed to sound drearier than usual he returned to the money problem kindly though  but how y goin t raise the money i aint got no extra cash this time agin roach is paid an the mortgage interest paid we aint got no hundred dollars to spare jane not by a jugful  waal dont you lay awake nights studyin on where im agoin to get the money said the old woman taking delight in mystifying him she had him now and he couldnt escape he strove to show his indifference however by playing a tune or two on the violin  come tukey you better climb the wooden hill mrs ripley said a half hour later to the little chap on the floor who was beginning to get drowsy under the influence of his grandpas fiddling pa you had orta a put that string in the clock todayon the larm side the string is broke she said upon returning from the boys bedroom i orta get up extry early tomorrow to get some sewin done land knows i cant fix up much but they is a leetle i cn do i want to look decent  they were alone now and they both sat expectantly you pear to think mother that im agin yer goin waal it would kinder seem as if y hadnt hustled yerself any t help me git off  he was smarting under the sense of being wronged waal im jest

managed as well as i have youd have some money to go with and she rose and went to mix her bread and set it raisin he sat by the fire twanging his fiddle softly he was plainly thrown into gloomy retrospectlon something quite unusual for him but his fingers picking out the bars of a familiar tune set him to smiling and whipping his bow across the strings he forgot all about his wifes resolutions and his own hardships trouble always slid off his back like punkins off a haystack anyway  the old man still sat fiddling softly after his wife disappeared in the hot and stuffy little bedroom off the kitchen his shaggy head bent lower over his violin he heard her shoes dropone two pretty soon she called  come put up that squeakin old fiddle and go to bed seems as if you orta have sense enough not to set there keepin everybody in the house awake  you hush up retorted he ill come when i git ready not till ill be glad when youre gone  yes i warrant that  with which arniable good nlght they went off to sleep or at least she did while he lay awake pondering on where under the sun she was goin t raise that money  the next day she was up bright and early working away on her own affairs ignoring ripley totally the fixed look of resolutlon still on her little old wrinkled face she killed a hen and dressed and baked it she fried up a pan of doughnuts and made a cake she was engaged on the doughnuts when a neighbor came in one of those women who take it as a personal affront when anyone in the neighborhood does anything without asking their advice she was fat and could talk a man blind in three minutes by the watch  whats this i hear mis ripley  i dun know i expect you hear about all they is goin on in this neighborhood replied mrs ripley with crushing bluntness but the gossip did not flinch  well sett turner told me that her husband told her that ripley told him that you was goin back east on a visit  waal what of it  well air yeh  the lord willin an the weather

walked so fast and had rested so little that her interminable flow of ses is and ses hes ceased necessarily she had reached moreover the point of most vital interestthe money  an youll find out jest bout as soon as he does was the dry response from the figure hovering over the stove and with all her maneuvering that was all she got  all day ripley went about his work exceedingly thoughtful for him it was cold blustering weather the wind rustled among the cornstalks with a wild and mournful sound the geese and ducks went sprawling down the wind and horses coats were ruffled and backs raised  the old man was husking corn alone in the field his spare form rigged out in two or three ragged coats his hands inserted in a pair of gloves minus nearly all the fingers his thumbs done up in stalls and his feet thrust into huge coarse boots during the middle of the day the frozen ground thawed and the mud stuck to his boots and the down ears wet and chapped his hands already worn to the quick toward night it grew colder and threatened snow in spite of all these attacks he kept his cheerfulness and though he was very tired he was softened in temper  having plenty of time to think matters over he had come to the conclusion that the old woman needed a play spell i aint likely to be no richer next year than i am this one if i wait till im able to send her she wont never go i calclate i cn git enough out o them shoats to send her id kind a lotted on eatn them pigs done up mto sassengers but if the ol woman goes east tukey an mell kind a haff to pull through without em well have a turkey fr thanksgivin an a chicken once n a while lord but well miss the gravy on the flapjacks amen he smacked his lips over the thought of the lost dainty but let er rip we can stand it then there is my buffalo overcoat id kind a calclated on havin a buffalobut thats gone up the spout along with them sassengers  these heroic sacrifices having been determined upon he put them into effect at once  this he was able to do for his corn rows ran alongside the road leading to cedarville and his neighbors were passing almost all hours of the day  it would have softened jane ripleys heart could she have seen his bent and stiffened form amid the corn rows the cold wind piercing to the bone through his threadbare and insufficient clothing the rising wind sent the snow rattling among the moaning stalks at intervals the cold made his poor dim eyes water and he had to stop now and then to swing his arms about his chest to warm them his voice was hoarse with shouting at the shivering team  that night as mrs ripley was clearing the dishes away she got to thinking about the departure of the next day and she began to soften she gave way to a few tears when little tewksbury gilchrist her grandson came up and stood beside her  granma you aint goin to stay away always are yeh  why course not tukey what made y think that  well y aint told us nawfliln tall about it an yeb kind o look sif

souny an weve been s poor all these years i couldnt seem t never get started now when im most ready t go i feel kind a queersif id cry  and cry she did while little tewksbury stood patting her trembling hands hearing ripleys step on the porch she rose hastily and drying her eyes plunged at the work again ripley came in with a big armful of wood which he rolled into the woodbox with a thundering crash then he pulled off his mittens slapped them together to knock off the ice and snow and laid them side by side under the stove he then removed cap coat blouse and boots which last he laid upon the woodbox the soles turned toward the stovepipe  as he sat down without speaking he opened the front doors of the stove and held the palms of his stiffened hands to the blaze the light brought out a thoughtful look on his large uncouth yet kindly visage life had laid hard lines on his brown skin but it had not entirely soured a naturally kind and simple nature it had made him penurious and dull and ironmuscled had stifled all the slender flowers of his nature yet there was warm soil somewhere hid in his heart  its snowin like all psessed he remarked finally i guess well

they wont  i spose ill haff to use it and that ended iti they were a familiar sight as they rode down the road toward town next day as usual mrs ripley sat up straight and stiff as a halfdrove wedge in a whiteoak log the day was cold and raw there was some snow on the ground but not enough to warrant the use of sleighs it was neither sleddin nor wheelin the old people sat on a board laid across the box and had an old quilt or two drawn up over their knees tewksbury lay in the back part of the box which was filled with hay where he jounced up and down in company with a queer old trunk and a brandnew imitationleather handbag there is no ride quite so desolate and uncomfortable as a ride in a lumber wagon on a cold day in autumn when the ground is frozen and the wind is strong and raw with threatening snow the wagon wheels grind along in the snow the cold gets in under the seat at the calves of ones legs and the ceaseless bumping of the bottom of the box on the feet is frightful  there was not much talk on the way down and what little there was related mainly to certain domestic regulations to be strictly followed regarding churning pickles pancakes etc mrs ripley wore a shawl over her head and carried her queer little black bonnet in her hand tewksbury was also wrapped in a shawl the boys teeth were pounding together like castanets by the time they reached cedarville and every muscle ached with the fatigue of shaking after a few purchases they drove down to the railway station a frightful little den common in the west which was always too hot or too cold it happened to be hot just nowa fact which rejoiced little tewksbury  now git my trunk stamped r fixed r whatever they call it she said to ripley in a commanding tone which gave great delight to the inevitable crowd of loafers begliming to assemble now remember tukey have granddad kill that biggest turkey night before thanksgiving an then you run right over to mis doudneysshes got a nawful tongue but she can bake a turkey firstratean shell fix up some squash pies for yeh you can warm up one s them mince pies i wish ye could be with me but ye cant so do the best ye can  ripley returning now she said waal now ive

thunder didnt she after a silence she didnt me neither i guess she kind of sort a forgot it bein so frustrated y know  one cold windy intensely bright day mrs stacey who lives about two miles from cedarville looking out of the window saw a queer little figure struggling along the road which was blocked here and there with drifts it was an old woman laden with a good halfdozen parcels any one of which was a load which the wind seemed determined to wrench from her she was dressed in black with a full skirt and her cloak being short the wind had excellent opportunity to inflate her garments ind sail her off occasionally into the deep snow outside the track but she held on bravely till she reached the gate as she turned in mrs stacey cried  why its granma ripley just getting back from her trip why how do you do come in why you must be nearly frozen let me take off your hat and veil  no thank ye kindly but i cant stop i must be glttin back to ripley i expec that man has jest let

ripley jest kinder stow them bags away ill take two an leave them three others goodbye i must be gittin home to ripley hell want his supper on time and off up the road the indomitable little figure trudged head held down to the cutting blast little snow fly a speck on a measureless expanse crawling along with painful breathing and slipping sliding steps gittin home to ripley an the boy  ripley was out to the barn when she entered but tewksbury was building a fire in the old cookstove he sprang up with a cry of joy and ran to her she seized him and kissed him and it did her so much good she hugged him close and kissed him again and again crying hysterically  oh granma im so glad to see you weve had an awful time since youve been gone  she released him and looked around a lot of dirty dishes were on the table the tablecloth was a sight to behold and so was the stovekettle marks all over the tablecloth splotches of pancake batter all over the stove  waal i shd say as much she dryly vouchsafed untying her bonnet strings  when ripley came in she had on her regimentals the stove was brushed the room swept and she was elbowdeep in the dishpan hullo mother got back hev yeh  i shd say it was about time she replied briefly without looking up or ceasing work has ol cruuipy dried up yit this was her greeting  her trip was a fact now no chance could rob her of it she had looked forward twentythree years toward it and now she could look back at it accomplished she took up her burden again never more thinking to lay it down  uncle ethan ripley  like the maintravelled road of life it is traversed by many classes of people  uncle ethan had a theory that a mans character could be told by the way he sat in a wagon seat  a mean man sets right plumb in the middle o the seat as much as to say walk goldarn yeh who cares but a man that sets in the corner o the seat much as to say jump incheaper t ride n to walk you can jest tie to  uncle ripley was prejudiced in favor of the stranger therefore before he came opposite the potato patch where the old man was bugging his vines the stranger drove a jadedlooking pair of calico ponies hitched to a clattering democrat wagon and he sat on the extreme end of the seat with the lines in his right hand while his left rested on his thigh with his little finger gracefully crooked and his elbows akimbo he wore a blue shirt with gaycolored armlets just above the elbows and his vest hung unbuttoned down his lank ribs it was plain he was well pleased with himself  as he pulled up and threw one leg over the end of the seat uncle ethan observed that the left spring was much more worn than the other which proved that it was not accidental but that it was the drivers habit to sit on that end of the seat  good afternoon said the stranger pleasantly  good afternoon sir  bugs purty plenty  plenty enough i gol i dont see where they all come fum  early rose inquired the man as if referring to the bugs  no peachblows an carter reds my early rose is over near the house the old woman wants em near see the darned things he pursued rapping savagely on the edge of the pan to rattle the bugs back  how do yeh kill emscald em  mostly sornetimcs i  good piece of oats yawned the stranger listessly  thats barley  so tis didnt notice  uncle ethan was wondering who the man was he had some pots of black paint in the wagon and two or three square boxes  what do yeh think o clevelands chances for a second term continued the man as if they had been talking politics all the while  uncle ripley scratched his head waali dunn bein a republicani think  thats soits a purty scaly outlook i dont believe in second terms myself the man hastened to say  is that your new barn acrosst there be asked pointing with his whip  yes sir it is replied the old man proudly after years of planning and hard work he had managed to erect a little wooden barn costing possibly three hundred dollars it was plain to be seen he took a childish pride in the fact of its newness  the stranger mused a lovely place for a sign he said as his eyes wandered across its shining yellow broadside  uncle ethan stared unmindful of the bugs crawling over the edge of his pan his interest in the pots of paint deepened  couldnt think o lettin me paint a sign on that barn the stranger continued putting his locked hands around one knee and gaining away across the pigpen at the building  what kind of a sign goldarn your skins uncle ethan pounded the pan with his paddle and scraped two or three crawling abominations off his leathery wrist  it was a beautiful day and the man in the wagon seemed unusually loath to attend to business the tired ponies slept in the shade of the lombardies the plain was draped in a warm mist and shadowed by vast vaguely defined masses of cloudsa lazy june day  dodds family bitters said the man waking out of his abstraction with a start and resuming his working manner the best bitter in the market he alluded to it in the singular like to look at it no trouble to show goods as the fellah says he went on hastily seeing uncle ethans hesitation  he produced a large bottle of triangular shape like a bottle for pickled onions it had a red seal on top and a strenuous caution in red letters on the neck none genuine unless dodds family bittem is blown in the bottom  heres what it cures pursued the agent pointing at the side where in an inverted pyramid the names of several hundred diseases were arranged running from gout to pulmonary complaints etc  i gol she cuts a wide swath dont she exclaimed uncle ethan profoundly impressed with the list  they aint no better bitter in the world said the agent with a conclusive inflection  whats its speshyality most of em have some speshyality  wellsummer complaintsananspring an fall troublestones ye up sort of  uncle ethans forgotten pan was empty of his gathered bugs he was deeply interested in this man there was something he liked about him  what does it sell fur he asked after a pause  same price as them cheap medicinesdollar a bottlebig bottles too want one  wal mother aint to home an i dont know as shed like this kind we aint been sick fr years still theys no tellln he added seeing the answer to his objection in the agents eyes times is purty close too with us y see weve just built that stable  say ill tell yeh what ill do said the stranger waking up and speaking in a warnily generous tone ill give you ten bottles of the bitter if youll let me paint a sign on that barn it wont hurt the barn a bit and if you want o you can paint it out a year from date come what dye say  i guess i hadnt better  the agent thought that uncle ethan was after more pay but in reality he was thinking of what his little old wife would say  it simply puts a family bitter in your home that may save you fifty dollars this comin fall you cant tell  just what the man said after that uncle ethan didnt follow his voice had a confidential purring sound as he stretched across the wagon seat and talked on eyes half shut he straightened up at last and concluded in the tone of one who has carried his point  so if you didnt want to use the whole twenty five bottles yrself why sell it to your neighbors you can get twenty dollars out of it easy and still have five bottles of the best family bitter that ever went into a bottle  it was the thought of this opportunity to get a buffalo skin coat that consoled uncle ethan as he saw the hideous black letters appearing under the agents lazy brush  it was the hot side of the barn and painting was no light work the agent was forced to mop his forehead with his sleeve  say haint got a cookie or anything and a cup o milk handy he said at the end of the first enormous word which ran the whole length of the barn  uncle ethan got him the milk and oookie which he ate with an exaggeratedly dainty action of his fingers seated meanwhile on the staging which uncle ripley had helped him to build this lunch infused new energy into him and in a short time dodds family bitters best in the market disfigured the sweetsmelling pine boards  ethan was eating his selfobtained supper of bread and milk when his wife came home  whos been apaintin on that barn she demanded her beadlike eyes flashing her withered little face set in an ominous frown ethan ripley what you been doin  nawthin he replied feebly  who painted that sign on there  a man come along an he wanted to paint that on there and i let im and its my barn anyway i guess i can do what im a min to with it he ended defiantly but his eyes wavered  mrs ripley ignored the defiance what under the sun psessed you to do such a thing as that ethan ripley i declare i dont see you git fooler an fooler cvry day you live i do believe  uncle ethan attempted a defense  wal he paid me twentyfive dollars fr it anyway  did e she was visibly affected by this news  wal anyhow it amounts to that he give me twentyfive bottles  mrs ripley sank back in her chair wal i swan to bungay ethan ripleywal you beat all i ever see she added in despair of expression i thought you had some sense left but you haint not one blessed scimpton where is the stuff  down cellar an you neednt take on no airs ol woman ive known you to buy things you didnt need time an time an agintins an things an i guess you wish you had back that ten dollars you paid for that illustrated bible  go long an bring that stuff up here i never see such a man in my life its a wonder he didnt do it fr two bottles she glared out at the sign which faced directly upon the kitchen window  uncle ethan tugged the two cases up and set them down on the floor of the kitchen mrs ripley opened a bottle and smelled of it like a cautious cat  ugh merciful sakes what stuff it aint fit fr a hog to take whatd you think you was goin to do with it she asked in poignant disgust  i expected to take itif i was sick whaddy ye spose he defiantly stood his ground towering above her like a leaning tower  the hull cartload of it  no im goin to sell part of it an git me an overcoat  sell it she shouted nobuddyil buy that sicknin stuff but an old numskull like you take that slop out o the house this minute take it right down to the sinkhole an smash every bottle on the stones  uncle ethan and the cases of medicine disappeared and the old woman addressed her concluding remarks to little tewksbury her grandson who stood timidly on one leg in the doorway like an intruding pullet  everything around this place ud go to rack an ruin if i didnt keep a watch on that softpated old dummy i thought that lightninrod man had glve him a lesson hed remember but no he must go an make a reglar  she subsided in a tumult of banging pans which helped her out in the matter of expression and reduced her to a grim sort of quiet uncle ethan went about the house like a convict on shipboard once she caught him looking out of the window  i should think youd feel proud o that  uncle ethan had never been sick a day in his life he was bent and bruised with neverending toil but he had nothing especial the matter with him  he did not smash the medicine as mrs ripley commanded because he had determined to sell it the next sunday morning after his chores were done he put on his best coat of faded diagonal and was brushing his hair into a ridge across the center of his high narrow head when mrs ripley carne in from feeding the calves  where you goin now  none o your business he replied its darn funny if i cant stir without you wantin to know all about it wheres tukey  feedin the chickens you aint goin to take him off this mornin now i dont care where you go  whos agoin to take him off i aint said nothin about takin him off  wal take yrseif off an if y aint here fr dinner i aint goin to get no supper  ripley took a water pail and put four bottles of the bitter mto it and trudged away up the road with it in a pleasant glow of hope all nature seemed to declare the day a time of rest and invited men to disassoeiate ideas of toil from the rustling green wheat shining grass and tossing blooms something of the sweetness and buoyancy of all nature permeated the old mans workcalloused body and he whistled little snatches of the dance tunes he played on his fiddle  but he found neighbor johnson to be supplied with another variety of bitter which was all he needed for the present he qualified his refusal to buy with a cordial invitation to go out and see his shoats in which he took infinite pride but uncle ripley said i guess ill haf t be gom i want o git up to jennings before dimier  he couldnt help feeling a little depressed when he found jennings away the next house along the pleasant lane was inhabited by a newcomer he was sitting on the horse trough holding a horses halter while his hired man dashed cold water upon the galled spot on the animals shoulder  after some preliminary talk ripley presented his medicine  hell no what do i want of such stuff when theys anything the matter with me i take a lunkin ol swig of popple bark and bourbon that fixes me  uncle ethan moved off up the lane he hardly felt like whistling now at the next house he set his pail down in the weeds beside the fence and went in without it doudney came to the door in his bare feet buttoning his suspenders over a clean boiled shirt he was dressing to go out  hello ripley i was just goin down your way jest wait a minute an ill be out  when he came out fully dressed uncle ethan grappled him  say what d you think o paytent med  some of em are boss but y want o know what yre gittin  what d ye think o dodds  best in the market  uncle ethan straightened up and his face lighted doudney went on  yes sir best bitter that ever went into a bottle i know ive tried it i dont go much on patent medicines but when i get a good  dont want o buy a bottle  doudney turned and faced him  buy no ive got nineteen bottles i want o sell ripley glanced up at doudneys new granary and there read dodds family bitters he was stricken dumb doudney saw it all and roared  wal thats a good one we two tryin to sell each other bitters hohohohar whoop wal this is rich how many bottles did you git  none o your business said uncle ethan as he turned and made off while doudney screamed with merriment  on his way home uncle ethan grew ashamed of his burden doudney had canvassed the whole neighborhood and he practically gave up the struggle everybody he met seemed determined to find out what he had been doing and at last he began lying about it  hello uncle ripley what y got there in that pail  goose eggs fr settin  he disposed of one bottle to old gus peterson gus never paid his debts and he would oniy promise fifty cents on tick for the bottle and yet so desperate was ripley that this questionable sale cheered him up not a little  as he came down the road tired dusty and hungry he climbed over the fence in order to avoid seeing that sign on the barn and slunk into the house without looking back  he couldnt have felt meaner about it if he had allowed a democratic poster to be pasted there  the evening passed in grim silence and in sleep he saw that sign wriggling across the side of the barn like boa constrictors hung on rails he tried to paint them out but every time he tried it the man seemed to come back with a sheriff and savagely warned him to let it stay till the year was up in some mysterious way the agent seemed to know every time he brought out the paint pot and he was no longer the pleasantvoiced individual who drove the calico ponies  as he stepped out into the yard next morning that abominable sickening scrawling advertisement was the first thing that claimed his glanceit blotted out the beauty of the morning  mrs ripley came to the window buttoning her dress at the throat a wisp of her hair sticking assertively from the little knob at the back of her head  lovely aint it an jve got to see it all day long i cant look out the winder but that things right in my face it seemed to make her savage she hadnt been in such a temper since her visit to new york i hope you feel satisfied with it  ripley walked off to the barn his pride in its clean sweet newness was gone he slyly tried the paint to see if it couldnt be scraped off but it was dried in thoroughly whereas before he had taken delight in having his neighbors turn and look at the building now he kept out of sight whenever he saw a team coming he hoed corn away in the back of the field when he should have been bugging potatoes by the roadside  mrs ripley was in a frightful mood about it but she held herself in check for several days at last she burst forth  ethan ripley i cant stand that thing any longer and i aint goin to thats all youve got to go and paint that thing out or i will im just about crazy with it  but mother i promised  i dont care what you promised its got to be painted out ive got the nightmare now seein it im goin to send for a pail o red paint and im goin to paint that out if it takes the last breath ive got to do it  ill tend to it mother if you wont hurry me  i cant stand it another day it makes me boil every time i look out the winder  uncle ethan hitched up his team and drove gloomily off to town where he tried to find the agent he lived in some other part of the county however and so the old man gave up and bought a pot of red paint not daring to go back to his desperate wife without it  goin to paint yr new barn inquired the merchant with friendly interest  uncle ethan turned with guilty sharpness but the merchants face was grave and kindly  yes i thought id tech it up a littledont cost much  it paysalways the merchant said emphatically  will itstick jest as well put on evenings inquired uncle ethan hesitatingly  yeswont make any difference why aint goin to have  wali kind o thought id do it odd times night an morninkind o odd times  he seemed oddly confused about it and the merchant looked after him anxiously as he drove away  after supper that night he went out to the barn and mrs ripley heard him sawing and hammering then the noise ceased and he came in and sat down in his usual place  what y ben makin she inquired tewksbury had gone to bed she sat darning a stocking  i jest thought id git the stagin ready fr paintin he said evasively  wal ill be glad when its covered up when she got ready for bed he was still seated in his chair and after she had dozed off two or three times she began to wonder why he didnt come when the clock struck ten and she realized that he had not stirred she began to get impatient come are y goin to sit there all night there was no reply she rose up in bed and looked about the room the broad moon flooded it with light so that she could see he was not asleep in his chair as she had supposed there was something ominous in his disappearance  ethan ethan ripley where are yeh there was no reply to her sharp call she rose and distractedly looked about among the furniture as if he inight somehow be a cat and be hiding in a corner somewhere then she went upstairs where the boy slept her hard little heels making a curious tunking noise on the bare boards the moon fell across the sleeping hoy like a robe of silver he was alone  she began to be alarmed her eyes widened in fear an sorts of vague horrors sprang unbidden into her brain she still had the mist of sleep in her brain  she hurried down the stairs and out into the fragrant night the katydids were singing in infinite peace under the solemn splendor of the moon the cattle sniffed and sighed jangling their bells now and then and the chickens in the coop stirred uneasily as if overheated the old woman stood there in her bare feet and long nightgown horrorstricken the ghastly story of a man who had hung himseif in his barn because his wife deserted him came into her mind and stayed there with frightful persistency her throat filled chokingly  she felt a wild rush of loneliness she had a sudden realization of how dear that gaunt old figure was with its grizzled face and ready smile her breath came quick and quicker and she was at the point of bursting into a wild cry to tewksbury when she heard a strange noise it came from the barn a creaking noise she looked that way and saw in the shadowed side a deeper shadow moving to and fro a revulsion to astonishment and anger took place in her  land o bungay if he aint paintin that barn like a perfect old idiot in the night  uncle ethan working desperately did not hear her feet pattering down the path and was startled by her shrill voice  well ethan ripley whaddy y think youre doin now  he made two or three slapping passes with the brush and then snapped out im apaintin this barnwhaddy ye spose ii ye had eyes y wouldnt ask  well you come right straight to bed what dyou mean by actin so  you go back into the house an let me be i know what im adoin youve pestered me about this sign jest about enough he dabbed his brush to and fro as he spoke his gaunt figure towered above her in shadow his slapping brush had a vicious sound  neither spoke for some time at length she said more gently aint you comin in  nonot till i get aready you go long an tend to yr own business dont stan there an ketch cold  she moved off slowly toward the house his shout subdued her working alone out there had rendered him savage he was not to be pushed any further she knew by the tone of his voice that he must now be respected  she slipped on her shoes and a shawl and came back where he was working and took a seat on a sawhorse  im goin to set right here till you come in ethan ripley she said in a firm voice but gentler than usual  wal youll set a good while was his ungracious reply but each felt a furtive tenderness for the other he worked on in silence the boards creaked heavily as he walked to and fro and the slapping sound of the paint brush sounded loud in the sweet harmony of the night the majestic moon swung slowly round the corner of the barn and fell upon the old mans grizzled head and bent shoulders the horses inside could be heard stamping the mosquitoes away and chewing their hay in pleasant chorus  the little figure seated on the sawhorse drew the shawl closer ahout her thin shoulders her eyes were in shadow and her hands were wrapped in her shawl at last she spoke in a curious tone  wal i dont know as you was so very much to blame i didnt want that bible myselfi hold out i did but i didnt  ethan worked on until the full meaning of this unprecedented surrender penetrated his head and then he threw down his brush  wal i guess ill let er go at that iye covered up the most of it anyhow guess we better go in  gods ravens  i  chicago has three winds that blow upon it one comes from the east and the mind goes out to the cold grayblue lake one from the north and men think of illimitable spaces of pinelands and mapleclad ridges which lead to the unknown deeps of the arctic woods  but the third is the west of southwest wind dry magnetic full of smell of unmeasured miles of growing grain in summer or ripening corn and wheat in autumn when it comes in winter the air glitters with incredible brilliancy the snow of the country dazzles and flames in the eyes deep blue shadows everywhere stream like stains of ink sleigh bells wrangle from early morning till late at night and every step is quick and alert in the city smoke dims its clarity but it is welcome  but its greatest moment of domination is spring the bitter gray wind of the east has held unchecked rule for days giving place to its brother the north wind only at intervals till some day in march the wind of the southwest begins to blow then the eaves begin to drip here and there a fowl in a house that is really a prison begins to sang the song it sang on the farm and toward noon its song becomes a chant of articulate joy  then the poor crawl out of their reeking hovels on the south and west sides to stand in the sunthe blessed sunand felicitate themselves on being alive windows of sickrooms are opened the merry small boy goes to school without his tippet and men lay off their long ulsters for their beaver coats caps give place to hats and men women pause to chat when they meet each other the street the open door is the sign of the great change of wind  there are imaginative souls who are stirred yet deeper by this windmen like robert bloom to whom come vague and very sweet reminiscences of farm life when the snow is melting and the dry ground begins to appear to these people the wind comes from the wide unending spaces of the prairie west they can smell the strange thrilling odor of newly uncovered sod and moist brown plowed lands to them it is like the opening door of a prison  robert had crawled downtown and up to his office high in the star block after a months sickness he had resolutely pulled a pad of paper under his hand to write but the window was open and that wind coming in and he could not writehe could only dream  his brown hair fell over the thin white hand which propped his head his face was like ivory with dull yellowish stains in it his eyes did not see the mountainous roofs humped and piled into vast masses of brick and stone crossed and riven by streets and swept by masses of graywhite vapor they saw a little valley circled by lowwooded bluffshis native town in wisconsin  as his weakness grew his ambition fell away and his heart turned back to nature and to the things he had known in his youth to the kindly people of the olden time it did not occur to him that the spirit of the country might have changed  sitting thus he had a mighty longing come upon him to give up the struggle to go back to the simplest life with his wife and two boys why should he tread in the mill when every day was taking the lifeblood out of his heart  slowly his longing took resolution at last he drew his desk down and as the lock clicked it seemed like the shutting of a prison gate behind him  at the elevator door he met a fellow editor hello bloom didnt know you were down today  im only trying it im going to take a vacation for a while  thats right man you look like a ghost  he hadnt the courage to tell him he never expected to work there again his step on the way home was firmer than it had been for weeks in his white face his wife saw some subtle change  what is it robert  mate lets give it up  what do you mean  the struggle is too hard i cant stand it im hungry for the country again lets get out of this  wherell we go  back to my native townup among the wisconsin hills and coulees go anywhere so that we escape this pressureits killing me lets go to bluff siding for a year it  will do me goodmay bring me back to life i can do enough special work to pay our grocery bill and the merrill placeso jack tells meis empty we can get it for seventyfive dollars for a year we can pull through some way  very well robert  i must have rest all the bounce has gone out of me mate he said with sad lines in his face any extra work here is out of the question i can only shamble aroundan excuse for a man  the wife had ceased to smile her strenuous cheerfulness could not hold before his tragically drawn and bloodless face  ill go wherever you think best robert it will be just as well for the boys i suppose there is a school there  oh yes at any rate they can get a years schooling in nature  wellno matter robert you are the one to be considered she had the selfsacrfficing devotion of the average woman she fancied herself hopelessly his inferior  they had dwelt so long on the crumbling edge of poverty that they were hardened to its threat and yet the failure of roberts health had been of the sort which terrifies it was a slow but steady sinking of vital force it had its ups and downs but it was a downward trail always downward the time for selldeception had passed  his paper paid him a meager salary for his work was prized only by the more thoughtful readers of the star  in addition to his regular work he occasionally hazarded a story for the juvenile magazines of the east in this way he turned the antics of his growing boys to account as he often said to his wife  he had also passed the preliminary stages of literary success by getting a couple of stories accepted by an eastern magazine and he still confidently looked forward to seeing them printed  his wife a sturdy practical little body did her part in the bitter struggle by keeping their little home one of the most attractive on the west side the north side being altogether too high for them  in addition her sorely pressed brain sought out other ways of helping she wrote out all her husbands stories on the typewriter and secretly she had tried composing others herself the results being queer dry little chronicles of the doings of men and women strung together without a touch of literary grace  she proposed taking a large house and rerenting rooms but robert would not hear to it as long as i can crawl about well leave that to others  in the month of preparation which followed he talked a great deal about their venture  i want to get there he said just when the leaves are coming out on the trees i want to see the cherry trees blossom on the hillside the popple trees always get green first  at other times he talked about the people it will be a rest just to get back among people who arent ready to tread on your head in order to lift themselves up i believe a year among those kind unhurried people will glve me all the material ill need for years ill write a series of studies somewhat like jefferiesor barriesonly of course ill be original ill just take his plan of telling about the people i meet and their queer ways so quaint and good  im tired of the scramble he kept breaking out of silence to say i dont blame the boys but its plain to me they see that my going will let them move up one mason cynically voiced the whole thing today i can say sorry to see you go bloom because your going doesnt concern me im not in line of succession but some of the other boys dont feel so theres no divinity doth hedge an editor nothing but law prevents the murder of those above by those below  i dont like mr mason when he talks like that said the wife  welli dont he didnt tell her what mason said when robert talked about the good simple life of the people in bluff siding  oh bosh bloom youll find the struggle of the outside world reflected in your little town youll find men and women just as hard and selfish in their small way itll be harder to bear because it will all be so petty and pusillailmous  it was a lovely day in late april when they took the train out of the great grimy terrible city it was eight oclock but the streets were muddy and wet a cold east wind blowing off the lake  with clanging bell the train moved away piercing the ragged gray formless mob of houses and streets through which railways always run in a city men were hurrying to work and robert pitied them poor fellows condemned to do that thing forever  in an hour they reached the prairies already clothed upon faintly with green grass and tender springing wheat the purplebrown squares reserved for the corn looked deliciously soft and warm to the sick man and he longed to set his bare feet into it  his boys were wild with delight they had the natural love of the earth still in them and correspondingly cared little for the city they raced through the cars like colts they saw everything every blossoming plant every budding tree was precious to them all  all day they rode toward noon they left the sunny prairie land of northern illinois and southern wisconsin and entered upon the hill land of madison and beyond as they went north the season was less advanced but spring was in the fresh wind and the warm sunshine  as evening drew on the hylas began to peep from the pools and their chorus deepened as they came on toward bluff siding which seemed very small very squalid and uninteresting but robert pointed at the circling winecolored wall of hills and the warm sunset sky  were in luck to find a hotel said robert they burn down every three months  they were met by a middleaged man and conducted across the road to a hotel which had been a rollerskating rink in other days and was not prepossessing however they were ushered into the parlor which resembled the sitting room of a rather ambitious village home and there they took seats while the landlord consulted about rooms  the wifes heart sank from the window she could see several of the low houses and far off just the hills which seemed to make the town so very small very lonely she was not given time to shed tears the children clamored for food tired and cross  robert went out into the office where he sigued his name under the close and silent scrutiny of a half dozen roughly clad men who sat leaning against the wall they were merely workingmen to him but in mrs blooms eyes they were dangerous people  the landlord looked at the name as robert wrote your boxes are all here he said  robert looked up at him in surprise what boxes  your household goods they came in on no9  robert recovered himself he remembered this was a village where everything that goes oneverythingis known  the stairway rose picturesquely out of the office to the low second story and wp these stairs they tramped to their tiny rooms which were like cells  oh mamma aint it queer cried the boys  supper is all ready the landlords soft deep voice aunounced a few moments later and the boys responded with whoops of hunger  they were met by the close scrutiny of every boarder as they entered and they heard also the muttered cornments and explanations  family to take the merrill house  he looks purty well fiaxed out dont he  they were agreeably surprised to find everything neat and clean and wholesome the bread was good and the butter delicious their spirits revived  that butter tastes like old times said robert lis fresh its really butter  they made a hearty meal and the boys being filled up grew sleepy after they were put to bed robert said now mate lets go see the house  they walked out arm in arm like lovers her sturdy form steadied him though he would not have acknowledged it the red flush was not yet gone from the west and the hills still kept a splendid tone of purpleblack it was very clear the stars were out the wind deliciously soft isnt it still robert aimost whispered  they walked on under the budding trees up the hill till they came at last to the small frame house set under tall maples and locust trees just showing a feathery fringe of foliage  this is our home said robert  mate leaned on the gate in silence frogs were peeping the smell of spring was in the air there was a magnificent repose in the hour restful recreating impressive  oh its beautiful robert i know we shall like it  we must like it he said  ii  first contact with the people disappointed robert in the work of moving in he had to do with people who work at days work and the fault was his more than theirs he forgot that they did not consider their work degrading they resented his bossing the drayman grew rebellious  look ahere my christian friend if youll go long in the house and let us alone itll be a good job we know what were about  this was not pleasant and he did not perceive the trouble in the same way he got foul of the carpenter and the man who plowed his garden some way his tone was not right his voice was cold and distant he generally found that the men knew better than he what was to be done and how to do it and sometimes he felt like apologizing but their attitude had changed till apology was impossible  he had repelled their friendly advances because he considered them without meaning to do so as workmen and not as neighbors they reported therefore that he was cranky and rode a high horse  he thinks hes a little tin god on wheels the drayman said  oh hell get over that said mclane i knew the boys folks years agotiptop folks too he aint well and that makes him a little crusty  thats the troublehe thinks hes an upper crust said jim cullen the drayman  at the end of ten days they were settled and nothing remained to do but plan a little garden andget well the boys with their unspoiled natures were able to melt into the ranks of the villageboy life at once with no more friction than was indicated by a couple of roughandtumble fights they were sturdy fellows like their mother and these fights gave them high rank  robert got along in a dull smooth way with his neighbors he was too formal with them he met them only at the meat shop and the post office they nodded genially and said got settled yet and he replied quite comfortable thank you they felt his coldness conversation halted when he came near and made him feel that he was the subject of their talk as a matter of fact he generally was he was a source of great speculation with them some of them had gone so far as to bet he wouldnt live a year they all seemed grotesque to him so workscarred and bent and hairy even the men whose names he had known from childhood were queer to him they seemed shy and distant too not like his ideas of them  to mate they were almost caricatures what makes them look soso way behind the times robert  well i suppose they are said robert life in these coulees goes on rather slower than in chicago then there are a great many welsh and germans and norwegians living way up the coulees and theyre the ones you notice theyre not all so he could be generous toward them in general it was in special cases where he failed to know them  they had been there nearly two weeks without meeting any of them socially and robert was beginning to change his opinion about them they let us severely alone he was saying one night to his wife  its very odd i wonder what id better do robert i dont know the etiquette of these small towns i never lived in one before you know whether i ought to call firstand good gracious wholl i call on im in the dark  so am i to tell the truth i havent lived in one of these small towns since i was a lad i have a faint recollection that introductions were absolutely necessary they have an etiquette which is as binding as that of mcailisters four hundred but what it is i dont know  well well wait  the boys are perfectly at home said robert with a little emphasis on boys which was the first indication of his disappointment the people he had failed to reach  there came a knock on the door that startled them both come in said robert in a nervous shout  land sakes did i scare ye seem so way ye yelled said a highkeyed nasal voice and a tall woman came in followed by an equally stalwart man  how de do mrs folsom my wife mr folsom  folsoms voice was lost in the bustle of getting settled but mrs folsoms voice rose above the clamor i was tellin him it was about time we got neighborly i never let anybody come to town a week without callin on em it does a body a heap o good to see a face outside the family once in a while specially in a new place how do you like up here on the hill  very much the view is so fine  yes i spose it is still it aint my notion i dont like to climb hills well enough still ive heard of people buildin just for the view its all in taste as the old woman said that kissed the cow  there was an element of shrewdness and sellanalysis in mrs folsom which saved her from being grotesque she knew she was queer to mrs bloom but she did not resent it she was still young in form and face but her teeth were gone and like so many of her neighbors she was too poor to replace them from the dentists she wore a decent calico dress and a shawl and hat  as she talked her eyes took in every article of furniture in the room and every little piece of fancywork and bricabrac in fact she reproduced the pattern of one of the tidies within two days  folsom sat dumbly in his chair robert who met him now as a neighbor for the first time tried to talk with him but failed and turned himself gladly to mrs folsom who delighted him with her vigorous phrases  oh were amovin though you wouldnt think it this town is filled with a lot of old skinflints close aint no name for em jest ask folsom thar about em hes been buildin their houses for em still i suppose they say the same thing o me she added with a touch of humor which always saved her she used a mans phrases were always ready to tax some other feller but we kick like mules when the tax falls on us she went on my land the fight weve had to git sidewalks in this town  you should be mayor  thats what i tell folsom takes a woman to clean things up well i must run along thought id jest call in and see how you all was come down when ye kin  thank you i will  after they had gone robert turned with a smile our first formal call  oh dear robert what can i do with such people  go see em i like her shes shrewd youll like her too  but what can i say to such people did you hear her say we fellers to me  robert laughed thats nothing she feels as much of a man or feller as anyone why shouldnt she  but shes so vulgar  i admit she isnt elegant but i think shes a good wife and mother  i wonder if theyre all like that  now mate we must try not to offend them we must try to be one of them  but this was easier said than done as he went down to the post office and stood waiting for his mail like the rest he tried to enter into conversation witb them but mainly they moved away from him william mcturg nodded at him and said how de do and mclane asked how he liked his new place and that was about all  he couldnt reach them they suspected him they had only the estimate of the men who had worked for him and while they were civil they plainly didnt need him in the slightest degree except as a topic of conversation  he did not improve as he had hoped to do the spring was wet and cold the most rainy and depressing the valley had seen in many years day after day the rain clouds sailed in over the northern hills and deluged the flat little town with water till the frogs sang in every street till the main street mired down every team that drove into it  the corn rotted in the earth but the grass grew tall and yellowgreen the trees glistened through the gray air and the hills were like green jewels of incalculable worth when the sun shone at sweet infrequent intervals  the cold and damp struck through into the aliens heart it seemed to prophesy his dark future he sat at his desk and looked out into the gray rain with gloomy eyesa prisoner when he had expected to be free  he had failed in his last venture he had not gained any powerhe was reaily weaker than ever the rain had kept him confined to the house the joy he had anticipated of tracing out all his boyish pleasure haunts was cut off he had relied too upon that as a source of literary power  he could not do much more than walk down to the post office and back on the pleasantest days a few people called but he could not talk to them and they did not call again  in the meanwhile his little bank account was vanishing the boys were strong and happy that was his only comfort and his wife seemed strong too she had little time to get lonesome  he grew morbid his weakness and insecurity made him jealous of the security and health of others  he grew almost to hate the people as he saw them coming and going in the mud or heard their loud hearty voices sounding from the street he hated their gossip their dull jokes the flat little town grew vulgar and low and desolate to him  every little thing which had amused him now annoyed him the cut of their beards worried him their voices jarred upon him every day or two he broke forth to his wife in long tirades of abuse  oh i cant stand these people they dont know anything they talk every rag of gossip into shreds taters fish hops hops fish and taters theyve saved and pinched and toiled till their souls are pinched and ground away youre right they are caricatures they dont read or think about anything in which im interested this life is nervedestroying talk about the health of the village life it destroys body and soul it debilitates me it will warp us both down to the level of these people  she tried to stop him but he went on a flush of fever on his cheek  they degrade the nature they have touched their squat little town is a caricature like themselves everything they touch they belittle here they sit while sidewalks rot and teams mire in the streets  he raged on like one dementedbitter accusing rebellious in such a mood he could not write in place of inspiring him the little town and its people seemed to undermine his power and turn his sweetness of spirit into gall and acid he only bowed to them now as he walked feebly among them and they excused it by referring to his sickness they eyed him each time with pitying eyes hes failin fast they said among themselves  one day as he was returning from the post office he felt blind for a moment and put his hand to his head the wold of vivid green grew gray and life rceded from him into illimitable distance he had one dim fading glimpse of a shaggybearded face looking down at him and felt the clutch of an ironhard strong arm under him and then he lost hold even on so much consciousness  he came back slowly rising out of immeasurable deeps toward a distant light which was like the mouth of a well filled with clouds of misty vapor occasionally he saw a brown big hairy face floating in over this lighted horizon to smile kindly and go away again others came with shaggy beards he heard a cheery tenor voice which he recognized and then another face a big brown smiling face very lovely it looked now to himalmost as lovely as his wifes which floated in from the other side  hes all right now said the cheery tenor voice from the big bearded face  oh mr mcturg do you think so  yees sir hes all right the fevers left him brace up old man we need ye yit awhile then all was silent agam  the well mouth cleared away its mist again and he saw more clearly part of the time he knew he was in bed staring at the ceiling part of the time the well mouth remained closed in with clouds  gaunt old women put spoons of delicious broth to his lips and their toothless mouths had kindly lines about them he heard their high voices sounding faintly  now mis bloom jest let mis folsom an me attend to things out here well get supper for the boys an you jest go an lay down well take care of him dont worry bells a good hand with sick  then the light came again and he heard a robin singing and a catbird squalled softly pitifully he could see the ceiling again he lay on his back with his hands on his breast he felt as if he had been dead he seemed to feel his body as if it were an alien thing  how are you sir called the laughing thrillingly hearty voice of william mcturg  he tried to turn his head but it wouldnt move he tried to speak but his dry throat made no noise  the big man bent over him want o change place a little  he closed his eyes in answer  a giant arm ran deftly under his shoulders and turned him as if he were an infant and a new part of the good old world burst on his sight the sunshine streamed in the windows through a waving screen of lilac leaves and fell upon the carpet in a priceless flood of radiance  there sat william mcturg smiling at him he had no coat on and no hat and his bushy thick hair rose up from his forehead like thick marsh grass he looked to be the embodiment of sunshine and health sun and air were in his brown face and the perfect health of a fine animal was in his huge limbs he looked at robert with a smile that brought a strange feeling into his throat it made him try to speak at last he whispered  the great figure bent closer what is it  thankyou  william laughed a low chuckle dont bother about thanks would you like some water  a tall figure joined william awkwardiy  hello evan  how is he bm  hes awake today  thats good anything i can do  no i guess not an he needs is somethin to eat  i jest brought a chicken up an some jell an things the women sent ill stay with him till twelve then folsom will come in  thereafter he lay hearing the robins laugh and the orioles whistle and then the frogs and katydids at night these men with greasy vests and unkempt beards came in every day they bathed him and helped him to and from the bed they helped to dress him and move him to the window where he could look out on the blessed green of the grass  o god it was so beautiful it was a lovers joy only to live to look into these radiant vistas again a catbird was singing in the currant hedge a robin was hopping across the lawn the voices of the children sounded soft and jocund across the road and the surshinebeloved christ thy sunshine falling upon my feet his soul ached with the joy of it and when his wife came in she found him sobbing like a child  they seemed never to weary in his service they lifted him about and talked to him in loud and hearty voices which roused him like fresh winds from free spaces  he heard the women busy with things in the kitchen he often saw them loaded with things to eat passing his window and often his wife came in and knelt down at his bed  oh robert theyre so good they feed us like gods ravens  one day as he sat at the window fully dressed for the fourth of fifth time william mcturg came up the walk  well robert how are ye today  firstrate william he smiled i believe i can walk out a little if youll help me  all right sir  and he went forth leaning on williams arm a piteous wraith of a man  on every side the golden june sunshine fell filling the valley from purple brim to purple brim down over the hill to the west the light poured tangled and glowing in the plum and cherry trees leaving the glistening grass spraying through the elms and flinging streamers of pink across the shaven green slopes where the cattle fed  on every side he saw kindly faces and heard hearty voices good day robert glad to see you out again it thrilled him to hear them call him by his first name  his heart swelled till he could hardly breathe the passion of living came back upon him shaking uplifting him his pallid lips moved his face was turned to the sky  o god let me live it is so beautiful o god give me strength again keep me in the light of the sun let me see the green grass come and go  he turned to william with trembling lips trying to speak  oh i understand you now i know you all now  but william did not understand him  there there he said soothingly i guess youre gettin tired he led robert back and put him to bed  id know but we was a little brash about goin out william said to him as robert lay there smiling up at him  oh im all right now the sick man said  matie the alien cried when william had gone we knew our neighbors now dont we we never can hate or ridicule them again  yes robert they never will be caricatures againto me  agood fellows wife  i  life in the small towns of the older west moves slowlyalmost as slowly as in the seaport villages or little towns of the east towns like tyre and bluff siding have grown during the last twenty years but very slowly by almost imperceptible degrees lying too far away from the mississippi to be affected by the lumber interest they are merely trading points for the farmers with no perceivable germs of boom in their quiet life  a stranger coming into belfast minnesota excites much the same lanquid but persistent inquiry as in belfast new hampshire juries of men seated on salt barrels and nall kegs discuss the strangers appearance and his probable action just as in kittery maine but with a lazier speech tune and with a shade less of apparent interest  on such a rainy day as comes in may after the corn is planteda cold wet rainy daythe usual crowd was gathered in wilsons grocery store at bluff siding a small town in the coulee country they were farmers for the most part retired from active service their coats were of cheap diagonal or cassimere much faded and burned by the sun their hats flapped about by winds and soaked with countless rains were also of the same yellowbrown tints one or two wore paper collars on their hickory shirts  mcilvaine farmer and wheat buyer wore a paper collar and a butterfly necktie as befitted a man of his station in life he was a short squarely made scotchman with sandy whiskers much grayed and with a keen intensely blue eye  say called mcphail exsheriff of the county in the silence that followed some remark about the rain any o you fellers had any talk with this feller sanford  i haint said vance you bill  no but somebody was sayin he thought o startin in trade here  dont sam know he generally knows whats goin on  knows he registered from pittsfield mass an thats all say thats a mighty smartlookin woman o his  vance always sees how the women look whered you see her  came in here the other day to look up prices  whad she say bout settlin  hadnt decided yet  hes too slick to have much business in him that waxed mustache gives im away  the discussion having reached that point where his word would have most effect steve gilbert said while opening the hearth to rap out the ashes of his pipe sams wife heerd that he was kind o thinkin some of goin into business here if things suited im firstrate  they all knew the old man was aching to tell something but they didnt purpose to gratify him by any questions the rain dripped from the awning in front and fell upon the roof of the storeroom at the back with a soft and steady roar  good fr the corn mephail said after a long pause  purty cold though  gilbert was tranquilhe had a shot in reserve sams wife said his wife said he was thinkin some of goin into a bank here  a bank  what in thunder  vance turned with a comical look on his long placid face one hand stroking his beard  well now gents ill tell you whats the matter with this town it needs a bank yes sir i need a bank  you  yes me i didnt know just what did ail me but i do how its the need of a bank that keeps me down  well you fellers can talk an laugh but i tell yeb theys a boom goin to strike this town its got to come wy just look at lumberville  their boom is our bust was mcphails comment  i dont think so said sanford who had entered in time to hear these last two speeches they all looked at him with deep interest he was a smallish man he wore a derby hat and a neat suit ive looked things over pretty closea man dont like to invest his capital here the rest looked at one another till he does and i believe theres an opening for a bank  as he dwelt upon the scheme from day to day the citizens warmed to him and he became jim sanford he hired a little cottage and went to housekeeping at once but the entire summer went by before he made his decision to settle in fact it was in the last week of august that the little paper announced it in the usual style  mr james g sanford popularly known as jim has decided to open an exchange bank for the convenienee of our citizens who have hitherto been forced to transact business in lumberville the thanks of the town are due mr sanford who comes well recommended from massachusetts and from milwaukee and better still with a bag of ducats mr s will be well patronized success jim  the bank was open by the time the corn crop and the hogs were being marketed and money was received on deposit while the carpenters were still at work on the building everybody knew now that he was as solid as oak  he had taken into the bank as bookkeeper lincoln bingham one of mcphails multitudinous nephews and this was a capital move everybody knew link and knew he was a mcphail which meant that he could be tied to in all kinds o weather of course the mcphails mcilvaines and the rest of the scotch contingency banked on link as old andrew mcphail put it  links there an he knows the bank an books an just how things stand and so when he sold his hogs he put the whole sumover fifteen hundred dollarsinto the bank the mcilvaines and the binghams did the same and the bank was at once firmly established among the farmers  only two people held out against sanford old freeme cole and mrs bingham lincolns mother but they didnt count for freeme hadnt a cent and mrs bingham was too unreasoning in her opposition she could only say  i dont like him thats all i knowed a man back in new york that curled his mustaches just that way an he want no earthiy good  it might have been said by a cynic that banker sanford had all the virtues of a defaulting bank cashier he had no bad habits beyond smoking he was genial companionable and especially ready to help when sickness came when old freeme cole got down with delirium tremens that winter sanford was one of the most heroic of nurses and the service was so clearly disinterested and maguanimous that everyone spoke of it  his wife and he were included in every dance or picnic for mrs sanford was as great a favorite as the banker himself she was so sincere and her gray eyes were so charmingly frank and then she said such funny things  i wish i had something to do besides housework its a kind of a putterin job best ye can do shed say merrily just to see the others stare theres too much moppin an dustin seems s if a woman used up half her life on things that dont amount to anything dont it  i tell yeh that fellers a scallywag i know it buh the way e walks long the sidewalk mrs bingham insisted to her son who wished her to put her savings into the bank  the youngest of a large family link had been accustomed all his life to mrs biughams many whimsicalities  i spose you can smell hes a thief just as you can tell when its goin to rain or the butters comin by the smell  well you neednt laugh lincoln i can maintained the old lady stoutly an i aint goin to put a red cent o my money mto his pocketfr theres where it ud go to  she yielded at last and received a little bankbook in return for her money jest about all ill ever get she said privately and thereafter out of her brassbowed spectacles with an eagles gaze she watched the banker go by but the banker seeing the dear old soul at the window looking out at him always smiled and bowed unaware of her suspicion  at the end of the year he bought the lot next to his rented house and began building one of his own a modest little affair shaped like a pork pie with a cupola or a tamoshanter capa style of architecture which became fashionable at once  he worked heroically to get the location of the plow factory at bluff siding and all but succeeded but tyre once their ally turned against them and refused to consider the fact of the sidings position at the center of the county however for some reason or other the town woke up to something of a boom during the next two years several large farmers decided to retire and live off the sweat of some other fellows brow and so built some houses of the porkpie order and moved into town  this inflow of moneyed men from the country resulted in the establishment of a seminary of learning on the hillside where the soldiers home was to be located this called in more farmers from the country and a new hotel was built a sashanddoor factory followed and burt mcphail set up a feed mill  an this improvement unquestionably dated from the opening of the bank and the most unreasonmg partisans of the banker held him to be the chief cause of the resulting development of the town though he himself modestly disclaimed any hand in the affair  had bluff siding been a city the highest civic honors would have been open to banker sanford indeed his name was repeatedly mentioned in connection with the county offices  no gentlemen he explained firmly but courteously in wilsons store one night im a banker not a politician i cant ride two horses  in the second year of the banks history he went up to the north part of the state on business visiting west superior duluth ashland and other booming towns and came back full of the wonders of what he saw  theres big money up there nell he said to his wife  but she had the womans tendency to hold fast to what she had and would not listen to any plans about moving  build up your business here jim and dont worry about what good chances there are somewhere else  he said no more about it but he took great interest in all the news the boys brought back from their annual deer hunts up north they were all enthusiastic over west superior and duluth and their wonderful development was the neverending theme of discussion in wilsons store  ii  the first two years of the banks history were solidly successful and jim and nellie were the head and front of all good works and the provoking cause of most of the fun no one seemed more carefree  we consider ourselves just as young as anybody mrs sanford would say when joked about going out with the young people so much but sometirnes at home after the children were asleep she sighed a little  jim i wish you was in some kind of a business so i could help i dont have enough to do i spose i could mop an dust an dust an mop but it seems sinful to waste time that way cant i do anything jim  why no if you tend to the children and keep house thats all anybody asks of you  she was silent but not convinced she had a desire to do something outside the walls of her housea desire transmitted to her from her father for a woman inherits these things  in the spring of the second year a number of the depositors drew out money to invest in duluth and superior lots and the whole town was excited over the matter  the summer passed link and sanford spending their tirne in the bankthat is when not out swimming or fishing with the boys but july and august were terribly hot and dry and oats and corn were only halfcrop and the farmers were grumbling some of them were forced to draw on the bank instead of depositing  mcphail came in one day in november to draw a thousand dollars to pay for a house and lot he had recently bought  sanford was alone he whistled phew youre comin at me hard come in tomorrow links gone down to the city to get some money  all right said mephail any time  goin t snow  looks like it ill haf to load a lot o catridges ready fr biz  about an hour later old lady bingham burst upon the banker wild and breathless i want my money she announced  good morning mrs bingham pleasant  i want my money wheres lincoln  she had read that morning of two bank failureone in nova scotia and one in massachusettsand they seemed providential warnings to her lincolns absence confirmed them  hes gone to st paulwont be back till the fiveoclock train do you need some money this morning how much  all of it sir every cent  sanford saw something was out of gear he tried to explain ive sent your son to st paul after some money  wheres my money what have you done with that in her excitement she thought of her money just as she hand handed it insilver and little rolls and wads of bills  if youll let me explain  i dont want you to explain nawthin jest hand me out my money  two or three loafers seeing her gesticulate stopped on the walk outside and looked in at the door sanford was annoyed but he remained calm and persuasive he saw that something had caused a panic in the good simple old woman he wished for lincoln as one wishes for a policeman sometimes  now mrs bingham if youll only wait till lincoln  i dont want o wait i want my money right now  will fifty dollars do  no sir i want it allevery cent of itjest as it was  but i cant do that your money is gone

becauseif youd let me explainwe dont keep the money just as it comes to us we pay it out and take in other  mrs bingham was getting more and more bewildered she now had only one clear ideashe couldnt get her money her voice grew tearful like an angry childs  i want my moneyi knew youd steal itthat i worked for give me my money  sanford hastily handed her some money heres fifty dollars you can have the rest when  the old lady clutched the money and literally ran out of the door and went off up the sidewalk talking incoherently to everyone she met she told her story but the men smiled and passed on they had heard her predictions of calamity before  but mrs mcilvaine was made a triffe uneasy by it he wouldnt give you yr money or did he say he couldnt she inquired in her moderate way  he couldnt an he wouldnt she said if youve got any money there youd better get it out quick it aint safe a minute when lincoln comes home im goin to see if i cant  well i was calclatin to go to lumberville this week anyway to buy a carpet and a chamber set i guess i might s well get the money today  when she came in and demanded the money sanford was scared were these two old women the beginning of the deluge would mcphail insist on being paid also there was just one hundred dollars left in the bank together with a little silver with rare strategy he smiled  certainly mrs mcilvaine how much will you need she had intended to demand the whole of her depositone hundred and seventeen dollarsbut his readiness mollified her a little i did low id take the hull but i guess seventyfive dollars ll do  he paid the money briskly out over the little glass shelf how is your children mrs mcilvaine  purty well thanky replied mrs mcilvaine laboriously counting the bills  is it all right  i guess so she replied dubiously ill count it after i get home  she went up the street with the feeling that the bank was all right and she stepped in and told mrs bingham that she had no trouble in getting her money  alter she had gone sanford sat down and wrote a telegram which he sent to st paul this telegram according to the duplicate at the station read in this puzzling way  e o exchange block no 96 all out of paper send five hundred noteheads and envelopes to match business brisk press of correspondence just now get them out quick wire  sanford  two or three others came in after a little money but he put them off easily just been cashing some paper and took all the ready cash i can spare cant you wait till tomorrow links gone down to st paul to collect on some paper be back on the five oclock nine oclock sure  an old norwegian woman came in to deposit ten dollars and he counted it in briskly and put the amount down on her little book for her barney mace came in to deposit a hundred dollars the proceeds of a horse sale and this helped him through the day those who wanted small sums he paid  glad this aint a big demand rather close on cash today he said smiling as lincolns

exactly credit all right plenty o property but and he smiled and went at his books the smile died out of his eyes as vance went out and he pulled a little morocco book from his pocket and began studying the beautiful columns of figures with which it seemed to be filled those he compared with the books with great care thrusting the book out of sight when anyone entered  he closed the bank as usual at five lincoln had not come couldnt come now till the nineoclock accommodation for an hour after the shades were drawn he sat there in the semidarkness silently pondering on his situation this attitude and deep quiet were unusual to him he heard the feet of friends and neighbors passing the door as he sat there by the smoldering coal fire in the growing darkness there was something impressive in his attitude  he started up at last and tried to see what the hour was by turning the face of his watch to the dull glow from the cannon stoyes open door  suppertime he said and threw the whole matter off as if he had decided it or had put off the decision till another time  as he went by the post office vance said to mcilvaine in a smiling way as if it were a good joke on sanford  little short o cash down at the bank  hes a good fellow mcilvaine said  sos his wife added vance with a chuckle  iii  that night after supper sanford sat in his snug little skting room with a baby on each knee looking as cheerful and happy as any man in the village the children crowed and shouted as he trotted them to boston or rode them on the toe of his boot they made a noisy merry group  mrs sanford did her own work and her swift feet could be heard moving to and fro out in the kitchen it was pleasant there the woodwork the furniture the stove the curtainsall had that look of newness just growing into coziness the coal stove was lighted and the curtains were drawn  after the work in the kitchen was done mrs sanford came in and sat awhile by the fire with the children looking very wifely in her dark dress and white apron her round smiling face glowing with love and pridethe gloating look of a mother seeing her children in the arms of her husband  how is mrs petersons baby jim she said suddenly her face sobering  pretty bad i guess la la ladeedledee the doctor seemed to think it was a tight squeak if it lived guess its done foroop e goes  she made a little leap at the youngest child and clasped it convulsively to her bosom her swift maternal imagination had made anothers loss very near and terrible  oh say nell he broke out on seeing her sober i had the confoundedest time today with old lady bingham  sh babys gone to sleep  after the children had been put to bed in the little alcove off the sitting room mrs sanford came back to find jim absorbed over a little book of accounts  what are you studying jim  someone knocked on the door before he had time to reply  come in he said  sh dont yell so his wife whispered  telegram jim said a voice in the obscurity  oh that you sam come in  sam a lathy fellow with a quid in his cheek stepped in how d e do mis sanford  set downse down  cant stop most train time  sanford tore the envelope open read the telegram rapidly the smile fading out of his face he read it again word for word then sat looking at it  any answer asked sam  all right good night  good night  after the door slammed sanford took the sheet from the envelope and reread it at length he dropped into his chair that settles it he said aloud  settles what whats the news his wife came up and looked over his shoulder  settles ive got to go on that ninethirty train  be back on the morning train  yes i guess soi mean of courseill have to beto open the bank  mrs sanford looked at him for a few seconds in silence there was something in his look and especially in his tone that troubled her  what do you mean jim you dont intend to come back she took his arm whats the matter now tell me what are you going away for  he knew he could not deceive his wifes ears and eyes just then so he remained silent weve got to leave nell he admitted at last  why what for  because im bustedbrokegone up the spoutand all the rest he said desperately with an attempt at fun mrs bingham and mrs mcilvaine have busted medead  whywhywhat has become of the moneyall the money the people have put in there  gone up with the rest  what ve you done with it i dont  well ive invested itand lost it  james gordon sanford she exclaimed trying to realize it was that right aint that a case ofof  shouldnt wonder a case of embezzlement such as you read of in the newspapers his tone was easy but he avoided the look in his wifes beautiful gray eyes  but itsstealingaint it she stared at him bewildered by his reckless lightness of mood it is now because ive lost if  ida won it it ud a been financial shrewdness  she asked her next question after a pause in a low voice and through teeth almost set did you go into this bank tosteal this money tell me that  no i didnt nell i aint quite up to that  his answer softened her a little and she sat looking at him steadlly as he went on the tears began to roll slowly down her cheeks her hands were clenched  the fact is the idea came into my head last fall when i went up to superior my partner wanted me to go in with him on some land and i did we speculated on the growth of the town toward the south we made a strike then he wanted me to go in on a copper mine of course i expected  as he went on with the usual excuses her mind made all the allowances possible for him he had always been boyish impulsive and lacking in judgment and strength of character she was humiliated and frightened but she loved and sympathized with him  her silence alarmed him and he made excuses for himself he was speculating for her sake more than for his own and so on  chocoo whistled the faroff train through the still air  he sprang up and reached for his coat  she seized his arm again where are you going she sternly asked  to take that train  when are you coming back  i dont know but his tone said never  she felt it her face grew bitter going to leave me andthe babies  ill send for you soon come goodbye he tried to put his arm about her she stepped back  jim if you leave me tonight choochoo whistled the engine you leave me forever there was a terrible resolution in her tone  what do you mean  i mean that im going to stay here if you goill never be your wifeagainnever she glanced at the sleeping children and her chin trembled  i cant face those fellowstheyll kill me he said in a sullen tone  no they wont theyll respect you if you stay and tell em exactly howitallis youve disgraced me and my children thats what youve done if you dont stay  the clear jangle of the engine bell sounded through the night as with the whiz of escaping steam and scrape and jar of gripping brakes and howl of wheels the train came to a stop at the station sanford dropped his coat and sat down again  ill have to stay now his tone was dry and lifeless it had a reproach in it that cut the wife deepdeep as the fountain of tears and she went across the room and knelt at the bedside burying her face in the clothes on the feet of her children and sobbed silently  the man sat with bent head looking into the glowing coal whistling through his teeth a look of sullen resignation and endurance on his face that had never been there before his very attitude was alien and ominous  neither spoke for a long time at last he rose and began taking off his coat and vest  well i suppose theres nothing to do but go to bed  she did not stirshe might have been asleep so far as any sound or motion was concerned he went off to the bed in the little parlor and she still knelt there her heart full of anger bitterness sorrow  the sunny uneventfulness of her past life made this great storm the more terrifying her trust in her husband had been absolute a farmers daughter the bank clerk had seemed to her the equal of any gentleman in the worldher world and when she knew his delicacy his unfailing kindness and his abounding good nature she had accepted him as the father of her children and this was the first revelation to her of his inherent moral weakness  her mind went over the whole ground again and again in a sort of blinding rush she was convinced of his lack of honor more by his tone his inflections than by his words his lack of deep regret his readiness to leave her to bear the whole shock of the discoverythese were in his flippant tones and everytime she thought of them the hot blood surged over her at such moments she hated him and her white teeth clenched  to these moods succeeded others when she remembered his smile the dimple in his chin his tender care for the sick his buoyancy his songs to the childrenhow could he sit there with the children on his knees and plan to run away leaving them disgraced  she went to bed at last with the babies and with their soft warm little bodies touching her side fell asleep pondering suffering as only a mother and wife can suffer when distrust and doubt of her husband supplant confidence and adoration  iv  the children awakened her by their delighted cooing and kissing it was a great event this waking to find mamma in their bed it was hardly light of a dull gray morning and with the children tumbling about over her feeling the pressure of the warm little hands and soft lips she went over the whole situation again and at last settled upon her action  she rose shook down the coal in the stove in the sitting room and started a fire in the kitchen then she dressed the children by the coal burner the elder of them as soon as dressed ran in to wake poppa while the mother went about breakfastgetting  sanford came out of his bedroom unwontedly gloomy greeting the children in a subdued maimer he shivered as he sat by the fire and stirred the stove as if he thought the room was cold his face was pale and moist  breakfast is ready james called mrs sanford in a tone which she meant to be habitual but which had a cadence of sadness in it  some way he found it hard to look at her as he came out she busied herself with placing the children at the table in order to conceal her own emotion  i dont believe ill eat any meat this morning nellie i aint very well  she glanced at him quickly keenly whats the matter  i dknow my stomach is kind of upset by this failure o mine im in great shape to go down to the bank this morning and face them fellows  its got to be done  i know it but that dont help me any he tried to smile  she mused while the baby hammered on his tin plate youve got to go down if you donti will said she resolutely and you must say that that money will be paid backevery cent  but thats moren i can do  it must be done  but under the law  theres nothing can make this thing right except paying every cent we owe i aint agoin to have it said that my childrenthat im livin on somebody else if you dont pay these debts i will ive thought it all out if you dont stay and face it and pay these men i wont own you as my husband i loved and trusted you jimi thought you was honorableits been a terrible blowbut ive decided it all in my mind  she conquered her little weakness and went on to the end firmly her face looked pale there was a square look about the mouth and chin the iron resolution and puritanic strength of her father old john foreman had come to the surface her look and tone mastered the man for he loved her deeply  she had set him a hard task and when he rose and went down the street he walked with bent head quite unlike his usual self  there were not many men on the street it seemed earlier than it was for it was a raw cold morning promising snow the sun was completely masked in a seamless dustgray cloud he met vance with a brown parcel beefsteak for breakfast under his arm  hello jim how are ye so early in the morning  blessed near used up  that so whats the matter  i dknow said jim listlessly bilious i guess headachestomach bad  oh well now you try them pills i was tellin you of arrived at the bank he let himself in and locked the door behind him he stood in the middle of the floor a few minutes then went behind the railing and sat down he didnt build a fire though it was cold and damp and he shivered as he sat leaning on the desk at length he drew a large sheet of paper toward him and wrote something on it in a heavy hand  he was writing on this when lincoln entered at the back whistling boyishly hello jim aint you up early no fire eh he rattled at the stove  sanford said nothing but finished his writing then he said quietly you neednt build a fire on my account link  why not  well im used up  whats the matter  im sick and the business has gone to the devil he looked out of the window  link dropped the poker and came around behind the counter and stared at sanford with fallen mouth  whad you say  i said the business had gone to the devil were broke bustedpeteredgone up the spout he took a sort of morbid pleasure in saying these things  whats busted us have  ive been speciflatin in copper my partners busted me  link came closer his mouth stiffened and an ominous look came into his eyes you dont mean to say youve lost my money and mothers and uncle andrews and all the rest  sanford was getting irritated  it whats the use i tell you yes its all gonevery cent of it  link caught him by the shoulder as he sat at the desk sanfords tone enraged him you thief but youll pay me back or ill  oh go ahead pound a sick man if itll do you any good said sanford with a peculiar recklessness of lifeless misery pay yrsell out of the safe heres the combination  lincoln released him and began turning the knob of the door at last it swung open and he searched the money drawers less than forty dollars all told his voice was full of helpless rage as he turned at last and walked up close to sanfords bowed head  id like to pound the life out o you  youre at liberty to do so if itll be any satisfaction this desperate courage awed the younger man he gazed at sanford in amazement  if youll cool down and wait a little link ill tell you all about it im sick as a horse i guess ill go home you can put this up in the window and go home too if you want to  lincoln saw that sanford was sick he was shivering and drops of sweat were on his white forehead lincoln stood aside silently and let him go out  better lock up link you cant do anything by staying here  lincoln took refuge in a boyish phrase that would have made anyone but a sick man laugh well this is a  of a note  he took up the paper it read  bank closed  to my creditors and depositors  through a combination of events i find myself obliged to temporarily suspend payment i ask the depositors to be patient and their claims will be met i think i can pay twentyfive cents on the dollar if given a little time i shall not run away i shall stay right here till all matters are honorably settled  james g sanford  lincoln hastily pinned this paper to the windowsash so that it could be seen from without then pulled down the blinds and locked the door his funloving nature rose superior to his rage for the moment therell be the devil to pay in this burg before two hours  he slipped out the back way taking the keys with him ill go and tell uncle and then well see if jim cant turn in the house on our account he thought as he harnessed a team to drive out to mcphails  the first man to try the door was an old norwegian in a spotted mackinac jacket and a fur cap with the inevitable little red tippet about his neck he turned the knob knocked and at last saw the writing which he could not read and went away to tell johnson that the bank was closed johnson thought nothing special of that it was early and they werent very particular to open on time anyway  then the barber across the street tried to get in to have a bill changed trying to peer in the window he saw the notice which he read with a grin  one o links jobs he explained to the fellows in the shop hes too darned lazy to open on time so he puts up notice that the bank is busted  lets go and see  dont do it hes watchin to see us all rush across and look just keep quiet and see the solid citizens rear around  old orrin mcilvaine came out of the post office and tried the door next then stood for a long time reading the notice and at last walked thoughtfully away soon he returned to the merriment of the fellows in the barbershop with two or three solid citizens who had been smoking an afterbreakfast cigar and planning a deer hunt they stood before the window in a row and read the notice mcilvaine gesticulated with his cigar  gentlemen theres a pig loose here  one o links jokes i reckon  but thats sanfords writin an here it is nine oclock and no one round i dont like the looks of it myself  the crowd thickened the fellows came out of the blacksmith shop while the jokers in the barbershop smote their knees and yelled with merriment  whats up queried vance coming up and repeating the universal question  mcilvaine pointed at the poster with his cigar  vance read the notice while the crowd waited silently  what ye think of it asked someone impatiently vance smoked a moment cant say wheres jim  thats it where is he  best way to find out is to send a boy up to the house he called a boy and sent him scurrying up the street  the crowd now grew sober and discussed possibilities if thats true its the worst crack on the head i ever had said mcilvaine seventeen hundred dollars is my pile in there he took a seat on the windowsill  well im tickled to death to think i got my little stake out before anything happened  when you think of itwhat security did he ever give mcilvaine continued  not a centnot a red cent  no sir we simply banked on him now hes a good fellow an this may be a joke o links but the fact is it might a happened well sonny he said to the boy who came running up  link aint to home an mrs sanford she says jims sick an cant come down  there was a silence anybody see him this morning asked wilson  yes i saw him said vance looked bad too the crowd changed people came and went some to get news some to carry it away in a short time the whole town knew the bank had busted all to smash farmers drove along and stopped to find out what it all meant the more they talked the more excited they grew and scoundrel and i always had my doubts of that feller were phrases growing more frequent  the list of the victims grew until it was evident that neariy all of the savings of a dozen or more depositors were swallowed up and the sum reached was nearly twenty thousand dollars  what did he do with it was the question he never gambled or drank he lived frugally there was no apparent cause for this failure of a trusted institution  it was beginning to snow in great damp driving flakes which melted as they fell giving to the street a strangeness and gloom that were impressive the men left the sidewalk at last and gathered in the saloons and stores to continue the discussion  the crowd at the railroad saloon was very decided in its belief sanford had pocketed the money and skipped that yarn about his being at home sick was a blind some went so far as to say that it was almighty curious where link was hinting darkly that the bank ought to be broken into and so on  upon this company burst barney and sam mace from hogans corners they were excited by the news and already inflamed with drink  say yelled barney any o you fellers know anything about jim sanford  no why got any money there  yes and im goin to git it out if i haf to smash the door in  thats the talk shouted some of the loafers they sprang up and surrounded barney there was something in his voice that aroused all their latent ferocity im goin to get into that bank an see how things look an then im goin to find sanford an get my money or pound  out of im one o the six  go find him first hes up home sicksos his wife  ill see whether hes sick r not ill drag im out by the scruff o the neck come on he ended with a sudden resolution leading the way out into the street where the falling snow was softening the dirt into a sticky mud  a rabble of a dozen or two of men and boys followed mace up the street he led the way with great strides shouting his threats as they passed along women thrust their heads out at the windows asking whats the matter and someone answered each time in a voice of unconcealed delight  sanfords stole all the money in the bank and theyre goin up to lick im come on if ye want to see the fun  in a few moments the street looked as if an alarm of fire had been sounded half the town seemed to be out and the other half comingwomen in shawls like squaws children capering and laughing young men grinning at the girls who came out and stood at the gates  some of the citizens tried to stop it vance found the constable looking on and ordered him to do his duty and stop that crowd  i cant do anything he said helplessly they aint done nawthin yet an i dont know  oh git out theyre goin up there to whale jim an you know it if you dont stop em ill telephone fr the sheriff and have you arrested with em  under this pressure the constable ran along after the crowd in an attempt to stop it he reached them as they stood about the little porch of the house packed closely around barney and sam who said nothing but followed barney like his shadow if the sun had been shining it might not have happened as it did but there was a semiobscurity a weird halflight shed by the thick sky and falling snow which somehow encouraged the enraged ruffians who pounded on the door just as the pleading voice of the constable was heard  hold on gentlemen this is aginst the law  law to  said someone this is a case fr something besides law  open up there roared the raucous voice of barney mace as he pounded at the door fiercely  the door opened and the wife appeared one child in her arms the other at her side  what do you want  wheres that banker tell the thief to come out here we want to talk with him  the woman did not quail but her face seemed a ghastly yellow seen through the falling snow  he cant come hes sick  sick well sick im tell im t come out or well snake im out by the heels the crowd laughed the worst elements of the saloons surrounded the two halfsavage men it was amusing to them to see the woman face them all in that way  wheres mcphail vance inquired anxiously somebody find mcphail  stand out o the way snarled barney as he pushed the struggling woman aside  the wife raised her voice to that wild animallike pitch a woman uses when desperate  i shant do it i tell you help  keep out o my way or ill wring yr neck fr yeh she struggled with him but he pushed her aside and entered the room  whats goin on here called the ringing voice of andrew mcphail who had just driven up with link  several of the crowd looked over their shoulders at mcphail  hello mac just in time oh nawthin barneys callin on the banker thats all  over the heads of the crowd packed struggling about the door came the womans scream again mcphail dashed around the crowd running two or three of them down and entered the back door vance mcilvaine and lincoln followed him  cowards the wife said as the ruffians approached the bed they swept her aside but paused an instant before the glance of the sick mans eye he lay there desperately deathly sick the blood throbbed in his whirling brain his eyes were bloodshot and blinded his strength was gone he could hardly speak he partly rose and stretched out his hand and then fell back  kill meif you want tobut let heralone shes  the children were crying the wind whistled drearily across the room carrying the evanescent flakes of soft snow over the heads of the pausing listening crowd in the doorway quick steps were heard  hold on there cried mcphail as he burst into the room he seemed an angel of god to the wife and mother  he spread his great arms in a gesture which suggested irresistible strength and resolution clear out out with ye  no man had ever seen him look like that before he awed them with the look in his eyes his long service as sheriff gave him authority he hustled them cuffed them out of the door like schoolboys barney backed out cursing he knew mcphall too well to refuse to obey  mcphail pushed barney out shut the door behind him and stood on the steps looking at the crowd  well youre a great lot you fellers would ye jump on a sick man what ye think yere all doin anyhow  the crowd laughed hey mac give us a speech  you ought to be booted the whole lot o yeh he replied  that houn in theres run the bank into the ground with every cent o money wed put in said barney i spose ye know that  well spose he haswhats the use o jumpin on  git it out of his hide  ive heerd that talk before how much you got in  two hundred dollars  well ive got two thousand the crowd saw the point  i guess if anybody was goin t take it out of his hide id be the man but i want the feller to live and have a chance to pay it back killin im is a dead loss  thats so shouted somebody mac aint no fool if he does chaw hay said another and the crowd laughed they were losing that frenzy largely imitative and involuntary which actuates a mob there was something counteracting in the exsheriffs cool humorous tone  give us the rest of it mac  the rest of it is clear out o here r ill boot every mothers son of yeh  cant do it  come down an try it  mcilvaine opened the door and looked out mac mrs sanford wants to say somethingif its safe  safe as eatin dinner  mrs sanford came out looking pale and almost like a child as she stood beside her defenders towering bulk but her face was resolute  that money will be paid back she said dollar for dollar if youll just give us a chance as soon as jim gets well enough every cent will be paid if i live  the crowd received this little speech in silence one or two said in low voices thats business shell do it too if anyone can  barney pushed his way through the crowd with contemptuous curses the  she will he said  well see t you have a chance mcphall and mcilvaine assured mrs sanford  she went in and closed the door  now git said andrew coming down the steps the crowd scattered with laughing taunts he turned and entered the house the rest drifted off down the street through the soft flurries of snow and in a few moments the street assumed its usual appearance  the failure of the bank and the raid on the banker had passed into history  v  in the light of the days of calm afterthought which followed this attempt upon the peace of the sanford home grew more monstrous and helped largely to mitigate the feeling against the banker besides he had not run away that was a strong point in his favor  dont that show argued vance to the post office dont that show he didnt intend to steal an dont it show hes goin to try to make things square  i guess we might as well think that as anything  i claim the boys has a right t take sumpthin out o his hide bent wilson stubbornly insisted  aint enough t go round laughed mcphail besides i cant have it link an i own the biggest share in im an we cant have him hurt  mcilvaine and vance grinned thats a fact mac we four fellers are the main losers hes ours an we cant have him foundered r crippled r cut up in any way aint that woman of his gritty  gritty aint no name for her shes goin into business  so i hear they say jim was crawling around a little yesterday i didnt see  i did he looks pretty streakidnow you bet  whad he say for himself  oh said give im timehed fix it all up  how much time  time enough haint been able to look at a book since say aint it a little curious he was so sick just thensick as a pisened dog  the two men looked at each other in a manner most comically significant the thought of poison was in the mind of each  it was under these trying circumstances that sanford began to crawl about a week or ten days after his sickness it was really the most terrible punishment for him before everybody used to sing out hello jim or mornin banker or some other jovial heartwarming salutation now as he went down the street the groups of men smoking on the sunny side of the stores ignored him or looked at him with scornfull eyes  nobody said hello jimnot even mcphail or vance they nodded merely and went on with their smoking the children followed him and stared at him without compassion they had heard him called a scoundrel and a thief too often at home to feel any pity for his pale face  after his first trip down the street bright with the december sunshine he came home in a bitter weak mood smarting aching with a poignant selfpity over the treatment he had received from his old cronies  its all your fault he burst out to his wife if youd only let me go away and look up another place i wouldnt have to put up with all these sneers and insults  what sneers and insults she asked coming over to him  why nobody ll speak to me  wont mr mcphail and mr mcllvalne  yes but not as they used to  you cant blame em jim you must go to work and win back their confidence  i cant do that lets go away nell and try again her mouth closed firmly a hard look came into her eyes you can go if you want to jim im goin to stay right here till we can leave honorably we cant run away from this it would follow us anywhere we went and it would get worse the farther we went  he knew the unyielding quality of his wifes resolution and from that moment he submitted to his fate he loved his wife and children with a passionate love that made life with them among the citizens he had robbed better than life anywhere else on earth he had no power to leave them  as soon as possible he went over his books and found out that he owed above all notes coming in about eleven thousand dollars this was a large sum to look forward to paying by anything he could do in the siding now that his credit was gone nobody would take him as a clerk and there was nothing else to be done except manual labor and he was not strong enough for that  his wife however had a plan she sent east to friends for a little money at once and with a few hundred dollars opened a little store in time for the holiday tradewallpaper notions light dry goods toys and millinery she did her own housework and attended to her shop in a grim uncomplaining fashion that made sanford feel like a criminal in her presence he couldnt propose to help her in the store for he knew the people would refuse to trade with him so he attended to the children and did little things about the house for the first few months of the winter  his life for a time was abjectly pitiful he didnt know what to do he had lost his footing and worst of all he felt that his wife no longer respected him she loved and pitied him but she no longer looked up to him she went about her work and down to her store with a silent resolute uncommunicative air utterly unlike her former sunny domestic self so that even she seemed alien like the rest if he had been ill vance and mcphail would have attended him as it was they could not help him  she already had the sympathy of the entire town and mcilvaine had said if you need more money you can have it mrs sanford call on us at any time  thank you i dont think ill need it all i ask is your trade she replied i dont ask anybody to pay moren a things worth either im goin to sell goods on business principles and i expect folks to buy of me because im selling reliable goods as cheap as anybody else  her business was successful from the start but she did not allow herself to get too confident  this is a kind of charity trade it wont last on that basis folks aint goin to buy of me because im poornot very long she said to vance who went in to congratulate her on her booming trade during christmas and new year  vance called so often advising or congratulating her that the boys joked him say looky here youre gom to get into a peck o trouble with your wife yet you spend about hall yr time in the new store  vance looked serene as he replied id stay longer and go oftener if i could  well if you aint cheekier n ol cheek i should think youd be ashamed to say it  shamed of it im proud of it as i tell my wife if id a met mis sanford when we was both young they wouldnt a ben no such present arrangement  the new life made its changes in mrs sanford she grew thinner and graver but as she went on and trade steadily increased a feeling of pride a sort of exultation came into her soul and shone from her steady eyes it was glorious to feel that she was holding her own with men in the world winning their respect which is better than their flattery she arose each day at five oclock with a distinct pleasure for her physical health was excellent never better  she began to dream she could pay off five hundred dollars a year of the interestperhaps she could pay some of the principal if all went well perhaps in a year br two she could take a larger store and if jim got something to do in ten years they could pay it all offevery cent she talked with businessmen and read and studied and felt each day a firmer hold on affairs  sanford got the agency of an insurance company or two and earned a few dollars during the spring in june things brightened up a little the money for a note of a thousand dollars fell duea note he had considered virtually worthless but the debtor having had a streak o luck sent seven hundred and fifty dollars sanford at once called a meeting of his creditors and paid them pro rata a thousand dollars the meeting took place in his wifes store and in making the speech sanford said  i tell you gentlemen if youll only give us a chance well clear this thing all upthat is the principal we cant  yes we can james we can pay it all principal and interest we owe the interest just as much as the rest it was evident that there was to be no letting down while she lived  the effect of this payment was marked the general feeling was much more kindly than before most of the fellows dropped back into the habit of calling him jim but after all it was not like the greeting of old when he was banker still the gain in confidence found a reflex in him his shoulders which had begun to droop a little lifted and his eyes brightened  well win yet he began to say  shes aholdin of im right to time mrs bingham said  it was shortly after this that he got the agency for a new cashdelivery system and went on the road with it traveling in northern wisconsin and minnesota he came back after a three weeks trip quite jubilant ive made a hundred dollars nell im all right if this holds out and i guess it will  in the following november just a year after the failure they celebrated the day at her suggestion by paying interest on the unpaid sums they owed  i could pay a little more on the principal she explained but i guess itll be better to use it for my stock i can pay better dividends next year  take yr time mrs sanford vance said  of course she could not escape criticism there were the usual number of women who noticed that she kept her young uns in the latest style when as a matter of fact she sat up nights to make their little things they also noticed that she retained her house and her furniture  if i was in her place seems to me id turn in some o my fine furniture toward my debts mrs sam gilbert said spitefully  she did not even escape calumny mrs sam gilbert darkly hinted at certain goins on durin his bein away lit up till after midnight some nights i cn see her winder from mine  rose mcphail one of mrs sanfords most devoted friends asked quietly do you sit up all night t see  sposin i do she snapped i cant sleep with such things goin on  if itll do you any good jane ill say that shes settin up there sewin for the children if youd keep your nose out o other folks affairs and attend better to your own your house wouldnt look like a pigpen all your children like arabs  but in spite of a few annoyances of this character mrs sanford found her new life wholesomer and broader than her old life and the pain of her loss grew less poignant  vi  one day in spring in the lazy odorous hush of the afternoon the usual number of loafers were standing on the platform waiting for the train the sun was going down the slope toward the hills through a warm april haze  hello exclaimed the man who always sees things first here comes mrs sanford and the ducklings  everybody looked  aint goin off is she  nope guess not meet somebody probly sanford  well sornethins up she dont often get out o that store  les see hes been gone most o the winter haint he  yes went away about new years  mrs sanford came past leading a child by each hand nodding and smiling to friendsfor all seemed friends she looked very resolute and businesslike in her plain dark dress with a dull flame of color at the throat while the broad hat she wore gave her face a touch of piquancy very charming evidently she was in excellent spirits and laughed and chatted in quite a carefree way  she was now an institution at the siding her store had grown in proportions yearly until it was as large and commodious as any in the town the drummers for dry goods all called there and the fact that she did not sell any groceries at all did not deter the drummers for grocery houses from calling to see each time if she hadnt decided to put in a stock of groceries  these keeneyed young fellows had spread her fame all up and down the road she had captured them not by beauty but by her pluck candor honesty and by a certain fearless but reserved camaraderie she was not afraid of them or of anybody else now  the train whistled and everybody turned to watch it as it came pushing around the bluff like a huge hound on a trail its nose close to the ground among the first to alight was sanford in a shining new silk hat and a new suit of clothes he was smiling gaily as he fought his way through the crowd to his wifes side hello he shouted i thought id see you all here  wy jim aint you cuttin a swell  a swell well whos got a better right a man wants to look as well as he can when he comes home to such a family  hello jim that plug ll never do  hello vance yes but its got to do say you tell all the fellers thats got anything aginst me to come around tomorrow night to the store i want to make some kind of a settlement  all right jim goin to pay a new dividend  thats what i am he beamed as he walked off with his wife who was studying him sharply  jim what ails you  nothin im all right  but this new suit and the hat and the necktie he laughed merrilyso merrily in fact that his wife looked at him the more anxiously he appeared to be in a queer state of intoxicationa state that made him happy without impairing his faculties however he turned suddenly and put his lips down toward her ear well nell i cant hold in any longer weve struck it  struck what  well you see that derned fool partner o mine got me to go into a lot o land in the copper country thats where all the trouble came he got awfully let down well hes had some surveyors to go up there lately and look it over and the next thing we knew the superior mining company came along an wanted to buy it of course we didnt want to sell just then  they had reached the store door and he paused  well go right home to supper she said the girls will look out for things till i get back  they walked on together the children laughing and playing ahead  well upshot of it is i sold out my share to osgood for twenty thousand dollars  she stopped and stared at him jimgordon sanford  fact i can prove it he patted his breast pocket mysteriously ten thousand right there  gracious sakes alive how dare you carry so much money  im mighty glad o the chance he grinned  they walked on almost in silence with only a word now and then she seemed to be thinking deeply and he didnt want to disturb her it was a delicious spring hour the snow was all gone even under the hedges the roads were warm and brown the red sun was flooding the valley with a misty richcolored light and against the orange and gold of the sky the hills stood in tyrian purple wagons were rattling along the road men on the farms in the edge of the village could be heard whistling at their work a discordant jangle of a neighboring farmers supper bell announced that it was time to turn out  sanford was almost as gay as a lover he seemed to be on the point of regaining his old place in his wifes respect somehow the possession of the package of money in his pocket seemed to make him more worthy of her to put him more on an equality with her  as they reached the little onestory square cottage he sat down on the porch where the red light fell warmly and romped with the children while his wife went in and took off her things she kept a girl now so that the work of getting supper did not devolve entirely upon her she came out soon to call them all to the supper table in the little kitchen back of the sitting room  the children were wild with delight to have poppa back and the meal was the merriest they had had for a long time the doors and windows were open and the spring evening air came in laden with the sweet suggestive smell of bare ground the alert chuckle of an occasional robin could be heard  mrs sanford looked up from her tea theres one thing i dont like jim and thats the way that money comes you didntyou didnt really earn it  oh dont worry yourself about that thats the way things go its just luck  well i cant see it just that way it seems to me justlike gambling you win butbut somebody else must lose  oh well look ahere if you go to lookin too sharp into things like that youll find a good eal of any business like gamblin  she said no more but her face remained clouded on the way down to the store they met lincoln  come down to the store link and bring joe i want to talk with yeh  lincoln stared but said all right then added as the others walked away well that feller aint got no cheek t talk to me like thatmore cheek n a govment mule  jim took a seat near the door and watched his wife as she went about the store she employed two clerks now while she attended to the books and the cash he thought how different she was and he liked and in a way feared her cool businesslike manner her selfpossession and her smileless conversation with a drummer who came in jim was puzzled he didnt quite understand the peculiar effect his wifes manner had upon him  outside word had passed around that jim had got back and that something was in the wind and the fellows began to drop in when mcphail came in and said hello in his hearty way sanford went over to his wile and said  say nell i cant stand this im goin to get rid o this money right off now  very well just as you please  gents he began turning his back to the counter and smiling blandly on them one thumb in his vest pocket any o you fellers got anything against the lumber cpunty bankany certificates of deposit or notes  two or three nodded and mcphail said humorously slapping his pocket i always go loaded  produce your paper gents continued sanford with a dramatic whang of a leathern wallet down into his palm im buying up all paper on the bank  it was a superb stroke the fellows whistled and stared and swore at one another this was coming down on them link was dumb with amazement as he received sixteen hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new bills  andrew its your turn next sanfords tone was actually patronizing as he faced mcphail  i was jokin i aint got my certificate here  dont matterdont matter heres fifteen hundred dollars just give us a receipt and bring the certif any time i want to get rid o this stuff right now  say jim wed like to know jestjest where this windfall comes from said vance as he took his share  comes from the copper country was all he ever said about it  i dont see where he invested link said wasnt a scratch of a pen to show that he invested anything while he was in the bank guess thats where our money went  well i aint squealin said vance im glad to get out of it without asking any questions ill tell yeh one thing though he added as they stood outside the door wed a never smelt of our money again if it hadnt a been fr that woman in there shed a paid it alone if jim hadnt a made this strike whereas he neverd awell all right were out of it  it was one of the greatest moments of sanfords life he expanded in it he was as pleasantly aware of the glances of his wife as he used to be when as a clerk he saw her pass and look in at the window where he sat dreaming over his ledger  as for her she was going over the whole situation from this new standpoint he had been weak he had fallen in her estimation and yet as he stood there so boyish in his exultation the father of her children she loved him with a touch of maternal tenderness and hope and her heart throbbed in an unconscious swift determination to do him good she no longer deceived herself she was his equalin some ways his superior her love had friendship in it but less of sex and no adoration  as she blew out the lights stepped out on the walk and turned the key in the lock he said well nellie you wont have to do that any more  no i wont have to but i guess ill keep on just the same jim  keep on what for  well i rather like it  but you dont need to  i like being my own boss she said ive done a lot o figuring jim these last three years and its kind o broadened me i hope i cant go back where i was im a better woman than i was before and i hope and believe that im better able to be a real mother to my children jim looked up at the moon filling the warm moist air with a transfiguring light that fell in a luminous mist on the distant hills i know one thing nellie im a better man than i was before and its all owin to you  his voice trembled a little and the sympathetic tears came into her eyes she didnt speak at onceshe couldnt at last she stopped him by a touch on the arm  jim i want a partner in my store let us begin again right here i cant say that ill ever feel just as i did once i dont know as its right to i looked up to you too much i expected too much of you too lets begin again as equal partners she held out her hand as one man to another he took it wonderingly  all right nell ill do it  then as he put his arm around her she held up her lips to be kissed and well be happy againhappy as we deserve i spose she said with a smile and a sigh  its almost like getting married again nellfor me as they walked off up the sidewalk in the soft moonlight their arms were interlocked  they loitered like a couple of lovers
