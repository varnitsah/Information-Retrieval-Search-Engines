66841744	the marriages  by henry james     chapter i    wont you stay a little longer the hostess asked while she held the girls hand and smiled  its too early for every one to go its too absurd  mrs churchley inclined her head to one side and looked gracious she flourished about her face in a vaguely protecting sheltering way an enormous fan of red feathers everything in her composition for adela chart was enormous  she had big eyes big teeth big shoulders big hands big rings and bracelets big jewels of every sort and many of them  the train of her crimson dress was longer than any other her house was huge her drawingroom especially now that the company had left it looked vast and it offered to the girls eyes a collection of the largest sofas and chairs pictures mirrors clocks that she had ever beheld  was mrs churchleys fortune also large to account for so many immensities  of this adela could know nothing but it struck her while she smiled sweetly back at their entertainer that she had better try to find out  mrs churchley had at least a highhung carriage drawn by the tallest horses and in the row she was to be seen perched on a mighty hunter  she was high and extensive herself though not exactly fat her bones were big her limbs were long and her loud hurrying voice resembled the bell of a steamboat  while she spoke to his daughter she had the air of hiding from colonel chart a little shyly behind the wide ostrich fan  but colonel chart was not a man to be either ignored or eluded  of course every ones going on to something else he said  i believe there are a lot of things tonight  and where are you going mrs churchley asked dropping her fan and turning her bright hard eyes on the colonel  oh i dont do that sort of thinghe used a tone of familiar resentment that fell with a certain effect on his daughters ear she saw in it that he thought mrs churchley might have done him a little more justice  but what made the honest soul suppose her a person to look to for a perception of fine shades  indeed the shade was one it might have been a little difficult to seizethe difference between going on and coming to a dinner of twenty people  the pair were in mourning the second year had maintained it for adela but the colonel hadnt objected to dining with mrs churchley any more than he had objected at easter to going down to the millwards where he had met her and where the girl had her reasons for believing him to have known he should meet her  adela wasnt clear about the occasion of their original meeting to which a certain mystery attached  in mrs churchleys exclamation now there was the fullest concurrence in colonel charts idea she didnt say ah yes dear friend i understand but this was the note of sympathy she plainly wished to sound  it immediately made adela say to her surely you must be going on somewhere yourself  yes you must have a lot of places the colonel concurred while his view of her shining raiment had an invidious directness  adela could read the tacit implication  youre not in sorrow in desolation  mrs churchley turned away from her at this and just waited before answering  the red fan was up again and this time it sheltered her from adela  ill give everything upfor you were the words that issued from behind it  do stay a little  i always think this is such a nice hour  one can really talk mrs churchley went on  the colonel laughed he said it wasnt fair  but their hostess pressed his daughter  do sit down its the only time to have any talk the girl saw her father sit down but she wandered away turning her back and pretending to look at a picture  she was so far from agreeing with mrs churchley that it was an hour she particularly disliked  she was conscious of the queerness the shyness in london of the gregarious flight of guests after a dinner the general sauve qui peut and panic fear of being left with the host and hostess  but personally she always felt the contagion always conformed to the rush  besides she knew herself turn red now flushed with a conviction that had come over her and that she wished not to show  her father sat down on one of the big sofas with mrs churchley fortunately he was also a person with a presence that could hold its own  adela didnt care to sit and watch them while they made love as she crudely imaged it and she cared still less to join in their strange commerce  she wandered further away went into another of the bright handsome rather nude roomsthey were like women dressed for a ballwhere the displaced chairs at awkward angles to each other seemed to retain the attitudes of bored talkers  her heart beat as she had seldom known it but she continued to make a pretence of looking at the pictures on the walls and the ornaments on the tables while she hoped that as she preferred it it would be also the course her father would like best  she hoped awfully as she would have said that he wouldnt think her rude  she was a person of courage and he was a kind an intensely goodnatured man nevertheless she went in some fear of him  at home it had always been a religion with them to be nice to the people he liked  how in the old days her mother her incomparable mother so clever so unerring so perfect how in the precious days her mother had practised that art  oh her mother her irrecoverable mother  one of the pictures she was looking at swam before her eyes  mrs churchley in the natural course would have begun immediately to climb staircases  adela could see the high bony shoulders and the long crimson tail and the universal coruscating nod wriggle their horribly practical way through the rest of the night  therefore she must have had her reasons for detaining them  there were mothers who thought every one wanted to marry their eldest son and the girl sought to be clear as to whether she herself belonged to the class of daughters who thought every one wanted to marry their father  her companions left her alone and though she didnt want to be near them it angered her that mrs churchley didnt call her  that proved she was conscious of the situation  she would have called her only colonel chart had perhaps dreadfully murmured dont love dont this proved he also was conscious  the time was really not longten minutes at the most elapsedwhen he cried out gaily pleasantly as if with a small jocular reproach i say adela we must release this dear lady  he spoke of course as if it had been adelas fault that they lingered  when they took leave she gave mrs churchley without intention and without defiance but from the simple sincerity of her pain a longer look into the eyes than she had ever given her before mrs churchleys onyx pupils reflected the question as distant dark windows reflect the sunset they seemed to say  yes i am if thats what you want to know  what made the case worse what made the girl more sure was the silence preserved by her companion in the brougham on their way home they rolled along in the june darkness from princes gate to seymour street each looking out of a window in conscious prudence watching but not seeing the hurry of the london night the flash of lamps the quick roll on the wood of hansoms and other broughams  adela had expected her father would say something about mrs churchley but when he said nothing it affected her very oddly still more as if he had spoken  in seymour street he asked the footman if mr  godfrey had come in to which the servant replied that he had come in early and gone straight to his room  adela had gathered as much without saying so from a lighted window on the second floor but she contributed no remark to the question  at the foot of the stairs her father halted as if he had something on his mind but what it amounted to seemed only the dry goodnight with which he presently ascended  it was the first time since her mothers death that he had bidden her goodnight without kissing her  they were a kissing family and after that dire event the habit had taken a fresh spring she had left behind her such a general passion of regret that in kissing each other they felt themselves a little to be kissing her now as standing in the hall with the stiff watching footmanshe could have said to him angrily go awayplanted near her she looked with unspeakable pain at her fathers back while he mounted the effect was of his having withheld from another and a still more slighted cheek the touch of his lips  he was going to his room and after a moment she heard his door close  then she said to the servant shut up the houseshe tried to do everything her mother had done to be a little of what she had been conscious only of falling woefully shortand took her own way upstairs  after she had reached her room she waited listening shaken by the apprehension that she should hear her father come out again and go up to godfrey  he would go up to tell him to have it over without delay precisely because it would be so difficult  she asked herself indeed why he should tell godfrey when he hadnt taken the occasiontheir drive home being an occasionto tell herself however she wanted no announcing no telling there was such a horrible clearness in her mind that what she now waited for was only to be sure her father wouldnt proceed as she had imagined  at the end of the minutes she saw this particular danger was over upon which she came out and made her own way to her brother  exactly what she wanted to say to him first if their parent counted on the boys greater indulgence and before he could say anything was  dont forgive him dont dont  he was to go up for an examination poor lad and during these weeks his lamp burned till the small hours  it was for the foreign office and there was to be some frightful number of competitors but adela had great hopes of himshe believed so in his talents and saw with pity how hard he worked  this would have made her spare him not trouble his night his scanty rest if anything less dreadful had been at stake  it was a blessing however that one could count on his coolness young as he washis bright goodlooking discretion the thing that already made him half a man of the world  moreover he was the one who would care most  if basil was the eldest sonhe had as a matter of course gone into the army and was in india on the staff by good luck of a governorgeneralit was exactly this that would make him comparatively indifferent  his life was elsewhere and his father and he had been in a measure military comrades so that he would be deterred by a certain delicacy from protesting he wouldnt have liked any such protest in an affair of his  beatrice and muriel would care but they were too young to speak and this was just why her own responsibility was so great  godfrey was in workinggearshirt and trousers and slippers and a beautiful silk jacket  his room felt hot though a window was open to the summer night the lamp on the table shed its studious light over a formidable heap of textbooks and papers the bed moreover showing how he had flung himself down to think out a problem  as soon as she got in she began  fathers going to marry mrs churchley you know  she saw his poor pink face turn pale  how do you know  ive seen with my eyes  weve been dining thereweve just come home  hes in love with her  shes in love with him  theyll arrange it  oh i say godfrey exclaimed incredulous  he will he will he will cried the girl and with it she burst into tears  godfrey who had a cigarette in his hand lighted it at one of the candles on the mantelpiece as if he were embarrassed  as adela who had dropped into his armchair continued to sob he said after a moment  he oughtnt tohe oughtnt to  oh think of mammathink of mamma she wailed almost louder than was safe  yes he ought to think of mamma  with which godfrey looked at the tip of his cigarette  to such a woman as thatafter her  dear old mamma said godfrey while he smoked  adela rose again drying her eyes  its like an insult to her its as if he denied her  now that she spoke of it she felt herself rise to a height  he rubs out at a stroke all the years of their happiness  they were awfully happy godfrey agreed  think what she wasthink how no one else will ever again be like her the girl went on  i suppose hes not very happy now her brother vaguely contributed  of course he isnt any more than you and i are and its dreadful of him to want to be  well dont make yourself miserable till youre sure the young man said  but adela showed him confidently that she was sure from the way the pair had behaved together and from her fathers attitude on the drive home  if godfrey had been there he would have seen everything it couldnt be explained but he would have felt  when he asked at what moment the girl had first had her suspicion she replied that it had all come at once that evening or that at least she had had no conscious fear till then  there had been signs for two or three weeks but she hadnt understood themever since the day mrs churchley had dined in seymour street  adela had on that occasion thought it odd her father should have wished to invite her given the quiet way they were living she was a person they knew so little  he had said something about her having been very civil to him and that evening already she had guessed that he must have frequented their portentous guest herself more than there had been signs of  tonight it had come to her clearly that he would have called on her every day since the time of her dining with them every afternoon about the hour he was ostensibly at his club  mrs churchley was his clubshe was for all the world just like one  at this godfrey laughed he wanted to know what his sister knew about clubs  she was slightly disappointed in his laugh even wounded by it but she knew perfectly what she meant  she meant that mrs churchley was public and florid promiscuous and mannish  oh i daresay shes all right he said as if he wanted to get on with his work  he looked at the clock on the mantelshelf he would have to put in another hour  all right to come and take darling mammas placeto sit where she used to sit to lay her horrible hands on her things  adela was appalledall the more that she hadnt expected itat her brothers apparent acceptance of such a prospect  he coloured there was something in her passionate piety that scorched him  she glared at him with tragic eyeshe might have profaned an altar  oh i mean that nothing will come of it  not if we do our duty said adela  and then as he looked as if he hadnt an idea of what that could be  you must speak to himtell him how we feel that we shall never forgive him that we cant endure it  hell think im cheeky her brother returned looking down at his papers with his back to her and his hands in his pockets  cheeky to plead for her memory  hell say its none of my business  then you believe hell do it cried the girl  not a bit  go to bed  ill speak to himshe had turned as pale as a young priestess  dont cry out till youre hurt wait till he speaks to you  he wont he wont she declared  hell do it without telling us  her brother had faced round to her again he started a little at this and again at one of the candles lighted his cigarette which had gone out  she looked at him a moment then he said something that surprised her  is mrs churchley very rich  i havent the least idea  what on earth has that to do with it  godfrey puffed his cigarette  does she live as if she were  she has a lot of hideous showy things  well we must keep our eyes open he concluded  and now you must let me get on  he kissed his visitor as if to make up for dismissing her or for his failure to take fire and she held him a moment burying her head on his shoulder  a wave of emotion surged through her and again she quavered out ah why did she leave us  why did she leave us  yes why indeed the young man sighed disengaging himself with a movement of oppression    chapter ii    adela was so far right as that by the end of the week though she remained certain her father had still not made the announcement she dreaded  what convinced her was the sense of her changed relations with himof there being between them something unexpressed something she was aware of as she would have been of an open wound when she spoke of this to godfrey he said the change was of her own makingalso that she was cruelly unjust to the governor  she suffered even more from her brothers unexpected perversity she had had so different a theory about him that her disappointment was almost an humiliation and she needed all her fortitude to pitch her faith lower  she wondered what had happened to him and why he so failed her  she would have trusted him to feel right about anything above all about such a question  their worship of their mothers memory their recognition of her sacred place in their past her exquisite influence in their fathers life his fortune his career in the whole history of the family and welfare of the house accomplished clever gentle good beautiful and capable as she had been a woman whose quiet distinction was universally admired so that on her death one of the princesses the most august of her friends had written adela such a note about her as princesses were understood very seldom to write  their hushed tenderness over all this was like a religion and was also an attributive honour to fall away from which was a form of treachery  this wasnt the way people usually felt in london she knew but strenuous ardent observant girl as she was with secrecies of sentiment and dim originalities of attitude she had already made up her mind that london was no treasurehouse of delicacies  remembrance there was hammered thin to be faithful was to make society gape  the patient dead were sacrificed they had no shrines for people were literally ashamed of mourning  when they had hustled all sensibility out of their lives they invented the fiction that they felt too much to utter  adela said nothing to her sisters this reticence was part of the virtue it was her idea to practise for them  she was to be their mother a direct deputy and representative  before the vision of that other woman parading in such a character she felt capable of ingenuities of deep diplomacies  the essence of these indeed was just tremulously to watch her father  five days after they had dined together at mrs churchleys he asked her if she had been to see that lady  no indeed why should i adela knew that he knew she hadnt been since mrs churchley would have told him  dont you call on people after you dine with them said colonel chart  yes in the course of time  i dont rush off within the week  her father looked at her and his eyes were colder than she had ever seen them which was probably she reflected just the way hers appeared to himself  then youll please rush off tomorrow  shes to dine with us on the 12th and i shall expect your sisters to come down  adela stared  to a dinnerparty  its not to be a dinnerparty  i want them to know mrs churchley  is there to be nobody else  godfrey of course  a family party he said with an assurance before which she turned cold  the girl asked her brother that evening if that wasnt tantamount to an announcement  he looked at her queerly and then said  ive been to see her  what on earth did you do that for  father told me he wished it  then he has told you  told me what godfrey asked while her heart sank with the sense of his making difficulties for her  that theyre engaged of course  what else can all this mean  he didnt tell me that but i like her  like her the girl shrieked  shes very kind very good  to thrust herself upon us when we hate her  is that what you call kind  is that what you call decent  oh i dont hate herand he turned away as if she bored him  she called the next day on mrs churchley designing to break out somehow to plead to appealoh spare us have mercy on us let him alone go away  but that wasnt easy when they were face to face mrs churchley had every intention of getting as she would have saidshe was perpetually using the expressioninto touch but her good intentions were as depressing as a tailors misfits  she could never understand that they had no place for her vulgar charity that their life was filled with a fragrance of perfection for which she had no sense fine enough  she was as undomestic as a shopfront and as out of tune as a parrot  she would either make them live in the streets or bring the streets into their lifeit was the same thing she had evidently never read a book and she used intonations that adela had never heard as if she had been an australian or an american  she understood everything in a vulgar sense speaking of godfreys visit to her and praising him according to her idea saying horrid things about himthat he was awfully goodlooking a perfect gentleman the kind she liked  how could her father who was after all in everything else such a dear listen to a woman or endure her who thought she pleased him when she called the son of his dead wife a perfect gentleman  what would he have been pray  much she knew about what any of them were when she told adela she wanted her to like her the girl thought for an instant her opportunity had come the chance to plead with her and beg her off  but she presented such an impenetrable surface that it would have been like giving a message to a varnished door  she wasnt a woman said adela she was an address  when she dined in seymour street the children as the girl called the others including godfrey liked her  beatrice and muriel stared shyly and silently at the wonders of her apparel she was brutally overdressed without of course guessing the danger that tainted the air  they supposed her in their innocence to be amusing and they didnt know any more than she did herself how she patronised them when she was upstairs with them after dinner adela could see her look round the room at the things she meant to altertheir mothers things not a bit like her own and not good enough for her  after a quarter of an hour of this our young lady felt sure she was deciding that seymour street wouldnt do at all the dear old home that had done for their mother those twenty years  was she plotting to transport them all to her horrible princes gate  of one thing at any rate adela was certain  her father at that moment alone in the diningroom with godfrey pretending to drink another glass of wine to make time was coming to the point was telling the news  when they reappeared they both to her eyes looked unnatural  the news had been told  she had it from godfrey before mrs churchley left the house when after a brief interval he followed her out of the drawingroom on her taking her sisters to bed  she was waiting for him at the door of her room  her father was then alone with his fianceethe word was grotesque to adela it was already as if the place were her home  what did you say to him our young woman asked when her brother had told her  i said nothing  then he added colouringthe expression of her face was suchthere was nothing to say  is that how it strikes youand she stared at the lamp  he asked me to speak to her godfrey went on  in what hideous sense  to tell her i was glad  and did you adela panted  i dont know  i said something  she kissed me  oh how could you shuddered the girl who covered her face with her hands  he says shes very rich her brother returned  is that why you kissed her  i didnt kiss her  goodnight  and the young man turning his back went out  when he had gone adela locked herself in as with the fear she should be overtaken or invaded and during a sleepless feverish memorable night she took counsel of her uncompromising spirit  she saw things as they were in all the indignity of life  the levity the mockery the infidelity the ugliness lay as plain as a map before her it was a world of gross practical jokes a world pour rire but she cried about it all the same  the morning dawned early or rather it seemed to her there had been no night nothing but a sickly creeping day  but by the time she heard the house stirring again she had determined what to do  when she came down to the breakfastroom her father was already in his place with newspapers and letters and she expected the first words he would utter to be a rebuke to her for having disappeared the night before without taking leave of mrs churchley  then she saw he wished to be intensely kind to make every allowance to conciliate and console her  he knew she had heard from godfrey and he got up and kissed her  he told her as quickly as possible to have it over stammering a little with an ive a piece of news for you that will probably shock you yet looking even exaggeratedly grave and rather pompous to inspire the respect he didnt deserve  when he kissed her she melted she burst into tears  he held her against him kissing her again and again saying tenderly yes yes i know i know  but he didnt know else he couldnt have done it  beatrice and muriel came in frightened when they saw her crying and still more scared when she turned to them with words and an air that were terrible in their comfortable little lives  papas going to be married hes going to marry mrs churchley  after staring a moment and seeing their father look as strange on his side as adela though in a different way the children also began to cry so that when the servants arrived with tea and boiled eggs these functionaries were greatly embarrassed with their burden not knowing whether to come in or hang back  they all scraped together a decorum and as soon as the things had been put on table the colonel banished the men with a glance  then he made a little affectionate speech to beatrice and muriel in which he described mrs churchley as the kindest the most delightful of women only wanting to make them happy only wanting to make him happy and convinced that he would be if they were and that they would be if he was  what do such words mean adela asked herself  she declared privately that they meant nothing but she was silent and every one was silent on account of the advent of miss flynn the governess before whom colonel chart preferred not to discuss the situation adela recognised on the spot that if things were to go as he wished his children would practically never again be alone with him  he would spend all his time with mrs churchley till they were married and then mrs churchley would spend all her time with him  adela was ashamed of him and that was horribleall the more that every one else would be all his other friends every one who had known her mother  but the public dishonour to that high memory shouldnt be enacted he shouldnt do as he wished  after breakfast her father remarked to her that it would give him pleasure if in a day or two she would take her sisters to see their friend and she replied that he should be obeyed  he held her hand a moment looking at her with an argument in his eyes which presently hardened into sternness  he wanted to know that she forgave him but also wanted to assure her that he expected her to mind what she did to go straight  she turned away her eyes she was indeed ashamed of him  she waited three days and then conveyed her sisters to the repaire as she would have been ready to term it of the lioness  that queen of beasts was surrounded with callers as adela knew she would be it was her day and the occasion the girl preferred  before this she had spent all her time with her companions talking to them about their mother playing on their memory of her making them cry and making them laugh reminding them of blest hours of their early childhood telling them anecdotes of her own  none the less she confided to them that she believed there was no harm at all in mrs churchley and that when the time should come she would probably take them out immensely  she saw with smothered irritation that they enjoyed their visit at princes gate they had never been at anything so grownup nor seen so many smart bonnets and brilliant complexions  moreover they were considered with interest quite as if being minor elements yet perceptible ones of mrs churchleys new life they had been described in advance and were the heroines of the occasion  there were so many ladies present that this personage didnt talk to them much she only called them her chicks and asked them to hand about teacups and bread and butter  all of which was highly agreeable and indeed intensely exciting to beatrice and muriel who had little round red spots in their cheeks when they came away  adela quivered with the sense that her mothers children were now mrs churchleys chicks and a part of the furniture of mrs churchleys dreadful consciousness  it was one thing to have made up her mind however it was another thing to make her attempt  it was when she learned from godfrey that the day was fixed the 20th of july only six weeks removed that she felt the importance of prompt action  she learned everything from godfrey now having decided it would be hypocrisy to question her father  even her silence was hypocritical but she couldnt weep and wail  her father showed extreme tact taking no notice of her detachment treating it as a moment of bouderie he was bound to allow her and that would pout itself away  she debated much as to whether she should take godfrey into her confidence she would have done so without hesitation if he hadnt disappointed her  he was so little what she might have expected and so perversely preoccupied that she could explain it only by the high pressure at which he was living his anxiety about his exam  he was in a fidget in a fever putting on a spurt to come in first sceptical moreover about his success and cynical about everything else  he appeared to agree to the general axiom that they didnt want a strange woman thrust into their life but he found mrs churchley very jolly as a person to know  he had been to see her by himselfhe had been to see her three times  he in fact gave it out that he would make the most of her now he should probably be so little in seymour street after these days  what adela at last determined to give him was her assurance that the marriage would never take place  when he asked what she meant and who was to prevent it she replied that the interesting couple would abandon the idea of themselves or that mrs churchley at least would after a week or two back out of it  that will be really horrid then godfrey pronounced  the only respectable thing at the point theyve come to is to put it through  charming for poor dad to have the air of being chucked  this made her hesitate two days more but she found answers more valid than any objections  the manyvoiced answer to everythingit was like the autumn wind round the housewas the affront that fell back on her mother  her mother was dead but it killed her again  so one morning at eleven oclock when she knew her father was writing letters she went out quietly and stopping the first hansom she met drove to princes gate  mrs churchley was at home and she was shown into the drawingroom with the request that she would wait five minutes  she waited without the sense of breaking down at the last and the impulse to run away which were what she had expected to have  in the cab and at the door her heart had beat terribly but now suddenly with the game really to play she found herself lucid and calm  it was a joy to her to feel later that this was the way mrs churchley found her  not confused not stammering nor prevaricating only a little amazed at her own courage conscious of the immense responsibility of her step and wonderfully older than her years  her hostess sounded her at first with suspicious eyes but eventually to adelas surprise burst into tears  at this the girl herself cried and with the secret happiness of believing they were saved  mrs churchley said she would think over what she had been told and she promised her young friend freely enough and very firmly not to betray the secret of the latters step to the colonel they were savedthey were saved  the words sung themselves in the girls soul as she came downstairs  when the door opened for her she saw her brother on the step and they looked at each other in surprise each finding it on the part of the other an odd hour for princes gate  godfrey remarked that mrs churchley would have enough of the family and adela answered that she would perhaps have too much  none the less the young man went in while his sister took her way home    chapter iii    she saw nothing of him for nearly a week he had more and more his own times and hours adjusted to his tremendous responsibilities and he spent whole days at his crammers  when she knocked at his door late in the evening he was regularly not in his room  it was known in the house how much he was worried he was horribly nervous about his ordeal  it was to begin on the 23rd of june and his father was as worried as himself  the wedding had been arranged in relation to this they wished poor godfreys fate settled first though they felt the nuptials would be darkened if it shouldnt be settled right  ten days after that performance of her private undertaking adela began to sniff as it were a difference in the general air but as yet she was afraid to exult  it wasnt in truth a difference for the better so that there might be still a great tension  her father since the announcement of his intended marriage had been visibly pleased with himself but that pleasure now appeared to have undergone a check  she had the impression known to the passengers on a great steamer when in the middle of the night they feel the engines stop  as this impression may easily sharpen to the sense that something serious has happened so the girl asked herself what had actually occurred  she had expected something serious but it was as if she couldnt keep still in her cabinshe wanted to go up and see  on the 20th just before breakfast her maid brought her a message from her brother  mr  godfrey would be obliged if she would speak to him in his room  she went straight up to him dreading to find him ill broken down on the eve of his formidable week  this was not the case howeverhe rather seemed already at work to have been at work since dawn  but he was very white and his eyes had a strange and new expression  her beautiful young brother looked older he looked haggard and hard  he met her there as if he had been waiting for her and he said at once  please tell me this adelawhat was the purpose of your visit the other morning to mrs churchley the day i met you at her door  she staredshe cast about  the purpose  whats the matter  why do you ask  theyve put it offtheyve put it off a month  ah thank god said adela  why the devil do you thank god godfrey asked with a strange impatience  she gave a strained intense smile  you know i think it all wrong  he stood looking at her up and down  what did you do there  how did you interfere  who told you i interfered she returned with a deep flush  you said somethingyou did something  i knew you had done it when i saw you come out  what i did was my own business  damn your own business cried the young man  she had never in her life been so spoken to and in advance had she been given the choice would have said that shed rather die than be so handled by godfrey  but her spirit was high and for a moment she was as angry as if she had been cut with a whip  she escaped the blow but felt the insult  and your business then she asked  i wondered what that was when i saw you  he stood a moment longer scowling at her then with the exclamation youve made a pretty mess he turned away from her and sat down to his books  they had put it off as he said her father was dry and stiff and official about it  i suppose i had better let you know weve thought it best to postpone our marriage till the end of the summer mrs churchley has so many arrangements to make  he was not more expansive than that  she neither knew nor greatly cared whether she but vainly imagined or correctly observed him to watch her obliquely for some measure of her receipt of these words  she flattered herself that thanks to godfreys forewarning cruel as the form of it had been she was able to repress any crude sign of elation  she had a perfectly good conscience for she could now judge what odious elements mrs churchley whom she had not seen since the morning in princes gate had already introduced into their dealings  she gathered without difficulty that her father hadnt concurred in the postponement for he was more restless than before more absent and distinctly irritable  there was naturally still the question of how much of this condition was to be attributed to his solicitude about godfrey  that young man took occasion to say a horrible thing to his sister  if i dont pass it will be your fault  these were dreadful days for the girl and she asked herself how she could have borne them if the hovering spirit of her mother hadnt been at her side  fortunately she always felt it there sustaining commending sanctifying  suddenly her father announced to her that he wished her to go immediately with her sisters down to brinton where there was always part of a household and where for a few weeks they would manage well enough  the only explanation he gave of this desire was that he wanted them out of the way  out of the way of what she queried since there were to be for the time no preparations in seymour street  she was willing to take it for out of the way of his nerves  she never needed urging however to go to brinton the dearest old house in the world where the happiest days of her young life had been spent and the silent nearness of her mother always seemed greatest  she was happy again with beatrice and muriel and miss flynn with the air of summer and the haunted rooms and her mothers garden and the talking oaks and the nightingales  she wrote briefly to her father giving him as he had requested an account of things and he wrote back that since she was so contentedshe didnt recognise having told him thatshe had better not return to town at all  the fagend of the london season would be unimportant to her and he was getting on very well  he mentioned that godfrey had passed his tests but as she knew there would be a tiresome wait before news of results  the poor chap was going abroad for a month with young sherardhe had earned a little rest and a little fun  he went abroad without a word to adela but in his beautiful little hand he took a chaffing leave of beatrice  the child showed her sister the letter of which she was very proud and which contained no message for any one else  this was the worst bitterness of the whole crisis for that somebodyits placing in so strange a light the creature in the world whom after her mother she had loved best  colonel chart had said he would run down while his children were at brinton but they heard no more about it  he only wrote two or three times to miss flynn on matters in regard to which adela was surprised he shouldnt have communicated with herself  muriel accomplished an upright little letter to mrs churchleyher eldest sister neither fostered nor discouraged the performanceto which mrs churchley replied after a fortnight in a meagre and as adela thought illiterate fashion making no allusion to the approach of any closer tie  evidently the situation had changed the question of the marriage was dropped at any rate for the time  this idea gave our young woman a singular and almost intoxicating sense of power she felt as if she were riding a great wave of confidence  she had decided and actedthe greatest could do no more than that  the grand thing was to see ones results and what else was she doing these results were in big rich conspicuous lives the stage was large on which she moved her figures  such a vision was exciting and as they had the use of a couple of ponies at brinton she worked off her excitement by a long gallop  a day or two after this however came news of which the effect was to rekindle it  godfrey had come back the list had been published he had passed first  these happy tidings proceeded from the young man himself he announced them by a telegram to beatrice who had never in her life before received such a missive and was proportionately inflated  adela reflected that she herself ought to have felt snubbed but she was too happy  they were free again they were themselves the nightmare of the previous weeks was blown away the unity and dignity of her fathers life restored and to round off her sense of success godfrey had achieved his first step toward high distinction  she wrote him the next day as frankly and affectionately as if there had been no estrangement between them and besides telling him how she rejoiced in his triumph begged him in charity to let them know exactly how the case stood with regard to mrs churchley  late in the summer afternoon she walked through the park to the village with her letter posted it and came back  suddenly at one of the turns of the avenue halfway to the house she saw a young man hover there as if awaiting hera young man who proved to be godfrey on his pedestrian progress over from the station  he had seen her as he took his short cut and if he had come down to brinton it wasnt apparently to avoid her  there was nevertheless none of the joy of his triumph in his face as he came a very few steps to meet her and although stiffly enough he let her kiss him and say im so gladim so glad she felt this tolerance as not quite the mere calm of the rising diplomatist  he turned toward the house with her and walked on a short distance while she uttered the hope that he had come to stay some days  only till tomorrow morning  theyre sending me straight to madrid i came down to say goodbye theres a fellow bringing my bags  to madrid  how awfully nice  and its awfully nice of you to have come she said as she passed her hand into his arm  the movement made him stop and stopping he turned on her in a flash a face of something more than suspicionof passionate reprobation  what i really came foryou might as well know without more delayis to ask you a question  a questionshe echoed it with a beating heart  they stood there under the old trees in the lingering light and young and fine and fair as they both were formed a complete superficial harmony with the peaceful english scene  a near view however would have shown that godfrey chart hadnt taken so much trouble only to skim the surface  he looked deep into his sisters eyes  what was it you said that morning to mrs churchley  she fixed them on the ground a moment but at last met his own again if she has told you why do you ask  she has told me nothing  ive seen for myself  what have you seen  she has broken it off  everythings over  fathers in the depths  in the depths the girl quavered  did you think it would make him jolly he went on  she had to choose what to say  hell get over it  hell he glad  that remains to be seen  you interfered you invented something you got round her  i insist on knowing what you did  adela felt that if it was a question of obstinacy there was something within her she could count on in spite of which while she stood looking down again a moment she said to herself i could be dumb and dogged if i chose but i scorn to be  she wasnt ashamed of what she had done but she wanted to be clear  are you absolutely certain its broken off  he is and she is so thats as good  what reason has she given  none at allor half a dozen its the same thing  she has changed her mindshe mistook her feelingsshe cant part with her independence  moreover he has too many children  did he tell you this the girl asked  mrs churchley told me  she has gone abroad for a year  and she didnt tell you what i said to her  godfrey showed an impatience  why should i take this trouble if she had  you might have taken it to make me suffer said adela  that appears to be what you want to do  no i leave that to youits the good turn youve done me cried the young man with hot tears in his eyes  she stared aghast with the perception that there was some dreadful thing she didnt know but he walked on dropping the question angrily and turning his back to her as if he couldnt trust himself she read his disgust in his averted face in the way he squared his shoulders and smote the ground with his stick and she hurried after him and presently overtook him  she kept by him for a moment in silence then she broke out  what do you mean  what in the world have i done to you  she would have helped me  she was all ready to help me godfrey portentously said  helped you in what  she wondered what he meant if he had made debts that he was afraid to confess to his father andof all horrible thingshad been looking to mrs churchley to pay  she turned red with the mere apprehension of this and on the heels of her guess exulted again at having perhaps averted such a shame  cant you just see im in trouble  where are your eyes your senses your sympathy that you talk so much about  havent you seen these six months that ive a curst worry in my life  she seized his arm made him stop stood looking up at him like a frightened little girl  whats the matter godfreywhat is the matter  youve gone against me soi could strangle you he growled  this image added nothing to her dread her dread was that he had done some wrong was stained with some guilt  she uttered it to him with clasped hands begging him to tell her the worst but still more passionately he cut her short with his own cry  in gods name satisfy me  what infernal thing did you do  it wasnt infernalit was right  i told her mamma had been wretched said adela  wretched  you told her such a lie  it was the only way and she believed me  wretched howwretched whenwretched where the young man stammered  i told her papa had made her so and that she ought to know it  i told her the question troubled me unspeakably but that i had made up my mind it was my duty to initiate her  adela paused the light of bravado in her face as if though struck while the words came with the monstrosity of what she had done she was incapable of abating a jot of it  i notified her that he had faults and peculiarities that made mammas life a long worrya martyrdom that she hid wonderfully from the world but that we saw and that i had often pitied  i told her what they were these faults and peculiarities i put the dots on the is  i said it wasnt fair to let another person marry him without a warning  i warned her i satisfied my conscience  she could do as she liked  my responsibility was over  godfrey gazed at her he listened with parted lips incredulous and appalled  you invented such a tissue of falsities and calumnies and you talk about your conscience  you stand there in your senses and proclaim your crime  id have committed any crime that would have rescued us  you insult and blacken and ruin your own father godfrey kept on  hell never know it she took a vow she wouldnt tell him  ah ill he damned if i wont tell him he rang out  adela felt sick at this but she flamed up to resent the treachery as it struck her of such a menace  i did righti did right she vehemently declared i went down on my knees to pray for guidance and i saved mammas memory from outrage  but if i hadnt if i hadntshe faltered an instantim not worse than you and im not so bad for youve done something that youre ashamed to tell me  he had taken out his watch he looked at it with quick intensity as if not hearing nor heeding her  then his calculating eyes raised he fixed her long enough to exclaim with unsurpassable horror and contempt  you raving maniac  he turned away from her he bounded down the avenue in the direction from which they had come and while she watched him strode away across the grass toward the short cut to the station    chapter iv    his bags by the time she got home had been brought to the house but beatrice and muriel immediately informed of this waited for their brother in vain  their sister said nothing to them of her having seen him and she accepted after a little with a calmness that surprised herself the idea that he had returned to town to denounce her  she believed this would make no difference nowshe had done what she had done  she had somehow a stiff faith in mrs churchley  once that so considerable mass had received its impetus it wouldnt it couldnt pull up  it represented a heavyfooted person incapable of further agility  adela recognised too how well it might have come over her that there were too many children lastly the girl fortified herself with the reflexion grotesque in the conditions and conducing to prove her sense of humour not high that her father was after all not a man to be played with  it seemed to her at any rate that if she had baffled his unholy purpose she could bear anythingbear imprisonment and bread and water bear lashes and torture bear even his lifelong reproach  what she could bear least was the wonder of the inconvenience she had inflicted on godfrey  she had time to turn this over very vainly for a succession of daysdays more numerous than she had expected which passed without bringing her from london any summons to come up and take her punishment  she sounded the possible she compared the degrees of the probable feeling however that as a cloistered girl she was poorly equipped for speculation  she tried to imagine the calamitous things young men might do and could only feel that such things would naturally be connected either with borrowed money or with bad women  she became conscious that after all she knew almost nothing about either of those interests  the worst woman she knew was mrs churchley herself  meanwhile there was no reverberation from seymour streetonly a sultry silence  at brinton she spent hours in her mothers garden where she had grown up where she considered that she was training for old age since she meant not to depend on whist  she loved the place as had she been a good catholic she would have loved the smell of her parish church and indeed there was in her passion for flowers something of the respect of a religion  they seemed to her the only things in the world that really respected themselves unless one made an exception for nutkins who had been in command all through her mothers time with whom she had had a real friendship and who had been affected by their pure example  he was the person left in the world with whom on the whole she could speak most intimately of the dead  they never had to name her togetherthey only said she and nutkins freely conceded that she had taught him everything he knew when beatrice and muriel said she they referred to mrs churchley adela had reason to believe she should never marry and that some day she should have about a thousand a year  this made her see in the far future a little garden of her own under a hill full of rare and exquisite things where she would spend most of her old age on her knees with an apron and stout gloves with a pair of shears and a trowel steeped in the comfort of being thought mad  one morning ten days after her scene with godfrey on coming back into the house shortly before lunch she was met by miss flynn with the notification that a lady in the drawingroom had been waiting for her for some minutes  a lady suggested immediately mrs churchley it came over adela that the form in which her penalty was to descend would be a personal explanation with that misdirected woman  the lady had given no name and miss flynn hadnt seen mrs churchley nevertheless the governess was certain adelas surmise was wrong  is she big and dreadful the girl asked  miss flynn who was circumspection itself took her time  shes dreadful but shes not big  she added that she wasnt sure she ought to let adela go in alone but this young lady took herself throughout for a heroine and it wasnt in a heroine to shrink from any encounter  wasnt she every instant in transcendent contact with her mother  the visitor might have no connexion whatever with the drama of her fathers frustrated marriage but everything today for adela was part of that  miss flynns description had prepared her for a considerable shock but she wasnt agitated by her first glimpse of the person who awaited her  a youngish welldressed woman stood there and silence was between them while they looked at each other  before either had spoken however adela began to see what miss flynn had intended  in the light of the drawingroom window the lady was fiveandthirty years of age and had vivid yellow hair  she also had a blue cloth suit with brass buttons a stickup collar like a gentlemans a necktie arranged in a sailors knot a golden pin in the shape of a little lawntennis racket and pearlgrey gloves with big black stitchings  adelas second impression was that she was an actress and her third that no such person had ever before crossed that threshold  ill tell you what ive come for said the apparition  ive come to ask you to intercede  she wasnt an actress an actress would have had a nicer voice  to intercede  adela was too bewildered to ask her to sit down  with your father you know  he doesnt know but hell have to her have sounded like ave  she explained with many more such sounds that she was mrs godfrey that they had been married seven mortal months  if godfrey was going abroad she must go with him and the only way she could go with him would be for his father to do something  he was afraid of his fatherthat was clear he was afraid even to tell him  what she had come down for was to see some other member of the family face to facefice to fice mrs godfrey called itand try if he couldnt be approached by another side  if no one else would act then she would just have to act herself  the colonel would have to do somethingthat was the only way out of it  what really happened adela never quite understood what seemed to be happening was that the room went round and round  through the blur of perception accompanying this effect the sharp stabs of her visitors revelation came to her like the words heard by a patient going off under ether  she afterwards denied passionately even to herself that she had done anything so abject as to faint but there was a lapse in her consciousness on the score of miss flynns intervention  this intervention had evidently been active for when they talked the matter over later in the day with bated breath and infinite dissimulation for the schoolroom quarter the governess had more lurid truths and still more to impart than to receive  she was at any rate under the impression that she had athletically contended in the drawingroom with the yellow hairthis after removing adela from the scene and before inducing mrs godfrey to withdraw  miss flynn had never known a more thrilling day for all the rest of it too was pervaded with agitations and conversations precautions and alarms  it was given out to beatrice and muriel that their sister had been taken suddenly ill and the governess ministered to her in her room  indeed adela had never found herself less at ease for this time she had received a blow that she couldnt return  there was nothing to do but to take it to endure the humiliation of her wound  at first she declined to take ithaving as might appear the much more attractive resource of regarding her visitant as a mere masquerading person an impudent impostor  on the face of the matter moreover it wasnt fair to believe till one heard and to hear in such a case was to hear godfrey himself  whatever she had tried to imagine about him she hadnt arrived at anything so belittling as an idiotic secret marriage with a dyed and painted hag  adela repeated this last word as if it gave her comfort and indeed where everything was so bad fifteen years of seniority made the case little worse miss flynn was portentous for miss flynn had had it out with the wretch  she had crossquestioned her and had not broken her down this was the most uplifted hour of miss flynns life for whereas she usually had to content herself with being humbly and gloomily in the right she could now be magnanimously and showily so  her only perplexity was as to what she ought to dowrite to colonel chart or go up to town to see him  she bloomed with alternativesshe resembled some dull gardenpath which under a copious downpour has begun to flaunt with colour  toward evening adela was obliged to recognise that her brothers worry of which he had spoken to her had appeared bad enough to consist even of a low wife and to remember that so far from its being inconceivable a young man in his position should clandestinely take one she had been present years before during her mothers lifetime when lady molesley declared gaily over a cup of tea that this was precisely what she expected of her eldest son  the next morning it was the worst possibilities that seemed clearest the only thing left with a tatter of dusky comfort being the ambiguity of godfreys charge that her own action had done for him  that was a matter by itself and she racked her brains for a connecting link between mrs churchley and mrs godfrey at last she made up her mind that they were related by blood very likely though differing in fortune they were cousins or even sisters  but even then what did the wretched boy mean  arrested by the unnatural fascination of opportunity miss flynn received before lunch a telegram from colonel chartan order for dinner and a vehicle he and godfrey were to arrive at six oclock adela had plenty of occupation for the interval since she was pitying her father when she wasnt rejoicing that her mother had gone too soon to know  she flattered herself she made out the providential reason of that cruelty now  she found time however still to wonder for what purpose given the situation godfrey was to he brought down  she wasnt unconscious indeed that she had little general knowledge of what usually was done with young men in that predicament  one talked about the situation but the situation was an abyss  she felt this still more when she found on her fathers arrival that nothing apparently was to happen as she had taken for granted it would  there was an inviolable hush over the whole affair but no tragedy no publicity nothing ugly  the tragedy had been in townthe faces of the two men spoke of it in spite of their other perfunctory aspects and at present there was only a family dinner with beatrice and muriel and the governesswith almost a company tone too the result of the desire to avoid publicity  adela admired her father she knew what he was feeling if mrs godfrey had been at him and yet she saw him positively gallant  he was mildly austere or rather evenwhat was itaugust just as coldly equivocal he never looked at his son so that at moments he struck her as almost sick with sadness  godfrey was equally inscrutable and therefore wholly different from what he had been as he stood before her in the park  if he was to start on his career with such a wifewouldnt she utterly blight it he was already professional enough to know how to wear a mask  before they rose from table she felt herself wholly bewildered so little were such large causes traceable in their effects  she had nerved herself for a great ordeal but the air was as sweet as an anodyne  it was perfectly plain to her that her father was deadly soreas pathetic as a person betrayed  he was broken but he showed no resentment there was a weight on his heart but he had lightened it by dressing as immaculately as usual for dinner  she asked herself what immensity of a row there could have been in town to have left his anger so spent  he went through everything even to sitting with his son after dinner  when they came out together he invited beatrice and muriel to the billiardroom and as miss flynn discreetly withdrew adela was left alone with godfrey who was completely changed and not now in the least of a rage  he was broken too but not so pathetic as his father  he was only very correct and apologetic he said to his sister  im awfully sorry you were annoyedit was something i never dreamed of  she couldnt think immediately what he meant then she grasped the reference to her extraordinary invader  she was uncertain however what tone to take perhaps his father had arranged with him that they were to make the best of it  but she spoke her own despair in the way she murmured oh godfrey godfrey is it true  ive been the most unutterable donkeyyou can say what you like to me  you cant say anything worse than ive said to myself  my brother my brotherhis words made her wail it out  he hushed her with a movement and she asked  what has father said  he looked very high over her head  hell give her six hundred a year  ah the angelit was too splendid  on conditiongodfrey scarce blinkedshe never comes near me she has solemnly promised and shell probably leave me alone to get the money  if she doesntin diplomacyim lost  he had been turning his eyes vaguely about this way and that to avoid meeting hers but after another instant he gave up the effort and she had the miserable confession of his glance  ive been living in hell  my brother my brother she yearningly repeated  im not an idiot yet for her ive behaved like one  dont ask me you mustnt know  it was all done in a day and since then fancy my condition fancy my work in such a torment fancy my coming through at all  thank god you passed she cried  you were wonderful  id have shot myself if i hadnt been  i had an awful day yesterday with the governor it was late at night before it was over  i leave england next week  he brought me down here for it to look wellso that the children shant know  hes wonderful too adela murmured  wonderful too godfrey echoed  did she tell him the girl went on  she came straight to seymour street from here  she saw him alone first then he called me in  that luxury lasted about an hour  poor poor father adela moaned at this on which her brother remained silent  then after he had alluded to it as the scene he had lived in terror of all through his cramming and she had sighed forth again her pity and admiration for such a mixture of anxieties and such a triumph of talent she pursued  have you told him  told him what  what you said you wouldwhat i did  godfrey turned away as if at present he had very little interest in that inferior tribulation  i was angry with you but i cooled off i held my tongue  she clasped her hands  you thought of mamma  oh dont speak of mamma he cried as in rueful tenderness  it was indeed not a happy moment and she murmured  no if you had thought of her  this made godfrey face her again with a small flare in his eyes  oh then it didnt prevent  i thought that woman really good  i believed in her  is she very bad  i shall never mention her to you again he returned with dignity  you may believe i wont speak of her  so father doesnt know the girl added  doesnt know what  that i said what i did to mrs churchley  he had a momentary pause  i dont think so but you must find out for yourself  i shall find out said adela  but what had mrs churchley to do with it  with my misery  i told her  i had to tell some one  why didnt you tell me  he appearedthough but after an instantto know exactly why  oh you take things so beastly hardyou make such rows  adela covered her face with her hands and he went on  what i wanted was comfort not to be lashed up  i thought i should go mad  i wanted mrs churchley to break it to father to intercede for me and help him to meet it  she was awfully kind to me she listened and she understood she could fancy how it had happened  without her i shouldnt have pulled through  she liked me you know he further explained and as if it were quite worth mentioningall the more that it was pleasant to him  she said shed do what she could for me  she was full of sympathy and resource  i really leaned on her but when you cut in of course it spoiled everything  thats why i was so furious with you  she couldnt do anything then  adela dropped her hands staring she felt she had walked in darkness  so that he had to meet it alone  dame said godfrey who had got up his french tremendously  muriel came to the door to say papa wished the two others to join them and the next day godfrey returned to town  his father remained at brinton without an intermission the rest of the summer and the whole of the autumn and adela had a chance to find out as she had said whether he knew she had interfered  but in spite of her chance she never found out  he knew mrs churchley had thrown him over and he knew his daughter rejoiced in it but he appeared not to have divined the relation between the two facts  it was strange that one of the matters he was clearest aboutadelas secret triumphshould have been just the thing which from this time on justified less and less such a confidence  she was too sorry for him to be consistently glad  she watched his attempts to wind himself up on the subject of shorthorns and drainage and she favoured to the utmost of her ability his intermittent disposition to make a figure in orchids she wondered whether they mightnt have a few people at brinton but when she mentioned the idea he asked what in the world there would be to attract them  it was a confoundedly stupid house he remarked with all respect to her cleverness  beatrice and muriel were mystified the prospect of going out immensely had faded so utterly away  they were apparently not to go out at all  colonel chart was aimless and bored he paced up and down and went back to smoking which was bad for him and looked drearily out of windows as if on the bare chance that something might arrive  did he expect mrs churchley to arrive did he expect her to relent on finding she couldnt live without him  it was adelas belief that she gave no sign  but the girl thought it really remarkable of her not to have betrayed her ingenious young visitor  adelas judgement of human nature was perhaps harsh but she believed that most women given the various facts wouldnt have been so forbearing  this ladys conception of the point of honour placed her there in a finer and purer light than had at all originally promised to shine about her  she meanwhile herself could well judge how heavy her father found the burden of godfreys folly and how he was incommoded at having to pay the horrible woman six hundred a year  doubtless he was having dreadful letters from her doubtless she threatened them all with hideous exposure  if the matter should be bruited godfreys prospects would collapse on the spot  he thought madrid very charming and curious but mrs godfrey was in england so that his father had to face the music  adela took a dolorous comfort in her mothers being out of thatit would have killed her but this didnt blind her to the fact that the comfort for her father would perhaps have been greater if he had had some one to talk to about his trouble  he never dreamed of doing so to her and she felt she couldnt ask him  in the family life he wanted utter silence about it  early in the winter he went abroad for ten weeks leaving her with her sisters in the country where it was not to be denied that at this time existence had very little savour  she half expected her sisterinlaw would again descend on her but the fear wasnt justified and the quietude of the awful creature seemed really to vibrate with the ring of goldpieces  there were sure to be extras adela winced at the extras  colonel chart went to paris and to monte carlo and then to madrid to see his boy  his daughter had the vision of his perhaps meeting mrs churchley somewhere since if she had gone for a year she would still be on the continent  if he should meet her perhaps the affair would come on again  she caught herself musing over this  but he brought back no such appearance and seeing him after an interval she was struck afresh with his jilted and wasted air  she didnt like itshe resented it  a little more and she would have said that that was no way to treat so faithful a man  they all went up to town in march and on one of the first days of april she saw mrs churchley in the park  she herself remained apparently invisible to that ladyshe herself and beatrice and muriel who sat with her in their mothers old bottlegreen landau mrs churchley perched higher than ever rode by without a recognition but this didnt prevent adelas going to her before the month was over  as on her great previous occasion she went in the morning and she again had the good fortune to be admitted  this time however her visit was shorter and a week after making itthe week was a desolationshe addressed to her brother at madrid a letter containing these words  i could endure it no longeri confessed and retracted i explained to her as well as i could the falsity of what i said to her ten months ago and the benighted purity of my motives for saying it  i besought her to regard it as unsaid to forgive me not to despise me too much to take pity on poor perfect papa and come back to him  she was more goodnatured than you might have expectedindeed she laughed extravagantly  she had never believed meit was too absurd she had only at the time disliked me  she found me utterly falseshe was very frank with me about thisand she told papa she really thought me horrid  she said she could never live with such a girl and as i would certainly never marry i must be sent awayin short she quite loathed me  papa defended me he refused to sacrifice me and this led practically to their rupture  papa gave her up as it were for me  fancy the angel and fancy what i must try to be to him for the rest of his life  mrs churchley can never come backshes going to marry
