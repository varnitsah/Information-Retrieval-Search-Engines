94261330	the pigeon pie  by charlotte m yonge     chapter i    early in the september of the year 1651 the afternoon sun was shining pleasantly into the dininghall of forest lea house  the sunshine came through a large baywindow glazed in diamonds and with long branches of a vine trailing across it but in parts the glass had been broken and had never been mended  the walls were wainscoted with dark oak as well as the floor which shone bright with rubbing and stags antlers projected from them on which hung a sword in its sheath one or two odd gauntlets an oldfashioned helmet a gun some bows and arrows and two of the broad shady hats then in use one with a drooping black feather the other plainer and a good deal the worse for wear both of a small size as if belonging to a young boy  an oaken screen crossed the hall close to the front door and there was a large open fireplace a settle on each side under the great yawning chimney where however at present no fire was burning before it was a long diningtable covered towards the upper end with a delicately white cloth on which stood however a few trenchers plain drinkinghorns and a large oldfashioned blackjack that is to say a pitcher formed of leather  an armchair was at the head of the table and heavy oaken benches along the side  a little boy of six years old sat astride on the end of one of the benches round which he had thrown a bridle of plaited rushes and with a switch in his other hand was springing himself up and down calling out come eleanor come lucy come and ride on a pillion behind me to worcester to see king charles and brother edmund  ill come i am coming cried eleanor a little girl about a year older her hair put tightly away under a plain round cap and she was soon perched sideways behind her brother  oh fie mistress eleanor why you would not ride to the wars this was said by a woman of about four or fiveandtwenty tall thin and spare with a high colour sharp black eyes and a waist which the long stiff stays laced in front had pinched in till it was not much bigger than a wasps while her quilted green petticoat standing out full below it showed a very trim pair of ankles encased in scarlet stockings and a pair of bony red arms came forth from the full short sleeves of a sort of white jacket gathered in at the waist  she was clattering backwards and forwards removing the dinner things and talking to the children as she did so in a sharp shrill tone  such a racket as you make to be sure and how you can have the heart to do so i cant guess not i considering what may be doing this very moment  oh but walter says they will all come back again brother edmund and diggory and all said little eleanor and then we shall be merry  yes said lucy who though two years older wore the same prim round cap and long frock as her little sister then we shall have edmund here again  you cant remember him at all eleanor and charlie for we have not seen him these six years  no said deborah the maid  ah these be weary wars what wont let a gentleman live at home in peace nor his poor servants who have no call to them   for shame deb cried lucy are not you the kings own subject  but deborah maundered on it is all very well for gentlefolks but now it had all got quiet again tis mortal hard it should be stirred up afresh and a poor soul marched off he dont know where to fight with he dont know who for he dont know what  he ought to know what exclaimed lucy growing very angry  i tell you deb i only wish i was a man  i would take the great two handled sword and fight in the very front rank for our church and our king  you would soon see what a brave cavaliers daughterson i mean said lucy getting into a puzzle could do  the more eager lucy grew the more unhappy deborah was and putting her apron to her eyes she said in a dismal voice ah tis little poor diggory wots of kings and cavaliers  what lucys indignation would have led her to say next can never be known for at this moment in bounced a tall slim boy of thirteen his long curling locks streaming tangled behind him  hollo he shouted what is the matter now  dainty deborah in the dumps cheer up my lass  ill warrant that doughty diggory is discreet enough to encounter no more bullets than he can reasonably avoid  this made deborah throw down her apron and reply with a toss of the head none of your nonsense master walter unless you would have me speak to my lady  cry for diggory indeed  she was really crying for him walter interposed lucy  mistress lucy exclaimed deborah angrily the life i lead among you is enough  not enough to teach you good temper said walter  do you want a little more  i wish someone was here to teach you good manners answered the tormented deborah  as if it was not enough for one poor girl to have the work of ten servants on her hands here must you be mock mock jeer jeer worrit worrit all day long  i had rather be a mark for all the musketeers in the parliamentary army  this deborah always said when she was out of temper and it therefore made walter and lucy laugh the more but in the midst of their merriment in came a girl of sixteen or seventeen tall and graceful her head was bare her hair fastened in a knot behind and in little curls round her face she had an open bodice of green silk and a white dress under it very plain and neat her step was quick and active but her large dark eyes had a grave thoughtful look as if she was one who would naturally have loved to sit still and think better than to bustle about and be busy  eleanor ran up to her at once complaining that walter was teasing deborah shamefully  she was going to speak but deborah cut her short  no mistress rose i will not have even you excuse him ill go and tell my lady how a poor faithful wench is served and away she flounced followed by rose  will she tell mamma asked little charlie  oh no rose will pacify her said lucy  i am sure i wish she would tell said eleanor a much graver little person than lucy walter is too bad  it is only to save diggory the trouble of taking a crabstick to her when he returns from the wars said walter  heigh ho and he threw himself on the bench and drummed on the table  i wish i was there  i wonder what is doing at worcester this minute  when will brother edmund come asked charlie for about the hundredth time  when the battle is fought and the battle is won and king charles enjoys his own again  hurrah shouted walter jumping up and beginning to sing    for forty years our royal throne has been his fathers and his own   lucy joined in with    nor is there anyone but he with right can there a sharer be   how can you make such a noise said eleanor stopping her ears by which she provoked walter to go on roaring into them while he pulled down her hand    for who better may the right sceptre sway than he whose right it is to reign then look for no peace for the war will never cease till the king enjoys his own again   as he came to the last line rose returning exclaimed oh hush lucy  pray dont walter  ha  rose turned roundhead cried walter  you dont deserve to hear the good news from worcester  o what cried the girls eagerly  when it comes said walter delighted to have taken in rose herself but rose going up to him gently implored him to be quiet and listen to her  all this noisy rejoicing grieves our mother said she  if you could but have seen her yesterday evening when she heard your loyal songs  she sighed and said poor fellow how high his hopes are and then she talked of our father and that evening before the fight at naseby  walter looked grave and said i remember  my father lifted me on the table to drink king charless health and prince ruperti remember his scarlet mantle and white plumepatted my head and called me his little cavalier  we sat apart with mother said rose and heard the loud cheers and songs till we were half frightened at the noise  i cant recollect all that said lucy  at least you ought not to forget how our dear father came in with edmund and kissed us and bade mother keep up a good heart  dont you remember that lucy  i do said walter it was the last time we ever saw him  and walter sat on the table resting one foot on the bench while the other dangled down and leaning his elbow on his knee and his head on his hand rose sat on the bench close by him with charlie on her lap and the two little girls pressing close against her all earnest to hear from her the story of the great fight of naseby where they had all been in a farmhouse about a mile from the field of battle  i dont forget how the cannon roared all day said lucy  ah that dismal day said rose  then by came our troopers blood stained and disorderly riding so fast that scarcely one waited to tell my mother that the day was lost and she had better fly  but not a step did she stir from the gate where she stood with you charlie in her arms she only asked of each as he passed if he had seen my father or edmund and ever her cheek grew whiter and whiter  at last came a parliament officer on horsebackit was mr enderby who had been a college mate of my fathers and he told us that my dear father was wounded and had sent him to fetch her  but i never knew where edmund was then said eleanor  no one ever told me  edmund lifted up my father when he fell said walter and was trying to bind his wound but when colonel enderbys troop was close upon them my father charged him upon his duty to fly saying that he should fall into the hands of an old friend and it was edmunds duty to save himself to fight for the king another time  so edmund followed prince rupert said eleanor  yes said lucy you know my father once saved prince ruperts life in the skirmish where his horse was killed so for his sake the prince made edmund his page and has had him with him in all his voyages and wanderings  but go on about our father rose  did we go to see him  no mr enderby said he was too far off so he left a trooper to guard us and my mother only took her little babe with her  dont you remember walter how eleanor screamed after her as she rode away on the colonels horse and how we could not comfort the little ones till they had cried themselves to sleep poor little things and in the morning she came back and told us our dear father was dead  o walter how can we look back to that day and rejoice in a new war  how can you wonder her heart should sink at sounds of joy which have so often ended in tears  walter twisted about and muttered but he could not resist his sisters earnest face and tearful eyes and said something about not making so much noise in the house  theres my own dear brother said rose  and you wont tease deborah  that is too much rose  it is all the sport i have to see the faces she makes when i plague her about diggory  besides it serves her right for having such a temper  she has not a good temper poor thing said rose but if you would only think how true and honest she is how hard she toils and how ill she fares and yet how steadily she holds to us you would surely not plague and torment her  rose was interrupted by a great outcry and in rushed deborah screaming out lackaday  mistress rose  o master walter what will become of us  the fight is lost the king fled and a whole regiment of redcoats burning and plundering the whole country  our throats will be cut every one of them  youll have a chance of being a mark for all the musketeers in the parliament army said walter who even then could not miss a piece of mischief  joking now master walter cried deborah very much shocked  that is what i call downright sinful  i hope youll be made a mark of yourself that i do  the children were running off to tell their mother when rose stopped them and desired to know how deborah had heard the tidings  it was from two little children from the village who had come to bring a present of some pigeons to my lady  rose went herself to examine the children but she could only learn that a packman had come into the village and brought the report that the king had been defeated and had fled from the field  they knew no more and walter pronouncing it to be all a cockandbull story of some rascally prickeared pedlar declared he would go down to the village and enquire into the rights of it  these were the saddest times of english history when the wrong cause had been permitted for a time to triumph and the true and rightful side was persecuted and among those who endured affliction for the sake of their church and their king none suffered more or more patiently than lady woodley or as she was called in the old english fashion dame mary woodley of forest lea  when first the war broke out she was living happily in her pleasant home with her husband and children but when king charles raised his standard at nottingham all this comfort and happiness had to be given up  sir walter woodley joined the royal army and it soon became unsafe for his wife and children to remain at home so that they were forced to go about with him and suffer all the hardships of the sieges and battles  lady woodley was never strong and her health was very much hurt by all she went through she was almost always unwell and if rose though then quite a child had not shown care and sense beyond her years for the little ones it would be hard to say what would have become of them  yet all she endured while dragging about her little babies through the country with bad or insufficient food uncomfortable lodgings pain weariness and anxiety would have been as nothing but for the heavy sorrows that came upon her also  first she lost her only brother edmund mowbray and in the battle of naseby her husband was killed besides which there were the sorrows of the whole nation in seeing the king sold insulted misused and finally slain by his own subjects  after sir walters death lady woodley went home with her five younger children to her fathers house at forest lea for her husbands estate edmunds own inheritance had been seized and sequestrated by the rebels  she was the heiress of forest lea since the loss of her brother but the old mr mowbray her father had given almost all his wealth for the royal cause and had been oppressed by the exactions of the rebels so that he had nothing to leave his daughter but the desolate old house and a few bare acres of land  for the shelter however lady woodley was very thankful and there she lived with her children and a faithful servant deborah whose family had always served the mowbrays and who would not desert their daughter now  the neighbours in the village loved and were sorry for their lady and used to send her little presents there was a large garden in which diggory stokes who had also served her father raised vegetables for her use the cow wandered in the deserted park and so they contrived to find food while all the work of the house was done by rose and deborah  rose was her mothers great comfort nursing her cheering her taking care of the little ones teaching them working for them and making light of all her exertions  everyone in the village loved rose woodley for everyone had in some way been helped or cheered by her  her mother was only sometimes afraid she worked too hard and would try her strength too much but she was always bright and cheerful and when the days work was done no one was more gay and lively and ready for play with the little ones  rose had more trial than anyone knew with deborah  deborah was as faithful as possible and bore a great deal for the sake of her mistress worked hard day and night had little to eat and no wages yet lived on with them rather than forsake her dear lady and the children  one thing however deborah would not do and that was to learn to rule her tongue and her temper  she did not know nor do many excellent servants how much trial and discomfort she gave to those she loved so earnestly by her constant bursting out into hasty words whenever she was vexedher grumbling about whatever she disliked and her illjudged scolding of the children  servants in those days were allowed to speak more freely to their masters and mistresses than at present so that deborah had more opportunity of making such speeches and it was roses continual work to try to keep her temper from being fretted or lady woodley from being teased with her complaints  rose was very forbearing and but for this there would have been little peace in the house  walter was thirteen an age when it is not easy to keep boys in order unless they will do so for themselves  though a brave generous boy he was often unruly and inconsiderate apt not to obey and to do what he knew to be unkind or wrong just for the sake of present amusement  he was thus his mothers great anxiety for she knew that she was not fit either to teach or to restrain him and she feared that his present wild disobedient ways might hurt his character for ever and lead to dispositions which would in time swallow up all the good about him and make him what he would now tremble to think of  she used to talk of her anxieties to doctor bathurst the good old clergyman who had been driven away from his parish but used to come in secret to help teach and use his ministry for the faithful ones of his flock  he would tell her that while she did her best for her son she must trust the rest to his father above and she might do so hopefully since it had been in his own cause that the boy had been made fatherless  then he would speak to walter showing him how wrong and how cruel were his overbearing disobedient ways  walter was grieved and resolved to improve and become steadier that he might be a comfort and blessing to his mother but in his love of fun and mischief he was apt to forget himself and then drove away what might have been in time repentance and improvement by fancying he did no harm  teasing deborah served her right he would tell himself she was so illtempered and foolish diggory was a clod and would do nothing without scolding it was a good joke to tease charlie eleanor was a vexatious little thing and he would not be ordered by her so he went his own way and taught the merry chattering lucy to be very nearly as bad as himself neglected his duties set a bad example tormented a faithful servant and seriously distressed his mother  give him some great cause he thought and he would be the first and the best bring back the king protect his mother and sisters and perform glorious deeds such as would make his name be remembered for ever  then it would be seen what he was worth in the meantime he lived a dull life with nothing to do and he must have some fun  it did not signify if he was not particular about little things they were womens affairs and all very well for rose but when some really important matter came that would be his time for distinguishing himself  in the meantime charles ii had been invited to scotland and had brought with him as an attendant edmund woodley the eldest son as soon as he was known to have entered england some of the loyal gentlemen of the neighbourhood of forest lea went to join the king and among their followers went farmer ewins who had fought bravely in the former war under edmund mowbray several other of the men of the village and lastly diggory stokes lady woodleys serving man who had lately shown symptoms of discontent with his place and fancied that as a soldier he might fare better make his fortune and come home prosperously to marry his sweetheart deborah    chapter ii    walter ran down to the village at full speed  he first bent his steps towards the halfmoon the little publichouse where news was sure to be met with  as he came towards it however he heard the loud sound of a mans voice going steadily on as if with some discourse  some preachment said he to himself  theyve got a thoroughgoing roundhead i can hear his twang through his nose shall i go in or not  while he was asking himself this question an old peasant in a round frock came towards him  hollo will shouted walter what prickeared rogue have you got there  hush hush master walter said the old man taking off his hat very respectfully  best take care what you say there be plenty of redcoats about  theres one of them now preaching away in marvellous pied words  it is downright shocking to hear the bible hollaed out after that sort so i came away  dont you go nigh him sir specially with your hat set on in that  never mind my hat said walter impatiently it is no business of yours and ill wear it as i please in spite of old noll and all his crew  for his forefathers sake and for the love of his mother and sister the good village people bore with walters haughtiness and discourtesy far more than was good for him and the old man did not show how much he was hurt by his rough reception of his good advice walter was not reminded that he ought to rise up before the hoary head and reverence the old man and went on hastily but tell me will what do you hear of the battle  the battle sir why they say it is lost  thats what the fellow there is preaching about  and where was it  did you hear  dont you know  dont be so hasty dont ye sir said the old slowspoken man growing confused  where was it  at some townsome town they said but i dont know rightly the name of it  and the king  who was it  not cromwell  had lord derby joined cried walter hurrying on his questions so as to puzzle and confuse the old man more and more till at last he grew angry at getting no explanation and vowed it was no use to talk to such an old fool  at that moment a sound as of feet and horses came along the road  tis the soldiers said walter  ay sir best get out of sight  walter thought so too and springing over a hedge ran off into a neighbouring wood resolving to take a turn and come back by the longer way to the house so as to avoid the road  he walked across the wood looking up at the ripening nuts and now and then springing up to reach one telling himself all the time that it was untrue and that the king could not and should not be defeated  the wood grew less thick after a time and ended in low brushwood upon an open common  just as walter was coming to this place he saw an unusual sight  a man and a horse crossing the down  slowly and wearily they came the horse drooping its head and stumbling in its pace as though worn out with fatigue but he saw that it was a warhorse and the saddle and other equipments were such as he well remembered in the royal army long ago  the rider wore buff coat cuirass gauntlets guarded with steel sword and pistols and walters first impulse was to avoid him but on giving a second glance he changed his mind for though there was neither scarf plume nor any badge of party the long locks the set of the hat and the general air of the soldier were not those of a rebel  he must be a cavalier but alas far unlike the triumphant cavaliers whom walter had hoped to receive for he was covered with dust and blood as if he had fought and ridden hard  walter sprung forward to meet him and saw that he was a young man with dark eyes and hair looking very pale and exhausted and both he and his horse seemed hardly able to stir a step further  young sir said the stranger what place is this  am i near forest lea  a flash of joy crossed walter  edmund are you edmund he exclaimed colouring deeply and looking up in his face with one quick glance then casting down his eyes  and you are little walter returned the cavalier instantly dismounting and flinging his arm around his brother why what a fine fellow you are grown  how are my mother and all  well quite well cried walter in a transport of joy  oh how happy she will be  come make haste home  alas  i dare not as yet  i must not enter the house till nightfall or i should bring danger on you all  are there any troopers near  yes the village is full of the rascals  but what has happened  it is not true that  he could not bear to say the rest  too true said edmund leading his tired horse within the shelter of the bushes  it is all over with us  the battle lost said walter in a stifled tone and in all the bitterness of the first disappointment of his youth he turned away overcome by a gush of tears and sobs stamping as he walked up and down partly with the intensity of his grief partly with shame at being seen by his brother in tears  had you set your heart on it so much said edmund kindly pleased to see his young brother so ardent a loyalist  poor fellow  but at least the king was safe when i parted from him  come cheer up walter the right will be uppermost some day or other  but oh that battle  i had so longed to see old noll get his deserts said walter i made so sure  but how did it happen edmund  i cannot tell you all now walter  you must find me some covert where i can be till night fall  the rebels are hot in pursuit of all the fugitives  i have ridden from worcester by byroads day and night and i am fairly spent  i must be off to france or holland as soon as may be for my life is not safe a moment here  cromwell is bitterer than ever against all honest men but i could not help coming this way i so much longed to see my mother and all of you  you are not wounded said walter anxiously  nothing to speak of only a swordcut on my shoulder by which i have lost more blood than convenient for such a journey  here ill lead your horse lean on me said walter alarmed at the faint weary voice in which his brother spoke after the first excitement of the recognition  ill show you what lucy and i call our bower where no one ever comes but ourselves  there you can rest till night  and poor bayard said edmund  i think i could put him into the outhouse in the field next to the copse hide his trappings here and get him provender from ewinss farm  will that do  excellently  poor ewinsthat is a sad story  he fell fighting bravely by my side cut down in sidbury street in the last charge alas these are evil days  and diggory stokes our own knave  i know nothing of him after the first onset  rogues and cowards enough were there  think walter of seeing his majesty strive in vain to rally them when the day might yet have been saved and the traitors hung down their heads and stood like blocks while he called on them rather to shoot him dead than let him live to see such a day  oh had i but been there to turn them all to shame  there were a few walter lord cleveland hamilton careless giffard and a few more of us charged down sidbury street and broke into the ranks of the rebels while the king had time to make off by s martins gate  oh how i longed for a few more  but the king was saved so far careless giffard and i came up with him again and we parted at nightfall  lord derbys counsel was that he should seek shelter at boscobel and he was to disguise himself and go thither under giffards guidance  heaven guard him whatever becomes of us  amen said walter earnestly  and here we are  here is lucys bank of turf and my throne and here we will wait till the sun is down  it was a beautiful green slope covered with soft grass short thyme and cushionlike moss and overshadowed by a thick dark yewtree shut in by brushwood on all sides and forming just such a retreat as children love to call their own  edmund threw himself down at full length on it laid aside his hat and passed his hand across his weary forehead  how quiet said he but hark is that the bubbling of water he added raising himself eagerly  yes here said walter showing him where a little further off on the same slope a little clear spring rose in a natural basin of red earth fringed along the top with fresh green mosses  delicious said the tired soldier kneeling over the spring scooping it up in his hand to drink opening his collar and bathing hands and face in the clear cool fountain till his long black hair hung straight saturated with wet  now bayard it is your turn and he patted the good steed as it sucked up the refreshing water and walter proceeded to release it from saddle and bridle  edmund meanwhile stretched himself out on the mossy bank asked a few questions about his mother rose and the other children but was too tired to say much and presently fell sound asleep while walter sat by watching him grieving for the battle lost but proud and important in being the guardian of his brothers safety and delighting himself with the thought of bringing him home at night  more was happening at home than walter guessed  the time of his absence seemed very long more especially when the twilight began to close in and lady woodley began to fear that he might with his rashness have involved himself in some quarrel with the troopers in the village  lady woodley and her children had closed around the wood fire which had been lighted on the hearth at the approach of evening and rose was trying by the bad light to continue her darning of stockings when a loud hasty knocking was heard at the door and all in a general vague impression of dread started and drew together  oh my lady cried deborah dont bid me go to the door i could not if you offered me fifty gold caroluses  i had rather stand up to be a mark  then i will said rose advancing  no no mistress rose said deborah running forward  dont i know what is fit for the like of you  you go opening the door to rogues and vagabonds indeed and with these words she undrew the bolts and opened the door  is this the way you keep us waiting said an impatient voice and a tall youth handsomely accoutred advanced authoritatively into the room  prepare to but as he saw himself alone with women and children and his eyes fell on the pale face mourning dress and graceful air of the lady of the house he changed his tone removed his hat and said your pardon madam i came to ask a nights lodging for my father who has been thrown from his horse and badly bruised  i cannot refuse you sir said lady woodley who instantly perceived that this was an officer of the parliamentary force and was only thankful to see that he was a gentleman and enforced with courtesy a request which was in effect a command  the youth turned and went out while lady woodley hastily directed her daughters and servant  deborah set the blue chamber in order rose take the key of the oak press eleanor will help you to take out the holland sheets  lucy run down to old margery and bid her kill a couple of fowls for supper  as the girls obeyed there entered at the front door the young officer and a soldier supporting between them an elderly man in the dress of an officer of rank  lady woodley ready of course to give her help to any person who had suffered an injury came forward to set a chair and at the same moment she exclaimed in a tone of recognition mr enderby  i am grieved to see you so much hurt  my lady woodley he returned recognising her at the same time as he seated himself in the chair i am sorry thus to have broken in on your ladyship but my son sylvester would have me halt here  this gentleman is your son then and a courteous greeting passed between lady woodley and young sylvester enderby after which she again enquired after his fathers accident  no great matter was the reply a blow on the head and a twist of the knee that is all  thanks to a stumbling horse wearied out with work i have little mind tothe pursuit of this poor young man  not the king exclaimed lady woodley breathless with alarm  it was with no apparent satisfaction that the rebel colonel replied even so madam  cromwells fortune has not forsaken him he has driven the scots and their allies out of worcester  lady woodley was too much accustomed to evil tidings to be as much overcome by them as her young son had been she only turned somewhat paler and asked the king lives  he was last seen on worcester bridge  troops are sent to every port whence he might attempt an escape  may the god of his father protect him said the lady fervently and my son she added faintly scarcely daring to ask the question  safe i hope replied the colonel  i saw him and i could have thought him my dear old friend himself as he joined charles in his last desperate attempt to rally his forces and then charged down sidbury street with a few bold spirits who were resolved to cover their masters retreat  he is not among the slain he was not a prisoner when i left the headquarters  i trust he may have escaped for cromwell is fearfully incensed against your party  colonel enderby was interrupted by lucys running in calling out mother mother there are no fowls but partlet and the sitting hen and the old cock and i wont have my dear old partlet killed to be eaten by wicked roundheads  come here my little lady said the colonel holding out his hand amused by her vehemence  i wont speak to a roundhead returned lucy with a droll air of petulance pleased at being courted  her mother spoke gravely  you forget yourself lucy  this is mr enderby a friend of your dear father  lucys cheeks glowed and she looked down as she gave her hand to the colonel but as he spoke kindly to her her forward spirit revived and she returned to the charge  you wont have partlet killed  her mother would have silenced her but the colonel smiled and said no no little lady i would rather go without supper than let one feather of dame partlet be touched  nay you need not do that either sir said the little chatterbox confidentially for we are to have a pie made of little jennys pigeons and ill tell you what sir no one makes raised crust half so well as sister rose  lady woodley was not sorry to stop the current of her little girls communications by despatching her on another message and asking colonel enderby whether he would not prefer taking a little rest in his room before suppertime offering at the same time all the remedies for bruises and wounds that every good housekeeper of the time was sure to possess  she had a real regard for mr enderby who had been a great friend of her husband before the unhappy divisions of the period arrayed them on opposite sides and even then though true friendship could not last a kindly feeling had always existed  mr enderby was a conscientious man but those were difficult times and he had regarded loyalty to the king less than what he considered the rights of the people  he had been an admirer of hampden and his principles and had taken up arms on the same side becoming a rebel on political not on religious grounds  when as time went on the evils of the rebellion developed themselves more fully he was already high in command and so involved with his own party that he had not the resolution requisite for a change of course and renunciation of his associates  he would willingly have come to terms with the king and was earnest in the attempt at the time of the conferences at hampden court  he strongly disapproved of the usurpation of power by the army and was struck with horror grief and dismay at the execution of king charles but still he would not or fancied that he could not separate himself from the cause of the parliament and continued in their service following cromwell to scotland and fighting at worcester on the rebel side disliking cromwell all the time and with a certain inclination to the young king and desire to see the old constitution restored  he was just one of those men who cause such great evil by giving a sort of respectability to the wrong cause following a multitude to do evil and doubtless bringing a fearful responsibility on their own heads yet with many good qualities and excellent principles that make those on the right side have a certain esteem for them and grieve to see them thus perverted  lady woodley who knew him well though sorry to have a rebel in her house at such a time was sure that in him she had a kind and considerate guest who would do his utmost to protect her and her children  on his side colonel enderby was much grieved and shocked at the pale altered looks of the fair young bride he remembered as well as the evidences of poverty throughout her house and perhaps he had a secret wish that he was as well assured as his friend sir walter that his blood had been shed for the maintenance of the right    chapter iii    rose woodley ran up and down indefatigably preparing everything for the accommodation of the guests smoothing down deborahs petulance and keeping her mother from overexertion or anxiety  much contrivance was indeed required for besides the colonel and his son two soldiers had to be lodged and four horses which to the consternation of old margery seemed likely to devour the cows winter store of hay while the troopers grumbled at the desolate halfruined empty stables and at the want of corn  rose had to look to everything to provide blankets from the bed of the two little girls send eleanor to sleep with her mother and take lucy to her own room despatch them on messages to the nearest cottage to borrow some eggs and to gather vegetables in the garden whilst she herself made the pigeon pie with the standing crust much wishing that the soldiers were out of the way  it was a pretty thing to see her in her white apron with her neat dexterous fingers and nimble quiet step doing everything in so short a time and so well without the least bustle  she was at length in the hall laying the white homespun home bleached cloth and setting the trenchers all the mowbray plate had long ago gone in the kings service wondering anxiously meantime what could have become of walter with many secret and painful misgivings though she had been striving to persuade her mother that he was only absent on some freak of his own  presently the door which led to the garden was opened and to her great joy walter put his head into the room  o walter she exclaimed the battle is lost but edmund and the king have both escaped  say you so said walter smiling  here is a gentleman who can give you some news of edmund  at the same moment rose saw her beloved eldest brother enter the room  it would be hard to say which was her first thought joy or dismayshe had no time to ask herself  quick as lightning she darted to the door leading to the staircase bolted it threw the bar across the fastening of the front entrance and then flying to her brother clung fast round his neck kissed him on each cheek and felt his ardent kiss on her brow as she exclaimed in a frightened whisper you must not stay here  there are troopers in the house  troopersquartered on us cried walter  rose hastily explained trembling lest anyone should attempt to enter  walter paced up and down in despair vowing that it was a trick to get a spy into the house  edmund sat down in the large arm chair with a calm resolute look saying i must surrender then neither i nor my horse can go further without rest  i will yield as a prisoner of war and well that it is to a man of honour  oh no no cried rose  he says cromwell treats his prisoners as rebels  it would be certain death  what news of the king asked edmund anxiously  not seen since the flight but  and lord derby wilmot  i cannot tell i heard no names said rose only that the enemys cruelties are worse than ever  walter stood with his back against the table gazing at his brother and sister in mute consternation  i know cried rose suddenly  the outhouse in the upper field no one ever goes up into the loft but ourselves  you know walter where eleanor found the kittens  go thither i will bring edmund food at night  oh consent edmund  it will do it will do cried walter  very well it may spare my mother said edmund and as footsteps and voices were heard on the stairs the two brothers hurried off without another word while rose trying to conceal her agitation undid the door and admitted her two little sisters who were asking if they had not heard walters voice  she scarcely attended to them but bounding upstairs to her mothers room flung her arms round her neck and poured into her ear her precious secret  the tremour the joy the fears the tears the throbbings of the heart and earnest prayers may well be imagined crowded by the mother and daughter into those few minutes  the plan was quickly arranged  they feared to trust even deborah so that the only way that they could provide the food that edmund so much needed was by rose and walter attempting to save all they could at supper and rose could steal out when everyone was gone to rest and carry it to him  lady woodley was bent on herself going to her son that night but rose prevailed on her to lay aside the intention as it would have been fatal in her weak state of health for her to expose herself to the chills of an autumn night and what was with her a much more conclusive reason rose was much more likely to be able to slip out unobserved  rose had an opportunity of explaining all this to walter and imploring him to be cautious before the colonel and his son came down and the whole party assembled round the supper table  lady woodley had the eggs and bacon before her walter insisted on undertaking the carving of the pigeonpie and looked considerably affronted when young sylvester enderby offered to take the office as a more experienced carver  poor rose how her heart beat at every word and look and how hard she strove to seem perfectly at her ease and unconscious  walter was in a fume of anxiety and vexation and could hardly control himself so far as to speak civilly to either of the guests so that he was no less a cause of fear to his mother and sister than the children who were unconscious how much depended on discretion  young sylvester enderby was a fine young man of eighteen very good natured and not at all like a puritan in appearance or manner  he had hardly yet begun to think for himself and was merely obeying his father in joining the army with him without questioning whether it was the right cause or not  he was a kind elder brother at home and here he was ready to be pleased with the children of the house  lucy was a highspirited talkative child very little used to seeing strangers and perhaps hardly reined in enough for her poor mothers weak health had interfered with strict discipline and as this evening walter and rose were both grave and serious under their anxieties lucy was less restrained even than usual  she was a pretty creature with bright blue eyes and an arch expression all the droller under her prim round cap and sylvester was a good deal amused with her pert bold little nods and airs  he paid a good deal of attention to her and she in return grew more forward and chattering  it is what little girls will sometimes do under the pleasure and excitement of the notice of gentlemen and it makes their friends very uneasy since the only excuse they can have is in being very little and it shows a most undesirable want of selfcommand and love of attention  in addition to this feeling lady woodley dreaded every word that was spoken lest it should lead to suspicion for though she was sure mr enderby would not willingly apprehend her son yet she could not tell what he might consider his duty to his employers besides there were the two soldiers to observe and report and the discovery that edmund was at hand might lead to frightful consequences  she tried to converse composedly with him on his family and the old neighbourhood where they had both lived often interrupting herself to send a look or word of warning to the lower end of the table but lucy and charles were too wild to see or heed her and grew more and more unrestrained till at last to the dismay of her mother brother and sister charles voice was heard so loud as to attract everyones notice in a shout of wonder and complaint mother mother look rose has gobbled up a whole pigeon to her own share  rose could not keep herself from blushing violently as she whispered reprovingly that he must not be rude  lucy did not mend the matter by saying with an impertinent nod rose does not like to be found out  children said lady woodley gravely i shall send you away if you do not behave discreetly  but mother rose is greedy said lucy  hold your tongues little mischief makers burst out walter who had been boiling over with anxiety and indignation the whole time  walter is cross now said lucy pleased to have produced a sensation and to have shocked eleanor who sat all the time as good demure and grave as if she had been forty years old  pray excuse these children said lady woodley trying to hide her anxiety under cover of displeasure at them no doubt mrs enderby keeps much better order at home  lucy charles silence at once walter is there no wine  if there is it is too good for rebels muttered walter to himself as he rose  light me deborah and ill see  la  master walter whispered deborah you know there is nothing but the dregs of the old cask of malmsey that was drunk up at the old squires burying  hush hush deb returned the boy fill it up with water and it will be quite good enough for those who wont drink the kings health  deborah gave a halfpuzzled smile  yere a madcap master walter but sure sir the spirit of a wolf must have possessed mistress roseshe that eats no supper at all in general  dye think it is wearying about master edmund that gives her a craving  it might be dangerous but walter was so much diverted that he could not help saying i have no doubt it is on his account  i know said deborah that i get so faint at heart that i am forced to be taking something all day long to keep about at all  by this time they were reentering the hall when there was a sound from the kitchen as of someone calling  deborah instantly turned screaming out joyfully bless me is it you and though out of sight her voice was still heard in its high notes of joy  you goodfornothing rogue are you turned up again like a bad tester staring into the kitchen like a great oaf as you be  there was a general laugh and eleanor said that must be diggory  a poor country clown said lady woodley whom we sent to join my sons troop  i hope he is in no danger  oh no said mr enderby he has only to return to his plough  hollo there shouted walter  come in diggory and show yourself  in came diggory an awkward thickset fellow with a shock head of hair high leathern gaiters and a buff belt over his rough leathern jerkin  there he stood pulling his forelock and looking sheepish  come in diggory said his mistress i am glad to see you safe you need not be afraid of these gentlemen  where are the rest  slain every man of them ant please your ladyship  and your master mr woodley  down too ant please your ladyship  lucy screamed aloud eleanor ran to her mother and hid her face in her lap charles sat staring with great round frightened eyes  very distressing it was to be obliged to leave the poor children in such grief and alarm when it was plain all the time that diggory was an arrant coward who had fancied more deaths and dangers than were real and was describing more than he had even thought he beheld in order to make himself into a hero instead of a runaway  moreover lady woodley and rose had to put on a show of grief lest they should betray that they were better informed and they were in agonies lest walters fury at the falsehoods should be as apparent to their guests as it was to themselves  are you sure of what you say diggory said lady woodley  sure as that i stand here my lady  there was sword and shot and smoke all round  i stood it all till farmer ewins was cut down a oneside of me maam and master edmund mores the pity with his brains scattered here and there on the banks of the river  there was another cry among the children and walter made such a violent gesture that rose covering her face with her handkerchief whispered to him walter dear take care  walter relieved his mind by returning oh that i could cudgel the rogue soundly  at the same time colonel enderby turned to their mother saying take comfort madam this fellows tale carries discredit on the face of it  let me examine him with your permission  where did you last see your master  i know none of your places sir answered diggory sullenly  colonel enderby spoke sternly and peremptorily  in the town or in the fields  answer me that sirrah  in the field on the bank of the river  ay  there you left your ranks you rogue that was the way you lost sight of your master said the colonel  then turning to lady woodley as diggory slunk off your ladyship need not be alarmed an hour after the encounter in which he pretends to have seen your son slain i saw him in full health and soundness  a cowardly villain cried walter delighted to let out some of his indignation  i knew he was not speaking a word of truth  the children cheered up in a moment but lady woodley was not sorry to make this agitating scene an excuse for retiring with all her children  lucy and eleanor were quite comforted and convinced that edmund must be safe but poor little charlie had been so dreadfully frightened by the horrors of diggorys description that after rose had put him to bed he kept on starting up in his sleep half waking and sobbing about brother edmunds brains  rose was obliged to go to him and soothe him  she longed to assure the poor little fellow that dear edmund was perfectly safe well and near at hand but the secret was too important to be trusted to one so young so she could only coax and comfort him and tell him they all thought it was not true and edmund would come back again  sister said charlie may i say my prayers again for him  yes do dear charlie said rose and say a prayer for king charles too that he may be safe from the wicked man  so little charlie knelt by rose with his hands joined and his little bare legs folded together and said his prayer  and did not his sisters heart go with him  then she kissed him covered him up warmly and repeated to him in her soft voice the ninetyfirst psalm whoso dwelleth under the defence of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty  by the time it was ended the little boy was fast asleep and the faithful loyal girl felt her failing heart cheered and strengthened for whatever might be before her sure that she her mother her brother and her king were under the shadow of the almighty wings    chapter iv    in a very strong fit of restlessness did little mistress lucy woodley go to bed in roses room that night  she was quite comforted on edmunds account for she had discernment enough to see that her mother and sister did not believe diggorys dreadful narration and she had been so unsettled and excited by mr sylvester enderbys notice and by the way in which she had allowed her high spirits to get the better of her discretion as well as by the sudden change from terror to joy that when first she went to roses room she could not attend to her prayers and next she could not go to sleep  perhaps the being in a different apartment from usual and the missing her accustomed sleeping companion eleanor had something to do with it for little eleanor had a gravity and steadiness about her that was very apt to compose and quiet her in her idlest moods  to night she lay broad awake tumbling about on the very hard mattress stuffed with chaff wondering how rose could bear to sleep on it trying to guess how there could be room for both when her sister came to bed and nevertheless in a great fidget for her to come  she listened to the howling and moaning of the wind the creaking of the doors and the rattling of the boards with which rose had stopped up the broken panes of her lattice she rolled from side to side fancied odd shapes in the dark and grew so restless and anxious for roses coming that she was just ready to jump out of bed and go in the passage to call her when rose came into the room  o rose what a time you have been  it was no satisfaction to rose to find the curious little chatterbox so wide awake at this very inconvenient time but she did not lose her patience and answered that she had been first with charlie and then with their mother  and now i hope you are coming to bed  i cant go to sleep without you  oh but indeed you must lucy dear for i shall not be ready this long time  look here is a great rent in walters coat which i must mend or he wont be fit to be seen tomorrow  what shall we have for dinner tomorrow rose  what made you eat so much supper tonight  ill tell you what lucy i am not going to talk to you or you will lie awake all night and that will be very bad for you  i shall put my candle out of your sight and say some psalms but i cannot talk  so rose began and wakeful as lucy was she found the low sweet tones lulled her a little  but she did not like this she had a perverse intention of staying awake till rose got into bed so instead of attending to the holy words she pinched herself and pulled herself and kept her eyes staring open gazing at the flickering shadows cast by the dim homemade rush candle  she went to sleep for a moment then started into wakefulness again rose had ceased to repeat her psalms aloud but was still at her needlework another doze another waking  there was some hope of rose now for she was kneeling down to say her prayers  lucy thought they lasted very long and at her next waking she was just in time to hear the latch of the door closing and find herself left in darkness  rose was not in bed did not answer when she called  oh she must be gone to take walters coat back to his room  but surely she might have done that in one moment and how long she was staying lucy could bear it no longer or rather she did not try to bear it for she was an impetuous selfwilled child without much control over herself  she jumped out of bed and stole to the door  a light was just disappearing on the ceiling as if someone was carrying a candle down stairs what could it mean  lucy scampered pitpat with her bare feet along the passage and came to the top of the stairs in time to peep over and discover rose silently opening the door of the hall a large dark cloak hung over her arm and her head and neck covered by her black silk hood and a thick woollen kerchief as if she was going out  lucys curiosity knew no bounds  she would not call for fear she should be sent back to bed but she was determined to see what her sister could possibly be about  down the cold stone steps pattered she and luckily as she thought rose probably to avoid noise had only shut to the door so that the little inquisitive maiden had a chink to peep through and beheld rose at a certain oaken corner cupboard whence she took out a napkin and in it she folded what lucy recognised as the very same threecornered segment of piecrust containing the pigeon that she had last night been accused of devouring  she placed it in a basket and then proceeded to take a lantern from the cupboard put in her rushlight and thus prepared advanced to the gardendoor softly opened it and disappeared  lucy in an extremity of amazement came forward  the wind howled in moaning gusts and the rain dashed against the windows lucy was chilly and frightened  the fire was not out and gave a dim light and she crept towards the window but a sudden terror came over her she dashed back looked again heard another gust of wind fell into another panic rushed back to the stairs and never stopped till she had tumbled into bed her teeth chattering shivering from head to foot with fright and cold rolled herself up tight in the bed clothes and after suffering excessively from terror and chill fell sound asleep without seeing her sister return  causeless fears pursue those who are not in the right path and turn from what alone can give them confidence  a sense of protection supports those who walk in innocence though their way may seem surrounded with perils and thus while lucy trembled in an agony of fright in her warm bed rose walked forth with a firm and fearless step through the dark gusty night heedless of the rain that pattered round her and the wild wind that snatched at her cloak and gown and flapped her hood into her eyes  she was not afraid of fancied terrors and real perils and anxieties were at this moment lost in the bounding of her young heart at the thought of seeing touching speaking to her brother her dear edmund  she had been eleven years old when they last had parted the morning of the battle of naseby and he was five years older but they had always been very happy and fond companions and playfellows as long as she could remember and she alone had been on anything like an equality with him or missed him with a feeling of personal loss that had been increased by the death of her elder sister mary  quickly and concealing her light as much as possible she walked down the damp ashstrewn paths of the kitchengarden and came out into the overgrown and neglected shrubbery or pleasance where the long wetladen shoots came beating in her face and now and then seeming to hold her back and strange rustlings were heard that would have frightened a maiden of a less stout and earnest heart  her anxiety was lest she should be confused by the unwonted aspect of things in the dark and miss the path and very very long did it seem while her light would only show her leaves glistening with wet at last she gained a clearer space the border of a field  something dark rose before her she knew the outline of the shed and entered the lower part  it was meant for a cartshed with a loft above for hay or straw but the cart had been lost or broken and there was only a heap of rubbish in the corner by which the children were wont to climb up to inspect their kittens  here rose was for a moment startled by a glare close to her of what looked like two fiery lamps in the darkness but the next instant a long low growling sound explained it and the tabby stripes of the cat quickly darted across her lanterns range of light  she heard a slight rustling above and ventured to call in a low whisper edmund  is that you walter and as rose proceeded to mount the pile of rubbish his pale and haggard face looked down at her  what  rose herself  i did not think you would have come on such a night as this  can you come up  shall i help you  thank you  take the lantern firsttake care  there  now the basket and the cloak  and this done with edmunds hand rose scrambled up into the loft  it was only the height of the roof and there was not room even in the middle to stand upright the rain soaked through the old thatch the floor was of rough boards and there was but very little of the hay that had served as a bed for the kittens  o edmund this is a wretched place exclaimed rose as crouching by his side one hand in his and the other round his neck she gazed around  better than a prison he answered  i only wish i knew that others were in as good a one  and youwhy rose how you are altered you are my young lady now  and how does my dear mother  pretty well  i could hardly prevail on her not to come here to night but it would have been too much she is so weak and takes cold so soon  but edmund how pale you are how weary  have you slept  i fear not on these hard boardsyour wound too  it hardly deserves such a dignified name as a wound said edmund i am more hungry than aught else i could have slept but for hunger and nowas he spoke he was opening the basketi shall be lodged better i fear than a king with that famous cloak  what a notable piece of pasty  well done rose  are you housewife  store of candles too  this is noble  how hungry you must be  how long is it since you have eaten  grey sent his servant into a village to buy some bread and cheese we divided it when we parted and it lasted me until this morning since then i have fasted  dear brother i wish i could do more for you but till mr enderby goes i cannot for the soldiers are about the kitchen and our maid deborah talks too much to be trustworthy though she is thoroughly faithful  this is excellent fare said edmund eating with great relish and now tell me of yourselves  my mother is feeble and unwell you say  never strong but tolerably well at present  so walter said  by the way walter is a fine spirited fellow  i should like to have him with me if we take another african voyage  he would like nothing better poor fellow  but what strange things you have seen and done since we met  how little we thought that morning that it would be six years before we should sit side by side again  and prince rupert is kind to you  he treats me like a son or brother  never was man kinder said edmund warmly  but the children  i must see them before i depart little lucy is she as bold and pert as she was as a young child  little changed said rose smiling and telling her brother the adventures at the dinner  as cheerfully as might be they talked till edmund had finished his meal and then rose begged him to let her examine and bind up the wound  it was a swordcut on the right shoulder and though not very deep had become stiff and painful from neglect and had soaked his sleeve deeply with blood  roses dexterous fingers applied the salve and linen she had brought and she promised that at her next visit she would bring him some clean clothes which was what he said he most wished for  then she arranged the large horsemans cloak the hay and his own mantle so well as to form he said the most luxurious resting place he had seen since he left dunbar and rolled up in this he lay his head supported on his hand talking earnestly with her on the measures next to be taken for his safety and on the state of the family  he must be hidden there till the chase was a little slackened and then escape by bosham or some other port to the royal fleet which was hovering on the coast  money however how was he to get a passage without it  the prince at partingheaven knows he has little enough himself gave me twenty gold crowns which he said was my share of prizemoney for our captures said edmund but this is the last of them  and i dont know how we can get any said rose  we never see money  our tenants if they pay at all pay in kinda side of bacon or a sack of corn they are very good poor people and love our mother heartily i do believe  i wish i knew what was to be done  time will show said edmund  i have been in as bad a case as this ere now and it is something to be near you all again  so you like this place do you  as well as our own home  rose shook her head and tears sprang into her eyes  oh no edmund i try to think it home and the children feel it so but it is not like woodley  do you remember the dear old oaktree with the branches that came down so low where you used to swing mary and me  and the high branch where i used to watch for my father coming home from the justicemeeting  and the meadow where the hounds killed the fox that had baffled them so long  do you hear anything of the place now rose  mr enderby told us something said rose sadly  you know who has got it edmund  who  that master priggins who was once justices clerk  ha cried edmund  that pettifogging scrivener in my fathers housein my ancestors house  a rogue that ought to have been branded a dozen years ago  i could have stood anything but that pretty work he is making there i suppose  go on rose  o edmund you know it is but what the king himself has to bear  neighbours fare as you say replied edmund with a short dry laugh  poverty and wandering i could bear peril is what any brave man naturally seeks the acres that have been ours for centuries could not go in a better cause but to hear of a rascal such as that in my fathers place is enough to drive one mad with rage  come what has he been doing  how has he used the poor people  he turned out old davy and madge at once from keeping the house but mr enderby took them in and gave them a cottage  i wonder what unlucky fate possessed that enderby to take the wrong side  well  he could not tell us much of the place for he cannot endure master priggins and master sylvester laughs at his puritanical manner but he sayso edmundthat the fishponds are filled upthose dear old fishponds where the waterlilies used to blow and you once pulled me out of the water  ay ay we shall not know it again if ever our turn comes and we enjoy our own again  but it is of no use to think about such matters  no we must be thankful that we have a home at all and are not like so many who are actually come to beggary like poor mrs forde  you remember her our old clergymans widow  he died on board ship and she was sent for by her cousin who promised her a home but she had no money and was forced to walk all the way with her two little boys getting a lodging at night from any loyal family who would shelter her for the love of heaven  my mother wept when she saw how sadly she was changed we kept her with us a week to rest her and when she went she had our last gold carolus little guessing poor soul that it was our last  then when she was gone my mother called us all round her and gave thanks that she could still give us shelter and daily bread  there is a judge above exclaimed edmund yet sometimes it is hard to believe when we see such a state of things here below  dr bathurst tells us to think it will all be right in the other world even if we do have to see the evil prosper here said rose gravely  the sufferings will all turn to glory just as they did with our blessed king out of sight  edmund sat thoughtful  if our people abroad would but hope and trust and bear as you do here rose  but i had best not talk of these things only your patience makes me feel how deficient in it we are who have not a tithe to bear of what you have at home  are you moving to go  must you  i fear so dear brother the light seems to be beginning to dawn and if lucy wakes and misses meis your shoulder comfortable  i was never more comfortable in my life  my loving duty to my dear mother  farewell you sweet rose  farewell dear edmund  perhaps walter may manage to visit you but do not reckon on it    chapter v    the vigils of the night had been as unwonted for lucy as for her sister and she slept soundly till rose was already up and dressed her first reflection was on the strange sights she had seen followed by a doubt whether they were real or only a dream but she was certain it was no such thing she recollected too well the chill of the stone to her feet and the sound of the blasts of wind  she wondered over it wished to make out the cause but decided that she should only be scolded for peeping and she had better keep her own counsel  that lucy should keep silence when she thought she knew more than other people was however by no means to be expected and though she would say not a word to her mother or rose of whom she was afraid she was quite ready to make the most of her knowledge with eleanor  when she came down stairs she found walter with his elbows on the table and his book before him learning the task which his mother required of him every day eleanor had just come in with her lapfull of the still lingering flowers and called her to help to make them up into nosegays  lucy came and sat down by her on the floor but paid little attention to the flowers so intent was she on showing her knowledge  ah you dont know what i have seen  i dare say it is only some nonsense said eleanor gravely for she was rather apt to plume herself on being steadier than her elder sister  it is no nonsense said lucy  i know what i know  before eleanor had time to answer this speech the mystery of which was enhanced by a knowing little nod of the head young mr enderby made his appearance in the hall with a civil goodmorning to walter which the boy hardly deigned to acknowledge by a gruff reply and little nod and then going on to the little girls renewed with them yesterdays war of words  weaving posies little ladies  not for rebels replied lucy pertly  may i not have one poor daisy  not one the daisy is a royal flower  if i take one  rebels take what they cant get fairly said lucy with the smartness of a forward child and sylvester laughing heartily continued what would general cromwell say to such a nest of little malignants  that is an ugly name said eleanor  quite as pretty as roundhead  yes but we dont deserve it  not when you make that pretty face so sour  ah interposed lucy she is sour because i wont tell her my secret of the pie  oh what said eleanor  now i have you cried lucy delighted  i know what became of the pigeon pie  in extreme alarm and anger walter turned round as he caught these words  lucy naughty child he began in a voice of thunder then recollecting the danger of exciting further suspicion he stammered whatwhatwhatare you doing here  go along to mother  lucy rubbed her fingers into her eyes and answered sharply in a pettish tone that she was doing no harm  eleanor in amazement asked what could be the matter  intolerable exclaimed walter  so many girls always in the way  sylvester enderby could not help smiling as he asked is that all you have to complain of  i could complain of something much worse muttered walter  get away lucy  i wont at your bidding sir  to walters great relief rose entered at that moment and all was smooth and quiet lucy became silent and the conversation was kept up in safe terms between rose and the young officer  the colonel it appeared was so much better that he intended to leave forest lea that very day and it was not long before he came down and presently afterwards lady woodley looking very pale and exhausted for her anxieties had kept her awake all night  after a breakfast on bread cheese rashers of bacon and beer the horses were brought to the door and the colonel took his leave of lady woodley thanking her much for her hospitality  i wish it had been better worth accepting said she  i wish it had though not for my own sake said the colonel  i wish you would allow me to attempt something in your favour  one thing perhaps you will deign to accept  every royalist house especially those belonging to persons engaged at worcester is liable to be searched and to have soldiers quartered on them to prevent fugitives from being harboured there  i will send sylvester at once to obtain a protection for you which may prevent you from being thus disturbed  that will be a kindness indeed said lady woodley hardly able to restrain the eagerness with which she heard the offer made that gave the best hope of saving her son  she was not certain that the colonel had not some suspicion of the true state of the case and would not take notice unwilling to ruin the son of his friend and at the same time reluctant to fail in his duty to his employers  he soon departed mistress lucys farewell to sylvester being thus goodbye mr roundhead rebel cropeared traitor  at which sylvester and his father turned and laughed and their two soldiers looked very much astonished  lady woodley called lucy at once and spoke to her seriously on her forwardness and impertinence  i could tell you lucy that it is not like a young lady but i must tell you more it is not like a young christian maiden  do you remember the text that i gave you to learn a little while agothe ornament fit for a woman  lucy hung her head and with tears filling her eyes as her mother prompted her continually repeated the text in a low mumbling voice half crying  whose adorning let it not be the putting on of gold or the plaiting of hair or the putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price  and does my little lucy think she showed that ornament when she pushed herself forward to talk idle nonsense and make herself be looked at and taken notice of  lucy put her finger in her mouth she did not like to be scolded as she called it gentle as her mother was and she would not open her mind to take in the kind reproof  lady woodley took the old blackcovered bible and finding two of the verses in s james about the government of the tongue desired lucy to learn them by heart before she went out of the house and the little girl sat down with them in the windowseat in a cross impatient mood very unfit for learning those sacred words  she had done no harm she thought she could not help it if the young gentleman would talk to her  so there she sat with the bible in her lap alone for lady woodley was so harassed and unwell in consequence of her anxieties that rose had persuaded her to go and lie down on her bed since it would be better for her not to try to see edmund till the promised protection had arrived lest suspicion should be excited  rose was busy about her household affairs eleanor a handy little person was helping her and walter and charles were gone out to gather apples for a pudding which she had promised them  lucy much wished to be with them and after a long brooding over her illtemper it began to wear out not to be conquered but to depart of itself she thought she might as well learn her lesson and have done with it so by way of getting rid of the task not of profiting by the warning it conveyed she hurried through the two verses ending withbehold how great a matter a little fire kindleth  as soon as she could say them perfectly she raced upstairs and into her mothers room gave her the book and repeated them at her fastest pace  poor lady woodley was too weary and languid to exert herself to speak to the little girl about her unsuitable manner or to try to bring the lesson home to her she dismissed her only saying i hope my dear you will remember this and away ran lucy first to the orchard in search of her brothers and not finding them there round and round the garden and pleasance  edmund in his hidingplace heard the voice calling walter  charlie and peeping out caught a glimpse of a little figure her long frock tucked over her arm and long locks of dark hair blowing out from under her small round white cap  what a pleasure it was to him to have that one view of his little sister  at last tired with her search lucy returned to the house and there found deborah ironing at the long table in the hall and crooning away her one dismal song of barbara allens cruelty  so you can sing again deb she began now the roundheads are gone and diggory come back  little girls should not meddle with what does not concern them answered deborah  you need not call me a little girl said lucy  i am almost eleven years old and i know a secret a real secret  a secret mistress lucy  who would tell their secrets to the like of you said deborah contemptuously  no one told me i found it out for myself cried lucy in high exultation  i know what became of the pigeon pie that we thought rose ate up  eh  mistress lucy exclaimed deborah pausing in her ironing full of curiosity  lucy was delighted to detail the whole of what she had observed  well cried deborah if ever i heard tell the like  that slip of a thing out in all the blackness of the night  i should be afraid of my life of the ghosts and hobgoblins  oh  i had rather be set up for a mark for all the musketeers in the parliament army than set one foot out of doors after dark  as deborah spoke walter came into the hall  he saw that lucy had observed something and was anxious every time she opened her lips this made him rough and sharp with her and he instantly exclaimed how now lucy still gossipping  you are so cross i cant speak a word for you said lucy fretfully walking out of the room while walter in his usual imperious way began to shout for diggory and his boots  diggory knave  anon sir answered the dogged voice  bring them i say you laggard  coming sir coming  coming are you you snail cried walter impatiently  your heels are tardier now than they were at worcester  a man cant do more nor he can do sir said diggory sullenly as he plodded into the hall  answering again lubber said walter  is this what you call cleaned  you are not fit for your own shoeblacking trade  get along with you and he threw the boots at diggory in a passion  i must wear them though as they are or wait all day  bring them to me again  walter had some idle notion in his head that it was puritanical to speak courteously to servants and despising diggory for his cowardice and stupidity he was especially overbearing with him and went on rating him all the time he was putting on his boots to go out and try to catch some fish for the morrows dinner which was likely to be but scanty  as soon as he was gone diggory who had listened in sulky silence began to utter his complaints  chickenheart mooncalf awkward lubber those be the best words a poor fellow gets  i can tell master walter that these are no times for gentlefolks to be hectoring especially when they havent a penny to pay wages with  you learnt that in the wars diggory said deborah turning round for grumble as she might herself she could not bear to have a word said by anyone else against her ladys family and loved to scold her sweetheart diggory  never mind master walter  if he has not a penny in his pocket and the very green coat to his back is cut out of his grandmothers farthingale mores the pity  how should he show he is a gentleman but by hectoring a bit now and then specially to such a rogue as thou coming back when thy betters are lost  that is always the way as i found when i lost my real silver crown and kept my trumpery parliament bit  ah deb pleaded diggory thou knowst not what danger is  i thought thou wouldst never have set eyes on poor diggory again  much harm would that have been retorted mrs deb tossing her head  dye think id have broke my heart  that ill never do for a runaway  twas time to run when poor farmer ewins was cut down holloaing for quarter and master edmunds brains lying strewn about on the ground for all the world like a calfs  tis your own brains be like a calfs said deborah  id bargain to eat all of master edmunds brains you ever saw  hes as dead as a red herring  i say he is as lifelike as you or i  i say i saw him stretched out covered with blood and a swordcut on his head big enough to be the death of twenty men  didnt that colonel man as they call him see him alive and merry long after  its my belief that master edmund is not a dozen miles off  master edmund hey deb  ill never believe that after what ive seen at worcester  then pray why does mistress rose save a whole pigeon out of the pie hide it in her lap and steal out of the house with it at midnight either master edmund is in hiding or some other poor gentleman from the wars and i verily believe it is master edmund himself so a fig for his brains or yours and theres for you for a falsetongued runaway  coming mistress coming and away ran deborah at a call from rose  now deborah was faithful to the backbone and would have given all she had in the world almost her life itself for her lady and the children she was a good and honest woman in the main but tongue and temper were two things that she had never learnt to restrain and she had given her love to the first person by whom it was sought without consideration whether he was worthy of affection or not  that diggory was a sullen illconditioned selfish fellow was evident to everyone else but he had paid court to deborah and therefore the foolish woman had allowed herself to be taken with him see perfections in him promise to become his wife and confide in him  when deborah left the hall diggory returned to his former employment of chopping wood and began to consider very intently for him  he had really believed at the moment of his panicterror that he saw edmund woodley fall and had at once taken flight without attempting to afford him any assistance  the story of the brains had of course been invented on the spur of the moment by way of excusing his flight and he was obliged to persist in the falsehood he had once uttered though he was not by any means certain that it had been his master whom he saw killed especially after hearing colonel enderbys testimony  and now there came alluringly before him the promise of the reward offered for the discovery of the fugitive cavaliers the idea of being able to rent and stock poor ewinss farm and setting up there with deborah  it was money easily come by he thought and he would like to be revenged on master walter and show him that the lubber and mooncalf could do some harm after all  a relenting came across him as he thought of his lady and mistress rose though he had no personal regard for edmund who had never lived at forest lea and his stolid mind was too much enclosed in selfishness to admit much feeling for anyone  besides it might not be master edmund he was probably killed it might be one of the lords in the battle or even the king himself and that would be worth 1000 pounds  master cantwell called them all tyrants and sons of belial and what not and though dr bathurst said differently who was to know what was right  dr bathurst had had his day and this was cantwells turn  there was a comedown now of feathered hats and point collars and curled hair and leathern jerkin should have its day  and as for being an informer he would keep his own counsel at any rate the reward he would have  it was scarcely likely to be a hanging matter after all and if the gentleman whoever he might be did chance to be taken he would get off scot free no harm done to him  diggory stokes youre a made man he finished throwing his billhook from him  ah  lucy lucy you little thought of the harm your curiosity and chattering had done as you saw diggory stealing along the side of the wood in the direction leading to chichester    chapter vi    in the afternoon lady woodley was so much better as to be able to come downstairs and all the party sat round the fire in the twilight  walter was just come in from his fishing bringing a basket of fine trout eleanor and charles were admiring their beautiful red spots lucy wondering what made him so late while he cast a significant look at his eldest sister showing her that he had been making a visit to edmund  at that moment a loud authoritative knocking was heard at the door walter shouted to diggory to open it and was answered by deborahs shrill scream from the kitchen hes not here sir ive not seen him since you threw your boots at him sir  another thundering knock brought deborah to open the door and what was the dismay of the mother and children as there entered six tall men their buff coats steeplecrowned hats plain collars and thick calfskin boots marking them as parliamentary soldiers  with a shriek of terror the little ones clung round their mother while he who by his orange scarf was evidently the commanding officer standing in the middle of the hall with his hat on announced in a puritanical tone we are here by order of his excellency general cromwell to search for and apprehend the body of the desperate malignant edmund woodley last seen in arms against the most high court of parliament  likewise to arrest the person of dame mary woodley widow suspected of harbouring and concealing traitors and he advanced to lay his hand upon her  walter in an impulse of passion rushed forward and aimed a blow at him with the buttend of the fishingrod but it was the work of a moment to seize the boy and tie his hands while his mother earnestly implored the soldier to have pity on him and excuse his thoughtless haste to protect her  the officer sat down in the armchair and without replying to lady woodley ordered a soldier to bring the boy before him and spoke thus hear me son of an ungodly seed  so merciful are the lessons of the light that thou contemnest that i will even yet overlook and forgive the violence wherewith thou didst threaten my life so thou wilt turn again and confess where thou hast hidden the bloodyminded traitor  this house harbours no traitor answered walter undauntedly  if thou art too hardened to confess continued the officer frowning and speaking slowly and sternly as he kept his eyes steadily fixed on walter if thou wilt not reveal his hidingplace i lead thee hence to abide the penalty of attempted murder  i am quite ready answered walter returning frown for frown and not betraying how his heart throbbed  the officer signed to the soldier who roughly dragged him aside by the cord that tied his hands cutting them severely though he disdained to show any sign of pain  young maiden continued the rebel turning to rose what sayest thou  wilt thou see thy brother led away to death when the breath of thy mouth might save him  poor rose turned as pale as death but her answer was steady  i will say nothing  little ones then said the officer fiercely speak or you shall taste the rod  do you know where your brother is  nono sobbed lucy and her mother added they know nothing sir  it is loss of time to stand parleying with women and children said the officer rising  here to one of his men keep the door  let none quit the chamber and mark the childrens talk  the rest with me  where is the fellow that brought the tidings  diggory who had slunk out of sight was pushed forward by two of the soldiers and at the same time there was a loud scream from deborah oh  diggory is it you  oh my lady my lady forgive me  i meant no harm  oh who would have thought it  and in an agony of distress she threw her apron over her face and sinking on the bench rocked herself to and fro sobbing violently  in the meantime the officer and his men all but the sentinel had left the room to search for the fugitive leaving lady woodley sitting exhausted and terrified in her chair the little ones clinging around her walter standing opposite with his hands bound rose stood by him her arm round his neck proud of his firmness but in dreadful terror for him and in such suspense for edmund that her whole being seemed absorbed in agonised prayer  deborahs sobs and the childrens frightened weeping were all the sounds that could be heard rose was obliged to attempt to soothe them but her first kind word to deborah produced a fresh burst of violent weeping and then a loud lamentation  oh the roguethe rogue  if i could have dreamt it  what has she done exclaimed walter impatiently  come stop your crying  what have you done deb  i thoughtoh if i had known what was in the villain continued deborah id sooner have bit out my tongue than have said one word to him about the pigeon pie  pigeon pie repeated rose  lucy now gave a cry for she was with all her faults a truth telling child  mother mother  i told deb about the pigeon pie oh what have i done  was it for edmund  is edmund here  and to increase the danger and perplexity the other two children exclaimed together is edmund here  hush hush my dears be quiet i cannot answer you now whispered lady woodley trying to silence them by caresses and looking with terror at the rigid stern guard who instead of remaining at the door where he had been posted had come close up to them and sat himself down at the end of the table as if to catch every word they uttered  eleanor and charles obeyed their mothers command that they should be silent rose took lucy on her lap let her rest her head on her shoulder and whispered to her that she should hear and tell all another time but she must be quiet now and listen  deborah kept her apron over her face and walter leaning his shoulder against the wall stood gazing at them all and while he was intently watching for every sound that could enable him to judge whether the search was successful or not at the same time his heart was beating and his head swimming at the threat of the rebel  was he to die  to be taken away from that bright world from sunshine youth and health from his mother and all of them and be laid a stiff mangled corpse in some cold dark unregarded grave his pulses that beat so fast all still and silentsenseless motionless like the birds he had killed  and that was not all  that other world  to enter on what would last for ever and ever and ever on a state which he had never dwelt on or realised to himself filled him with a blank shuddering awe and next came a worse a sickening thought  if his feeling for the bliss of heaven was almost distaste could he be fit for it could he dare to hope for it  it was his judge whom he was about to meet and he had been impatient and weary of bible and catechism and dr bathursts teaching he had been inattentive and careless at his prayers he had been disobedient and unruly violent and unkind  such a horror and agony came over the poor boy so exceeding a dread of death that he was ready at that moment to struggle to do anything to save himself but there came the recollection that the price of his rescue must be the betrayal of edmund  he would almost have spoken at that instant the next he sickened at the thought  never neverhe could not would not better not live at all than be a traitor  he was too confused and anxious to pray for he had not taught himself to fix his attention in quiet moments  he would not speak before the rebel soldier but only looked with an earnest gaze at his sister who as their eyes met understood all it conveyed  his mother after the first moments fright had reassured herself somewhat on his account he was so mere a boy that it was not likely that algernon sydney who then commanded at chichester would put him to death a short imprisonment was the worst that was likely to befall him and though that was enough to fill her with terror and anxiety it could at that moment be scarcely regarded in comparison with her fears for her eldest son  a long time passed away so long that they began to hope that the enemies might be baffled in their search in spite of diggorys intimate knowledge of every nook and corner  they had been once to the shrubbery and had been heard tramping back to the stable where they were welcome to search as long as they chose then to the barn yard all over the house from garret to cellar  was it over  joy joy  but the feet were heard turning back to the pleasance as though to recommence the search and ten minutes after the steps came nearer  the rebel officer entered the hall first but alas behind him came guarded by two soldiers edmund woodley himself his step firm his head erect and his hands unbound  his mother sank back in her chair and he going straight up to her knelt on one knee before her saying mother dear mother your blessing  let me see your face again  she threw her arms round his neck my son and is it thus we meet  we only meet as we parted he answered firmly and cheerfully still sufferers in the same good cause still i trust with the same willing hearts  come sir said the officer i must see you safely bestowed for the night  one moment gentlemen entreated lady woodley  it is six years since i saw my son and this may be our last meeting  she led him to the light and looked earnestly up into his face saying with a smile which had in it much of pride and pleasure as well as sadness how you are altered edmund  see rose how brown he is and how much darker his hair has grown and does not his moustache make him just like your father  and my little sisters said edmund  ha  lucy i know your little round face  oh sobbed lucy is it my fault  can you pardon me  the pigeon pie  what does she mean asked edmund turning to rose  i saw you take it out at night rose said poor lucy  i told deb  and poor deborah added rose from the same thoughtlessness repeated her chatter to diggory who has betrayed us  the cowardly villain cried walter who had come forward to the group round his brother  hush walter said edmund  but what do i see  your hands bound you a prisoner  poor walter was rash enough to attempt resistance said his mother  so sir said edmund turning to the rebel captain you attach great importance to the struggles of a boy of thirteen  a blow with the buttend of a fishingrod is no joke from boy or man answered the officer  when last i served in england continued the cavalier cromwells ironsides did not take notice of children with fishingrods  you can have no warrant no order or whatever you pretend to act by against him  whyno sir buthowever the young gentleman has had a lesson and i do not care if i do loose his hands  here unfasten him  but i cannot permit him to be at large while you are in the house  very well then perhaps you will allow him to share my chamber  we have been separated for so many years and it may be our last meeting  so let it be  since you are pleased to be conformable sir i am willing to oblige you answered the rebel whose whole demeanour had curiously changed in the presence of one of such soldierly and gentlemanlike bearing as edmund prisoner though he was  now madam to your own chamber  you will all meet tomorrow  goodnight mother said edmund  sleep well think this is but a dream and only remember that your eldest son is in your own house  goodnight my brave boy said lady woodley as she embraced him ardently  a comfort indeed i have in knowing that with your fathers face you have his steadfast loving unselfish heart  we meet tomorrow  gods blessing be upon you my boy  and tenderly embracing the children she left the hall followed by a soldier who was to guard her door and allow no one to enter edmund next kissed his sisters and little charles affectionately wishing them goodnight and assuring the sobbing lucy of his pardon rose whispered to him to say something to comfort deborah who continued to weep piteously  deborah he said i must thank you for your long faithful service to my mother in her poverty and distress  i am sure you knew not that you were doing me any harm  oh sir cried poor deborah oh dont speak so kind  i had rather stand up to be a mark for all the musketeers in the parliament army than be where i am now  edmund did not hear half what she said for he and walter were obliged to hasten upstairs to the chamber which was to be their prison for the night  rose at the same time led away the children poor little charles almost asleep in the midst of the confusion  deborahs troubles were not over yet the captain called for supper and seeing walters basket of fish ordered her to prepare them at once for him  afraid to refuse she took them down to the kitchen and proceeded to her cookery weeping and lamenting all the time  oh the sweet generoushearted young gentleman  that i should have been the death of such as he and he thanking me for my poor services  tis little i could do with my crooked temper that plagues all i love the very best and my long tongue  oh that it had been bitten out at the root  i wishi wish i was a mark for all the musketeers in the parliament army this minute  and diggory the rogue  oh after having known him all my life who would have thought of his turning informer  why was not he killed in the great fight  it would have broke my heart less  and having set her fish to boil deborah sank on the chair her apron over her head and proceeded to rock herself backwards and forwards as before  she was startled by a touch and a lumpish voice attempted to be softened into an insinuating tone  i say deb dont take on  she sprung up as if an adder had stung her and jumped away from him ha is it you  dost dare to speak to an honest girl  come come dont be fractious my pretty one said diggory in the amiable tones that had once gained her heart  but now her retort was in a still sharper more angry key  yourn indeed  id rather stand up to be a mark for all the musketeers in the parliament army as poor master edmund is like to be all along of you  o diggory stokes she added ruefully id not have believed it of you if my own father had sworn it  hush hush deb said diggory rather sheepishly theyve done hanging the folk  dont be for putting me off with such trash she returned more passionately youve murdered him as much as if you had cut his throat and pretty nigh master walter into the bargain and youve broke my ladys heart you as was born on her land and fed with her bread  and now you think to make up to me do you  wasnt it all along of you i did it  for your sake  well and what would you be pleased to say next cried deb her voice rising in shrillness with her indignation  patience deb said diggory showing a heavy leathern bag  no more toiling in this ruinous old hall with scanty scraps hard words and no wages but a tidy little homestead pig cow and horse your own  see here deb and he held up a piece of money  silver she exclaimed  ay ay said diggory grinning and jingling the bag and there be plenty more where that came from  it is the price of master edmunds blood  dont ye say that now deb tis all for you he answered thinking he was prevailing because she was less violent too stupid to perceive the difference between her real indignation and perpetual scolding  so you still have the face to tell me so she burst out still more vehemently  i tell you id rather serve my lady and mistress rose if they had not a crust to give me than roll in gold with a rogue like you  get along with you and best get out of the county for not a boy in dorset but will cry shame on you  but deb deb he still pleaded  you will have it then  and dealing him a hearty box on the ear away ran deborah  down fell bag money and all and diggory stood gaping and astounded for a moment then proceeded to grope after the coins on his hands and knees  suddenly a voice exclaimed how now knave stealing thy mistresss goods and a tall grim steeplehatted figure armed with a formidable halberd stood over him  good master corporal he began trembling but the soldier would not hear him  away with thee son of iniquity or i will straightway lay mine halberd about thine ears  i bethink me that i saw thee at the fight of worcester on the part of the man charles stuart  here diggory judged it prudent to slink away through the back door  and so continued the puritan corporal as he swept the silver into his pouch and so the gains of iniquity fall into the hands of the righteous  in the meantime edmund and walter had been conducted up stairs to walters bedroom and there locked in a sentinel standing outside the door  no sooner were they there than walter swung himself round with a gesture of rage and despair  the villains the rogues  to be betrayed by such a wretch who has eaten our bread all his life o edmund edmund  it is a most unusual as well as an unhappy chance returned edmund  hitherto it has generally happened that servants have given remarkable proofs of fidelity  of course this fellow can have no attachment for me but i should have thought my mothers gentle kindness must have won the love of all who came near her both for herself and all belonging to her  a recollection crossed walter  he stood for a few moments in silence then suddenly exclaimed the surly rascal  i verily believe it was all spite at me for  for repeated edmund  for rating him as he deserved answered walter  i wish i had given it to him more soundly traitor as he is  no no after all added he hesitating perhaps if i had been civiller  i should guess you to be a little too prompt of tongue said edmund smiling  it is what my mother is always blaming me for said walter but really now edmund doesnt it savour of the cropear to be picking ones words to every rogue in ones way  nay walter you should not ask me that question just coming from france  there we hold that the best token in our poverty that we are cavaliers and gentlemen is to be courteous to all high and low you should see our young kings frank bright courtesy and as to the little king louis he is the very pink of civility to every old poissarde in the streets  walter coloured a little and looked confused then repeated as if consoling himself he is a sullen spiteful goodfornothing rogue whom hanging is too good for  dont let us spend our whole night in abusing him said edmund i want to make the most of you walter for this our last sight of each other  o edmund you dont meanthey shall notyou shall escape  oh is there no way out of this room cried walter running round it like one distracted and bouncing against the wainscot as if he would shake it down  hush this is of no use walter said his brother  the window is i see too high from the ground and there is no escape  walter stood regarding him with blank dismay  for one thing i am thankful to them continued edmund i thought they might have shot me down before my mothers door and so filled the place with horror for her ever after  now they have given me time for preparation and she will grow accustomed to the thought of losing me  then you think there is no hope  o edmund  i see none  sydney is unlikely to spare a friend of prince ruperts  walter squeezed his hands fast together  and howhow can you dont think me cowardly edmund for that i will never be never  never i am sure repeated edmund  but when that base puritan threatened me just nowperhaps it was foolish to believe himi could answer him freely enough but when i thought of dying then  you have not stood face to face with death so often as i have walter said edmund nor have you led so wandering and weary a life  i thought i could lead any sort of life rather than die said walter  yes our flesh will shrink and tremble at the thought of the judge we must meet said edmund but he is a gracious judge and he knows that it is rather than turn from our duty that we are exposed to death  we may have a good hope sinners as we are in his sight that he will grant us his mercy and be with us when the time comes  but it is late walter we ought to rest to fit ourselves for what may come tomorrow  edmund knelt in prayer his young brother feeling meantime both sorrowful and humiliated loving edmund and admiring him heartily following what he had said grieving and rebelling at the fate prepared for him and at the same time sensible of shame at having so far fallen short of all he had hoped to feel and to prove himself in the time of trial  he had been of very little use to edmund his rash interference had only done harm and added to his mothers distress he had been nothing but a boy throughout and instead of being a brave champion he had been in such an agony of terror at an empty threat that if the rebel captain had been in the room he might almost at one moment have betrayed his brother  poor walter how he felt what it was never to have learnt selfcontrol  the brothers arranged themselves for the night without undressing both occupying walters bed  they were both too anxious and excited to sleep and walter sat up after a time listening more calmly to edmund who was giving him last messages for prince rupert and his other friends should walter ever meet them and putting much in his charge as now likely to become heir of woodley hall and forest lea warning him earnestly to protect his mother and sisters and be loyal to his king avoiding all compromise with the enemies of the church    chapter vii    forest lea that night was a house of sorrow  the mother and two sons were prisoners in their separate rooms and the anxieties for the future were dreadful  rose longed to see and help her mother dreading the effect of such misery to be borne in loneliness by the weak frame shattered by so many previous sufferings  how was she to undergo all that might yet be in store for herimprisonment ill treatment above all the loss of her eldest son  for there was little hope for edmund  as a friend and follower of prince rupert he was a marked man and besides algernon sydney the commander of the nearest body of forces was known to be a good deal under the influence of the present owner of woodley who was likely to be glad to see the rightful heir removed from his path  rose perceived all this and her heart failed her but she had no time to pause on the thought  the children must be soothed and put to bed and a hard matter it was to comfort poor little lucy perhaps the most of all to be pitied  she relieved herself by pouring out the whole confession to rose crying bitterly while eleanor hurried on distressing questions whether they would take mamma away and what they would do to edmund  now it came back to lucy o if i had but minded what mamma said about keeping my tongue in order but now it is too late  rose after doing her best to comfort them and listening as near to her mothers door as she dared to hear if she were weeping went to her own room  it adjoined walters though the doors did not open into the same passage and she shut that which closed in the long gallery where her room and that of her sisters were so that the roundhead sentry might not be able to look down it  as soon as she was in her own room she threw herself on her knees and prayed fervently for help and support in their dire distress  in the stillness as she knelt she heard an interchange of voices which she knew must be those of her brothers in the next room  she went nearer to that side and heard them more distinctly  she was even able to distinguish when edmund spoke and when walter broke forth in impatient exclamations  a sudden thought struck her  she might be able to join in the conversation  there had once been a door between the two rooms but it had long since been stopped up and the recess of the doorway was occupied by a great oaken cupboard in which were preserved all the old stores of rich farthingales of brocade and velvet mantles which had been heirlooms from one dame of mowbray to another till poverty had caused them to be cut up and adapted into garments for the little woodleys  rose looked anxiously at the carved doors of the old wardrobe  had she the key  she felt in her pouch  yes she had not given it back to her mother since taking out the sheets for mr enderby  she unlocked the folding doors and pushing aside some of the piles of old garments saw a narrow line of light between the boards and heard the tones almost as clearly as if she was in the same room  eager to tell edmund how near she was she stretched herself out almost crept between the shelves leant her head against the board on the opposite side and was about to speak when she found that it yielded in some degree to her touch  a gleam of hope darted across her she drew back fetched her light tried with her hand and found that the back of the cupboard was in fact a door secured on her side by a wooden bolt which there was no difficulty in undoing  another push and the door yielded below but only so as to show that there must be another fastening above  rose clambered up the shelves and sought  here it was  it was one of the secret communications that were by no means uncommon in old halls in those times of insecurity edmund might yet be saved  trembling with the excess of her delight in her newfound hope she forced out the second bolt and pushed again  the door gave way the light widened upon her and she saw into the room  edmund was lying on the bed walter sitting at his feet  both started as what had seemed to be part of the wainscoted wall opened but edmund prevented walters exclamation by a sign to be silent and the next moment roses face was seen squeezing between the shelves  edmund  can you get through here she exclaimed in a low eager whisper  edmund was immediately by her side kissing the flushed anxious forehead  my gallant rose he said  oh thank heaven thank heaven now you may be safe continued rose still in the same whisper  i never knew this was a door till this moment  heaven sent the discovery on purpose for your safety hush walter  oh remember the soldier outside as walter was about to break out into tumultuous tokens of gladness  but can you get through edmund  or perhaps we might move out some of the shelves  that is easily done said edmund but i know not  even if i should escape it would be only to fall into the hands of some fresh troop of enemies and i cannot go and leave my mother to their mercy  you could do nothing to save her said rose and all that they may do to her would scarcely hurt her if she thought you were safe  o edmund think of her joy in finding you were escaped the misery of her anxiety now  yet to leave her thus  you had not told me half the change in her i know not how to go said edmund  you must you must said rose and walter both at once  and rose added your death would kill her i do believe  well then but i do not see my way even when i have squeezed between your shelves my little sister  every port is beset and our hiding places here can no longer serve me  listen said rose this is what my mother and i had planned before  the old clergyman of this parish dr bathurst lives in a little house at bosham with his daughter and maintains himself by teaching the wealthier boys of the town  now if you could ride to him tonight he would be most glad to serve you both as a cavalier and for my mothers sake  he would find some place of concealment and watch for the time when you may attempt to cross the channel  edmund considered and made her repeat her explanation  yes that might answer he said at length i take you for my general sweet rose  but how am i to find your good doctor  i think said rose after considering a little while that i had better go with you  i could ride behind you on your horse if the rebels have not found him and i know the town and dr bathursts lodging  i only cannot think what is to be done about walter  never mind me said walter they cannot hurt me  not if you will be prudent and not provoke them said edmund  oh i know cried rose wear my gown and hood these men have only seen us by candlelight and will never find you out if you will only be careful  i wear girls trumpery exclaimed walter in such indignation that edmund smiled saying if roses wit went with her gown you might be glad of it  she is a good girl enough said walter but as to my putting on her petticoat trash thats all nonsense  hear me this once dear walter pleaded rose  if there is a pursuit and they fancy you and edmund are gone together it will quite mislead them to hear only of a groom riding before a young lady  there is something in that said walter but a pretty sort of lady i shall make  then you consent  thank you dear walter  now will you help me into your room and ill put two rolls of clothes to bed that the captain may find his prisoners fast asleep tomorrow morning  walter could hardly help laughing aloud with delight at the notion of the disappointment of the rebels  the next thing was to consider of edmunds equipment rose turned over her ancient hoards in vain everything that was not too remarkable had been used for the needs of the family and he must go in his present bloodstained buff coat hoping to enter bosham too early in the morning for gossips to be astir  then she dressed walter in her own clothes not without his making many faces of disgust especially when she fastened his long curled lovelocks in a knot behind tried to train little curls over the sides of his face and drew her black silk hood forward so as to shade it  they were nearly of the same height and complexion and edmund pronounced that walter made a very pretty girl so like rose that he should hardly have known them apart which seemed to vex the boy more than all  there had been a sort of merriment while this was doing but when it was over and the moment came when the brother and sister must set off there was lingering sorrow and reluctance  edmund felt severely the leaving his mother in the midst of peril brought upon her for his sake and his one brief sight of his home had made him cling the closer to it and stirred up in double force the affections for mother brothers and sisters which though never extinct had been comparatively dormant while he was engaged in stirring scenes abroad  now that he had once more seen the gentle loving countenance of his mother and felt her tender tearful caress known that noble minded rose and had a glimpse of those pretty little sisters there was such a yearning for them through his whole being that it seemed to him as if he might as well die as continue to be cast up and down the world far from them  rose felt as if she was abandoning her mother by going from home at such a time when perhaps she should find on her return that she had been carried away to prison  she could not bear to think of being missed on such a morning that was likely to ensue but she well knew that the greatest good she could do would be to effect the rescue of her brother and she could not hesitate a moment  she crowded charge after charge upon walter with many a message for her mother promise to return as soon as possible and entreaty for pardon for leaving her in such a strait and edmund added numerous like parting greetings with counsel and entreaties that she would ask for colonel enderbys interference which might probably avail to save her from further imprisonment and sequestration  goodbye walter  in three or four years if matters are not righted before that perhaps if you can come to me i may find employment for you in prince ruperts fleet or the duke of yorks troop  o edmund thanks that would be  walter had not time to finish for rose kissed him left her love and duty to her mother with him bade him remember he was a lady and then holding edmund by the hand both with their shoes off stole softly down the stairs in the dark    chapter viii    after pacing up and down roses room till he was tired walter sat down to rest for rose had especially forbidden him to lie down lest he should derange his hair  he grew very sleepy and at last with his arms crossed on the table and his forehead resting on them fell sound asleep and did not awaken till it was broad daylight and calls of rose  rose were heard outside the locked door  he was just going to call out that rose was not here when he luckily recollected that he was rose pulled his hood forward and opened the door  he was instantly surrounded by the three children who poor little things feeling extremely forlorn and desolate without their mother all gathered round him lucy and eleanor seizing each a hand and charles clinging to the skirts of his dress  he by no means understood this and rose was so used to it as to have forgotten he would not like it  how you crowd he exclaimed  mistress rose began deborah coming half way up stairslucy let go his hand but charles instantly grasped it and he felt as if he could not move  dont be troublesome children said he trying to shake them off cant you come near one without pulling off ones hands  mistress continued deborah but as he forgot he was addressed and did not immediately attend she exclaimed oh she wont even look at me  i thought she had forgiven me  forgiven you said he starting  stuff and nonsense whats all this about  you were a fool thats all  deborah stared at this most unwonted address on the part of her young lady and lucy a sudden light breaking on her smiled at eleanor and held up her finger  deborah proceeded with her inquiry mistress rose shall i take some breakfast to my lady and the young gentlemen poor souls  yes of course he answered  no wait a bit  only to my mother i mean just at present  and the soldiers continued deborahtheyre roaring for breakfast what shall i give them  a halter he had almost said but he caught himself up in time and answered what you canbread beef beer  bread beef beer almost shrieked deborah when she knows the colonel man had the last of our beer beef we have not seen for two christmases and bread theres barely enough for my lady and the children till we bake  well whatever there is then said walter anxious to get rid of her  i could fry some bacon pursued deborah only i dont know whether to cut the new flitch so soon and there be some cabbages in the garden  should i fry or boil them mistress rose  the bottom is out of the fryingpan and the tinker is not come this way  the tinker was too much for poor walters patience and flinging away from her he exclaimed mercy on me woman youll plague the life out of me  poor deborah stood aghast  mistress rose what is it you look wildly i declare and your hood is all i dont know how  shall i set it right  mind your own business and ill mind mine cried walter  alack alack lamented deborah as she hastily retreated down stairs charlie running after her  mistress rose is gone clean demented with trouble and that is the worst that has befallen this poor house yet  there said lucy as soon as she was gone i have held my tongue this time  o walter you dont do it a bit like rose  where is rose said eleanor  how did you get out  well said walter it is hard that whatever we do women and babies are mixed up with it  i must trust you since you have found me out but mind lucy not one word or look that can lead anyone to guess what i am telling you  edmund is safe out of this house rose is gone with himtis safest not to say where  but is not she coming back asked eleanor  oh yes very soontoday or tomorrow perhaps  so i am rose till she comes back and little did i guess what i was undertaking  i never was properly thankful till now that i was not born a woman  oh dont stride along so or they will find you out exclaimed eleanor  and dont mince and amble that is worse added lucy  oh you will make me laugh in spite of everything  pshaw  i shall shut myself into myher room and see nobody said walter you must keep charlie off lucy and dont let deb drive me distracted  i dare say if necessary i can fool it enough for the rebels who never spoke to a gentlewoman in their lives  but only tell me how did you get out said lucy  little miss curiosity must rest without knowing said walter shutting the door in her face  now dont be curious dear lucy said eleanor taking her hand we shall know in time  i will not i am not said lucy magnanimously  we will not say one single word eleanor and i will not look as if i knew anything come down and we will see if we can do any of roses work for we must be very useful you know i wish i might tell poor deb that edmund is safe  walter was wise in secluding himself in his disguise  he remained undisturbed for some time while deborahs unassisted genius was exerted to provide the rebels with breakfast  the first interruption was from eleanor who knocked at the door beginning to call walter and then hastily turning it into rose  he opened and she said with tears in her eyes o walter walter the wicked men are really going to take dear mother away to prison  she is come down with her cloak and hood on and is asking for yourose i mean to wish goodbye  will you come  yes said walter and edmund  they were just sending up to call him said eleanor they will find it out in  eleanors speech was cut short by a tremendous uproar in the next room  ha  how  where are they  how now  escaped with many confused exclamations and much trampling of heavy boots  eleanor stood frightened walter clapped his hands cut a very unfeminine caper clenched his fist and shook it at the wall and exclaimed in an exulting whisper ha ha my fine fellows  you may look long enough for him then ran downstairs at full speed and entered the hall  his mother dressed for a journey stood by the table a glance of hope and joy lighting on her pale features but her swollen eyelids telling of a night of tears and sleeplessness  lucy and charles were by her side the front door open and the horses were being led up and down before it  walter and eleanor hurried up to her but before they had time to speak the rebel captain dashed into the room exclaiming thou treacherous woman thou shalt abye this here mount pursue the nearest road to the coast  smite them rather than let them escape  the malignant nursling of the blood thirsty palatine at large again  follow and overtake i say  which way sir demanded the corporal  the nearest to the coast  two ride to chichester two to gosport or here  where is that maiden young in years but old in wiles ah there come hither maiden  wilt thou purchase grace for thy mother by telling which way the prisoners are fled  i know thy wiles and will visit them on thee and on thy fathers house unless thou dost somewhat to merit forgiveness  what do you mean demanded walter swelling with passion  do not feign maiden  thy heart is rejoicing that the enemies of the righteous are escaped  you are not wrong there sir said walter  i tell thee said the captain sternly thy joy shall be turned to mourning  thou shalt see thy mother thrown into a dungeon and thou and thy sisters shall beg your bread unless  walter could not endure these empty threats and exclaimed you know you have no power to do this  is this what you call manliness to use such threats to a poor girl in your power  out upon you  ha said the rebel considerably surprised at the young ladys manner of replying  is it thus the malignants breed up their daughters in insolence as well as deceit  the last word made walter entirely forget his assumed character and striking at the captain with all his force he exclaimed take that for giving the lie to a gentleman  how now cried the rebel seizing his arm  walter struggled the hood fell back  tis the boy  ha deceived again  here search the house instantly every corner  i will not be balked a second time  he rushed out of the room while walter rending off the hood threw himself into his mothers arms exclaiming o mother dear i bore it as long as i could  my dear rash boy said she  but is he safe  no do not say where  thanks thanks to heaven  now i am ready for anything and so indeed her face proved  all owing to rose mother she will soon be back again shebut ill say no more for fear  he left lovedutyrose left all sorts of greetings that i will tell you by and by  ha do you hear them lumbering about the house  they fancy he is hid there  yes you are welcome  hush hush walter the longer they look the more time he will gain whispered his mother  oh this is joy indeed  mamma i found out walter and said not one word interposed lucy but there was no more opportunity for converse permitted for the captain returned and ordered the whole party into the custody of a soldier who was not to lose sight of any of them till the search was completed  after putting the whole house in disorder and seeking in vain through the grounds the captain himself and one of his men went off to scour the neighbouring country and examine every village on the coast  lady woodley and her three younger children were in the meantime locked into her room while the soldier left in charge was ordered not to let walter for a moment out of his sight and both she and walter were warned that they were to be carried the next morning to chichester to answer for having aided and abetted the escape of the notorious traitor edmund woodley  it was plain that he really meant it but hope for edmund made lady woodley cheerful about all she might have to undergo and even trust that the poor little ones she was obliged to leave behind might be safe with rose and deborah  her great fear was lest the rebels should search the villages before edmund had time to escape    chapter ix    cautiously stealing down stairs rose first to spy where the rebels might be the brother and sister reached the kitchen where rose provided edmund with a grey cloak once belonging to a former servingman and after a short search in an old press brought out various equipments saddle belt and skirt with which her mother had once been wont to ride pillionfashion  these they carried to the outhouse where edmunds horse had been hidden and when all was set in order by the light of the lantern rose thought that her brother looked more like a groom and less like a cavalier than she had once dared to hope  they mounted and on they rode across the downs through narrow lanes past farm houses dreading that each yelping dog might rouse his master to report which way they were gone  it was not till day had dawned and the eastern sky was red with the approaching sun that they came down the narrow lane that led to the little town of bosham a low flat place sloping very gradually to the water  here rose left her brother advising him to keep close under the hedge while she softly opened a little gate and entered a garden long and narrow with carefully cultivated flowers and vegetables  at the end was a low cottage and going up to the door rose knocked gently  the door was presently cautiously opened by a girl a few years older very plainly dressed as if busy in household work  she started with surprise then held out her hand which rose pressed affectionately as she said dear anne will you tell your father that i should be very glad to speak to him  i will call him said anne he is just rising  what isbut i will not delay  oh no do not thank you i cannot tell you now  rose was left by anne bathurst standing in a small cleanlysanded kitchen with a few wooden chairs neatly ranged some trenchers and pewter dishes against the wall and nothing like decoration except a beaupot as anne would have called it filled with flowers  here the good doctor and his daughter lived and tried to eke out a scanty maintenance by teaching a little school  after what was really a very short interval but which seemed to rose a very long one dr bathurst a thin spare middleaged man with a small black velvet cap over his grey hair came down the creaking rough wooden stairs  my dear child he asked in what can i help you  your mother is well i trust  oh yes sir said rose and with reliance and hope as if she had been speaking to a father she explained their distress and perplexity then stood in silence while the good doctor a slow thinker considered  first to hide him he said he may not be here for thisthe old parsons housewill be the very first spot they will search  but we will try  you rode you say mistress rose where is your horse  ah there is one difficulty said rose edmund is holding him now but where shall we leave him  let us come first to see the young gentleman said dr bathurst and they walked together to the lane where edmund was waiting the doctor explaining by the way that he placed his chief dependence on harry fletcher a fisherman thoroughly brave trustworthy and loyal who had at one time been a sailor and had seen and been spoken to by king charles himself  he lived in a little lonely hut about half a mile distant he was unmarried and would have been quite alone but that he had taken a young nephew whose father had been killed on the royalist side to live with him and to be brought up to his fishing business  edmund and rose both agreed that there could be no better hope of escape than in trusting to this good man and as no time was to be lost they parted for the present rose returning to the cottage to spend the day with anne bathurst and the clergyman walking with the young cavalier to the place where the fisherman lived  they led the horse with them for some distance then tied him to a gate a little out of sight and went on to the hut which stood built of the shingle of the beach just beyond the highest reach of the tide with the boat beside it and the nets spread out to dry  before there was time to knock the door was opened by harry fletcher himself his open sunburnt face showing honesty and good faith in every feature  he put his hand respectfully to his woollen cap and said with a sort of smile as he looked at edmund i see what work you have for me your reverence  you are right harry said dr bathurst this is one of the gentlemen that fought for his majesty at worcester and if we cannot get him safe out of the country with heavens blessing he is as good as a dead man  come in sir said fletcher you had best not be seen  theres no one here but little dick and ill answer for him  they came in and dr bathurst explained edmunds circumstances  the honest fellow looked a little perplexed but after a moment said well ill do what in me lies sir but tis a long way across  i should tell you my good man said edmund that i have nothing to repay you with for all the trouble and danger to which you may be exposing yourself on my behalf  nothing but my horse which would only be bringing suspicion on you  as to that your honour replied harry id never think of waiting for pay in a matter of life and death  i am glad if i can help off a gentleman that has been on the kings side  so the plan was arranged  edmund was to be disguised in the fishermans clothes spend the day at his hut and at night if the weather served fletcher would row him out to sea assisted by the little boy in hopes of falling in with a french vessel or if not they must pull across to havre or dieppe  the doctor promised to bring rose at ten oclock to meet him on the beach and bid him farewell  as to the horse fletcher sent the little boy to turn it out on the neighbouring down and hide the saddle  all this arranged dr bathurst returned to his school and rose dressed in annes plainest clothes rested on her bed as long as her anxiety would allow her then came down and helped in her household work  it was well that rose was thus employed for in the afternoon they had a great fright  two soldiers came knocking violently at the door exhibiting an order to search for the escaped prisoner  rose recognised two of the party who had been at forest lea but happily they had not seen enough of her to know her in the coarse blue stuff petticoat that she now wore  one of them asked who she was and anne readily replied oh a friend who is helping me after which they paid her no further attention  her anxiety for edmund was of course at its height during this search and it was not till the evening that she could gain any intelligence  edmunds danger had indeed been great  harry fletcher saw the rebels coming in time to prepare  he advised his guest not to remain in the house as if he wished to avoid observation but to come out as if afraid of nothing  his cavalier dress had been carefully destroyed or concealed he wore the fishermans rough clothes and had even sacrificed his long dark hair covering his head with one of harrys red woollen caps  he was altogether so different in appearance from what he had been yesterday that he ventured forward and leant whistling against the side of the boat while harry parleyed with the soldiers  perhaps they suspected harry a little for they insisted on searching his hut and as they were coming out one of them began to tell him of the penalties that fishermen would incur by favouring the escape of the royalists harry did not lose countenance but went on hammering at his boat as if he cared not at all till observing that one of the soldiers was looking hard at edmund he called out i say ned whats the use of loitering there listening to whats no concern of yours  fetch the oar out of yon shed  i never lit on such a lazy comrade in my life  this seemed to turn away all suspicion the soldiers left them and no further mischance occurred  at night just as the young moon was setting the boat was brought out and harry with little dick and a comrade whom he engaged could be trusted prepared their oars  at the same time dr bathurst and rose came silently to meet them along the shingly beach  rose hardly knew her brother in his fishermans garb  the time was short and their hearts were too full for many words as that little party stood together in the light of the crescent moon the sea sounding with a low constant ripple spread out in the grey hazy blue distance and here and there the crests of the nearer waves swelling up and catching the moonlight  edmund and his sister held their hands tightly clasped loving each other if possible better than ever  he now and then repeated some loving greeting which she was to bear home and she tried to restrain her tears at the separation she was forced to rejoice in a parting which gave no augury of meeting again the renewal of an exile from which there was no present hope of return  harry looked at dr bathurst to intimate it was time to be gone  the clergyman came close to the brother and sister and instead of speaking his own words used these  turn our captivity o lord as the rivers in the south  they that sow in tears shall reap in joy  he that now goeth on his way weeping and beareth forth good seed shall doubtless come again with joy and bring his sheaves with him  amen answered edmund and rose and they loosened their hold of each other with hearts less sore  then edmund bared his head and knelt down and the good clergyman called down a blessing from heaven on him harry the faithful man who was going to risk himself for him did the same and received the same blessing  there were no more words the boat pushed off and the splash of the oars resounded regularly  roses tears came thick fast blinding and she sat down on a block of wood and wept long and bitterly then she rose up and in answer to dr bathursts cheering words she said yes i do thank god with all my heart  that night rose slept at dr bathursts and early in the morning was rejoiced by the tidings which harry fletcher sent little dick to carry to the cottage  the voyage had been prosperous they had fallen in with a french vessel and mr edmund woodley had been safely received on board  she was very anxious to return home and as it was saturday and therefore a holiday at the school dr bathurst undertook to go with her and spend the sunday at forest lea  one of the farmers of bosham helped them some little way with his harvest cart but the rest of the journey had to be performed on foot  it was not till noon that they came out upon the high road between chichester and forest lea and they had not been upon it more than ten minutes before the sound of horses tread was heard as if coming from chichester  looking round they saw a gentleman riding fast followed by a soldier also on horseback  there was something in his air that rose recognised and as he came nearer she perceived it was sylvester enderby  he was much amazed when at the same moment he perceived it was mistress rose woodley and stopping his horse and taking off his hat with great respect both towards her and the clergyman he hoped all the family were well in health  yes yes i believe so thank you replied rose looking anxiously at him  i am on my way to forest lea he said  i bring the order my father hoped to obtain from general cromwell  the protection  oh thanks ten thousand thanks cried rose  oh it may savebut hasten on pray hasten on sir  the soldiers are already at home i feared she might be already a prisoner at chichester  pray go on and restrain them by your authority  dont ask me to explainyou will understand all when you are there  she prevailed on him to go on while she with dr bathurst more slowly proceeded up the chalky road which led to the summit of the green hill or down covered with short grass which commanded a view of all the country round and whence they would turn off upon the down leading to forest lea  just as they came to the top rose cast an anxious glance in the direction of her home and gave a little cry  sylvester enderby and his attendant could be seen speeding down the green slope of the hill but at some distance further on was a little troop of horsemen coming from the direction of forest lea the sun now and then flashing on a steel cap or on the point of a pike  fast rode on sylvester nearer and nearer came the troop rose almost fancied she could discern on one of the horses something muffled in black that could be no other than her mother  how she longed for wings to fly to meet her and cheer her heart with the assurance of edmunds safety  how she longed to be on sylvesters horse as she saw the distance between him and the party fast diminishing  at length he was close to it he had mingled with it and at the same time dr bathurst and rose had to mount a slightly rising ground which for a time entirely obscured their view  when at length they had reached the summit of this eminence the party were standing still as if in parley there was presently a movement a parting rose clasped her hands in earnestness  the main body continued their course to chichester a few remained stationary  how many  one two threeyes four or was it five and among them the black figure she had watched so anxiously  she is safe she is safe cried rose  oh god has been so very good to us i wish i could thank him enough  leaving the smoother slope to avoid encountering the baffled rebels dr bathurst and rose descended the steep the good man exerting himself that her eagerness might not be disappointed  down they went sliding on the slippery green banks helping themselves with the doctors trusty staff taking a short run at the lowest and steepest part of each creeping down the rude steps or rather foot holes cut out by the shepherdboys in the more perpendicular descents and fairly sliding or running down the shorter ones  they saw their friends waiting for them and a lesser figure than the rest hastened towards them scaling the steep slopes with a good will precipitancy and wild hurrahs of exultation that would not let them doubt it was walter before they could see his form distinctly or hear his words  rose ran headlong down the last green slope and was saved from falling by fairly rushing into his arms  is he safe  i need not ask exclaimed walter  safe in a french vessel  and mother  safe well happy  you saw you heard  hurrah  the cropears are sent to the right about the captain has done mother and me the favour to forgive us as a christian all that has passed he says we are all going home again as fast as we can young enderby and all to chase out the two rogues that are quartered on us to afflict poor deb and the little ones  by this time dr bathurst had descended more cautiously and walter went to greet him and repeat his news  together they proceeded to meet the rest and who can tell the tearful happiness when rose and her mother were once more pressed in each others arms  my noble girl under providence you have saved him whispered lady woodley  the next evening in secrecy with the shutters shut and the light screened the true pastor of forest lea gathered the faithful ones of his flock for a service in the old hall  there knelt many a humble loyal trustful peasant there was the widowed dame ewins trying to be comforted as they told her she ought there was the lady herself at once sorrowful and yet earnestly thankful there was sylvester enderby hearing and following the prayers he had been used to in his early childhood with a growing feeling that here lay the right and the truth there was deborah weeping grieving over her own fault and almost heartbroken at the failure of him on whom she had set her warm affections yet perhaps in a way made wiser and taught to trust no longer to a broken reed but to look for better things there were walter and lucy both humbled and subdued repenting in earnest of the misbehaviour each of them had been guilty of  walter did not show his contrition much in manner but it was real and he proved it by many a struggle with his selfwilled overbearing temper  it was a real resolution that he took now and in a spirit of humility which made him glad to pray that what was past might be forgiven and that he might be helped for the future  that was the first time walter had ever kept up his attention through the whole service but it all came home to him now  each of that little congregation had their own sorrow of heart their own prayer and thanksgiving to pour out in secret but all could join in one thankoffering for the safety of the heir of that house all joined in one prayer for the rescue of their hunted king and for the restoration of their oppressed and afflicted church      nine years had passed away and forest lea still stood among the stumps of its cutdown trees but one fair long day in early june there was much that was changed in its aspect  the park was carefully mown and swept the shrubs were trained back the broken windows were repaired and within the hall the appearance of everything was still more strikingly cheerful as the setting sun looked smilingly in at the western window  green boughs filled the hearth and were suspended round the walls fresh branches of young oak leaves tasselled with the pale green catkins the helmets and gauntlets hanging on the wall were each adorned with a spray and polished to the brightest the chairs and benches were ranged round the long table covered with a spotless cloth and bearing in the middle a large bowl filled with oak boughs roses lilac honey suckle and all the pride of the garden  at the head of the table sat less pale and her face beaming with deep quiet heartfelt joy lady woodley herself and near her were dr bathurst and his happy daughter who in a few days more were to resume their abode in his own parsonage  opposite to her was a dark soldierly sunburnt man on whose countenance toil weather and privation had set their traces but whose every tone and smile told of the ecstasy of being once more at home  merry faces were at each side of the table walter grown up into a tall noblelooking youth of twoandtwenty particularly courteous and gracious in demeanour and most affectionate to his mother charles a gentle sedate boy of fifteen so much given to books and gravity that his sisters called him their little scholar rose with the same sweet thoughtful face active step and helpful hand that she had always possessed but very pale and more pensive and grave than became a time of rejoicing as if the cares and toils of her youth had taken away her light heart and had given her a soft subdued melancholy that was always the same  she was cheerful when others were cast down and overwhelmed but when they were gay she though not sorrowful seemed almost grave in spite of her sweet smiles and ready sympathy  yet rose was very happy no less happy than eleanor with her fair lovely laughing face or   but where is lucy edmund asked as he saw her chair vacant  lucy said rose she will come in a moment  she is going to bring in the dish you especially ordered and which deborah wonders at  good faithful deborah said edmund  did she never find a second love  oh no never said eleanor  she says she has seen enough of men in her time  she is grown sharper than ever said walter now she is mistress housekeeper deborah i shall pity the poor maidens under her  she will always be kind in the main rejoined rose  and did you ever hear what became of that precious sweetheart of hers asked edmund  hanged for sheep stealing replied walter according to the report of sylvester enderby  but hush for enter  there entered lucy smiling and blushing her dark hair decorated with the spray of oak and her hands supporting a great pewter dish in which stood a noble pie of palebrown wellbaked crust garnished with many a pair of little claws showing what were the contents  she set it down in the middle of the table just opposite to walter  the grace was said the supper began and great was the merriment when walter raising a whole pigeon on his fork begged to know if rose had appetite enough for it and if she still possessed the spirit of a wolf  and said he as they finished now rose will never gainsay me more when i sing    for forty years our royal throne has been his fathers and his own nor is there anyone but he with right can there a sharer be for who better may the right sceptre sway than he whose right it is to reign then look for no peace for the war will never cease till the king enjoys his own again  then far upon the distant hill my hope has cast her anchor still until i saw the peaceful dove bring home the branch i dearly love and there did i wait till the waters abate that did surround my swimming brain for rejoice could never i till i heard the joyful cry that the king enjoys his own again
