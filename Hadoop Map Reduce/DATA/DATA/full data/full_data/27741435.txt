day in early spring of the next year  act iv  same as act ithree days later      act i   scenelivingroom of curtis jaysons house in bridgetown conn a large comfortable room on the left an armchair a big open fireplace a writing desk with chair in far left corner on this side there is also a door leading into curtis study in the rear center a double doorway opening on the hall and the entryway bookcases are built into the wall on both sides of this doorway in the far right corner a grand piano three large windows looking out on the lawn and another armchair front are on this right side of the room opposite the fireplace is a couch facing front opposite the windows on the right is a long table with magazines reading lamp etc four chairs are grouped about the table the walls and ceiling are in a french gray color a great rug covers most of the hardwood floor  it is around four oclock of a fine afternoon in early fall  as the curtain rises martha curtis and bigelow are discovered martha is a healthy finelooking woman of thirtyeight she does not appear this age for her strenuous life in the open has kept her young and fresh she possesses the frank clear direct quality of outdoors outspoken and generous her wavy hair is a dark brown her eyes bluegray curtis jayson is a tall rangy broadshouldered man of thirtyseven while spare his figure has an appearance of rugged health of great nervous strength held in reserve his squarejawed largefeatured face retains an eager boyish enthusiasm in spite of its prevailing expression of thoughtful preoccupied aloofness his crisp dark hair is graying at the temples edward bigelow is a large handsome man of thirtynine his face shows culture and tolerance a sense of humor a lazy unambitious contentment curtis is reading an article in some scientific periodical seated by the table martha and bigelow are sitting nearby laughing and chatting  bigelowis talking with a comically worried but earnest air do you know im getting so im actually afraid to leave them alone with that governess shes too romantic ill wager shes got a whole book full of ghost stories superstitions and yellowjournal horrors up her sleeve  marthaoh pooh dont go milling around for trouble when i was a kid i used to get fun out of my horrors  bigelowbut i imagine you were more courageous than most of us  marthawhy  bigelowwell nevadathe far west at that timei should think a child would have grown so accustomed to violent scenes  marthasmiling oh in the mining camps but you dont suppose my father lugged me along on his prospecting trips do you why i never saw any rough scenes until id finished with school and went to live with father in goldfield  bigelowsmiling and then you met curt  marthayesbut i didnt mean he was a rough scene he was very mild even in those days do tell me what he was like at cornell  bigelowa romanticistand he still is  marthapointing at curtis with gay mischief what that sedate man never  curtislooking up and smiling at them both affectionatelylazily dont mind him martha he always was crazy  bigelowto curtaccusingly why did you elect to take up mining engineering at cornell instead of a classical degree at the yale of your fathers and brothers because you had been reading bret harte in prep school and mistaken him for a modern realist you devoted four years to grooming yourself for another outcast of poker flat martha laughs  curtisgrinning it was you who were hypnotized by harteso much so that his west of the past is still your blinded new englandmovie idea of the west at present but go on what next  bigelownext you get a job as engineer in that goldfield minebut you are soon disillusioned by a laborious life where sixshooters are as rare as nuggets you try prospecting you find nothing but different varieties of pebbles but it is necessary to your nature to project romance into these stones so you go in strong for geology as a geologist you become a slave to the romance of the rocks it is but a step from that to anthropologythe last romance of all there you find yourselfbecause there is no further to go you win fame as the most proficient of young skullhuntersand wander over the face of the globe digging up bones like an old dog  curtiswith a laugh the man is mad martha  bigelowmad what an accusation to come from one who is even now considering setting forth on a fiveyear excavating contest in search of the remains of our gibbering ancestor the first man  curtiswith sudden seriousness im not considering it any longer ive decided to go  marthastartingthe hurt showing in her voice when did you decide  curtisi only really came to a decision this morning with a seriousness that forces bigelows interested attention its a case of got to go its a tremendous opportunity that it would be a crime for me to neglect  bigelowand a big honor too isnt it to be picked as a member of such a large affair  curtiswith a smile i guess its just that they want all the men with considerable practical experience they can get there are bound to be hardships and they know im hardened to them turning to his wife with an affectionate smile we havent roughed it in the queer corners for the last ten years without knowing how its done have we martha  marthadully no curt  curtiswith an earnest enthusiasm and this expedition is what you call a large affair big its the largest thing of its kind ever undertaken the possibilities from the standpoint of anthropology are limitless  bigelowwith a grin aha now we come to the missing link  curtisfrowning darn your barnum and bailey circus lingo big this isnt a thing to mock at i should think the origin of man would be something that would appeal even to your hothouse imagination modern science believesknowsthat asia was the first home of the human race thats where were going to the great central asian plateau north of the himalayas  bigelowmore soberly and there you hope to dig upour first ancestor  curtisits a chance in a million but i believe we may myselfat least find authentic traces of him so that we can reconstruct his life and habits i was up in that country a lot while i was mining advisor to the chinese governmentdid some of my own work on the side the extraordinary results i obtained with the little means at my disposal convinced me of the riches yet to be uncovered the first man may be among them  bigelowturning to martha and you were with him on that asian plateau  marthayes ive always been with him  curtisyou bet she has he goes over and puts his hand on his wifes shoulder affectionately marthas more efficient than a whole staff of assistants and secretaries she knows more about what im doing than i do half the time he turns toward his study well i guess ill go in and work some  marthaquietly do you need me now curt  bigelowstarting up yes if you two want to work together why just shoo me  curtisputs both hands on his shoulders and forces him to his seat again no sit down big i dont need martha now coming over to her bends down and kisses herrather mockingly i couldnt deprive big of an audience for his confessions of a fond parent  bigelowaha now its you who are mocking at something you know nothing about an awkward silence follows this remark  curtisfrowning i guess youre forgetting arent you big he turns and walks into his study closing the door gently behind him  marthaafter a pausesadly poor curt  bigelowashamed and confused i had forgotten  marthathe years have made me reconciled they havent curt she sighsthen turns to bigelow with a forced smile i suppose its hard for any of you back here to realize that curt and i ever had any children  bigelowafter a pause how old were they when  marthathree years and twoboth girls she goes on sadly we had a nice little house in goldfield forcing a smile we were very respectable home folks then the wandering came later afterit was a sunday in winter when curt and i had gone visiting some friends the nurse girl fell asleepor somethingand the children sneaked out in their underclothes and played in the snow pneumonia set inand a week later they were both dead  bigelowshocked good heavens  marthawe were real lunatics for a time and then when wed calmed down enough to realizehow things stood with uswe swore wed never have children againto steal away their memory it wasnt what you thoughtromanticismthat set curt wanderingand me with him it was a longing to lose ourselvesto forget he flung himself with all his power into every new study that interested him he couldnt keep still mentally or bodilyand i followed he needed methenso dreadfully  bigelowand is it that keeps driving him on now  marthaoh no hes found himself his work has taken the place of the children  bigelowand with you too  marthawith a wan smile well ive helpedall i could his work has me in it i like to thinkand i have him  bigelowshaking his head i think people are foolish to stand by such an oath as you tookforever with a smile children are a great comfort in ones old age ive tritely found  marthasmiling old age  bigelowim knocking at the door of fatal forty  marthawith forced gaiety youre not very tactful i must say dont you know im thirtyeight  bigelowgallantly a woman is as old as she looks youre not thirty yet  marthalaughing after that nice remark ill have to forgive you everything wont i lily jayson comes in from the rear she is a slender rather pretty girl of twentyfive the stamp of college student is still very much about her she rather insists on a superior intellectual air is full of nervous thwarted energy at the sight of them sitting on the couch together her eyebrows are raised  lilycoming into the roombreezily hello martha hello big they both get up with answering hellos i walked right in regardless hope im not interrupting  marthanot at all  lilysitting down by the table as martha and bigelow resume their seats on the lounge i must say it sounded serious i heard you tell big youd forgive him everything martha drylywith a mocking glance at bigelow youre letting yourself in for a large proposition  bigelowdispleased but trying to smile it off the past is never past for a dog with a bad name eh lily lily laughs bigelow gets up if you want to reward me for my truthfulness mrs jayson help me take the kids for an airing in the car i know its an imposition but theyve grown to expect you glancing at his watch by jove ill have to run along ill get them and then pick you up here is that all right  marthafine  bigelowill run then goodby lily she nods bigelow goes out rear  marthacordially come on over here lily  lilysits on couch with marthaafter a pausewith a smile you were forgetting werent you  marthawhat  lilythat youd invited all the family over here to tea this afternoon im the advance guard  marthaembarrassed so i was how stupid  lilywith an inquisitive glance at marthas face but with studied carelessness do you like bigelow  marthayes very much and curt thinks the world of him  lilyoh curt is the last one to be bothered by anyones morals curt and i are the unconventional ones of the family the trouble with bigelow martha is that he was too careless to conceal his sinsand that wont go down in this philistine small town you have to hide and be a fellow hypocrite or they revenge themselves on you bigelow didnt he flaunted his loveaffairs in everyones face i used to admire him for it no one exactly blamed him in their secret hearts his wife was a terrible straitlaced creature no man could have endured her disgustedly after her death he suddenly acquired a bad conscience hed never noticed the children before ill bet he didnt even know their names and then presto hes about in our midst giving an imitation of a wet hen with a brood of ducks its a bore if you ask me  marthaflushing i think its very fine of him  lilyshaking her head his reform is too sudden hes joined the hypocrites i think  marthaim sure hes no hypocrite when you see him with the children  lilyoh i know hes a good actor lots of women have been in love with him then suddenly you wont be furious if im very very frank will you martha  marthasurprised no of course not lily  lilywell im the bearer of a message from the jayson family  marthaastonished a message for me  lilydont think that i have anything to do with it im only a victor record of their misgivings shall i switch it going well then father thinks brother john and wife sister esther and husband all think that you are unwisely intimate with this same bigelow  marthastunned i unwisely intimate suddenly laughing with amusement well you sure are funny people  lilyno were not funny wed be all right if we were on the contrary were very dull and deadly bigelow really has a villainous rep for philandering but of course you didnt know that  marthabeginning to feel resentfulcoldly no i didntand i dont care to know it now  lilycalmly i told them you wouldnt relish their silly advice in a very confidential friendly tone oh i hate their narrow smalltown ethics as much as you do martha i sympathize with you indeed i do but i have to live with them and so for comforts sake ive had to make compromises and youre going to live in our midst from now on arent you well then youll have to make compromises tooif you want any peace  marthabutcompromises about what forcing a laugh i refuse to take it seriously how anyone could thinkits too absurd  lilywhat set them going was bigs being around such an awful lot the weeks curt was in new york just after youd settled down here you must acknowledge he wasvery much present then martha  marthabut it was on account of his children they were always with him  lilythe town doesnt trust this sudden fond parenthood martha weve known him too long you see  marthabut hes curts oldest and best friend  lilyweve found they always are  marthaspringing to her feetindignantly its a case of evil minds it seems to meand it would be extremely insulting if i didnt have a sense of humor resentfully you can tell your family that as far as im concerned the town may  lilygo to the devil i knew youd say that well fight the good fight you have all my best wishes with a sigh i wish i had something worth fighting for now that im through with college my occupations gone all i do is read book after book the only live people are the ones in books i find and the only live life  marthaimmediately sympathetic youre lonely thats what lily  lilydrily dont pity me marthaor ill join the enemy  marthaim not but id like to help you if i could after a pause have you ever thought of marrying  lilywith a laugh martha how banal the men i see are enough to banish that thought if i ever had it  marthamarriage isnt only the man its children wouldnt you like to have children  lilyturning to her bluntly wouldnt you  martha confused  butlily  lilyoh i know it wasnt practicable as long as you elected to wander with curtbut why not now when youve definitely settled down here i think that would solve things all round if you could present father with a grandson im sure hed fall on your neck he feels piqued at the john and esther families because theyve had a run of girls a male jayson aunt davidson would weep with joy suddenly youre thirtyeight arent you martha  marthayes lilythen why dont youbefore its too late martha struggling with herself does not answer lily goes on slowly you wont want to tag along with curt to the ends of the earth forever will you curiously wasnt that queer life like any other i mean didnt it get to pall on you  marthaas if confessing it reluctantly yesperhapsin the last two years  lilydecisively its time for both of you to rest on your laurels why cant curt keep on with what hes doing nowstay home and write his books  marthacurt isnt that kind the actual workthe romance of itthats his life  lilybut if he goes and you have to stay youll be lonesome meaningly alone  marthahorribly i dont know what ill do  lilythen whywhy think martha if curt knewthat was to happenhed want to stay here with you im sure he would  marthashaking her head sadly no curt has grown to dislike children they remind him ofours that were taken he adored them sohes never become reconciled  lilyif you confronted curt with the actual fact hed be reconciled soon enough and happy in the bargain  marthaeagerly do you really think so  lilyand you marthai can tell from the way youve talked that youd like to  marthaexcitedly yes ii never thought id ever want to again for many years after they died i never once dreamed of it but latelythe last yearsive feltand when we came to live hereand i saw all around mehomesand children ishe hesitates as if ashamed at having confessed so much  lilyputting an arm around heraffectionately i know vigorously you must thats all there is to it if you want my advice you go right ahead and dont tell curt until its a fact hell have to learn to like willynilly youll find in his inmost heart hell be tickled to death  marthaforcing a smile yes iill confess i thought of that in spite of my fear iivei meanishe flushes in a shamed confusion  lilylooking at her searchingly why martha whatthen suddenly understandingwith excited pleasure martha i know it is so isnt it it is  marthain a whisper yes  lilykissing her affectionately you dear you then after a pause how long have you known  marthafor over two months there is a ring from the front door bell in the hall  lilyjumping up ill bet thats we jaysons now she runs to the door in the rear and looks down the hall to the right yes its esther and husband and aunt davidson she comes back to martha laughing excitedly the maid is seen going to the door the first wave of attack martha be brave the young guard dies but never surrenders  marthadispleased but forcing a smile you make me feel terribly ill at ease when you put it that way lily she rises now and goes to greet the visitors who enter mrs davidson is seventyfive years olda thin sinewy old lady oldfashioned unbending and rigorous in manner she is dressed aggressively in the fashion of a bygone age esther is a stout middleaged woman with the round unmarked sentimentallycontented face of one who lives unthinkingly from day to day sheltered in an assured position in her little world mark her husband is a lean tall stooping man of about fortyfive his long face is alert shrewd cautious full of the superficial craftiness of the lawyer mind martha kisses the two women shakes hands with mark uttering the usual meaningless greetings in a forced tone they reply in much the same spirit there is the buzz of this empty chatter while martha gets them seated lily stands looking on with a cynical smile of amusement mrs davidson is in the chair at the end of table left esther sits by martha on couch mark in chair at front of table will you have tea now or shall we wait for the others  estherlets wait they ought to be here any moment  lilymaliciously just think martha had forgotten you were coming she was going motoring with bigelow there is a dead silence at thisbroken diplomatically by sheffield  sheffieldwhere is curt martha  marthahard at work in his study im afraid hes there for the day sheffieldcondescendingly still plugging away at his book i suppose well i hope it will be a big success  lilyirritated by his smugness as big a success as the brief youre writing to restrain the citizens from preventing the traction company robbing them eh mark before anyone can reply she turns suddenly on her aunt who is sitting rigidly on her chair staring before her stonily like some old lady in a daguerreotypein a loud challenging tone you dont mind if i smoke aunt she takes a cigarette out of case and lights it  esthersmiling lily  mrs davidsonfixes lily with her starein a tone of irrevocable decision well get you married young lady and that very soon what you need to bring you down to earth is a husband and the responsibility of children turning her glance to martha a challenge in her question every woman who is able should have children dont you believe that martha jayson she accentuates the full name  marthataken aback for a moment but restraining her resentmentgently yes i do mrs davidson  mrs davidsonseemingly placated by this replyin a milder tone you must call me aunt my dear meaningly all the jaysons do  marthasimply thank you aunt  lilyas if all of this aroused her irritationin a nervous fuming why dont the others come darn em im dying for my tea the door from the study is opened and curt appears they all greet him  curtisabsentmindedly hello everybody then with a preoccupied air to martha martha i dont want to interrupt youbut  marthagetting up briskly you want my help  curtiswith the same absentminded air yesnot for longjust a few notes before i forget them he goes back into the study  marthaseemingly relieved by this interruption and glad of the chance it gives to show them her importance to curt youll excuse me for a few moments all of you wont you they all nod  mrs davidsonrather harshly why doesnt curt hire a secretary that is no work for his wife  marthaquietly a paid secretary could hardly give the sympathy and understanding curt needs mrs davidson proudly and she would have to study for years as i have done in order to take my place to lily if i am not here by the time the others arrive will you see about the tea lily  lilyeagerly sure i love to serve drinks if i were a man id be a bartenderin mexico or canada  marthagoing toward the study ill be with you again in a minute i hope she goes in and shuts the door behind her  estherpettishly even people touched by a smattering of science seem to get rude dont they  mrs davidsonharshly i have heard much silly talk of this being an age of free women and i have always said it was tommyrot pointing to the study she is an example she is more of a slave to curts hobbies than any of my generation were to anything but their children still more harshly where are her children  lilythey died aunt as children have a bad habit of doing then meaningly however i wouldnt despair if i were you mrs davidson stares at her fixedly  estherbetraying a sudden frightened jealousy what do you mean lily what are you so mysterious about what did she say what  lilymockingly mark your frau seems to have me on the stand can i refuse to answer there is a ring at the bell lily jumps to her feet excitedly here comes the rest of our grand fleet now ill have my tea she darts out to the hallway  esthershaking her head goodness lily is trying on the nerves jayson his two sons john and dick and johns wife emily enter from hallway in rear jayson the father is a short stout baldheaded man of sixty a typical smalltown new england bestfamily banker reserved in pose unobtrusively importanta placid exterior hiding querulousness and a fussy temper john junior is his father over again in appearance but pompous obtrusive purseandfamilyproud extremely irritating in his selfcomplacent air of authority emptily assertive and loud he is about forty richard the other brother is a typical young casino and country club member collegebred good looking not unlikable he has been an officer in the war and has not forgotten it emily john jrs wife is one of those small mouselike women who conceal beneath an outward aspect of gentle unprotected innocence a very active envy a silly pride and a mean malice the people in the room with the exception of mrs davidson rise to greet them all exchange familiar perfunctory greetings sheffield relinquishes his seat in front of the table to jayson going to the chair right front himself john and dick take the two chairs to the rear of table emily joins esther on the couch and they whisper together excitedly esther doing most of the talking the men remain in uncomfortable silence for a moment  dickwith gay mockery well the gangs all here looks like the league of nations then with impatience lets get down to cases folks i want to know why ive been summoned here im due for tournament mixeddoubles at the casino at five wheres the teaand has curt a stick in the cellar to put in it  lilyappearing in the doorway heres teabut no stick for you sot the maid brings in tray with tea things  johnheavily it seems it would be more to the point to inquire where our hostess  jaysonrousing himself again yes and where is curt  lilyworking at his book he called martha to take notes on something  estherwith a trace of resentment she left us as if she were glad of the excuse  lilystuff esther she knows how much curt depends on herand we dont  emilyin her quiet lisping voicewith the most innocent air martha seems to be a model wife but there is some quality to the way she says it that makes them all stare at her uneasily  lilyinsultingly how well you say what you dont mean emily twinkle twinkle little bat but im forgetting to do the honors tea everybody without waiting for any answer tea everybody the tea is served  jaysonimpatiently stop fooling lily lets get to our muttons did you talk with martha  lilybriskly i did sir  jaysonin a lowered voice what did she say  lilyshe said you could all go to the devil they all look shocked and insulted lily enjoys this then adds quietly oh not in those words martha is a perfect lady but she made it plain she will thank you to mind your own business  esthervolubly and just imagine shed even forgotten shed asked us here this afternoon and was going motoring with bigelow  lilywith his three children too dont forget  emilysoftly they have become such wellbehaved and intelligent children they say again all the others hesitate staring at her suspiciously  lilysharply youd better let martha train yours for a while emily im sure shed improve their mannersthough of course she couldnt give them any intelligence  emilywith the pathos of outraged innocence oh  dickinterrupting so its bigelow youre up in the air

country where they dont permit dueling isnt it dick  dickhis pose crumblingangrily go to the devil  sheffieldwith a calm judicious air this wrangling is getting us nowhere you say she was resentful about our wellmeant word to the wise jaysontestily surely she must realize that some consideration is due the position she occupies in bridgetown as curts wife  lilymartha is properly unimpressed by big frogs in tiny puddles and there you are  mrs davidsonoutraged the idea she takes a lot upon herselfthe daughter of a wild western coalminer  lilymockingly gold miner aunt  mrs davidsonit makes no differencea common miner sheffield keenly inquisitive just before the others came lily you gave out some hintsvery definite hints i should say  estherexcitedly yes you did lily what did you mean

son  dicksmartly lilys kidding you how can she know its a sonunless shes a clairvoyant  estherwith glad relief yes how stupid  lilyi am clairvoyant in this case allah is great and it will be a sonif only to make you and emily burst with envy among your daughters  estherlily  emilyoh  jaysontestily keep still for a moment lily for gods sake this is no subject to joke about remember  lilymartha told me i know that  jaysonand does curt know this  lilyno not yet martha has been afraid to tell him  jaysonah that explains matters you know i asked curt some time agoand he said it was impossible  emilywith a lift of her eyebrows impossible why what a funny thing to say  sheffieldkeenly lawyerlike and why is martha afraid to tell him lily  lilyits all very simple when the two died years ago they said they would never have one again martha thinks curt is still haunted by their memory and is afraid he will resent another as an intruder i told her that was all foolishnessthat a child was the one thing to make curt settle down for good at home here and write his books  jaysoneagerly yes i believe that myself pleased well this is fine news  emilystill it was her duty to tell curt dont

emilygrowing crimsonfalteringly ii didnt mean  johnfuriously where the honor of the family is at stake  lilyfiercely ssshh you empty barrel i think i hear the door from the study is opened and martha comes in in the midst of a heavy silence all the gentlemen rise stiffly martha is made immediately selfconscious and resentful by the feeling that they have been discussing her unfavorably  marthacoming forwardwith a forced cordiality how do you do everybody so sorry i wasnt here when you came i hope lily made proper excuses for me she goes from one to the other of the four latest comers with so glad you came etc they reply formally and perfunctorily martha finally finds a seat on the couch between emily and esther i hope lilybut i see youve all had tea  lilytrying to save the situationgayly yes you can trust me as understudy for the part of hostess any time  marthaforcing a smile well im glad to know i wasnt missed  emilysweetly we were talking about youat least we were

oh but you see i consider it my work too ive helped him with it so long now  jaysonin a forced tone and how is curts book coming martha  marthamore and more stung by their strained attitudes and inquisitive glances coldly and cuttingly finely thank you the book will cause quite a stir i believe it will make the name of jayson famous in the big world outside of bridgetown  mrs davidsonindignantly the name of jayson has been  jaysonpleadingly aunt elizabeth  lilyaunt means its world famous already martha pointing to the sullen john john was once a substitute on the yale

vixen what would you do if you had a sister like that martha  marthaid love herand try to understand her  sheffieldmeaningly shes a bad ally to rely onthis side of the fence one day and that the next  marthais that why you advised her to become a lawyer mr sheffield  sheffieldstung but maintaining an unruffled front now now that remark must be catalogued as catty  marthadefiantly it seems to be in the bridgetown atmosphere i never wasnot the least bitin the open air  jaysonconciliatingly oh bridgetown isnt so bad martha once you get used to us  johnits one of the most prosperous and wealthy towns in the usand that means in the world nowadays  emilywith her sugary smile that isnt what martha means you silly i know what shes thinking about us and im not sure that i dont agree with herpartly she feels that were so awfully strictabout certain things it must be so different in the far westi supposeso much freer  marthaacidly then you believe broadmindedness and clean thinking are a question of locality i cant agree with you i know nothing of the present far west not having lived there for ten years but curt and i have lived in the far east and im sure hed agree with me in saying that chinese ancestor worship is far more dignified than ours after all you know theirs is religion not snobbery there is a loud honking of an auto horn before the house martha starts seems to come to a quick decision and announces with studied carelessness that must be mr bigelow i suppose lily told you i had an engagement to go motoring with him so sorry i must leave but im like lily i need fresh air she walks to the study door as she is talking ill call curt she raps loudly on the door and calls curt come out its important she turns and goes to the door smiling fixedly hell be out

testily and do sit down the old lady plumps herself down again angrily  emilyin her lisp of hidden meanings yes the family mustnt forgether condition the door from the study is opened and curt appears his face shows his annoyance at being interrupted his eyes are preoccupied they all turn and greet him embarrassedly he nods silently and comes slowly down front  curtislooking around wheres martha whats the important thing she called me out for  estherforcing gaiety to play host you big bear you dont you think we came to see you too sit down here and be good he sits on sofa  emilysoftly martha had to leave us to go motoring with mr bigelow  estherhastily and the three children  curtisfrowning grumpily hm big and his eternal kids he sighs they exchange meaning glances curt seems to feel

workand i have always believed you did too  marthaquickly i did curt i do all in the past is our work its my greatest pride to think so but curt ill have to confess franklyduring the past two years ive felt myselffeeling as if i wasnt completewith that alone  curtismartha bitterly and all the time i believed that more and more it was becoming the aim of your life too  marthawith a sad smile im glad of that dear i tried my best to conceal it from you it would have been so unfair to let you guess while we were still in harness but oh how i kept looking forward to the time when we would come backand restin our own home you knowyou said that was your planto stay here and write your booksand i was hoping  curtiswith a gesture of aversion i loathe this bookwriting it isnt my part i realize

the longing for a child if you had just the tiniest bit of feminine in you forcing a smile but youre so utterly masculine dear thats what has made me love you i supposeso ive no right to complain of it intensely i dont i wouldnt have you changed one bit i love you and i love the things you loveyour workbecause its a part of you and thats what i want you to doto reciprocateto love the creator in meto desire that i too should complete myself with the thing nearest my heart  curtisintensely preoccupied with his own strugglevaguely but i thought  marthai know but after all your work is yours not mine i have been only a helper a good comrade too i hope butsomehowoutside of it all do you remember two years ago when we were camped in yunnan among the aboriginal tribes it was one night there when we were lying out in our sleepingbags up in the mountains along the tibetan frontier i couldnt sleep suddenly i felt oh so tiredutterly aloneout of harmony with youwith the earth under me i became horribly despondentlike an outcast who suddenly realizes the whole world is alien and all the wandering about the world and all the romance and excitement id enjoyed in it appeared an aimless futile business chasing around in a circle in an effort to avoid touching reality forgive me curt i meant myself not you of course oh it was horrible i tell you to feel that way i tried to laugh at myself to fight it off but it stayed and grew worse it seemed as if i were the only creature alivewho was not alive and all at once the picture came of a tribeswoman who stood looking at us in a little mountain village as we rode by she was nursing her child her eyes were so curiously sure of herself she was horribly ugly poor woman and yetas the picture came back to mei appeared to myself the ugly one while she was beautiful and i thought of our children who had diedand such a longing for another child came to me that i began sobbing you were asleep you didnt hear she pausesthen proceeds slowly and when we came back hereto have a home at last i was so happy because i saw my chance of fulfillmentbefore it was too late in a gentle pleading voice now can you understand dear she puts her hand on his arm  curtisstarting as if awaking from a sleep understand no i cant understand martha  marthain a gasp of unbearable hurt curt i dont believe you heard a word i was saying  curtisbursting forth as if releasing all the pentup struggle that has been gathering within him no i cant understand i cannot cannot it seems like treachery to me  marthacurt  curtisive depended on you this is the crucial pointthe biggest thing of my lifeand you desert me  martharesentment gathering in her eyes if you had listened to meif you had even tried to feel  curtisi feel that you are deliberately ruining my highest hope how can i go on without you ive been trying to imagine myself alone i cant even with my workwho can i get to take your place oh martha why do you have to bring this new element into our lives at this late day havent we been sufficient you and i together isnt that a more difficult beautiful happiness to achieve thanchildren everyone has children dont i love you as much as any man could love a woman isnt that enough for you doesnt it mean anything to you that i need you so terriblyfor myself for my workfor everything that is best and worthiest in me can you expect me to be glad when you propose to introduce a stranger who will steal away your love your interestwho will separate us and deprive me of you no no i cannot its asking the impossible i am only human  marthaif you were human you would think of my life as well as yours  curtisi do it is our life i am fighting for not mineour life that you want to destroy  marthaour life seems to mean your life to you curtand only your life i have devoted fifteen years to that now i must fight for my own  curtisaghast you talk as if we were enemies martha striding forward and seizing her in his arms no you dont mean it i love you so martha youve made yourself part of my life my worki need you so i cant share you with anyone i wont martha my own say that you wont dear he kisses her passionately again and again  marthaall her love and tenderness aroused by his kisses and passionate sincerityweakening curt curt pitiably it wont separate us dear cant you see he will be a link between useven when we are away from each otherthat he will bring us together all the closer  curtisbut i cant be away from you  marthamiserably oh curt why wont you look the fact in the faceand learn to accept it with joy why cant you for my sake i would do that for you  curtisbreaking away from herpassionately you will not do what i have implored youfor me and i am looking the fact in the facethe fact that there must be no fact avoiding her eyesas if defying his own finer feelings there are doctors who  marthashrinking back from him curt you propose thatto me with overwhelming sorrow oh curt when i feel himhis life within melike a budding of my deepest soulto flower and continue meyou say what you have just said griefstricken oh you never never never will understand  curtisshamefacedly martha idistractedly i

frightenedlysadly you have changed curt i remember it used to be your happiness to sacrifice yourself for me  curtisi had no work thenno purpose beyond myself to sacrifice oneself is easy but when your only meaning becomes as a searcher for knowledgeyou cannot sacrifice that martha you must sacrifice everything for thator lose all sincerity  marthai wonder where your work leaves off and you begin hasnt your work become you  curtisyes and no helplessly you cant understand martha   marthanor you  curtiswith a trace of bitter irony and you and your work arent they one and the same  marthaso you think mine is selfish too after a pausesadly i cant blame you curt its all my fault ive spoiled you by giving up my life so completely to yours youve forgotten i have one oh i dont mean that i was a martyr i know that in you alone lay my happiness and fulfillment in those yearsafter the children died but we are no longer what we were then we must both of us relearn to love and respectwhat we

your eyes you dont know  curtisfrightenedly martha stop this is terrible they continue to be held by each others fearfully questioning eyes  the curtain falls      act iii  scenesame as act ii as the curtain rises jayson is discovered sitting in an armchair by the fireplace in which a log fire is burning fitfully he is staring into the flames a strained expectant expression on his face it is about three oclock in the morning there is no light but that furnished by the fire which fills the room with shifting shadows the door in the rear is opened and richard appears his face harried by the stress of unusual emotion through the opened doorway a low muffled moan of anguish sounds from the upper part of the house jayson and richard both shudder the latter closes the door behind him quickly as if anxious to shut out the noise  jaysonlooking up anxiously well  richardinvoluntarily straightening up as if about to salute and report to a superior officer no change sir then as if remembering himself comes to the fireplace and slumps down in a chairagitatedly god dad i cant stand her moaning and screaming its got my nerves shot to pieces i thought i was hardened ive heard them out in no mans landdying by incheswhen you couldnt get to them or helpbut this is worsea million times after all that was warand they were men  jaysonmartha is having an exceptionally hard ordeal  richardsince three oclock this morningyesterday morning i should say its a wonder she isnt dead  jaysonafter a pause where is curt  richardharshly still out in the garden walking around bareheaded in the cold like a lunatic  jaysonwhy didnt you make him come in  richardmake him its easy to say hes in a queer state dad i can tell you theres something torturing him besides her pain  jaysonafter a pause yes theres a lot in all this we dont know about  richardi suppose the reason hes so down on the family is because weve rather cut her since that tea affair  jaysonhe shouldnt blame us she acted abominably and has certainly caused enough talk since thenalways about with bigelow  richardwith a sardonic laugh and yet he keeps asking everyone to send for bigelowsays he wants to talk to himnot us we cant understand he laughs bitterly  jaysonim afraid curt knows we understand too much agitatedly but why does he want bigelow in gods name in his present statewith the suspicions he must havetheres liable to be a frightful scene  richarddont be afraid of a scene with pitying scorn the hell of it is he seems to regard bigelow as his best friend damned if i can make it out  jaysoni gave orders that they were always to tell curt bigelow was out of town and couldnt be reached with a sigh what a frightful situation for all of us after a pause it may sound cruel of mebuti cant help wishing for all our sakes that this child will never  richardyes dad i know what youre thinking it would be the best thing for it tooalthough i hate myself for saying it there is a pause then the door in rear is opened and lily appears she is pale and agitated leaving the door open behind her she comes forward and flings herself on the lounge  jaysonanxiously well  lilyirritably getting up and switching on the lights isnt everything gloomy enough sits down i couldnt bear it upstairs one second longer esther and emily are coming down too its too much for themand theyve had personal experience trying to mask her agitation by a pretense at flippancy i hereby become a lifemember of the birthcontrol league lets let humanity ceaseif god cant manage its continuance any better than that  richardseriously second

on chair right rear  estherwith a sigh i thought i went through something when mine were bornbut this is too awful  emilyand according to john curt actually says he hates it isnt that terrible after a pausemeaningly its almost as if her suffering was a punishment dont you think  estherif it is shes being punished enough heaven knows it cant go on this way much longer or something dreadful will happen  emilydo you think the baby  estheri dont know i shouldnt say it but perhaps it would be better if  emilythats what i think  estheroh i wish i didnt have such evil suspicionsbut the way curt goes onhow can you help feeling theres something wrong  jaysonsuddenly how is curt  emilyjohn just came in from the garden turning around to where john is dozing in his chairsharply john well i never if he isnt falling asleep john he jerks up his head and stares at her blinking stupidly she continues irritably a nice time to pick out for a nap i must say  johnsurlily dont forget i have to be at the bank in the morning  jaysontestily i have to be at the bank tooand you dont notice me sleeping tell me about curt you just left him didnt you  johnirritably yes and ive been walking around that damned garden half the night watching over him isnt that enough to wear anyone out i can feel ive got a terrible cold coming on  estherimpatiently for goodness sake dont you start to pity yourself  johnindignantly im not i think ive showed my willingness to do everything i could if curt was only the least bit grateful he isnt he hates us all and wishes we were out of his home i would have left long ago if i didnt want to do my part in saving the family name from disgrace  jaysonimpatiently has he quieted down thats what i want to know  johnharshly not the least bit hes out of his headand id be out of mine if a child was being born to my wife that  jaysonangrily keep that to yourself remember you have no proof morosely think all you wantbut dont talk  emilypettishly the whole town knows it anyway im sure they must  jaysontheres only been gossipno real scandal lets do our united best to keep it at that after a pause wheres aunt elizabeth well have to keep an eye on her too or shes quite liable to blurt out the whole business before all comers  estheryou neednt be afraid shes forgotten all about the scandalous part no word of it has come to her out in the country and she hasnt set foot in town since that unfortunate tea remember and at present shes so busy wishing the child will be a boy that she hasnt a thought for another thing the door in the rear is opened and mark sheffield enters he comes up to the fire to warm himself the others watch him in silence for a moment  jaysonimpatiently well mark wheres curt  sheffieldfrowning inside i think hell be with us in a minute with a scornful smile just now hes phoning to bigelow the others gasp  jaysonfuriously for gods sake couldnt you stop him  sheffieldnot without a scene your aunt persuaded him to come into the houseand he rushed for the phone i think he guessed we had been lying to him  jaysonafter a pause then hebigelow will be here soon  sheffielddrily it depends on his sense of decency as he seems lacking in that quality ive no doubt hell come  johnrising to his feetpompously then i for one will go come emily since curt seems bound to disgrace everyone concerned i want it thoroughly understood that we wash our hands of the whole disgraceful affair  emilysnappishly go if you want to i wont then with a sacrificing air i think it is our duty to stay  jaysonexasperated sit down wash your hands indeed arent you as much concerned as any of us  sheffieldsharply sshh i think i hear curt now john sits down abruptly all stiffen into stony attitudes the door is opened and curt enters he is incredibly drawn and haggard a tortured bewildered expression in his eyes his hair is dishevelled his boots caked with mud he stands at the door staring from one to the other of his family with a wild contemptuous scorn and mutters  curtisliars well hes coming now then bewilderedly why didnt you want him to come eh hes my oldest friend ive got to talk to someoneand i cant to you wildly what do you want here anyway why dont you go a scream of marthas is heard through the doorway curt shudders violently slams the door to with a crash putting his shoulders against it as if to bar out the sound inexorablyin anguish god why must she go through such agony why why he goes to the fireplace as mark makes way for him flings himself exhaustedly on a chair his shoulders bowed his face hidden in his hands the others stare at him pityingly there is a long silence then the two women whisper together get up and tiptoe out of the room motioning for the others to follow them john does so sheffield starts to go then notices the preoccupied jayson who is staring moodily into the fire  sheffieldsstt as jayson looks upin a whisper lets go out and leave him alone perhaps hell sleep  jaysonstarting to follow sheffield hesitates and puts a hand on his sons shoulder curt remember im your father cant you confide in me ill do anything to help  curtisharshly no dad leave me alone  jaysonpiqued as you wish he starts to go  curtisand send big in to me as soon as he comes  jaysonstops appears about to objectthen remarks coldly very wellif you insist he switches off the lights he hesitates at the door uncertainly then opens it and goes out there is a pause then curt lifts his head and peers about the room seeing he is alone he springs to his feet and begins to pace back and forth his teeth clenched his features working convulsively then as if attracted by an irresistible impulse he goes to the closed door and puts his ear to the crack he evidently hears his wifes moans for he starts awayin agony  curtisoh martha martha martha darling he flings himself in the chair by the fireplacehides his face in his hands and sobs bitterly there is a ring from somewhere in the house soon after there is a knock at the door curtis doesnt hear at first but when it is repeated he mutters huskily come in bigelow enters curt looks up at him close that door big for gods sake  bigelowdoes sothen taking off his overcoat hat and throwing them on the lounge comes quickly over to curt i got over as soon as i could as he sees curts face he starts and says sympathetically by jove old man you look as though youd been through hell  curtisgrimly i have i am  bigelowslapping his back buck up then anxiously hows martha  curtisshes in hell too  bigelowattempting consolation youre surely not worrying are you martha is so strong and healthy theres no doubt of her pulling through in fine shape  curtisshe should never have attempted this after a pause ive a grudge against you big it was you bringing your children over here that first planted this in her mind  bigelowafter a pause ive guessed you thought that thats why you havent noticed meor themover here so much lately ill confess that i felt

certainly why not martha ought to be able to travel in a month or so  bigelowyes butdo you think it would be safe to take the child  curtiswith a bitter laugh yesi was forgetting the child wasnt i viciously but perhapsthen catching himself with a groan oh damn all children big  bigelowastonished curt  curtisin anguish i cant help itive fought against it but its theredeep down in meand i cant drive it out i cant  bigelowbewildered what curt  curtishatred yes hatred whats the use of denying it i must tell someone and youre the only one who might understand with a wild laugh for youhated

growing horror curt cant you realize how horrible  curtisyes its horrible ive told myself that a million times with emphasis but its true  bigelowseverely shut up youre not yourself come think for a moment what would martha feel if she heard you going on this way whyit would kill her  curtiswith a sobbing groan oh i know i know after a pause she read it in my eyes yes its horrible but when i saw her there suffering so frightfullyi couldnt keep it out of my eyes i tried to force it backfor her sakebut i couldnt i was holding her hands and her eyes searched mine with such a longing question in themand she read only my hatred there not my love for her and she screamed and seemed to try to push me away i wanted to kneel down and pray for forgivenessto tell her it was only my love for herthat i couldnt help it and then the doctors told me to leaveand now the door is locked against mehe sobs  bigelowgreatly moved this is only your damned imagination they put you out because you were in their way thats all and as for martha she was probably suffering so much  curtisno she read it in my eyes i saw that look in hersof horrorhorror of me  bigelowgruffly youre raving damn it  curtisunheeding it came home to her thenthe undeniable truth with a groan isnt it fiendish that i should be the one to add to her torturein spite of myselfin spite of all my will to conceal it she will never forgive me never and how can i forgive myself  bigelowdistractedly for gods sake dont think about it its absurdridiculous  curtisgrowing more calmin a tone of obsession shes guessed it ever since that day when we quarreledher birthday oh you can have no idea of the misery there has been in our lives since then you havent seen or guessed the reason no one has it has beenthe thought of it  bigelowcurt  curtisunheeding for years we had welded our lives together so that we two were sufficient each to each there was no room for a third and it was a fine free life we had madea life of new worlds of discovery of knowledge invaluable to mankind isnt such a life worth all the sacrifice it must entail  bigelowbut that life was your life curt  curtisvehemently no it was her life tooher work as well as mine she had made the life our lifethe work our work had she the right to repudiate what she had built because she suddenly has a fancy for a home children a miserable ease i had thought i was her home her children i had tried to make my life worthy of being that to her and i had failed i was not enough  bigelowcurt  curtisoh i tried to become reconciled i tried my damnedest i tried to love this child as i had loved those that died but i couldnt and so this being estranged us we loved as intensely as ever but it pushed us apart i grew to dread the idea of this intruder she saw this in me i denied itbut she knew there was something in each of us the other grew to hate and still we loved as never before perhaps for we grew to pity each others helplessness  bigelowcurt are you sure you ought to tell anyone this  curtiswaving his remark aside one day when i was trying to imagine myself without her and finding nothing but hopelessnessyet knowing i must goa thought suddenly struck mea horrible but fascinating possibility that had never occurred to me before with feverish intensity can you guess what it was  bigelowno and i think youve done enough morbid raving if you ask me  curtisthe thought that came to me was that if a certain thing happened martha could still go with me and i knew if it did happen that she would want to go that she would fling herself into the spirit of our work to forget that she would be mine more than ever  bigelowafraid to believe the obvious answer curt  curtisyes my thought was that the child might be born dead  bigelowrepelledsternly damn it man do you know what youre saying relentingly no curt old boy do stop talking if you dont ill send for a doctor damned if i wont that talk belongs in an asylum god man cant you realize this is your childyours as well as hers  curtisive tried i cannot there is some inexorable force in me  bigelowcoldly do you realize how contemptible this confession makes you out angrily why if you had one trace of human kindness in youone bit of unselfish love for your wifeone particle of pity for her suffering  curtisanguished i haveall the love and pity in the world for her thats why i cant help hatingthe cause of her suffering  bigelowhave you never thought that you might repay martha for giving up all her life to you by devoting the rest of yours to her  curtisbitterly she can be happy without me she will have this childto take my place intensely you think i would not give up my work for her but i would i will stay heredo anything she wishesif only we can make a new beginning againtogetheralone

emilyhadnt the doctor better  jaysonshhh he begins to recognize me curt  curtislooking around him bewilderedly yes suddenly remembrance comes and a spasm of intolerable pain contracts his features he

looking at each other bewilderedly  emilyputting all her venomous gratification into one word well  the curtain falls      act iv   scenesame as act i it is afternoon of a fine day three days later motors are heard coming up the drive in front of the house there is the muffled sound of voices the maid is seen going along the hall to the front door then the family enter from the rear first come jayson and esther with mrs davidsonthen lily dick and sheffieldthen john and his wife all are dressed in mourning the only one who betrays any signs of sincere grief is mrs davidson the others all have a strained look irritated worried or merely gloomy they seem to be thinking the worst is yet to come  jaysonleading mrs d who is weeping softly to the chair at left of tablefretfully please do sit down aunt she does so mechanically and do stop crying he sits down in front of table esther goes to couch where she is joined by emily mark goes over and stands in back of them dick and john sit at rear of table lily comes down front and walks about nervously she seems in a particularly fretful upset mood  lilytrying to conceal her feelings under a forced flippancy what ridiculous things funerals are anyway that stupid ministerwhining away through his nose why does the lord show such a partiality for men with adenoids i wonder  jaysontestily sshhh have you no respect for anything  lilyresentfully if i had id have lost it when i saw all of you pulling such long faces in the church where you knew you were under observation pah such hypocrisy and then to cap it all emily has to force out a few crocodile tears at the grave  emilyindignantly when i saw curtthats why i criednot for her  jaysonwhat a scene curt made i actually believe he wanted to throw himself into the grave  dickyou believe he wanted to why it was all mark and i could do to hold him wasnt it mark sheffield nods  jaysonintolerable i never expected hed turn violent like that hes seemed calm enough the past three days  lilycalm yes just like a corpse is calm  jaysondistractedly and now this perfectly mad idea of going away today to join that infernal expeditionleaving that child on our handsthe child he has never even looked at why its too monstrously flagrant hes deliberately flaunting this scandal in everyones face  johnfirmly he must be brought to time  sheffieldyes we must talk to himquite openly if were forced to after all i guess he realizes the situation more keenly than any of us  lilywho has wandered to window on right you mean you think he believeswell i dont and you had better be careful not to let him guess what you think pointing outside theres my proof there he is walking about with bigelow can you imagine curt doing thatif he thought for a moment  dickoh i guess curt isnt all fool he knows thats the very best way to keep people from suspecting  estherindignantly but wouldnt you think that bigelow personits disgusting his sticking to curt like this  sheffieldwell for one im becoming quite resigned to bigelows presence in the first place he seems to be the only one who can bring curt to reason then again i feel that it is to bigelows own interest to convince curt that he mustnt provoke an open scandal by running away without acknowledging this child  lilysuddenly bursting forth hysterically oh i hate you all of you i loathe your suspicionsand i loathe myself because im beginning to be poisoned by them too  emilyreally lily at this late hourafter the way curt has actedand her last words when she was dying  lilydistractedly i know shut up havent you told it

as she doesnt answer but goes out into the hall esther go with her and see that she doesnt  esthergets up with a jealous irritation shes only going up to see the baby shes simply forgotten everything else in the world  lilyindignantly she probably realizes what we are too mean to rememberthat the baby at least is innocent wait esther ill come with you  jaysonyes hurry she shouldnt be left alone esther and lily follow the old lady out rear  dickafter a pauseimpatiently well what next i dont see what good we are accomplishing may i run along he gets up restlessly as he is speaking and goes to the window  jaysonseverely you will stay if you please theres to be no shirking on anyones part it may take all of us to induce curt  sheffieldi wouldnt worry bigelow is taking that job off our hands i imagine  dicklooking out of the window he certainly seems to be doing his damnedest with a sneer the stage missed a great actor in him  jaysonworriedly but if bigelow should fail  sheffieldthen well succeed with a grim smile by god well have to  jaysoncurt has already packed his trunks and had them taken down to the stationtold me he was leaving on the five oclock train  sheffieldbut didnt you hint to him there was now this matter of the child to be considered in making his plans  jaysonlamely i started to he simply flared up at me with insane rage  dicklooking out the window say i believe

retire grumblingly but precipitately to the study closing the door behind them the front door is heard opening and a moment later curt and bigelow enter the room curts face is set in an expression of stony grief bigelow is flushed excited indignant  bigelowas curt sinks down on the couchpleading indignantly curt damn it wake up are you made of stone has everything ive said gone in one ear and out

door of the study is slowly opened and sheffield peers out cautiouslythen comes into the room followed by the others they all take seats as before curt ignores them  sheffieldclearing his throat curt  curtissuddenly what time is it do you know  sheffieldlooking at his watch two minutes to four  curtisimpatiently still an hour more of this  jaysonclearing his throat curtbefore he starts what he intends to say there is the sound of voices from the hall esther and lily help in mrs davidson to her former chair the old ladys face is again transformed with joy esther joins emily on the couch lily sits in chairfront right there is a long uncomfortable pause during which curt paces up and down  mrs davidsonsuddenly murmuring aloud to herselfhappily hes such a dear i could stay watching him forever  jaysontestily sshhh aunt then clearing his throat again surely youre not still thinking of going on the five oclock train are you curt  curtisyes  sheffielddrily then mr bigelow didnt persuade you  curtiscoldly and impatiently im not to be persuaded by big or anyone else and ill thank you not to talk any more about it they all stiffen resentfully at his tone  jaysonto curtin a pleading tone you mustnt be unreasonable curt after all we are your familyyour best friends in the worldand we are only trying to help you  curtiswith nervous vehemence i dont want your help you will help me most by keeping silent  emily with a meaning look at the otherssneeringly yes no doubt  esthersshhh emily  jaysonhelplessly but you see curt  sheffieldwith his best judicial air if youll all allow me to be the spokesman i think perhaps that ithey all nod and signify their acquiescence  well then will you listen to me curt this last somewhat impatiently as curt continues to pace eyes on the floor  curtiswithout looking at himharshly yes im listening what else can i do when youve got me cornered say what you like and lets get this over  sheffieldfirst of all curt i hope it is needless for me to express how very deeply we all feel for you in your sorrow but we sincerely trust that you are aware of our heartfelt sympathy they all nod a bitter cynical smile comes over lilys face  esthersuddenly breaking down and beginning to weep poor martha sheffield glances at his wife impatient at this interruption the others also show their irritation  emilypettishly esther for goodness sake curt hesitates stares at his sister frowningly as if judging her sinceritythen bends down over her and kisses the top of her bowed head impulsivelyseems about to break down himselfgrits his teeth and forces it backglances around at the others defiantly and resumes his pacing esther dries her eyes forcing a trembling smile the cry has done her good  sheffieldclearing his throat i may truthfully say we all feelas esther doeseven if we do not give ventwith an air of sincere sympathy i know how terrible a day this must be for you curt we all do and we feel guilty in breaking in upon the sanctity of your sorrow in any way but if you will pardon my saying so your own course of actionthe suddenness of your planshave made it imperative that we come to an understanding about certain thingsabout one thing in particular i might say he pauses curt goes on pacing back and forth as if he hadnt heard  jaysonplacatingly yes it is for the best curt  estheryes curt dear you mustnt be unreasonable  dickfeeling called upon to say something yes old man youve got to face things like a regular facts are facts this makes everybody uneasy  lilyspringing to her feet phew its close in here im going out in the garden you can call me when theseorationsare finished she sweeps out scornfully  jaysoncalling after her imperiously lily but she doesnt answer and he gives it up with a hopeless sigh  curtisharshly what time is it  sheffieldyou have plenty of time to listen to what ii should rather say wehave to ask you curt i promise to be brief but first let me again impress upon you that i am talking in a spirit of the deepest friendliness and sympathy with youas a fellowmember of the same family i may sayand with the highest ideals and the honor of that family always in view curt makes no comment sheffield unconsciously begins to adopt the alert keenness of the crossexaminer first let me ask you is it your intention to take that five oclock train today  curtisharshly ive told you that  sheffieldand then youll join this expedition to asia  curtisyou know that  sheffieldto be gone five years  curtisshrugging his shoulders more or less  sheffieldis it your intention to return here at any time before you leave for asia  curtisno  sheffieldand your determination on these plans is irrevocable  curtisirrevocable exactly please remember that  sheffieldsharply that being your attitude i will come bluntly to the core of the whole matterthe child whose coming into the world cost martha her life  curtissavagely her murderer you are right they all look shocked suspicious  sheffieldremonstratingly but suspiciously you can hardly hold the child responsible for the terrible outcome women die every day from the same cause keenly why do you attribute guilt to the child in this case curt  curtisit lives and martha is gonebut enough ive said i never wanted it mentioned to me will you please remember that  sheffieldsharply its name is jayson curtin the eyes of the law

in this affair  curtiswhy not am i not alonemore alone this minute than any creature on gods earth  sheffieldsoothingly in your great grief yes yes of course we all appreciateand we hate topersuasively yes it would be much wiser to postpone these practical considerations until you are in a calmer mood and if you will only give us the chancewhy not put off this precipitate departurefor a month sayand in the meantime  curtisharshly i am going when i said i was i must get away from this horrible holeas far away as i can i must get back to my work for only in it will i find martha again but youyou cant understand that what is the good of all this talking which leads nowhere  sheffieldcoldly youre mistaken it leads to this do you understand that your running away from this childon the very day of its mothers funeralwill have a very queer appearance in the eyes of the world  emilyand what are you going to do with the baby curt do you think you can run off regardless and leave it hereon our hands  curtisdistractedly ill give it this home and someoneanyoneesther lilycan appoint a nurse to live here and breaking down oh dont bother me  sheffieldsharply in the worlds eyes it will appear precious like a desertion on your part  curtisoh arrange it to suit yourselvesanything you wish  sheffieldquickly  ill take you at your word then let us arrange it this way you will remain here a month longer at least  curtisno  sheffieldignoring the interruption you can make plans for the childs future in that time become reconciled to it  curtisno  jaysonpleadingly
