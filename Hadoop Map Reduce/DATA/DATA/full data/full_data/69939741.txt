good giants dwarfs and fairies this book is gratefully dedicated     tingaling   in a far country of the east in a palace surrounded by orange groves where the nightingales sang and by silvery lakes where the soft fountains plashed there lived a fine old king for many years he had governed with great comfort to himself and to the tolerable satisfaction of his subjects his queen being dead his whole affection was given to his only child the princess aufalia and whenever he happened to think of it he paid great attention to her education she had the best masters of embroidery and in the language of flowers and she took lessons on the zithar three times a week  a suitable husband the son of a neighboring monarch had been selected for her when she was about two hours old thus making it unnecessary for her to go into society and she consequently passed her youthful days in almost entire seclusion she was now when our story begins a woman more beautiful than the roses of the garden more musical than the nightingales and far more graceful than the plashing fountains  one balmy day in spring when the birds were singing lively songs on the trees and the crocuses were coaxing the jonquils almost off their very stems with their pretty ways aufalia went out to take a little promenade followed by two grim slaves closely veiled she walked in the secluded suburbs of the town where she was generally required to take her lonely exercise today however the slaves impelled by a sweet tooth which each of them possessed thought it would be no harm if they went a little out of their way to procure some sugared creambeans which were made excellently well by a confectioner near the outskirts of the city while they were in the shop bargaining for the sugarbeans a young man who was passing thereby stepped up to the princess and asked her if she could tell him the shortest road to the baths and if there was a good eatinghouse in the neighborhood now as this was the first time in her life that the princess had been addressed by a young man it is not surprising that she was too much astonished to speak especially as this youth was well dressed extremely handsome and of proud and dignified mannersalthough to be sure a little travelstained and tiredlooking  illustration  when she had somewhat recovered from her embarrassment she raised her veil as if it was necessary to do so in speaking to a young man and told him that she was sure she had not the slightest idea where any place in the city wasthat she very seldom went into the city and never thought about the way to any place when she did gothat she wished she knew where those places were that he mentioned for she would very much like to tell him especially if he was hungry which she knew was not pleasant and no doubt he was not used to it but that indeed she hadnt any idea about the way anywhere but  there is no knowing how long the princess might have run on thus and her veil up all the time had not the two slaves at that moment emerged from the sugarbean shop the sight of the princess actually talking to a young man in the broad daylight so amazed them that they stood for a moment dumb in the door but recovering from their surprise they drew their cimeters and ran toward the prince for such his every action proclaimed him to be when this highborn personage saw them coming with drawn blades his countenance flushed and his eyes sparkled with rage drawing his flashing sword he shouted crouch varlets lie with the dust ye dogs and sprang furiously upon them  illustration  the impetuosity of the onslaught caused the two men to pause and in a few minutes they fell back some yards so fast and heavy did the long sword clash upon their upraised cimeters this contest was soon over for unaccustomed to such a vigorous method of attack the slaves turned and fled and the prince pursued them down a long street and up an alley and over a wall and through a garden and under an arch and over a courtyard and through a gate and down another street and up another alley and through a house and up a long staircase and out upon a roof and over several abutments and down a trapdoor and down another pair of stairs and through another house into another garden and over another wall and down a long road and over a field clear out of sight  when the prince had performed this feat he sat down to rest but suddenly bethinking himself of the maiden he rose and went to look for her  i have chased away her servants said he how will she ever find her way anywhere  if this was difficult for her the prince found that it was no less so for himself and he spent much time in endeavoring to reach again the northern suburbs of the city at last after considerable walking he reached the long street into which he had first chased the slaves and finding a line of children eagerly devouring a line of sugared creambeans he remembered seeing these confections dropping from the pockets of the slaves as he pursued them and following up the clew soon reached the shop and found the princess sitting under a tree before the door the shopkeeper knowing her to be the princess had been afraid to speak to her and was working away inside making believe that he had not seen her and that he knew nothing of the conflict which had taken place before his door  illustration  up jumped aufalia o i am so glad to see you again i have been waiting here ever so long but what have you done with my slaves  i am your slave said the prince bowing to the ground  but you dont know the way home said she and i am dreadfully hungry  having ascertained from her that she was the kings daughter and lived at the palace the prince reflected for a moment and then entering the shop dragged forth the maker of sugared creambeans and ordered him to lead the way to the presence of the king the confectioner crouching to the earth immediately started off and the prince and princess side by side followed over what seemed to them a very short road to the palace the princess talked a great deal but the prince was rather quiet he had a good many things to think about he was the younger son of a king who lived far away to the north and had been obliged to flee the kingdom on account of the custom of allowing only one fullgrown heir to the throne to live in the country  now thought he this is an excellent commencement of my adventures here is a truly lovely princess whom i am conducting to her anxious parent he will be overwhelmed with gratitude and will doubtless bestow upon me the government of a provinceorperhaps he will make me his vizierno i will not accept thatthe province will suit me better having settled this little matter to his mind he gladdened the heart of the princess with the dulcet tones of his gentle voice  on reaching the palace they went directly to the grand hall where the king was giving audience justly astounded at perceiving his daughter now veiled approaching under the guidance of a crouching sugarbean maker and a strange young man he sat in silent amazement until the prince who was used to court life had made his manners and related his story when the king had heard it he clapped his hands three times and in rushed twentyfour eunuchs  take said the monarch this bird to her bower and they surrounded the princess and hurried her off to the womens apartments  then he clapped his hands twice and in rushed twentyfour armed guards from another door  bind me this dog quoth the king pointing to the prince and they bound him in a twinkling  is this the way you treat a stranger cried the prince  aye said the king merrily we will treat you royally you are tired tonight and tomorrow you shall be lodged and feasted daintily and the day after we will have a celebration when you shall be beaten with sticks and shall fight a tiger and be tossed by a bull and be bowstrung and beheaded and drawn and quartered and we will have a nice time bear him away to his soft couch  illustration  the guards then led the prince away to be kept a prisoner until the day for the celebration the room to which he was conducted was comfortable and he soon had a plenteous supper laid out before him of which he partook with great avidity having finished his meal he sat down to reflect upon his condition but feeling very sleepy and remembering that he would have a whole day of leisure tomorrow for such reflections he concluded to go to bed before doing so however he wished to make all secure for the night examining the door he found there was no lock to it and being unwilling to remain all night liable to intrusion he pondered the matter for some minutes and then took up a wide and very heavy stool and having partially opened the door he put the stool up over it resting it partly on the door and partly on the surrounding woodwork so that if any one tried to come in and pushed the door open the stool would fall down and knock the intruders head off having arranged this to his satisfaction the prince went to bed  that evening the princess aufalia was in great grief for she had heard of the sentence pronounced upon the prince and felt herself the cause of it what other reason she had to grieve over the princes death need not be told her handmaidens fully sympathized with her and one of them nerralina the handsomest and most energetic of them all soon found by proper inquiry that the prince was confined in the fourth story of the tower of tears so they devised a scheme for his rescue each one of the young ladies contributed her scarf and when they were all tied together the conclave decided that they made a rope plenty long enough to reach from the princes window to the ground  thus much settled it only remained to get this means of escape to the prisoner this the lady nerralina volunteered to do waiting until the dead of night she took off her slippers and with the scarfrope rolled up into a ball under her arm she silently stepped past the drowsy sentinels and reaching the princes room pushed open the door and the stool fell down and knocked her head off her body lay in the doorway but her head rolled into the middle of the room  notwithstanding the noise occasioned by this accident the prince did not awake but in the morning when he was up and nearly dressed he was astonished at seeing a ladys head in the middle of the room  illustration  hallo said he heres somebodys head  picking it up he regarded it with considerable interest then seeing the body in the doorway he put the head and it together and finding they fitted came to the conclusion that they belonged to each other and that the stool had done the mischief when he saw the bundle of scarfs lying by the body he unrolled it and soon imagined the cause of the ladys visit  poor thing he said doubtless the princess sent her here with this and most likely with a message also which now i shall never hear but these poor women what do they know this rope will not bear a man like me well well this poor girl is dead i will pay respect to her  and so he picked her up and put her on his bed thinking at the time that she must have fainted when she heard the stool coming for no blood had flowed he fitted on the head and then he covered her up with the sheet but in pulling this over her head he uncovered her feet which he now perceived to be slipperless  illustration  no shoes ah me well i will be polite to a lady even if she is dead  and so he drew off his own yellow boots and put them on her feet which was easy enough as they were a little too big for her he had hardly done this and dressed himself when he heard some one approaching and hastily removing the fallen stool he got behind the door just as a fat old fellow entered with a broadsword in one hand and a pitcher of hot water and some towels in the other glancing at the bed and seeing the yellow boots sticking out the old fellow muttered gone to bed with his clothes on eh well ill let him sleep and so putting down the pitcher and the towels he walked out again but not alone for the prince silently stepped after him and by keeping close behind him followed without being heardhis politeness having been the fortunate cause of his being in his stockingfeet for some distance they walked together thus the prince intending to slip off at the first cross passage he came to it was quite dusky in the long hall way there being no windows and when the guard at a certain place made a very wide step taking hold of a rod by the side of the wall as he did so the prince not perceiving this walked straight on and popped right down an open trapdoor  nerralina not returning the princess was in great grief not knowing at first whether she had eloped with the prince or had met with some misfortune on the way to his room in the morning however the ladies ascertained that the rope was not hanging from the princes window and as the guards reported that he was comfortably sleeping in his bed it was unanimously concluded that nerralina had been discovered in her attempt and had come to grief sorrowing bitterly somewhat for the unknown mishap of her maid of honor but still more for the now certain fate of him she loved aufalia went into the garden and making her way through masses of rosetrees and jasmines to the most secluded part of the grounds threw herself upon a violet bank and wept unrestrainedly the tears rolling one by one from her eyes like a continuous string of pearls  now it so happened that this spot was the pleasure ground of a company of fairies who had a colony near by these fairies were about an inch and a half high beautifully formed and of the most respectable class they had not been molested for years by any one coming to this spot but as they knew perfectly well who the princess was they were not at all alarmed at her appearance in fact the sight of her tears rolling so prettily down into the violet cups and over the green leaves seemed to please them much and many of the younger ones took up a tear or two upon their shoulders to take home with them  there was one youth the handsomest of them all named tingaling who had a beautiful little sweetheart called lingating  each one of these lovers when they were about to return to their homes picked up the prettiest tear they could find tingaling put his tear upon his shoulder and walked along as gracefully as an egyptian woman with her waterjug while little lingating with her treasure borne lightly over her head skipped by her lovers side as happy as happy could be  dont walk out in the sun my dearest said tingaling your shinshiney will burst  burst o no tingy darling no it wont see how nice and big it is getting and so light look cried she throwing back her head i can see the sky through it and o what pretty colorsblue green pink andand the tear burst and poor little lingating sunk down on the grass drenched and drowned  horrorstricken tingaling dropped his tear and wept clasping his hands above his head he fell on his knees beside his dear one and raised his eyes to the blue sky in bitter anguish but when he cast them down again little lingating was all soaked into the grass then sterner feelings filled his breast and revenge stirred up the depths of his soul  this thing shall end he said hissing the words between his teeth no more of us shall die like lingating  so he ran quickly and with his little sword cut down two violets and of the petals he made two little soft bundles and tying them together with his garters he slung them over his shoulder full of his terrible purpose he then ran to the princess and going behind her clambered up her dress until he stood on her shoulder and getting on the top of her head he loosened a long hair and lowered himself down with it until he stood upon the under lashes of her left eye now his intention was evident those violet bundles were to end this thing they were to be crammed into the source of those fatal tears to the beauty of which poor lingating had fallen a victim  now we shall see said he if some things cannot be done as well as others and kneeling down he took one bundle from his shoulder and prepared to put it in her eye it is true that occupying the position he did he in some measure obstructed the ladys vision but as her eyes had been so long dimmed with tears and her heart overshadowed with sorrow she did not notice it  just as tingaling was about to execute his purpose he happened to look before him and saw to his amazement another little fairy on his knees right in front of him starting back he dropped the bundle from his hand and the other from his shoulder then upon his hands and knees he stared steadfastly at the little man opposite to him who immediately imitated him and there they knelt with equal wonder in each of their countenances bobbing at each other every time the lady winked then did tingaling get very red in the face and standing erect he took strong hold of the princesss upper eyelash to steady himself resolved upon giving that saucy fairy a good kick when to his dismay the eyelash came out he lost his balance and at the same moment a fresh shower of tears burst from her eyes which washed tingaling senseless into her lap  when he recovered he was still sticking to the princesss silk apron all unobserved as she sat in her own room talking to one of her maids who had just returned from a long visit into the country slipping down to the floor tingaling ran all shivering to the window to the seat of which he climbed and getting upon a chrysanthemum that was growing in a flowerpot in the sunshine he took off his shoes and stockings and hanging them on a branch to dry laid down in the warm blossom and while he was drying listened to the mournful tale that aufalia was telling her maid about the poor prince that was to die tomorrow the more he heard the more was his tender heart touched with pity and forgetting all his resentment against the princess he felt only the deepest sympathy for her misfortunes and those of her lover when she had finished tingaling had resolved to assist them or die in the attempt  but as he could not do much himself he intended instantly to lay their case before a giant of his acquaintance whose goodhumor and benevolence were proverbial so he put on his shoes and stockings which were not quite dry and hastily descended to the garden by means of a vine which grew upon the wall the distance to the giants castle was too great for him to think of walking and he hurried around to a friend of his who kept a liverystable when he reached this place he found his friend sitting in his stabledoor and behind him tingaling could see the long rows of stalls with all the butterflies on one side and the grasshoppers on the other  how do you do said tingaling seating himself upon a horseblock and wiping his face it is a hot day isnt it  yes sir said the liverystable man who was rounder and shorter than tingaling yes it is very warm i havent been out today  well i shouldnt advise you to go said tingaling but i must to business for im in a great hurry have you a fast butterfly that you can let me have right away  o yes two or three of them for that matter  have you that one asked tingaling that i used to take out last summer  that animal said the liverystable man rising and clasping his hands under his coattail i am sorry to say you cant have hes foundered  thats bad said tingaling for i always liked him  i can let you have one just as fast said the stablekeeper by the way how would you like a real good grasshopper  too hot a day for the saddle said tingaling and now please harness up for im in a dreadful hurry  yes sir right away but i dont know exactly what wagon to give you i have two firstrate new peapods but they are both out however i can let you have a nice easy johnnyjumpup if you say so  any thing will do said tingaling only get it out quick  in a very short time a butterfly was brought out and harnessed to a firstclass johnnyjumpup the vehicles used by these fairies were generally a cuplike blossom or something of that nature furnished instead of wheels with little bags filled with a gas resembling that used to inflate balloons thus the vehicle was sustained in the air while the steed drew it rapidly along  as soon as tingaling heard the sound of the approaching equipage he stood upon the horseblock and when the wagon was brought up to it he quickly jumped in and took the reins from the hostler get up said he and away they went  it was a long drive and it was at least three in the afternoon when tingaling reached the giants castle drawing up before the great gates he tied his animal to a hinge and walked in himself under the gate going boldly into the hall he went upstairs or rather he ran up the top rail of the banisters for it would have been hard work for him to have clambered up each separate step as he expected he found the giant whose name i forgot to say was turilira in his diningroom he had just finished his dinner and was sitting in his armchair by the table fast asleep this giant was about as large as two mammoths it was useless for tingaling to stand on the floor and endeavor to make himself heard above the roaring of the snoring which sounded louder than the thunders of a cataract so climbing upon one of the giants boots he ran up his leg and hurried over the waistcoat so fast that slipping on one of the brass buttons he came down upon his knees with great force  whew said he that must have hurt him after dinner too  jumping up quickly he ran easily over the bosom and getting on his shoulder clambered up into his ear standing up in the opening of this immense cavity he took hold of one side with his outstretched arms and shouted with all his might  turili turili turilira  startled at the noise the giant clapped his hand to his ear with such force that had not tingaling held on very tightly he would have been shot up against the tympanum of this mighty man  dont do that again cried the little fellow dont do that again its only metingaling hold your finger  recognizing the voice of his young friend the giant held out his forefinger and tingaling mounting it was carried round before the giants face where he proceeded to relate the misfortunes of the two lovers in his most polished and affecting style  the giant listened with much attention and when he had done said tingaling i feel a great interest in all young people and will do what i can for this truly unfortunate couple but i must finish my nap first otherwise i could not do anything please jump down on the table and eat something while i go to sleep for a little while  so saying he put tingaling gently down upon the table but this young gentleman having a dainty appetite did not see much that he thought he would like but cutting a grain of rice in two he ate the half of it and then laid down on a napkin and went to sleep  when turilira awoke he remembered that it was time to be off and waking tingaling he took out his great purse and placed the little fairy in it where he had very comfortable quarters as there was no money there to hurt him  dont forget my wagon when you get to the gate said tingaling sleepily rolling himself up for a fresh nap as the giant closed the purse with a snap turilira having put on his hat went downstairs and crossed the courtyard in a very few steps when he had closed the great gates after him he bethought himself of tingalings turnout which the fairy had mentioned as being tied to the hinge not being able to see anything so minute at the distance of his eyes from the ground he put on his spectacles and getting upon his hands and knees peered closely about the hinges  o here you are said he and picking up the butterfly and wagon he put them in his vest pocketthat is all excepting the butterflys head that remained fast to the hinge as the giant forgot he was tied then our lofty friend set off at a smart pace for the kings castle but notwithstanding his haste it was dark when he reached it  come now young man said he opening his purse wake up and let us get to work where is that prince you were talking about  well im sure i dont know said tingaling rubbing his eyes but just put me up to that window which has the vine growing beneath it that is the princesss room and she can tell us all about it  so the giant took him on his finger and put him in the window there in the lighted room tingaling beheld a sight which greatly moved him although she had slept but little the night before the princess was still up and was sitting in an easychair weeping profusely near her stood a maidofhonor who continually handed her fresh handkerchiefs from a great basketful by her side as fast as the princess was done with one she threw it behind her and the great pile there showed that she must have been weeping nearly all day getting down upon the floor tingaling clambered up the princesss dress and reaching at last her ear shouted into it  princess princess stop crying for im come  the princess was very much startled but she did not like the giant clap her hand to her ear for if she had she would have ruined the beautiful curls which stood out so nicely on each side tingaling implored her to be quiet and told her that the giant had come to assist her and that they wanted to know where the prince was confined  i will tell you i will show you cried the princess quickly and jumping up she ran to the window with tingaling still at her ear o you good giant she cried are you there if you will take me i will show you the tower the cruel tower where my prince is confined  fear not said the good giant fear not i soon will release him let me take you in my hands and do you show me where to go  are you sure you can hold me said the princess standing timidly upon the edge of the window  i guess so said the giant just get into my hands  and taking her down gently he set her on his arm and then he took tingaling from her hair and placed him on the tip of his thumb thus they proceeded to the tower of tears  here is the place said the princess here is the horrid tower where my beloved is please put me down a minute and let me cry  no no said the giant you have done enough of that my dear and we have no time to spare so if this is your princes tower just get in at the window and tell him to come out quickly and i will take you both away without making any fuss  that is the windowthe fourthstory one lift me up said the princess  but though the giant was very large he was not quite tall enough for this feat for they built their towers very high in those days so putting tingaling and the princess into his pocket he looked around for something to stand on seeing a barn near by he picked it up and placed it underneath the window he put his foot on it to try if it would bear him and finding it would for in those times barns were very strong he stood upon it and looked in the fourthstory window taking his little friends out of his pocket he put them on the windowsill where tingaling remained to see what would happen but the princess jumped right down on the floor as there was a lighted candle on the table she saw that there was some one covered up in the bed  o there he is said she now i will wake him up and hurry him away but just at that moment as she was going to give the sleeper a gentle shake she happened to perceive the yellow boots sticking out from under the sheet  o dear said she in a low voice if he hasnt gone to bed with his boots on and if i wake him he will jump right down on the floor and make a great noise and we shall be found out  so she went to the foot of the bed and pulled off the boots very gently  white stockings said she what does this mean i know the prince wore green stockings for i took particular notice how well they looked with his yellow boots there must be something wrong i declare let me run to the other end of the bed and see how it is there o my o my cried she turning down the sheet a womans head wrong both ways o what shall i do  letting the sheet drop she accidentally touched the head which immediately rolled off on to the floor  loose loose loose she screamed in bitter agony clasping her hands above her head what shall i ever do o misery misery me some demon has changed him all but his boots o despair despair  and without knowing what she did she rushed frantically out of the room and along the dark passage and popped right down through the open trap  whats up said the giant putting his face to the window whats all this noise about  o i dont know said tingaling almost crying but somebodys head is off and its a ladyall but the bootsand the princess has run away o dear o dear  come now said turilira tingaling get into my pocket i must see into this myself for i cant be waiting here all night you know  so the giant still standing on the barn lifted off the roof of the tower and threw it to some distance he then by the moonlight examined the upper story but finding no prince or princess brushed down the walls until he came to the floor and taking it up he looked carefully over the next story this he continued until he had torn down the whole tower and found no one but servants and guards who ran away in all directions like ants when you destroy their hills he then kicked down all those walls which connected the tower with the rest of the palace and when it was all level with the ground he happened to notice almost at his feet a circular opening like an entrance to a vault from which arose a very pleasant smell as of something good to eat stooping down to see what it was that caused this agreeable perfume he perceived that at the distance of a few yards the aperture terminated in a huge yellow substance in which upon a closer inspection he saw four feet sticking uptwo with slippers and two with green stockings  why this is strange said he and stooping down he felt the substance and found it was quite soft and yielding he then loosened it by passing his hand around it and directly lifted it out almost entire  by the beard of the prophet he cried but this is a cheese and turning it over he saw on the other side two heads one with short black hair and the other covered with beautiful brown curls  why here they are as im a living giant these must be the prince and princess stowed away in a cheese and he laughed until the very hills cracked  when he got a little over his merriment he asked the imprisoned couple how they got there and if they felt comfortable they replied that they had fallen down a trap and had gone nearly through this cheese where they had stuck fast and that was all they had known about it and if the blood did not run down into their heads so they would be pretty comfortable thank himwhich last remark the giant accounted for by the fact that when lovers are near each other they do not generally pay much attention to surrounding circumstances  this then said he rising is where the king hardens his cheeses is it well well its a jolly go and he laughed some more  o turilira cried tingaling looking out from the vestpocket im so glad youve found them  well so am i said the giant  then turilira still holding the cheese walked away for a little distance and sat down on a high bank intending to wait there until morning when he would call on the king and confer with him in relation to his newfound treasure leaning against a great rock the giant put the cheese upon his knees in such a manner as not to injure the heads and feet of the lovers and dropped into a very comfortable sleep  dont i wish i could get my arms out whispered the prince  o my whispered the princess  tingaling having now nothing to occupy his mind and desiring to stretch his legs got out of the vestpocket where he had remained so safely during all the disturbance and descended to the ground to take a little walk he had not gone far before he met a young friend who was running along as fast as he could  hallo tingaling cried the other is that you come with me and i will show you the funniest thing you ever saw in your life  is it far said tingaling for i must be back here by daylight  o no come on it wont take you long and i tell you its fun  so away they ran merrily vaulting over the hickorynuts or acorns that happened to be in their way in mere playfulness as if they were nothing they soon came to a large open space so brightly lighted by the moon that every object was as visible as if it were daylight scattered over the smooth green were thousands of fairies of tingalings nation the most of whom were standing gazing intently at a very wonderful sight  seated on a stone under a great tree that stood all alone in the centre of this plain was a woman without any head she moved her hands rapidly about over her shoulders as if in search of the missing portion of herself and encountering nothing but mere air she got very angry and stamped her feet and shrugged her shoulders which amused the fairies very much and they all set up a great laugh and seemed to be enjoying the fun amazingly on one side down by a little brook was a busy crowd of fairies who appeared to be washing something therein scattered all around were portions of the tower of tears much of which had fallen hereabouts  tingaling and his friend had not gazed long upon this scene before the sound of music was heard and in a few moments there appeared from out the woods a gorgeous procession first came a large band of music ringing bluebells and blowing honeysuckles then came an array of courtiers magnificently dressed and after them the queen of the fairies riding in a beautiful waterlily drawn by six royal purple butterflies and surrounded by a brilliant body of lords and ladies  this procession halted at a short distance in front of the ladyminusahead and formed itself into a semicircle with the queen in the centre then the crowd at the brook were seen approaching and on the shoulders of the multitude was borne a head they hurried as fast as their heavy load would permit until they came to the tree under which sat the headless nerralina who bed and all had fallen here when the giant tore down the tower then quickly attaching a long rope that they had put over a branch directly above the lady to the hair of the head they all took hold of the other end and pulling with a will soon hoisted the head up until it hung at some distance above the neck to which it had previously belonged now they began to lower it slowly and the queen stood up with her wand raised ready to utter the magic word which should unite the parts when they touched a deep silence spread over the plain and even the lady seemed conscious that something was about to happen for she stood up and remained perfectly still  there was but one person there who did not feel pleasure at the approaching event and that was a dwarf about a foot high very ugly and wicked who by some means or other had got into this goodly company and who was now seated in a crotch of the tree very close to the rope by which the crowd was lowering the ladys head no one perceived him for he was very much the color of the tree and there he sat alone quivering with spite and malice  illustration  at the moment the head touched the ivory neck the queen uttering the magic word dropped the end of the wand and immediately the head adhered as firmly as of old  but a wild shout of horror rang through all the plain for at the critical moment the dwarf had reached out his hand and twisted the rope so that when the head was joined it was wrong side foremostface back  just then the little villain stuck his head out from behind the branch and giving a loud and mocking laugh of triumph dropped from the tree with a yell of anger the whole crowd queen courtiers common people and all set off in a mad chase after the dwarf who fled like a stag before the hounds  all were gone but little tingaling and when he saw the dreadful distress of poor nerralina who jumped up and twisted around and ran backward both ways screaming for help he stopped not a minute but ran to where he had left the giant and told him as fast as his breathing would allow the sad story  rubbing his eyes turilira perceived that it was nearly day and concluded to commence operations he placed tingaling on his shirtfrill where he could see what was going on and taking about eleven strides he came to where poor nerralina was jumping about and picking her up put her carefully into his coattail pocket then with the cheese in his hand he walked slowly toward the palace  when he arrived there he found the people running about and crowding around the ruins of the tower of tears he passed on however to the great audience chamber and looking in saw the king sitting upon his throne behind a velvetcovered table holding an early morning council and receiving the reports of his officers concerning the damage as this hall and the doors thereof were of great size the giant walked in stooping a little as he entered  he marched right up to the king and held the cheese down before him  here your majesty is your daughter and the young prince her lover does your majesty recognize them  well i declare cried the king if that isnt my great cheese that i had put in the vaultflue to harden and my daughter and that young man in it what does this mean what have you been doing giant  then turilira related the substance of the whole affair in a very brief manner and concluded by saying that he hoped to see them made man and wife as he considered them under his protection and intended to see them safely through this affair and he held them up so that all the people who thronged into the hall could see  the people all laughed but the king cried silence and said to the giant if the young man is of as good blood as my daughter i have no desire to separate them in fact i dont think i am separating them i think its the cheese  come come said the giant turning very red in the face none of your trifling or ill knock your house down over your eyes  and putting the cheese down close to the table he broke it in half letting the lovers drop out on the velvet covering when they immediately rushed into each others arms and remained thus clasped for a length of time  they then slowly relinquished their hold upon each other and were exchanging looks of supreme tenderness when the prince happening to glance at his feet sprang back so that he almost fell off the long table and shouted  blood fire thunder wheres my boots boots slaves hounds get me my boots boots boots  illustration  o hes a prince cried the king jumping up i want no further proof hes a prince give him boots and blow horners blow beat your drums drummers join hands all clear the floor for a dance  and in a trice the floor was cleared and about five thousand couples stood ready for the first note from the band  hold up cried the giant hold up here is one i forgot and he commenced feeling in his pockets i know i have got her somewhere o yes here she is and taking the lady nerralina from his coattail pocket he put her carefully upon the table  every face in the room was in an instant the picture of horrorall but that of the little girl whose duty it was to fasten nerralinas dress every morningwho got behind the door and jumping up and clapping her hands and heels exclaimed good good now she can see to fasten her own frock behind  the prince was the first to move and with tears in his eyes he approached the luckless lady who was sobbing piteously  poor thing said he and putting his arm around her he kissed her what joy thrilled through nerralina she had never been kissed by a man before and it did for her what such things have done for many a young lady sinceit turned her head  blow horners blow shouted the king join hands all  seizing nerralinas hand and followed by the prince and princess who sprang from the table he led off the five thousand couples in a grand gallopade  the giant stood and laughed heartily until at last being no longer able to restrain himself he sprang into the midst of them and danced away royally trampling about twenty couples under foot at every jump  dance away old fellow shouted the king from the other end of the room dance away my boy and never mind the people  and the music blew louder and round they all went faster and faster until the building shook and trembled from the cellar to the roof  at length perfectly exhausted they all stopped and tingaling slipping down from the giants frill went out of the door  o said he wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes it was all so funny and every body was so happythatthat i almost forgot my bereavement     tingaling and the five magicians   tingaling for some weeks after the death of his young companion lingating seemed quite sad and dejected he spent nearly all his time lying in a halfopened rosebud and thinking of the dear little creature who was gone but one morning the bud having become a fullblown rose its petals fell apart and dropped little tingaling out on the grass the sudden fall did not hurt him but it roused him to exertion and he said o ho this will never do i will go up to the palace and see if there is anything going on so off he went to the great palace and sure enough something was going on he had scarcely reached the courtyard when the bells began to ring the horns to blow the drums to beat and crowds of people to shout and run in every direction and there was never such a noise and hubbub before  tingaling slipped along close to the wall so that he would not be stepped on by anybody and having reached the palace he climbed up a long trailing vine into one of the lower windows there he saw the vast audiencechamber filled with people shouting and calling and talking all at once the grand vizier was on the wide platform of the throne making a speech but the uproar was so great that not one word of it could tingaling hear the king himself was by his throne putting on the bulky boots which he only wore when he went to battle and which made him look so terrible that a person could hardly see him without trembling the last time that he had worn those boots as tingaling very well knew he had made war on a neighboring country and had defeated all the armies killed all the people torn down all the towns and cities and every house and cottage and ploughed up the whole country and sowed it with thistles so that it could never be used as a country any more so tingaling thought that as the king was putting on his war boots something very great was surely about to happen hearing a fizzing noise behind him he turned around and there was the prince in the courtyard grinding his sword on a grindstone which was turned by two slaves who were working away so hard and fast that they were nearly ready to drop then he knew that wonderful things were surely coming to pass for in ordinary times the prince never lifted his finger to do anything for himself  illustration  just then a little page who had been sent for the kings spurs and couldnt find them and who was therefore afraid to go back stopped to rest himself for a minute against the window where tingaling was standing as his head just reached a little above the windowseat tingaling went close to his ear and shouted to him to please tell him what was the matter the page started at first but seeing it was only a little fairy he told him that the princess was lost and that the whole army was going out to find her before he could say anything more the king was heard to roar for his spurs and away ran the little page whether to look again for the spurs or to hide himself is not known at the present day tingaling now became very much excited the princess aufalia who had been married to the prince but a month ago was very dear to him and he felt that he must do something for her but while he was thinking what this something might possibly be he heard the clear and distinct sound of a tiny bell which however no one but a fairy could possibly have heard above all that noise he knew it was the bell of the fairy queen summoning her subjects to her presence and in a moment he slid down the vine and scampered away to the gardens there although the sun was shining brightly and the fairies seldom assembled but by night there were great crowds of them all listening to the queen and keeping much better order than the people in the kings palace the queen addressed them in soulstirring strains and urged every one to do their best to find the missing princess in the night she had been taken away while the prince and everybody were asleep and now said the queen untying her scarf and holding it up away with you every one search every house garden mountain and plain in the land and the first one who comes to me with news of the princess aufalia shall wear my scarf and as this was a mark of high distinction and conveyed privileges of which there is no time now to tell the fairies gave a great cheer which would have sounded to you had you heard it like a puff of wind through a thicket of reeds and they all rushed away in every direction now though the fairies of this tribe could go almost anywhere through small cracks and keyholes under doors and into places where no one else could possibly penetrate they did not fly or float in the air or anything of that sort when they wished to travel fast or far they would mount on butterflies and all sorts of insects but they seldom needed such assistance as they were not in the habit of going far from their homes in the palace gardens tingaling ran as fast as he could to where a friend of his whom we have mentioned before kept grasshoppers and butterflies to hire but he found he was too lateevery one of them was taken by the fairies who had got there before him never mind said tingaling to himself ill catch a wild one and borrowing a bridle he went out into the meadows to catch a grasshopper for himself he soon perceived one quietly feeding under a cloverblossom tingaling slipped up softly behind him but the grasshopper heard him and rolled his big eyes backward drawing in his hindlegs in the way which all boys know so well whats the good of his seeing all around him thought tingaling but there is no doubt that the grasshopper thought there was a great deal of good in it for just as tingaling made a rush at him he let fly with one of his hindlegs and kicked our little friend so high into the air that he thought he was never coming down again he landed however harmlessly on the grass on the other side of a fence nothing discouraged he jumped up with his bridle still in his hand and looked around for the grasshopper there he was with his eyes still rolled back and his leg ready for another kick should tingaling approach him again but the little fellow had had enough of those strong legs and so he slipped along the fence and getting through it stole around in front of the grasshopper and while he was still looking backward with all his eyes tingaling stepped quietly up before him and slipped the bridle over his head it was of no use for the grasshopper to struggle and pull back for tingaling was astraddle of him in a moment kicking him with his heels and shouting hi hi  away sprang the grasshopper like a bird and he sped on and on faster than he had ever gone before in his life and tingaling waved his little sword over his head and shouted hi hi  so on they went for a long time and in the afternoon the grasshopper began to get very tired and did not make anything like such long jumps as he had done at first they were going down a grassy hill and had just reached the bottom when tingaling heard some one calling him looking around him in astonishment he saw that it was a little fairy of his acquaintance younger than himself named parsley who was sitting in the shade of a widespreading dandelion  hello parsley cried tingaling reining up what are you doing there  why you see tingaling said the other i came out to look for the princess  you cried tingaling a little fellow like you  yes i said parsley and sourgrass and i rode the same butterfly but by the time we had come this far we got too heavy and sourgrass made me get off  and what are you going to do now said tingaling  o im all right replied parsley i shall have a butterfly of my own soon  hows that asked tingaling quite curious to know  come here said parsley and so tingaling got off his grasshopper and led it up close to his friend see what ive found said parsley showing a cocoon that lay beside him im going to wait till this butterflys hatched and i shall have him the minute he comes out  the idea of waiting for the butterfly to be hatched seemed so funny to tingaling that he burst out laughing and parsley laughed too and so did the grasshopper for he took this opportunity to slip his head out of the bridle and away he went  tingaling turned and gazed in amazement at the grasshopper skipping up the hill and parsley when he had done laughing advised him to hunt around for another cocoon and follow his example  tingaling did not reply to this advice but throwing his bridle to parsley said there you would better take that you may want it when your butterflys hatched i shall push on  what walk cried parsley  yes walk said tingaling goodby  so tingaling travelled on by himself for the rest of the day and it was nearly evening when he came to a wide brook with beautiful green banks and overhanging trees here he sat down to rest himself and while he was wondering if it would be a good thing for him to try to get across he amused himself by watching the sports and antics of various insects and fishes that were enjoying themselves that fine summer evening plenty of butterflies and dragonflies were there but tingaling knew that he could never catch one of them for they were nearly all the time over the surface of the water and many a big fish was watching them from below hoping that in their giddy flights some of them would come near enough to be snapped down for supper there were spiders who shot over the surface of the brook as if they had been skating and all sorts of beautiful bugs and flies were theregreen yellow emerald gold and black at a short distance tingaling saw a crowd of little minnows who had caught a young tadpole and having tied a bluebell to his tail were now chasing the affrighted creature about but after a while the tadpoles mother came out and then the minnows caught it  while watching all these lively creatures tingaling fell asleep and when he awoke it was dark night he jumped up and looked about him the butterflies and dragonflies had all gone to bed and now the great nightbugs and buzzing beetles were out the katydids were chirping in the trees and the frogs were croaking among the long reeds not far off on the same side of the brook tingaling saw the light of a fire and so he walked over to see what it meant on his way he came across some wild honeysuckles and pulling one of the blossoms he sucked out the sweet juice for his supper as he walked along when he reached the fire he saw sitting around it five men with turbans and great black beards tingaling instantly perceived that they were magicians and putting the honeysuckle to his lips he blew a little tune upon it which the magicians hearing they said to one another there is a fairy near us then tingaling came into the midst of them and climbing up on a pile of cloaks and shawls conversed with them and he soon heard that they knew by means of their magical arts that the princess had been stolen the night before by the slaves of a wicked dwarf and that she was now locked up in his castle which was on top of a high mountain not far from where they then were  illustration  i shall go there right off said tingaling  and what will you do when you get there said the youngest magician whose name was zamcar this dwarf is a terrible little fellow and the same one who twisted poor nerralinas head which circumstance of course you remember he has numbers of fierce slaves and a great castle you are a good little fellow but i dont think you could do much for the princess if you did go to her  tingaling reflected a moment and then said that he would go to his friend the giant turilira but zamcar told him that that tremendous individual had gone to the uttermost limits of china to launch a ship it was such a big one and so heavy that it had sunk down into the earth as tight as if it had grown there and all the men and horses in the country could not move it so there was nothing to do but to send for turilira when tingaling heard this he was disheartened and hung his little head the best thing to do remarked alcahazar the oldest of the magicians would be to inform the king and his army of the place where the princess is confined and let them go and take her out  o no cried tingaling who if his body was no larger than a very small peapod had a soul as big as a watermelon if the king knows it up he will come with all his drums and horns and the dwarf will hear him a mile off and either kill the princess or hide her away if we were all to go to the castle i should think we could do something ourselves this was the longest speech that tingaling had ever made and when he was through the youngest magician said to the others that he thought it was growing cooler and the others agreed that it was after some conversation among themselves in an exceedingly foreign tongue these kind magicians agreed to go up to the castle and see what they could do so zamcar put tingaling in the folds of his turban and the whole party started off for the dwarfs castle they looked like a company of travelling merchants each one having a package on his back and a great staff in his hand when they reached the outer gate of the castle alcahazar the oldest knocked at it with his stick and it was opened at once by a shiny black slave who coming out shut it behind him and inquired what the travellers wanted  is your master within asked alcahazar  i dont know said the slave  cant you find out asked the magician  well good merchant perhaps i might but i dont particularly want to know said the slave as he leaned back against the gate leisurely striking with his long sword at the nightbugs and beetles that were buzzing about  my friend said alcahazar dont you think that is rather a careless way of using a sword you might cut somebody  thats true said the slave i didnt think of it before but he kept on striking away all the same  then stop it said alcahazar the oldest magician striking the sword from his hand with one blow of his staff upon this up stepped ormanduz the next oldest and whacked the slave over his head and then mahallah the next oldest struck him over the shoulders and akbeck the next oldest cracked him on the shins and zamcar the youngest punched him in the stomach and the slave sat down and begged the noble merchants to please stop so they stopped and he humbly informed them that his master was in  we would see him said alcahazar  but sirs said the slave he is having a grand feast  well said the magician were invited  o noble merchants cried the slave why did you not tell me that before and he opened wide the gate and let them in after they had passed the outer gate which was of wood they went through another of iron and another of brass and another of copper and then walked through the courtyard filled with armed slaves and up the great castle steps at the top of which stood the butler dressed in gorgeous array  whom have you here base slave cried the gorgeous butler  five noble merchants invited to my lords feast said the slave bowing to the ground  but they cannot enter the banqueting hall in such garbs said the butler they cannot be noble merchants if they come not nobly dressed to my lords feast  o sir said alcahazar may your delicate and farreaching understanding be written in books and taught to youth in foreign lands and may your profound judgment ever overawe your country but allow us now to tell you that we have gorgeous dresses in these our packs would we soil them with the dust of travel ere we entered the halls of my lord the dwarf  the butler bowed low at this address and caused the five magicians to be conducted to five magnificent chambers where were slaves and lights and baths and soap and towels and washrags and toothbrushes and each magician took a gorgeous dress from his pack and put it on and then they were all conducted with tingaling still in zamcars turban to the grand hall where the feast was being held here they found the dwarf and his guests numbering a hundred having a truly jolly time the dwarf who was dressed in white to make him look larger was seated on a high red velvet cushion at the end of the hall and the company sat crosslegged on rugs in a great circle before him he was drinking out of a huge bottle nearly as big as himself and eating little birds and judging by the bones that were left he must have eaten nearly a whole flock of them when he saw the five magicians entering he stopped eating and opened his eyes in amazement and then shouted to his servants to tell him who these people were who came without permission to his feast but as no one knew nobody answered the guests seeing the stately demeanor and magnificent dresses of the visitors thought that they were at least five great monarchs  my lord the dwarf said alcahazar advancing toward him i am the king of a far country and passing your castle and hearing of your feast i have made bold to come and offer you some of the sweettasting birds of my kingdom so saying he lifted up his richly embroidered cloak and took from under it a great silver dish containing about two hundred dozen hot smoking delicately cooked fat little birds under the dish were fastened lamps of perfumed oil all lighted and keeping the savory food nice and hot making a low bow the magician placed the dish before the dwarf who tasted one of the birds and immediately clapped his hands with joy great king he cried welcome to my feast slaves quick make room for the great king as there was no vacant place the slaves took hold of one of the guests and gave him what the boys would call a hist right through the window and alcahazar took his place then stepped forward ormanduz and said my lord the dwarf i am also the king of a far country and i have made bold to offer you some of the wine of my kingdom so saying he lifted his goldlined cloak and took from beneath it a crystal decanter covered with gold and ruby ornaments with one hundred and one beautifully carved silver goblets hanging from its neck and which contained about eleven gallons of the most delicious wine he placed it before the dwarf who having tasted the wine gave a great cheer and shouted to his slaves to make room for this mighty king so the slaves took another guest by the neck and heels and sent him slambang through the window and ormanduz took his place then stepped forward mahallah and said my lord the dwarf i am also the king of a far country and i bring you a sample of the venison of my kingdom so saying he raised his velvet cloak trimmed with diamonds and took from under it a whole deer already cooked and stuffed with oysters anchovies buttered toast olives tamarind seeds sweetmarjoram sage and many other herbs and spices and all piping hot and smelling deliciously this he put down before the dwarf who when he had tasted it waved his goblet over his head and cried out to the slaves to make room for this mighty king so the slaves seized another guest and out of the window like a shot he went and mahallah took his place then akbeck stepped up and said my lord the dwarf i am also the king of a far country and i bring you some of the confections of my dominions so saying he took from under his cloak of gold cloth a great basket of silver filagree work in which were creamchocolates and burnt almonds and spongecake and ladys fingers and mixtures and gingernuts and hoarhound candy and gumdrops and fruitcake and cream candy and mintstick and poundcake and rock candy and butter taffy and many other confections amounting in all to about two hundred and twenty pounds he placed the basket before the dwarf who tasted some of these good things and found them so delicious that he lay on his back and kicked up his heels in delight shouting to his slaves to make room for this great king as the next guest was a big fat man too heavy to throw far he was seized by four slaves who walked him spanish right out of the door and akbeck took his place then zamcar stepped forward and said my lord the dwarf i also am king of a far country and i bring you some of the fruit of my dominions and so saying he took from beneath his gold and purple cloak a great basket filled with currants as big as grapes and grapes as big as plums and plums as big as peaches and peaches as big as cantaloupes and cantaloupes as big as watermelons and watermelons as big as barrels there were about nineteen bushels of them altogether and he put them before the dwarf who having tasted some of them clapped his hands and shouted to his slaves to make room for this mighty king but as the next guest had very sensibly got up and gone out zamcar took his seat without any delay then tingaling who was very much excited by all these wonderful performances slipped down out of zamcars turban and running up towards the dwarf cried out my lord the dwarf i am also the king of a far country and i bring youand he lifted up his little cloak but as there was nothing there he said no more but clambered up into zamcars turban again as nobody noticed or heard him so great was the bustle and noise of the festivity his speech made no difference one way or the other after everybody had eaten and drunk until they could eat and drink no more the dwarf jumped up and called to the chief butler to know how many beds were prepared for the guests to which the butler answered that there were thirty beds prepared then said the dwarf give these five noble kings each one of the best rooms with a down bed and a silken comfortable and give the other beds to the twentyfive biggest guests as to the rest turn them out so the dwarf went to bed and each of the magicians had a splendid room and twentyfive of the biggest guests had beds and the rest were all turned out as it was pouring down rain and freezing and cold and wet and slippery for the weather was very unsettled on this mountain and all these guests who now found themselves outside of the castle gates lived many miles away and as none of them had any hats or knew the way home they were very miserable indeed  illustration  alcahazar did not go to bed but sat in his room and reflected he saw that the dwarf had given this feast on account of his joy at having captured the princess and thus caused grief to the king and prince and all the people but it was also evident that he was very sly and had not mentioned the matter to any of the company the other magicians did not go to bed either but sat in their rooms and thought the same thing and tingaling in zamcars turban was of exactly the same opinion so in about an hour when all was still the magicians got up and went softly over the castle one went down into the lower rooms and there were all the slaves fast asleep and another into one wing of the castle and there were half the guests fast asleep and another into the other wing and there were the rest of the guests fast asleep and alcahazar went into the dwarfs room in the centre of the castle and there was he fast asleep with one of his fists shut tight the magician touched his fist with his magic staff and it immediately opened and there was a key so alcahazar took the key and shut up the dwarfs hand again zamcar went up to the floor near the top of the house and entered a large room which was empty but the walls were hung with curtains made of snakes skins beautifully woven together tingaling slipped down to the floor and peeping behind these curtains saw the hinge of a door and without saying a word he got behind the curtain and sure enough there was a door and there was a keyhole and in a minute there was tingaling right through it and there was the princess in a chair in the middle of a great room crying as if her heart would break by the light of the moon which had now broken through the clouds tingaling saw that she was tied fast to the chair so he climbed up on her shoulder and called her by name and when the princess heard him and knew him she took him into her lovely hands and kissed him and cried over him and laughed over him so much that her joy had like to have been the death of him when she got over her excitement she told him how she had been stolen away how she had heard her favorite cat squeak in the middle of the night and how she had got up quickly to go to it supposing it had been squeezed in some door and how the wicked dwarf who had been imitating the cat was just outside the door with his slaves and how they had seized her and bound her and carried her off to this castle without waking up any of the kings household then tingaling told her that his five friends were there and that they were going to see what they could do and the princess was very glad to hear that you may be sure then tingaling slipped down to the floor and through the keyhole and as he entered the room where he had left zamcar in came alcahazar with the key and the other magicians with news that everybody was asleep when tingaling had told about the princess alcahazar pushed aside the curtains unlocked the door with the key and they all entered the next room  there sure enough was the princess aufalia but right in front of her on the floor squatted the dwarf who had missed his key and had slipped up by a back way the magicians started back on seeing him the princess was crying bitterly and tingaling ran past the dwarf who was laughing too horribly to notice him and climbing upon the princesss shoulder sat there among her curls and did his best to comfort her  anyway said he i shall not leave you again and he drew his little sword and felt as big as a house the magicians now advanced towards the dwarf but he it seems was a bit of a magician himself for he waved a little wand and instantly a strong partition of iron wire rose up out of the floor and reaching from one wall to the other separated him completely from the five men the magicians no sooner saw this than they cried out o ho mr dwarf is that your game  yes said the little wretch chuckling can you play at it  a little said they and each one pulled from under his cloak a long file and filing the partition from the wall on each side which only needed a few strokes from their sharp files they pulled it entirely down but before the magicians could reach him the dwarf again waved his wand and a great chasm opened in the floor before them which was too wide to jump over and so deep that the bottom could not be seen  o ho cried the magicians another game eh  yes indeed cried the dwarf just let me see you play at that  each of the magicians then took from under his magic cloak a long board and putting them over the chasm they began to walk across them but the dwarf jumped up and waved his wand and water commenced to fall on the boards where it immediately froze and they were so slippery that the magicians could hardly keep their feet and could not make one step forward even standing still they came very near falling off into the chasm below i suppose you can play at that said the dwarf and the magicians replied  illustration  o yes and each one took from under his cloak a pan of ashes and sprinkled the boards and walked right over but before they reached the other edge the dwarf pushed the chair which was on rollers up against the wall behind him which opened and instantly the princess tingaling and the dwarf disappeared and the wall closed up without saying a word the magicians each drew from beneath his cloak a pickaxe and they cut a hole in the wall in a few minutes there was a large room on the other side but it was entirely empty so they sat down and got out their magical calculators and soon discovered that the princess was in the lowest part of the castle but the magical calculators being a little out of order they could not show exactly her place of confinement then the five hurried downstairs where they found the slaves still asleep but one poor little boy whose business it was to get up early every morning and split kindling wood having had none of the feast was not very sleepy and woke up when he heard footsteps near him the magicians asked him if he could show them to the lowest part of the castle all right said he this way and he led them to where there was a great black hole with a windlass over it get in the bucket said he and i will lower you down  bucket cried alcahazar is that a well  to be sure it is said the boy who had nothing on but the babyclothes he had worn ever since he was born and which as he was now about ten years old had split a good deal in the back and arms but in length they were very suitable  but there can be no one down there said the magician i see deep water  of course there is nobody there replied the boy were you told to go down there to meet anybody because if you were you had better take some tubs down with you to sit in but all i know about it is that its the lowest part of this old hole of a castle  boy said alcahazar there is a young lady shut up down here somewhere do you know where she is  how old is she asked the boy  about seventeen said the magician  o then if she is no older than that i should think shed be in the preservecloset if she knew where it was and the boy pointed to a great door barred and locked where the dwarf who had a very sweet tooth kept all his preserves locked up tight and fast zamcar stooped and looked through the keyhole of this door and there sure enough was the princess so the boy proved to be smarter than all the magicians each of our five friends now took from under his cloak a crowbar and in a minute they had forced open the great door but they had scarcely entered when the dwarf springing on the arm of the chair to which the princess was still tied drew his sword and clapped it to her throat crying out that if the magicians came one step nearer he would slice her head off  o ho cried they is that your game  yes indeed said the chuckling dwarf can you play at it  the magicians did not appear to think that they could but tingaling who was still on the princesss shoulder though unseen by the dwarf suddenly shouted i can play and in an instant he had driven his little sword into the dwarfs eye who immediately sprang from the chair with a howl of anguish while he was yelling and skipping about with his hands to his eyes the poor boy who hated him worse than pills clapped a great jar of preserves over him and sat down on the bottom of the jar the magicians then untied the princess and as she looked weak and faint zamcar the youngest took from under his cloak a little table set with everything hot and nice for supper and when the princess had eaten something and taken a cup of tea she felt a great deal better alcahazar lifted up the jar from the dwarf and there was the little rascal so covered up with sticky jam that he could not speak and could hardly move so taking an oilcloth bag from under his cloak alcahazar dropped the dwarf into it and tied it up and hung it to his girdle the two youngest magicians made a sort of chair out of a shawl and they carried the princess on it between them very comfortably and as tingaling still remained on her shoulder she began to feel that things were beginning to look brighter they then asked the poor boy what he would like best as a reward for what he had done and he said that if they would shut him up in that room and lock the door tight and lose the key he would be happy all the days of his life so they left the boy who knew what was good and was already sucking away at a jar of preserved greengages in the room and they shut the door and locked it tight and lost the key and he lived there for ninetyone years eating preserves and when they were all gone he died all that time he never had any clothes but his babyclothes and they got pretty sticky before his death then our party left the castle and as they passed the slaves still fast asleep the three oldest magicians took from under their cloaks wateringpots filled with water that makes men sleep and they watered the slaves with it until they were wet enough to sleep a week when they went through the gates of copper brass iron and wood they left them all open behind them they had not gone far before they saw seventyfive men all sitting in a row at the side of the road and looking woefully indeed they had been wet to the skin and were now frozen stiff not one of them being able to move anything but his eyelids and they were all crying as if their hearts would break so the magicians stopped and the three oldest each took from under his cloak a pair of bellows and they blew hot air on the poor creatures until they were all thawed then alcahazar told them to go up to the castle and take it for their own and live there all the rest of their lives he informed them that the dwarf was his prisoner and that the slaves would sleep for a week  illustration  when the seventyfive guests for those who had been taken from the feast had joined their comrades heard this they all started up and ran like deer for the castle and when they reached it they woke up their comrades and took possession and lived there all their lives the man who had been first thrown through the window and who had broken the way through the glass for the others was elected their chief because he had suffered the most and excepting the trouble of doing their own work for a week until the slaves awoke these people were very happy ever afterwards  it was just daylight when our party left the dwarfs castle and by the next evening they had reached the palace the army had not got back and there was no one there but the ladies of the princess when these saw their dear mistress there was never before such a kissing and hugging and crying and laughing tingaling came in for a good share of praise and caressing and if he had not slipped away to tell his tale to the fairy queen there is no knowing what would have become of him the magicians sat down outside of the princesss apartments to guard her until the army should return and the ladies would have kissed and hugged them in their gratitude and joy if they had not been such dignified and grave personages  now the king the prince and the great army had gone miles and miles away in the opposite direction to the dwarfs castle and the princess and her ladies could not think how to let them know what had happened as for ringing the great bell they knew that that would be useless for they would never hear it at the distance they were and so they wished that they had some fireworks to set off therefore zamcar the youngest magician offered to go up to the top of the palace and set off some so when he got up to the roof he lifted up his cloak and took out some fireworks and set them off and the light shone for miles and miles and the king and all his army saw it the king had just begun to feel tired and to think that he would pitch his tent and rest for the night by the side of a pleasant stream they had reached when he saw the light from the palace and instantly knew that there had been tidings of the princesskings are so smart you know so when his slaves came to ask him where they should pitch his tent he shouted pitch it in the river tention army right about face for homemarch and away the whole army marched for home the band playing the lively air of    cream cakes for supper       heigh o heigh o   o cream cakes for supper       heigh o heigh o  so as to keep up the spirits of the tired men when they approached the palace which was all lighted up there was the princess standing at the great door in her sunday clothes and looking as lovely as a fullblown rose the king jumped from his highmettled racer and went up the steps two at a time but the prince springing from his fiery steed bounded up three steps at once and got there first when he and the king had got through hugging and kissing the princess her sunday clothes looked as if they had been worn a week  illustration  now then for supper said the king and i hope its ready but the princess said never a word for she had forgotten all about supper and all the ladies hung their heads and were afraid to speak but when they reached the great hall they found that the magicians had been at work and had cooked a grand supper there it was on ever so many long tables all smoking hot and smelling delightfully so they all sat down for there was room enough for every man and nobody said a word until he was as tight as a drum  when they had all had enough and were just about to begin to talk there were heard strains of the most delightful soft music and directly in at a window came the queen of the fairies attended by her court all mounted on beautiful golden moths and dragonflies when they reached the velvet table in front of the throne where the king had been eating with his plate on his lap they arranged themselves in a circle on the table and the queen spoke out in a clear little voice that could have been heard almost anywhere and announced to the king that the little tingaling who now wore her royal scarf was the preserver of his daughter  o ho said the king and what can i do for such a mite as you my fine little fellow  then tingaling who wanted nothing for himself and only thought of the good of his people made a low bow to the king and shouted at the top of his voice your royal gardeners are going to make asparagus beds all over our fairy pleasure grounds if you can prevent that i have nothing more to ask  blow horner blow cried the king and hear all men if any man woman or child from this time henceforward forever shall dare to set foot in the garden now occupied by the fairies he shall be put to death he and all his family and his relations as far as they can be traced take notice of that every one of you  tingaling then bowed his thanks and all the people made up their minds to take very particular notice of what the king had said  then the magicians were ordered to come forward and name their reward but they bowed their heads and simply besought the king that he would grant them seven rye straws the peeling from a red apple and the heel from one of his old slippers what in the name of common sense they wanted with these no one but themselves knew but magicians are such strange creatures when these valuable gifts had been bestowed upon them the five good magicians departed leaving the dwarf for the king to do what he pleased with this little wretch was shut up in an iron cage and every day was obliged to eat three codfish a bushel of irish potatoes and eleven pounds of bran crackers and to drink a gallon of cambric tea all of which things he despised from the bottom of his miserable little heart  illustration  now cried the king all is settled and let everybody go to bed there is room enough in the palace for all to sleep tonight form in line and to bedmarch so they all formed in line and began to march to bed to the music of the band and the fairies their little horns blowing and with tingaling at the post of honor by the queen took up their line of march out of the window to the garden which was to be henceforward forever their own just as they were all filing out in flew little parsley on the back of his butterfly which had been hatched out at last  hello cried he is it all over  pretty nearly said tingaling its just letting out how came you to be so late  easy enough said poor little parsley of all the mean things that ever was the pokiest long time in unwrapping its wings this butterflys the meanest     the magical music   there was once an excessively mighty king barradin the great who died leaving no sons or daughters or any relation on the face of the earth to inherit his crown so his throne at the time of which i write was vacant this mighty king had been of a very peculiar disposition unlike other potentates he took no delight in going to war or in cutting off peoples heads or in getting married or building palaces but he was a great musician all that he cared for seemed to be music and the whole of his leisure time with a great many of his business hours was occupied in either composing or performing music of some kind everybody around him was obliged to be musical and if one was not so it would be of no use for him to apply for any situation his prime minister played on the violin his secretary performed on the horn while his treasurer was superb upon the great drum every time the royal council met the minutes of the last meeting all set to music were sung by the secretary and when the king made a speech he always sung it in a magnificent bass voice accompanied by a full orchestra if any one wished to present a petition he was always sure of having it granted if he could but sing it excellently well and even folks who were good at whistling were favorably received at court the example of the king was followed by the people they nearly always talked to some tune and every one but the very poorest owned an instrument  so this mighty monarch never went to war or cut off peoples heads or married more than once and as for building palaces it was of no use for he had as many as he wanted already the last ten years of his life were occupied almost entirely in the composition of a wonderful piece of music in which he sought by means of perseverance and magic to combine all the beauties and difficulties of the science he had scarcely finished it when he died and it was generally supposed that if he had not worked so hard at it he would have lived much longer  the composition was not long for you could have sung it in ten minutes that is if you could have sung it at all which is by no means likely for had that been the case and you had lived in those days you might have ruled over the country for just before the mighty king died he made a decree to this effectthat his successor on the throne should be the man woman or child who could at sight sing that piece of music  so the music was put up against a marble tablet in the great hall of the royal palace and there were six judges appointedthe most distinguished professors of music in the countryand these sat on great velvet chairs three on each side of the music and anybody might come to try who chose  you may well believe that the people came in crowds for nearly every one wished to be king or queen as the case might be this music had a very singular effect upon most of those who did not succeed in singing it they nearly all went crazy the first few notes were easy and they were so beautiful that it was enough to make any one crazy to think that they could not sing the rest of itnot to mention missing the crown the prime minister had on this account a great asylum built to which the disappointed candidates were immediately conveyed and the house was very soon filled indeed it was often necessary to build extensions to the main building and it was not long before this was the largest edifice in the country it is true that although every one failed to sing the music they did not all go crazy but they were taken to the asylum the same as the rest and if they were not crazy when they got there they soon became so and thus it amounted to pretty much the same thing in the end well the judges sat in their chairs until they died at a good old age and they were succeeded by others just as learned latterly there were not so many applications as there used to be but still every few days some one went out to the asylum years passed and the offices of the judges became sinecures but they had to sit there all the same just as if they expected to be busy and they might have been seen whenever anybody chose to step in during the day sitting there with their chins on their breasts fast asleep the prime minister and after him his son ruled the country very well and people began to feel as if they didnt care if they never had a king or a queen to govern them as a rule they all felt very comfortable without anything of the kind  now it so happened that about this time a certain young prince accompanied by an old gentleman to take care of him was travelling in this great kingdom his fathers dominion was very many miles away but the prince had been journeying in this direction for quite a long time taking things easily and seeing everything that was to be seen his mother had died when he was quite young and his father had lately married the daughter of a gnome probably because their estates joinedhis stretching for many miles over the surface of the earth while hers lay immediately beneath them the prince did not like his gnome stepmother who was you know one of those large underground fairies who are more like human beings than any others and when a little gnomebaby was born he could stand it no longer and so obtained permission of his father to travel for the good of his body and mind so he had been going from country to country until he reached the capital city of the great kingdom  illustration  there the prince saw enough to fill him with wonder for the rest of his life his old friend trumkard took him day by day into the bazaars and the palaces and the mosques and hundreds of places just as nice one beautiful evening the prince set out for a walk by himself through the city the gentle twilight still tinged the sky with gold and the soft breeze from the river that passed through fruitgardens and vineyards on its way to the city smelt of peaches and grapes and plums and oranges and pomegranates and pineapples and was truly very delicious everything was lovely and the prince felt good and happy the very beggars when he had passed them blessed the happy stars that had caused them to be born during his lifetime so noble and generous was the prince this evening strolling along he came to the palace of the mighty king the prince knew the palace for trumkard had taken him into it and had shown him the six judges sitting in their velvet chairs and the magical music hanging up against the marble tablet between them he knew all about the music and the conditions attached to it but not being much of a musician he had never felt inclined to try it so he walked through the royal courts and vestibules and into the great hall where stood the six chairsempty and covered with silken covers to keep the dust off during the night and the music was concealed by a great plate of gold which was locked over it every night he met but few persons for every one who was not detained by some particular duty had gone outofdoors that lovely night here and there a porter or a black eunuch or a soldier or two he met but as every one who saw him knew him instantly for a prince of good blood he could of course wander where he pleased he passed on among the golden columns and sculptured doorways and under vaulted and arabesque ceilings until he came to a door of motherofpearl which had a golden lock an alabaster knob and a diamond keyhole it turned easily on silver hinges and the prince passed by it into a beautiful garden he had never been in such a place of loveliness the trees were hung with many softcolored lamps and the fruit glittered and shone in gorgeous colors on the branches every nightbird sang and every nightflower was giving forth its fragrance in the middle of the garden was a fountain the waters of which rose in a single jet from the centre and then as they fell back into the basin each of their thousand drops struck upon a silver harpstring causing the most delightful sounds to fill the air and mingle with the songs of the birds and the perfume of the flowers around the great basin were silken cushions on which the prince reclined and the goldfish that were swimming in the basin came up to him to be fed there also came the ruby fish that shines as red as blood and the zimphare or transparent fish which is as colorless as the water and can only be discovered by a green knot on its head and another on its tail  there were also many other fish as the balancefish which comes up to the top of the water equally balanced having at each end of its body expansions like the pans of scales these are its mouths and if one puts a crumb into one of them without having put one into the other it turns right over and sinks to the bottom so when this fish is properly fed it always gets two crumbs at a time then there was the gelatine fish that has no mouth at all but is very soft and pulpy and all that is necessary is to drop some crumbs upon his back and they immediately soak in also the great flob was there who came clattering and clanking up from the bottom of the basin with his hard shells and heavy claws as if he was the greatest fish alive but for all that he opened his mouth so wide and shut it upon a little crumb with a snap loud enough for a loaf of bread his throat was so small that that little crumb nearly choked him all these fishes the prince fed from golden baskets filled with crumbs and placed around the basin for the convenience of those who wished to amuse themselves by feeding the fish when he was tired of this sport he rose and entered the palace again by another door he had not walked far along an alabaster corridor before he saw a door open and an old woman come out she had in her hand a silver waiter on which was the remains of a delicious little supper the scent of which seemed so charming to the prince that it made him feel as hungry as a bear in the springtime the old woman who was busy munching some of the pieces of cake and sucking the bones of the little birds that were left did not notice him and hoping to find some more good things where these came from he slipped in at the door before the old woman shut it and entered a large and beautiful room lighted by a single lamp that hung from the ceiling at the upper end of this apartment he was surprised to see a beautiful young princess who was sitting in an armchair fast asleep with a guitar on the floor at her feet around the room were placed musical instruments of all kinds but there was no one there to play on them but the princess and she was fast asleep  there was a breeze in the room that seemed to come and go like the waves of the sea and the prince could not imagine what occasioned it for all the doors and windows were closed however looking upwards he saw behind the princesss chair the reason of the wind and the ladys slumber standing behind her with his feet on the floor and his head high up in the obscurity of the ceiling was a great nimshee or evil spirit of the ocean who was fanning her with his wings and had put her to sleep with their slow and dreamy motion with his great eyes glowing like meteors in the dimness of the upper part of the room the nimshee glared at the prince and waved his wings faster and stronger but our young friend was not afraid of himnot a bit he walked softly round the room once or twice and then returning to the princess spoke to her she did not awake and the prince called her louder and louder and at last putting his hand on her shoulder he shook her but still she slept he felt that he must awaken her and seizing the guitar that lay at her feet he held it close to her ear and struck the strings loudly the princess opened her eyes with a start and as she awoke the nimshee beating his breast with his wings gave a great roar like the waves beating in a storm against a rocky coast and flew away the princess blushed a little when she first saw the prince but he was so polite that she soon recovered herself and they conversed quite pleasantly  she explained the meaning of the musical instruments in the room by stating that she had a great passion for music and the good people of the palace brought her a new instrument nearly every day but she never sat down to play any of them but she went almost immediately to sleep she could not imagine the reason for this but the prince knew very well that the nimshee had put her to sleep today at any rate and he had no doubt but that he was always at the bottom of it he said nothing to her however of what he had seen as he perceived that she did not know it and he did not wish to frighten her  she said she had taken her guitar that evening as soon as she had finished her supper but had fallen asleep as usual she asked the prince do you play and he said only a little and then they walked around the room and looked at all the instruments to see if there were any that the prince could play on better than the rest he wished her to perform but she urged him and he soon saw a handorgan and said he was pretty sure that he could play on that so he tried and sure enough he could play very well and the princess sat down on the floor by him and he played for almost an hour and three quarters and they were both very much pleased then the princes arm got tired and he stopped and asked the princess to tell him her history she said she was a little ashamed to tell him her story because he might think that she was not of as good descent as himself but the prince insisting she told him that her mother was a waterwoman  illustration  a mermaid i suppose said the prince  o no she cried none of those low things with fishtails but a real princess of the ocean she lived in a splendid palace at the bottom of the sea and fell in love with a prince of the earth who left his fathers kingdom and went down there and married her  i remember my father very well continued the beautiful princess he was a fine handsome man but our climate never seemed to agree with him he could not smoke under the water and he often used to have aches which helped to make him unhappy before he died he said that he would give all the treasures of the ocean for a pipe and a piece of dry flannel when he left her mother pined away and soon died too when i was only about twelve years old i was very lonely but as i was the daughter of a waterprincess and a landprince i could go where i pleased either on shore or in the water  amphibious like said the prince  i dont know anything about that she replied but i used to like to walk about on the seashore for everything was so different from what i had been accustomed tobirds you know and all that sort of thing  o yes said the prince it must have been very different to you indeed but i was going to say to you a little while ago that you need not think me above you for i am halfbrother to a gnome  o i am glad to hear that she said i was afraid you would make fun of me  as if i could said the prince reproachfully  so she went on with her story  one day about a year ago when i was quite grown up i met some ladies who lived here at the palace and they wanted me to come home with them and i did and i have lived here ever since and like it very much they are all very kind and if i didnt sleep so much i should be very happy  the prince now proposed to the princess and she accepted him and then she sat down to a harp to give him a little music the princes presence in some way perhaps because he was halfbrother to a gnome prevented the appearance of the nimshee and for the first time since she had been in the palace she played without hindrance and her music was perfectly charming and with tears of joy in his eyes the prince sat wishing she would play forever after a while however she got tired and stopped and when they turned around they saw the room was filled by the people of the palace who had come to hear this delicious music they were nearly all wiping their eyes with their handkerchiefsthey were so much affectedand they could not find words good enough with which to praise the playing of the princess such music they had never heard before  directly she declared that she was going to bed but she desired the grand chamberlain to take that young prince and give him a handsome room until morning when she would like to see him again and make arrangements for their wedding  so she went away with her ladies and the chamberlain took the prince out into the alabaster hall again  prince indeed said the chamberlain to himself o yes ill take care of him certainly a good roomo yes indeed and taking the prince by the arm he hurried him along until he came to the aviary where all sorts of wonderful and costly birds were kept and he pushed him in there and locked him up the prince was so taken by surprise at this hasty treatment that he had no time to get angry or he would certainly have drawn his sword and made short work of the grand chamberlain as it was he passed the night in the aviary as well as he could but as he had no place to lie but the floor and as the ostriches walked about a good deal he was very much afraid they might tread upon him and this made him feel uneasy all night the great owls too made it very unpleasant for him by forming a circle around him and steadfastly gazing at him with their great eyes which looked like enormous cateyes stuck into the darkness as to the nighthawks and the other birds which fly in the dark they swooped around and over him the whole livelong night and when he began to get a little sleep about daybreak every bird in the place began to sing or twitter or scream or crow or gobble or chatter and the prince might as well have tried to fly as sleep about eight oclock a man came to feed the birds and seeing the prince in the aviary he put him out instantly the prince was very angry and tried to find out what this all meant but the man told him he had better not let him catch him in there again and slammed the door in his face as the prince wandered about the palace he met a number of people all of whom he asked to conduct him to the princess some laughed at him and others told him that he had better be careful how he talked about the beautiful princess but no one conducted him to her  at last a man who seemed to have some authority came up to the prince and having heard his story requested him to follow him he led the way to a small door and motioning to the prince to pass through it shut and fastened it after him the prince found himself out in the street  enraged and hungry he hurried back to his lodgings where he had left trumkard on the way he heard a great many people talking of the beautiful music that it was reported the princess had played at the palace the evening previous in fact this matter seemed to be the town talk but the prince did not stay to listen to much of it for he was extremely anxious to get something to eat and to relate his troubles  trumkard did not encourage him much and proposed that they should continue their journey but the prince would not listen to such advice and as soon as he had finished his breakfast he went back to the palace in order to try and see his princess but all the doors were fastened and it was evident that there was no admission for the public that day a great crowd stood around the gates and they were very much excited about something  the prince learned from their discourse that it was thought that the princess who played so splendidly could certainly sing as well and there was a suspicion that the prime minister who had governed the people so long was afraid of her powers and had sent her away indeed a certain habbedilgabbed who kept a goatscheese shop and who had a cousin who was one of the royalblackeunuchguards had heard from him that the princess had certainly disappeared and that the public suspicions were very likely to be correct  at this news the prince smote his breast and became very sad and all that day and night and the next day until sundown he hung around the palace hoping to get in trumkard was with him a great part of the time and brought him cakes and things to keep him from starving in the early evening of the second day the prince while walking round the palace saw a boy come out of a backalley gate to empty some ashes rushing at him he seized him and demanded of him news of the princess the boy however was deaf and dumb and could not answer him and the prince perceiving this and being very expert in making signs asked him in that way what had become of his ladylove the boy then replied by a sign representing a heavy door with four locks a big bar and a chain and a black eunuch with a drawn sword asleep before it  then the prince tore his hair and groaned and went home to trumkard but he could not sleep and when the moon arose he got up and wandered far away beyond the walls of the city until he came to the borders of the sea there he saw roaming about upon the sands numbers of waterwomen who every now and then blew upon conchshells looking about them in every direction as if they expected some one to answer them when the prince perceived them he slipped softly from rock to rock keeping himself well concealed until he came near one of them when he made a sudden rush and caught her while all the others with loud cries dashed into the sea the one he had captured struggled and cried piteously but in as few words as possible he entreated her to be quiet and to understand that if she was looking for a princess he could tell her where she was or at least where she had been the waterwoman then became quiet and the prince told her all he knew and how anxious he was to find the beautiful princess the good woman of the sea then told him that she and her companions had come up on the shore every night for a year hoping that the princess would stray that way and be induced by them to return to her ocean home then she told him who the princess really was and thus her story ran  when the late mighty king barradin was quite young he married a daughter of the ocean at which his father much incensed drove him from the court he retired far from men and a little son was born to him in a few years his wife died and he was left alone with his son when this boy grew up he also married a waterwoman and having so much of their blood in his veins he went down to live with his wifes relations leaving his father to do as well as he could by himself until he ascended the throne when barradin became king he did not marry a queen or cut off peoples heads or go to war or build palaces but he took his chief delight in music and encouraged the love of it among his people so it was in the hope that one of his descendants might some day sit upon the throne that he composed the magical music for he knew that no one but a descendant of the oceanfolk could sing that music and none but those of his blood could read it for there was magic in his family  when the music was finished the king died his mother was a sorceress and a very wicked old woman who when her son was dead gave it out that she herself was dying for she had now lived so long that people had begun to suspect something and to think that she had too much to do with magic so she pretended to die and was buried in the royal vault and at night she came out and went far away from the city to a great cave in a lonely country where dwelt the demons and evil spirits who were her servants she now spent her life in wickedness she it was who put it into the heads of so many sensible people to contend for the crown and it was with joy that she saw them carried out to the asylum many other evil thoughts she put into the hearts of the people and she was forever imagining and doing mischief  when this young princess her greatgrandchild was born mahbracca that was the name of the old sorceress was very much troubled and used all available means to destroy the infant but her efforts were vain for the people of the ocean protected her from all enchantments  as the princess grew up she loved to ramble on the white sands and she was once perceived there by a party of ladies from the palace who had persuaded her to come with them to their royal home where she had now been for a year she knew not who she was nor did her friends at the palace and her relations of the ocean had always hoped that some day she would return to them now the sorceress feared that some day she would happen to sing the magical music and be made queen and she hated the poor girl so much that she would not have had this happen for all the world therefore it was no doubt that she had sent the nimshee in order to prevent the princess from ever exercising the wonderful gift she had inherited  this much the waterwoman told the prince but as to what had now become of the princess she did not know but there were others of her people who knew more than she did and she would inquire of them taking the prince by the hand she led him out upon a headland that projected some distance out into the sea and blew four times loudly upon her conchshell a great heaving and swelling of the waters was presently seen and in a few moments an elderly personage emerged from the waves and walked carefully up to the rock on which they stood he was a curiouslooking individual and as the waterwoman informed the prince a powerful lord of the ocean  he was wrapped in an oldfashioned cloak made of the finest quality of seaweed and drawing this closely around him he requested his fair cousin of the sea to be as quick as possible in her business with him as it was not prudent for him to be in the air much at his age so the waterwoman briefly related to him what the prince had told her  when he heard this the old seagentleman folded his arms and looked very grave mahbracca is at the bottom of this said he the prime minister would never have thought of imprisoning the princess if that wretched sorceress had not put it into his head i have no doubt that she now has the princess in her power and very likely shut up in her retreat  what cried the prince where is it where is her cave i will go instantly and rescue my beloved princess and he drew his sword of adamant and waved it over his head  ah my friend said the old man of the water you could do little against the powerful mahbracca and her minions but you might go there to be sure and find out if she really has possession of the princess but then you may lose your life  i care not cried the prince dead or alive i will be with my princess  the two citizens of the ocean talked together a few moments and then the old man asked him if he was really determined to undertake this perilous enterprise and the prince emphatically declared that he was  the distance by the sea is much the shortest would you be willing to go in that way asked the old man  certainly said the prince provided i have to go over and not under the water  the old gentleman made no reply to this but putting his two forefingers in his mouth he whistled loudly  in a few moments a seaboy came up out of the water and stood beside him the old man made a few remarks to him in the ocean dialect when the boy jumped off the rock and disappeared beneath the waves  now sir said the seagentleman to the prince you must cheer up and be lively or you cannot hope to succeed in this matter my boy will take you to the seaside entrance of the cave of mahbracca there i hope you will have no difficulty in entering but i can say nothing positive upon the subject  at this moment the seaboy reappeared driving a pair of dolphins which were harnessed to a large and commodious seashell somewhat resembling in shape the boat of the nautilus  when the equipage was drawn up at the foot of the rock the prince took leave of his friends and quickly stepped in and took his seat  i wish you all success said the elderly personage and reminding the boy to be sure to keep their heads up he walked down into the sea  the waterwoman said nothing but stood on the rock gazing sadly after the prince as the dolphins drew him rapidly from the shore the fishes made excellent time and the motion of the great shell over the waves would have been exceedingly pleasant to the prince if his mind had not been filled with anxiety and impatience he shifted his position so often and rolled the vehicle about so much that once or twice the seaboy turned round and asked him if he did not wish to get out to which the prince did not reply but only urged him to make greater speed the journey lasted until the morning of the next day and was marked by no greater occurrence than the annoyance caused by the wild dolphins occasionally coming up around them endeavoring to play with their brothers in harness but the boy with his whip of sharks skin and the prince with his sword soon drove them down again  at last they dashed into shore and the seaboy pulling up his steeds jumped out followed immediately by the prince  take the road in front of you said the boy and you cannot miss your way  the prince then threw a piece of platinum to the boy who tucked it in between two of his scales and jumping into his shell drove rapidly away  illustration  the shore where the prince now found himself was very peculiar a high rocky wall seemingly inaccessible stood up solemnly in front of him and extended out on each side far into the sea directly before him was a great cleft or tunnel in the rock which extended so far back that its other extremity was not visible from where he stood this rocky avenue was the only passage in any direction that the prince could perceive and consequently without delay or fear he drew his sword and entered it the way for a while was easy but afterward became very rough and uneven here and there were openings in the walls above him through which came a misty light and by it the prince perceived that the walls were filled with precious stones which glistened and sparkled brightly while great veins of gold and silver were streaked about in all directions under his feet were thousands of jewels and bits of precious minerals without number his way was now very difficult for the avenue was narrow and rough pearls and sapphires got into his shoes and he cut his legs and scratched his hands against the sharp diamonds and rubies that stuck out from the walls but he pressed bravely on until the ground became more even and the walls wider apart and at length he entered quite an open space inclosed by a wall in which he saw before him an immense gate of copper he went up and tried to push it open but finding it immovable he knocked loudly upon it with the hilt of his sword directly a small window at one side of the gate was opened and a ghoul put his head out seeing that it was a prince who knocked he drew in his head and opened the gate the prince quickly entered i wish said he in an imperious voice to see the princess whom the wicked mahbracca has doubtless imprisoned in this cavern  o said the ghoul grinning horribly certainly pass on great prince the princess and my mistress will both be glad to see you pass on freely you cannot miss your way opening then his wide mouth he gave a great laugh and reëntered the porters lodge through the open door of which the prince saw upon a table an empty coffin and a jug  the prince now found himself in a long and wide passage dimly lighted and very damp the place smelt like a burial vault and against the walls on each side rows of ghouls sat on the floor their knees drawn up to their chins as the prince passed some of them jumped up and gibed at him leering sticking out their tongues and smacking their lips as they danced around him walking on rapidly he soon left these gibbering wretches and found that the passage became much drier although darker and wound and turned in various directions against the walls transfixed by great iron pins were enormous glowworms which gave the only light in this dismal place these worms turned their heads to look at the prince and flashed a brighter light from their tails that they might see him the better presently he noticed a small door in the wall which was not quite closed pushing it open he entered a room the floor of which was not very spacious but which was very high against one of the walls chained by his arms and his wings and his legs was the nimshee who had fanned the princess with his sleepgiving wings  when this evil spirit saw the prince his eyes glowed so brightly that they lighted up the room as if they had been torches and putting down his horrid head as low as his bonds would allow he opened wide his nostrils and his mouth and bellowed with fury like an immense bullat the same time tugging and struggling at his chains until the very walls shook with his raging strength  this spectacle caused the prince to step out of the room with alacrity and quickly shutting the door behind him he walked rapidly along the gloomy passage on his way he met numerous demons and evil spirits of various kinds but they only scowled at him as he passed and he spoke to none of them he soon descended a stone stairway which led down to a large circular hall with various doors and passages leading from it on the side opposite to the stairs was a great door of green marble sculptured with mysterious devices stepping up to it and finding that it opened easily he entered an octagonal room the walls of which were hung with the skins of spotted cats and on the floor was spread a skin of the sacred white elephant of india the prince perceived that this was merely an anteroom for to the left of him was a door before which sat a fierce and black afrite with a great javelin in his hand with his hands upon his knees the afrite bent down his head and looked steadfastly at the prince with glaring eyes  advancing towards this formidable sentinel the prince inquired of him where he should find the princess if she were shut up here or where he could see the sorceress mahbracca the afrite arose and pushing aside the block of porphyry on which he had been sitting took down a brazen bar by which the door was fastened and throwing it open told the prince in a harsh and brazen voice to enter  the room in which the prince now found himself was the private apartment of the sorceress where had been concocted all the wickedness with which she had cursed the subjects of her son  at first the prince could scarcely distinguish the objects in the room as it was lighted only by a small brazier which burnt dimly on a table but the afrite thrust his javelin into the brazier and the flames all green and red burst forth luridly lighting up the apartment with unearthly colors the afrite after informing the prince that the great mahbracca would soon attend him left him and returned to his station on the other side of the door somewhat fearful that all this willingness to admit him boded no good the prince still determined to push boldly on in his adventure that being indeed the only course possible for him and to take things as coolly as possible  looking around him he saw by the bright light which now filled the room that against each of the walls was a row of cages containing snakes of various grades of venom placed in order according to their deadly properties standing on their heads in various places against the wall were many of those dreadful green lizards which poison the air of the deep valleys of sumatra and whose bite causes their victim together with all his blood relations to gangrene in an instant these although standing so stiffly against the wall were all alive and some of them perceiving the prince was looking at them winked at him but he paid them no further attention and proceeded with his inspection of the room  there were great numbers of horridlooking furnaces and cages and grotesque lamps with the flames out but with wicks still smouldering and smelling vilely upon a shelf near the ceiling was a row of great jars and out of one of them was continually popping the head of an excessively shining and black little demon who had evidently for some offense been put there in pickle from the other jars came groans but no heads these had been in longer while the prince stood scarcely able to refrain from laughing at the comical countenance of the young demon in the jar he heard the opening of a door and turning saw the sorceress mahbracca enter the apartment this worthy dame presented a remarkable appearance short with a large head partly covered with stubbly white hair she had a face of the color and smoothness of an irish potato which has been lying in the sun for about eighteen months her eyes opened in the middle of the pupil with a slit like those of a cat and she had three long hairs or whiskers on each side of her upper lip she advanced with a smile which did not make her look any more lovely and extended her hand to the prince being a man of politeness of course he took it but her touch was ten times more clammy and deadly than that of a snake  i am glad to see you said mahbracca will you take some rest and refreshment you must be tired for you have surely travelled a long way  no said the prince i desire neither rest nor refreshment all i require is that you conduct me to the princess if you have her here confined and then that you deliver her up to me  ah said the sorceress that is certainly not much to ask you shall be gratified allow me to conduct you to her she will be delighted i am sure  then taking in her hand a staff and opening the door by which she had entered she requested the prince to follow her passing quickly through several apartments they entered a wide long and dim avenue  come said the sorceress give me your hand we will lose no time  but the prince remembering his former experience of her touch drew back from the bony hand which she extended to him  ah cried she with a hideous grin you are able to get along by yourself are you my dear i dare say your young legs are very strong and nimble you dont need any old womans help ha ha well come on the princess awaits you  illustration  with these remarks the aged hag set off at a pace which considering her years was truly wonderful putting the prince to his best endeavors to keep up with her the underground avenue in which they ran seemed of great length and very shortly the old lady varied the exercise by introducing certain gymnastics sometimes as she stretched out her staff the ground would suddenly open before her and she sprang over the wide chasm with the greatest ease while the poor prince all unprepared would have to strain every muscle in his body to clear in the midst of his rapid career the yawning gulf then she would wave her staff upwards and the ground rise in front of her like a steep and rocky hill up which she would lightly run while the prince could scarcely restrain himself from dashing violently against its stony face then while heated and breathless with the ascent of one of these he would see her wave her staff downward and plunge down a steep declivity into the darkness of which he followed her pellmell not knowing whether he was going to descend a few yards or a mile very soon however he began to get his blood up and kicking out his legs like a wild goat of cashmere he prepared to show her that it would have to be a very smart old woman who could beat him in a race so away they went like a cat and a dog the prince clearing the great gaps as fast as mahbracca could make them at last he actually gained on her and kept ahead of her for a few minutes during which time he had level running but with a great effort she passed him and violently throwing up the end of her staff caused a great rock to rise with such promptness that the prince came within an inch of braining himself against it but over it they went and for half a mile kept neck and neck but the old woman soon put an end to this for whirling her staff round her head the prince instantly found himself wading in sand up to his armpits  thats mean he cried with tears of indignation in his eyes but mahbracca jumped up and down on top of the sand waving her arms and laughing and screaming like a hyena  ah ha my vigorous prince cried she why do you stop hasten hasten swiftest of youths the princess awaits us  incensed by her mockery he gave a mighty plunge into the sand before him and surged along like a ship in the ocean while mahbracca skipped gayly by him playfully kicking the sand into his eyes  you see the advantage of lightness my dear cried she i pass easily over the top of this sand while youo how you do wallow ha ha ha i never saw anything like it  with such remarks she beguiled his way until relenting she at last waved her staff again above her head and the prince found himself by her side on solid ground  she complimented him on his remarkable agility and strength but he made her no answer and wiping his face with his handkerchief walked on without a word at length they reached the end of the avenue and passing through a circular aperture with which it terminated the prince found himself in the cavity of an immense hollow mountain the floor of which was a great plain and into which the light of day was admitted through an opening in the top more than two miles above him  scattered about over the blackish sward were many groups of ghouls and variously colored demons some playing pitchpenny with ancient coins and others lying asleep on the ground at a distance grazing on the exuberant and oily foliage were herds of the pronghorned yabouksthose sanguinary monsters which impale their victims on the great horn upon their noses holding back their heads and opening their mouths to let the blood slowly trickle down their throats  many other dreadful cattle were scattered about the plain drinking at the greenish streams which meandered about in various directions or standing ruminating kneedeep in the oily water but these things claimed not the attention of the prince  in the centre of this great plain stood a tower  behold cried mahbracca springing in front of him and waving her armsbehold the dwelling of your princess come let us run let us bound  seizing him by the hand with a strength that was not to be resisted she led him at great speed to the foot of the tower then at the top of her voice she called out  princess appear at your window quickly your love has come from afar unto you show yourself to him  at these words the princess put her head out of the highest window and when the prince saw her lovely face he fell down on his knees trembling with happiness and protesting in broken sentences his love for her while she bending out over the windowsill wept silently tears of joy which came down pitter patter on the princes head  starting presently to his feet the prince ran around the tower to find the front door and seeing it he endeavored to push it open but it was securely fastened he then turned to look for mahbracca and perceived her standing at some distance surrounded by a crowd of ghouls and demons who seemed to be greatly enjoying the scene the prince shouted loudly to her to send him the keys at which the whole crowd set up a shout of laughter and mahbracca hysterically screamed to him  enter enter great prince why wait so long outside you grieve your lovely princess  the prince enraged drew his sword of adamant and at one blow thrust it through the lock but the door did not open and the sword was fixed immovably in vain did he tug and struggle at it he could not move it an inch hearing greater and wilder cries of derision he turned towards the crowd and shook his fist at them and then went back under the window of the princess but she was not visible he called her again and again at the top of his voice but she did not answer him nor make her appearance the night was fast coming on and overcome with sorrow and despair and weak with hunger the prince fell upon the ground  when he had lain thus for an hour or two hearing nothing of the princess or his enemies he began to reflect that if he intended to serve his ladylove he must do something and that speedily he himself he plainly saw had no power against this sorceress and perhaps even now she was within the tower preventing the princess from answering or appearing to him he would go for assistance and come what would the princess should be delivered from that horrid tower he therefore arose and without reflecting how he was to leave this abode of wickedness he prepared to return to his friend and adviser trumkard when he reached the aperture by which he had entered the hollow mountain which he did without meeting any one he found it closed by a gate of brass but he was not to be thus deterred he ran around the sides of the mountain rousing in his course several herds of yabouks and dreadful cattle that gazed half awake at his rapid movements and examined as well as he could by the dim light the wall of this great cavern he soon became convinced by the knowledge he had gained in a few visits to his stepmothers dominions that these walls were not very thick his resolution was quickly formed taking off his handsome and richly embroidered clothes which would only impede him in his labors he stood dressed only in his undervest and trousers then springing upon a projecting rock and over another he entered a great crack pushed through some loose earth and made his way through the various crevices of the ground as he had seen the gnomes do after about an hours work he emerged into the open air very tired and very dirty after resting awhile he arose and taking his way across a great plain found himself by daybreak worn out and footsore near the gates of a great city entering he inquired of one of the few people who were up so early what city this was and was informed that it was the city of the queen altabec and a long distance from the city of the mighty king  the prince thanked his informant and proceeded to look for a tailors shop where he might provide himself with clothes for he perceived that people eyed him with suspicion and well they might having found a shop he entered and desired to be immediately fitted with a princes suit the master tailor knowing by his proud air that he was a prince and supposing he had been on some youthful adventure and had thus lost his clothes was delighted to serve him and running to the shelves and drawers pulled out all the princes suits and spread them before his customer the prince selected some very handsome clothes and having washed himself put them on and found they fitted him exactly he declared his satisfaction with them and putting his hand in his pocket for his purse found nothing of the kind there the tailor not furnishing his clothes in that way he now remembered that all his money was in the clothes he had left behind him in the mountain and explained his condition to the tailor the latter however had no wish to deal with princes who had no money and ordered him to instantly take off the suit the prince who was strictly honest was about obeying when one of his feet which were very tender with his much walking giving him a sudden pain he stooped down to see what was in his shoe and taking it off out rolled a magnificent pearl and two sapphires  there said the prince picking them up and handing them to the tailor if these will be of any use to you you can have them for the clothes  the tailor filled with admiration at the sight of these jewels and with the most profound respect for a prince who carried such wealth in his shoes accepted them instantly and the prince left the shop but the good tailor gazing joyfully at his newfound treasures was so conscientious and grateful that he ran out after the prince and gave him back one of the sapphires as change  it may as well be here related that the tailor sold the pearl to a jeweler who gave him one third of its value with which he retired into the country bought great possessions and lived in much dignity for many years some time afterward the queen altabec happening to pass the jewelers shop and seeing the pearl in the window immediately ordered the execution of the jeweler and the seizure of the pearl which she placed above all the other jewels in the tiptop of her crown where it still remains as for the sapphire the tailors wife put that away for a rainy day but as the rainy day never came and she never went to look for it in its hidingplace it made no earthly difference to her that her youngest child had found it and had swapped it off for half of a little stale applepie  after leaving the tailors shop the prince made all haste to an inn where having eaten about four meals in one he bought from an arab who was highly recommended to him a swift dromedary of the desert for which he gave one sapphire and requested the landlord of the khan to see that the arab paid to him out of its value what would suffice for the price of his breakfast this the landlord promised faithfully to do and it is said that the descendants of that landlord are still drawing on the descendants of that arab for installments of the price of that wonderful breakfast  mounting his dromedary the prince would have started but was detained by the arab who embraced the animal and begged the prince out of charity to a poor man to add a little to the meagre price he had paid for it upon which the prince knowing the habits of these arabs drew his sword which he had got with his suit and threatened to split the affectionate man in halves if he did not immediately take his hands off the beast which the man instantly did when he started off the humpbacked courser might have gone much faster if he had felt inclined and at last the prince became so enraged at the exceedingly leisurely style of his trot that he lifted his sword to serve the animal as he had threatened to serve his old master but the intelligent dromedary casting back its only eye perceived the danger and set off at such a terrific speed that the people in the villages through which it passed knew not what it was that had trodden down their children and upset the old women at their pomegranate stalls  before night the prince pulled up in the great city before the door of the inn in which trumkard and himself had lodged trumkard was sitting on the front step with a melon on his lap and a skin bottle between his knees hastily dismounting the prince threw himself upon the neck of his old friend with such force that he upset the old gentleman and his supper into a great pile together jumping up and wiping the wine out of his eyes and the melonjuice out of his hair trumkard welcomed his young master and assured him that he had several times wondered where he was the prince then led him indoors and related his adventures and besought his advice  thereupon trumkard throwing his right leg over his left rested his elbow on his knee and reposing his chin in his hand cogitated at last he spoke  we cannot do better said he than to apply to the giant turilira  this giant it will be remembered was our old acquaintance and the friend of tingaling  the prince having readily consented to this proposition it was agreed that they should go to the giant the next day and implore his assistance the prince would have started that night but trumkard had great objections to night travelling and he being the best at an argument gained his point  early the next morning the travellers set forth upon their journey well mounted upon two good horses it may be as well to state that during the night the princes dromedary had returned to its original owner  as it will take two days of hard riding for our friends to reach their destination we will leave them and return for a time to the gentle mahbracca who when she had left the prince had gone to her private room to prepare an ingenious wire arrangement which she called a princetrap in which he was to be inclosed and hung up before the window of the princess for the amusement of this lively sorceress  but what was her dismay when on returning to the tower the first yabouk she met told her of the escape of the prince speechless with apprehension she ran to the place where he had passed through the side of the mountain and seeing his clothes upon the ground and the indubitable signs of his egress she became perfectly furious and rushing back to the tower commanded the dreadful afrite who guarded her door and who now accompanied her to enter and to bring down the princess but on no account to injure her until she should be placed alive in the cage that had been prepared for the prince the faithful afrite bowed his head in obedience and having at one bound entered one of the lower windows he hurried up the stairs to the door of the princesss room bursting it open he saw the princess lying on the floor in a swoon into which she had fallen when she perceived that mahbracca was acting treacherously towards the prince and supposing her to be dead he hastily plunged down the stairs to inform his mistress and rushing violently against the front door to burst it open as was his habit when doors were in his way he immediately spitted himself upon the princes sword of adamant which was sticking through the lock  after waiting some time and becoming alarmed at the long absence of the afrite the sorceress sent for the key of the tower and opened the door but when it slowly swung open and the body of her favorite swung with itthe point of the sword emerging from the middle of his backshe fainted away coming to her senses in a few minutes she ordered him to be drawn off and carried to her room where after again locking the tower door she followed in the hopes of reviving by means of proper magical remedies whatever vitality might be left in the unfortunate and indispensable afrite  trumkard and the prince journeyed so rapidly that their horses fell utterly exhausted at the end of the first days journey and not being able to procure others they were obliged to go the rest of the way on foot you may be sure that the prince did not lag by the way and poor trumkard was obliged to do his very best to keep up with him at all therefore when near the end of the second day they arrived at the giants castle they were tired and warm enough entering the great gate to the hinge of which little tingaling once tied his butterfly they approached the castle and perceived the giant sitting in his front porch with his feet in immense slippers comfortably resting against one of the great pillars before the door the prince who had never seen him before was struck with astonishment at his great size but trumkard assured him that a nobler or more truehearted being never breathed for all he was so big  when turilira perceived them he arose and welcomed them heartily remembering trumkard as an old friend he caused them to be seated on the porch and ordered water to be brought that they might free themselves from the dust of the journey then he called to his attendants to spread a table and to bring some cold meat and some game some curries and hashes some minced meat some pepperpot some muttonchops omelettes bacon and eggs some broiled steaks some spareribs toast butter cheese pickles and salad some macaroni vermicelli chowder mullagatawny lobsters clams oysters mussels and shrimps also some tripe kidneys liver and sausages and calvesfootjelly and stewed cranberries also frangipanni tarts and a charlotterusse with bottles of orgeat sherbet and iced wines together with mead and mineral water  when his guests had partaken of these their hunger was fully satisfied and they related to him the reason of their coming when the giant learned how the princess was kept from her lover and in all probability from a throne by this wicked sorceress his anger knew no bounds  i knew the woman well he cried but i thought her dead many is the deed of vile magic which i have known her to do but nowwell my friends you shall be avenged i will take up the cause of the princess and we will set out for the hollow mountain as soon as i can get myself ready to start  leaving the two friends in comfortable chairs on the porch in which they fell asleep as soon as he had left them the giant ascended the great stone stairs into his armory which was an immense room filled with his mighty weapons and armor and all sorts of implements of warfare kicking off his slippers he put upon his feet great boots the like of which were never seen before their soles were enormously thick and studded with nails each one of which was so heavy that i would not like to have to carry it very far then having put on his chain armor and his great gauntlets and having arrayed himself otherwise according to his taste he put upon his head his helmet which was like a great iron pot and big enough towell big enough to cover his head which is saying a great deal he then took from the corner of the room his club which was the trunk of a tall tree with one end fastened into a great rock by way of having a knob to it having thus accoutred himself he came downstairs and finding his guests in such a sound slumber he had not the heart to waken them so he gently took them up and put one of them in each of the sidepockets of the coat which he wore over his armor then having given orders to his servants to close all the gates and see that the house was well fastened up for fear of thieves he strode out of the great gate and proceeded towards the hollow mountain although this was a long journey for a man or a horse our giant made such tremendous strides that it did not seem like a very great distance to him and when trumkard and the prince awoke and stood up and looked in astonishment out of the pocketholes they saw the mountain in the distance the giant perceiving that they were awake looked from one to the other with his peculiar pleasant smile and assured them that their troubles would soon be at an end  i hardly think said he that the old woman can keep me out of her tower and he laughed at the very idea of such a thing the prince made no reply but he thought that if the giant did get into the tower it would be considerably stretched  having arrived at the mountain the giant walked around it until he came to the place where the prince informed him he had made his escape and which was as far as there was an opportunity of judging one of the thinnest parts turilira took his friends out of his pockets and set them on the ground at a little distance from the foot of the mountain and then letting his club down from his shoulder he whirled it around his head and struck such a tremendous blow on the side of the mountain with the rock end that everything cracked again then another on the same place and another and another until at the last blow a great mass of rock and earth fell inside with a crash like thunder leaving a gap large enough for the whole party to walk in without stooping you may be sure that the three were not long in entering but no sooner had they set foot upon the great interior plain than they perceived a mighty commotion among the inhabitants of this secluded spot ghouls afrites and all sorts of demons were running towards them in a great state of excitement and as they approached they formed into a solid body evidently intending to repel the invaders there was no mistaking their intentions for they hurled at the giant a volley of spears and javelins that would have annihilated any one who was not so large and who had not on such strong and secure chainarmor  as to our two smaller friends they were safe enough behind the giants legs giving his club a swing turilira stepped forward and let it drive right into the middle of the crowd crushing some sixty of them and sending the rest howling in every direction  being thus rid for a time of these opposers the giant picked up his club and followed by the prince and trumkard advanced towards the tower although turilira strode along at a great rate the prince got to the tower first and immediately commenced shouting to his princess she however did not make her appearance for she was still in a swoon so the prince ran around to the door to see if by chance it was open but found it locked he saw however the hilt of his sword still in the lock and seizing it he again used his utmost strength to pull it out but in vain the giant who had just come up perceiving what he was trying to do stooped down and taking hold of the hilt in his finger and thumb gave it a jerk and out it came he handed it with a smile to the prince who overjoyed at regaining his favorite weapon jumped around to see if there was anybody he could stick it into but as all the yabouks and other cattle were standing at a respectful distance and there was only old trumkard running up he thought better of the matter and put his sword into its scabbard feeling himself a man again the giant walked round the tower putting his eye to the windows but said he could see nothing  look in the upper window shouted the prince that is the princesss room  yes here she is cried the old fellow peering on tiptoe into the upper room and fast asleep on the floor that wretch of a witch has not even given her a bed then clapping his great hands against the side of the tower he criedwake up sweet princess in a voice so loud that the poor young lady thought it was thunder and sprang to her feet trembling with fright seeing the face of a strange giant at the window she was so much more terrified that it is probable she would have fainted away again had she not heard the princes voice  illustration  lift me up cried the prince jumping about almost mad with impatience put me in quick good giant if she is there so the giant took him up and put him right in at the window when the princess saw him her face flushed and her eyes flashed with joy starting back and stamping one foot she criedmy prince  and he starting back and stamping one foot criedmy princess  and then they rushed into each others arms and you could have heard the kissing ever so far  old trumkard was nearly tickled to death and ran around on his toes trying insanely to reach up but he couldnt see anythingnot he as for the giant he could see firstrate and he stood looking in at the window with such a broad grin on his face that one might almost have driven a horse and wagon down his throat  in a short time the prince and princess made their appearance at the window and requested to be taken down when the giant had deposited them safely on the ground they embraced each other and then trumkard and turning to turilira they made him a very pretty speech expressive of gratitude and eternal remembrance  these little duties having been performed there seemed nothing more to be done but to quit the mountain by the way they came but as they were about leaving the tower they were startled by a sudden burst of yells and howls and saw issuing from the brazen gate by which the prince had first entered a great crowd which was approaching them at full speed headed by mahbracca who skipped along at an astonishing rate  our friends did not attempt to retreat indeed the enemy was upon them almost as soon as they perceived their danger  mahbracca stepped to one side and the crowd opening discovered in the midst fortyseven spotted demons who carried a great copper brazier like an enormous covered pot which they quickly set down almost at the feet of the giant  off with the lid shouted mahbracca and instantly a number of the slaves seized the cover and dragged it off when a great thick poisonous smoke burst out of it which would have destroyed our friends in a few moments had not they involuntarily sprung back and clapped their handkerchiefs to their faces however they could not have lived more than half a minute had not the giant with admirable presence of mind and surprising quickness given the brazier such a tremendous kick with one of his heavy boots that he sent it more than a mile and a half into the midst of a distant herd of yabouks which were all instantly suffocated by the dense cloud of poisonous smoke which covered them as the brazier fell upsidedown right over the leader of the herd who giving one great bellow instantly crisped up into nothing the giant and his party did not dare to draw breath until they had run a considerable distance but notwithstanding this precaution the princess presently sank down very pale and faint for her handkerchief being of the finest cambric did not prevent her from slightly smelling the horrid vapor although she did not inhale any of it however the fresher air and the vigorous efforts of the prince soon restored her  mahbracca stupefied for a moment at her utter discomfiture and deserted by her followers stood gazing blankly at the scene what she intended doing next was not long doubtful for taking a magical wand from her pocket she bade the giant with a wave of her wand turn into a camelopard as he did not seem in a hurry to obey she commanded him to become a hippopotamus and then an elephant he positively declined however to turn into any of these animals owing to his having taken the precaution before leaving his castle to drink a bottle of antienchantment water the old sorceress now became so enraged that she could scarcely speak but stood stamping her feet and shaking her fist at the great turilira who leaning on his club waited with a smile for her next attempt upon him  at this moment the prince perceived a short distance behind mahbracca a small black and shining demon whom he immediately recognized as the little fellow he had seen in pickle the young rascal was pulling and tugging at a great wire machine that had been dropped by the followers of mahbracca when they ran away he beckoned to the prince to come and help him and the latter whispering to the princess to keep behind the giant slipped quietly around to the rear of the angry sorceress and assisted the little fellow to place the wire affair which was nothing less than the princetrap that mahbracca had made directly behind the old hag with the door right at her back the giant perceiving this rapidly performed stratagem raised his club and made a step forward as if with one blow he would crush mahbracca who was just beginning to find her tongue startled by this sudden action she stepped back quickly and stumbled right over into the princetrap for an instant she lay on her back astounded but quickly perceiving her predicament she sprang to her feet and with loud yells tried her best to get out but it was of no use the trap was made by the best rules of magic and there was no such a thing as getting out even if one was as small as a mouse as for the little black fellow who had been in pickle he laughed and danced until the old woman glaring at him between the wires ordered him to turn into a toad but unfortunately for her she had dropped her magic wand outside of the cage as she fell in and the little demon seeing this merely laughed in her face and running to the wand picked it up and ordered her to turn into a jackass which she immediately did and began to bray horribly the little wretch was so delighted with this feat that he turned about a dozen somersaults and then for the amusement of the giant and his friends he changed the old sorceress successively into a lion a pig an old hen a turtle a kangaroo a boaconstrictor an ape a lobster a cat a crocodile and a crane he declared his intention of going through these exercises until he had used up the whole animal kingdom and seemed delighted to think that he could have a complete menagerie in one cage in order that he might pursue his amusement without interruption the giant put him with the cage on the top of the tower and when our friends left the hollow mountain through the gap the giant had made the poor sorceress was being changed from bird to beast and from beast to fish or reptile as fast as the little demon was satisfied with her performance in any one character and he may be keeping up this amusing pastime yet for all i know  when our party emerged into the open plain it was night but as the stars were quite bright turilira carrying his smaller friends and with his good club over his shoulder took his way toward his castle they had not travelled far before daylight appeared and very soon afterward they saw in the distance what seemed to be a mighty army coming toward them as it drew nearer they perceived the glittering spears and the flags and heard the sounds of drum and horn this great multitude was nothing more than two or three hundred thousand of the inhabitants of the city of the mighty king who were marching upon the stronghold of mahbracca  during the princes hurried visit to the city he had freely told the few persons with whom he had conversed of the place of imprisonment of the princess and after he had left the story spread rapidly  at last the excitement became so great that it ended in a grand revolt the prime minister was seized and imprisoned and the palace was searched and when it was found that the princess was indeed gone the whole city put full faith in the princes story and all who could bear arms or play music and could possibly leave home formed themselves into a great army and started off for the cave of mahbracca they travelled bravely until they neared the hollow mountain and hoped soon to destroy the wicked mahbracca if they found that she was still alive as the prince had reported  as they approached the giant some of the vanguard recognized trumkard and others remembered having seen the prince before and then when the princess raised her head as the giant gently held her on his arm thousands of the nearest of the army set up a great shoutthe princess the princess  then came a rush in which the giant might have had even his mighty legs taken from under him had he not with the presence of mind for which he was noted mounted at a bound a tolerably high rock and waving his hand for silence demanded that the people should gather round and listen to him he then made a speech which met with the greatest attention he told the people everything that had happened on this adventure and having such a loud voice they all heard what he had to say he related the remarkable fate of mahbracca and advised his hearers to forget their wrath against her as she must for the rest of her life be harmless and to conduct the princess back to the mighty city and there to establish her in whatever rights she possessed that is if it were proved she had any at all he also spoke in the highest terms of the prince and recommended his old friend trumkard to their kindest consideration when he had finished the whole multitude applauded rapturously for some time and in the midst of it all he delivered up his protégés to the guardianship of the headman who immediately had the prince and trumkard mounted upon magnificent chargers and the princess was placed in a palanquin of white silk embroidered with diamonds which had been brought on purpose for her in case they had had the good fortune to find her  the giant was then about to leave them but as the citizens would not hear of this and as he was a rare good fellow and did not object to festivities he was persuaded to go with them as they had no horse big enough for him he walked  the procession was then formed for the return march first of all rode the headman with a sword in one hand and a golden horn in the other then marched the professors of music after them came all those of the army who could play on the trumpet then the guard of honor with the prince and princess then trumkard and the giant and after them the immense host that could carry their weapons in one hand and play upon the drum with the other when they started the drums were all beaten the trumpets all blown the horses neighed the spears glittered the banners flapped and fluttered and there was never so brave an army in the world  from all the hills and plains and valleys the people came flocking to see them as they passed the enthusiasm was so great that when night came on again enormous bonfires were lighted on both sides of their road and kept up with such hearty goodwill that they travelled all night in a light as bright as day and when the wood gave out the peasants tore down their cottages and threw them on the flames  as they proceeded the professors of music composed marches and when one was finished they gave the manuscript to the headman who commanding silence blew the tune on his horn and then the whole army struck up and played it grandly of these the giants grand march was the best it was what might be called good loud music if it had thundered it is not likely that it would have been heard in the grand final burst when all the drums and trumpets beat and blew their very loudest  the giant himself played in this march for some of those who marched near him seeing that he had no instrument asked him if he would not like to play upon something to which he replied that he did not care if he did so they got for him the largest bassdrum he was much pleased at this and handing his club to two hundred porters who accompanied the expedition he beat away upon his drum in good style this performance did not last long however for the first time they played the grand final burst he beat on both drumheads at the same time and of course there was no more music from him the people around him were very glad of this for while he played he became so much excited that he did not see where he was walking and was continually treading upon some one so they journeyed with joy and gladness until they reached the city of the mighty king and all the people who had been left behind came out to meet them bells were rung and all kinds of music played and the people shouted so that the oldest inhabitant never knew such a noise and excitement before they entered the city and the procession halted at the palace here the princess after embracing the prince was conducted to the ladies apartments where her friends were so overjoyed at seeing her again that one would have thought that they would never have got over it the prince trumkard and the giant were each shown to sumptuous apartments and that night everybody in the palace had as much of everything good as they could eat  twelve oclock of the next day was the time appointed for the princess to make trial of the magical music the great hall of the palace was fitted up most magnificently and with the utmost rapidity for this great occasion the chairs of the judges were covered with new velvet and nothing was omitted that could add to the regal splendor of the hall at halfpast ten the doors were opened and the hall was immediately filled in every part but the small portion reserved for the principal actors in the ceremony there were nine galleries one above the other around this truly immense room and when it was all packed full of people from floor to dome it was a wonderful spectacle indeed  at ten minutes of twelve the procession entered the great hall first came along the centre passage which was covered with cloth of gold a number of beautiful boys who strewed the way with hyacinths and jasmines and the costly blossoms of the century plant after them were others with golden waterpots who sprinkled attar of roses before the princess who dressed in the purest white silk cut bias and trimmed with pink fur was escorted by the prince after them came the prime minister released for the occasion the nobles etc and the procession was closed by the guards of the palace all dressed in blue and covered with diamonds there was no music nor scarcely any sound whatever as they moved toward the judges who were already sitting solemnly in their chairs when the procession reached them it halted and the princess was conducted to a chair in front of the music then the youngest judge arose and uncovered the magical music  in all that hall filled with such a multitude there was breathless silence it was so still that the little mice came out of their holes thinking there was no one there  then the princess timidly raising her eyes ran them over the music and began it commenced softly and somewhat sadly but soon becoming louder and richer the tones swelled high and clear until the pure voice of the princess thrilled through all the perfumed air then it became more and more glorious until its beatific beauty caused many of the older hearers to die and go straight to paradise the close was inconceivably sweet and when the last notes died away the people bowed their heads in tearful peace and all evil left their hearts and to many of them it never returned  as they raised their heads they saw the oldest judge arise and point with his golden wand to the marble tablet the characters of the music had disappeared and the vellum on which they had been written was as white as snow there was no need of any further decision the judges descended from their chairs in profound silence and the oldest and the youngest each taking the princess by the hand led her up the steps to the throne and seated her upon it then the prime minister took the crown from its velvet cushion and placed it on her head and turning to the people said in a voice which sounded in the stillness to all parts of the vast building behold your queen  then as one man that great multitude gave such a sudden wild tremendous shout that it took the roof right off the top of the house and the wood that fell in every direction outside was enough to keep the poor people in kindlingwood all winter  the giant whirling his iron helmet around his head now led off with a thundering hip hip hurra in three cheers for the queen and three such cheers  the dense crowd outside took them up and shook the very foundations of the city with their shouts and the country people and those at a great distance heard the joyful sounds and before many minutes the whole country for miles around reverberated with cheers for the newmade queen  illustration  as for the palace it shook and trembled with the thunders of applause still led by the giant who couldnt be stopped the people about him were all struck deaf in the ear nearest him but the eardoctors cured them all for nothing when they got outside so full of charity was every one at last when every one the giant and all were hoarse with shouting the prime minister offered his hand to the queen and led her down from the throne then she motioned to the prince to give her his arm and at the head of the procession he led her to the royal apartments at the door of which he left her the multitude then dispersed and they spent the rest of that day in putting right the wrongs they had committed and in making provision for future virtue when the queen had taken some refreshment she put on an everyday crown and repaired to the audience chamber to receive the visits of the various dignitaries of the kingdom who came before her and brought her their keys and papers and accountbooks giving each one back his keys and ordering the papers and accounts to be deposited in a great pile on one side where she might look over them at her leisure she reappointed every man to the office he held before and sent them away rejoicing then she called for writing materials and slaves and commenced writing notes to the prince she would write one on gilded vellum and folding it would hand it to the slave next to her who dipped it in frankincense and handed it to the next one who sprinkled it with attar of roses and passed it to the next who ran with it as hard as ever he could to the prince for in that kingdom it was not considered proper for lovers to visit much  this performance the queen kept up all the afternoon writing as fast as she could and only stopping long enough to read the answers which the slaves brought her as they returned at last they came back bringing with them her last notes unopened saying that the prince had gone to sleep at which intelligence she shed some tears but then like a sensible queen had her supper and went to bed  the next day the marriage of the queen and the prince took place and it was a glorious affair indeed twentyfour historians were appointed by the crown to write the history of it they were paid by the quarter and it took them a long time i can assure you  the whole of the weddingday the festivities were kept up and all the eating and drinking and merrymaking was at the royal expense during the day and night everybody spent and gave away to the poor all the wealth they possessed and in the morning it was all paid back to them by the royal treasurer in the country the people feasted grandly on their own herds and drank up their own wines and they were also reimbursed by the crown  but the great feature of the royal marriage was the decree proclaimed at noon of the weddingday that all persons married on that day should be set up in housekeeping free of expense  never in the history of that or any other kingdom were priests kept so busy as those in this city they worked as hard as they could but at three oclock they were obliged to commence marrying the folks by squads and so before suppertime there was not a bachelor or maid in the whole cityexcepting an old bobstay spinnerone of the crossest of old maids who hated men so much that she had not spoken to one for forty years and a crabbed bachelor who despised women so completely that he never had his clothes washed because it would have to be done by females  at midnight the priest alibobabem was called out of his bed and found at the door desiring to be married the crabbed old bachelor and the cross old maid these two did not live long but all the rest of the people were very happy for many years  about three oclock of the morning after the great weddingday the giant turilira arrived at his castle gate he had walked all the way home and he felt in such a good humor that the road never seemed so short to him before but for some reason he could not open the gate there seemed to be an unusual number of locks and bolts and the big key he carried did not seem to fit any of the numerous keyholes he could easily reach over and undo the bolts but the locks were too much for him and i am sorry to say he got a little angry and was about to take his club and smash his magnificent gate when his wife who had been sitting up for him and had heard the noise he had been making came down and let him in  they went together into the great hall and there turilira sat down before the fire his wife who thought a great deal of the good giant was sorry to see that he was silent and rather grum  what makes you look so my dear said she did you not have a good time  o yes said he good enoughbut that gate put me out i wonder whats the matter with it its got to be fixed i wont be bothered and worried in this way  it shall all be made right in the morning said his wife but are you sure you did not take anything that disagreed with you while you were away  perhaps i did said he it might have been the mincepies they told me they were temperance pies but i dont believe it  how many did you eat my dear asked the good giantess  well i dont know said her husband about ten or eleven hundred i suppose  that was too many for you said his wife and i think you had better go to bed and i will bring you something to make you feel better  so the giant went to bed and as he slowly ascended the stairs he winked to himself with his right eye and his wife she went into the kitchen and winked to herself with her left eye  after a while she came up to the giant and brought a barrel of hot chamomile tea and when he had drank it all she tucked him in nice and warm and the next morning he felt as well as ever     tingalings visit to turilira   one pleasant sunny day the giant turilira was lying on his back on the grass under some great trees in a wood near the palace of the king  his feet were high above the rest of his body resting in the crotch of a great oaktree and he lay with his vest open and his hat off idly sucking the pith from a young sapsagotree that he had just broken off near him on the top of a tall bulrush sat the little fairy tingaling they had been talking together for some time and turilira said tingaling you must come and see me you have never been to my castle except when you came for the good of somebody else come now for yours and mine and stay at least a week we will have a gay old time will you come  i will cried the little fairy in a voice as clear as the chirp of a cricket ill come whenever you say so  let it be tomorrow then said the giant shall i fetch you  o no said tingaling i will come on my blue butterfly you have no idea how fast he flies i do believe he could go to your castle nearly as fast as you could yourself  all right said turilira rising come as you please but be sure you come to stay  then the giant got up and he shook himself and buttoned his vest and put on his hat and as he had thin boots on he told tingaling he was going to see if he couldnt take the river at one jump so tightening his belt and going back for a good run he rushed to the river bank and with a spring like the jerk of five mad elephants he bounded across but the opposite bank was not hard enough to resist the tremendous fall of so many tons of giant as came upon it when turiliras feet touched its edge and it gave way and his feet went up and his back came down and into the river like a ship dropping out of the sky went the mighty giant the splash was so great that the whole air for a minute or two was full of water and spray and tingaling could see nothing at all when things had become visible again there was turilira standing up to the middle of his thighs in the channel of the river and brushing from his eyes and his nose the water that trickled from him like little brooks  hellooo cried tingaling are you hurt  o no spluttered the giant the water and the mud were soft enough but im nearly blinded and choked  its a good thing it isnt worse cried the fairy if that river had not been so broad you would have broken your neck when you came down  goodby cried the giant stepping upon the bank i must hurry home as fast as i can and so away he went over the hills at a run and you may rest assured that he did not jump any more rivers that day  the next morning early tingaling mounted his blue butterfly and over the fields he went almost as fast as a bird for his was a butterfly of the desert where they have to fly very far for anything to eat and to race for it very often at that tingaling took nothing with him but what he wore but his things and his best clothes were to be sent after him on a beetle which though slow was very strong and could have carried if he chose everything that tingaling had about sunset the fairy and the butterfly the latter very tired arrived at the castle of turilira and there at the great door stood the giant expecting them with his face beaming with hospitality and delight he had had his slaves for the whole afternoon scattered along the road by which his visitor would come and they were commanded to keep a sharp lookout for a blue butterfly and pass the word to the castle when they saw it coming so turilira was all ready and as he held out his finger the butterfly was glad enough to fly up and light upon it the good giant took them both into the house and the butterfly was put on a topshelf where there were some honeyjars and if he didnt eat  supper was all ready and turilira sat down to the table on a chair which was bigger than some houses while tingaling sat crosslegged on a napkin opposite to him the giant had everything nice there was a pair of roast oxen besides a small boiled whale and a great plate of fricasseed elks as for vegetables there were boatloads of mashed potatoes and turnips and beans and there was a pie which was as big as a small backyard the giant had a splendid appetite and before supper was over he had eaten up most of these things as for little tingaling he had only got half way through his third grain of boiled rice when the giant was done but he could eat no more and after scooping up about a drop of wine in a little cup he carried with him he drank the health of turilira and then they went out on the front porch where the giant ordered his big pipe to be brought and he had a smoke when turilira had finished his pipe and tingaling had nearly sneezed himself to death and the whole atmosphere for about a mile around the castle was foggy with smoke they went in to bed  turilira took tingaling upstairs and showed him where he was to sleep and then putting him down on the bed he bade him goodnight and went out and shut the door after him  tingaling stood in the middle of the bed and looked about him it was as if he was in the midst of a great plain the bed was a double one that had belonged to the giants father and mother and he had given it to tingaling because it was the best in the house the little fairy was delighted with this bed which was very smooth and covered with a great white counterpane he ran from one end to the other of it and he turned heelsoverhead and walked on his hands and amused himself in this way until he was thoroughly tired then he lay right down in the very middle and went to sleep i would like to have a picture of tingaling in the giants bed but any one can draw it so easily for himself that it is of no use to have it here all that is necessary is to take a large sheet of white paperthe largest you can getand in the centre of it make a small dotthe smallest you can makeand there you have the picture  it must have been nearly morning when tingaling was awakened by a tremendous knocking at the frontdoor of the castle the first thought he had was that perhaps there were his things but he forgot that a very small and probably tiredout fairy for parsleys younger brother was to come with the baggage in charge of a beetle in the same condition could hardly make such a thundering noise as that but he jumped up and slid down on the floor and as his room was a front one he went to the window and climbing up the curtains got outside and looked down there in the moonlight he saw an ordinary sized man on horseback directing about a dozen black slaves who had hold of a long rope which they had tied to the knocker of turiliras door they were all pulling away at it as hard as they could and a mighty pounding they made too when the giant put his head out of his window and asked what all this noise meant  o good turilira cried the man on the horse i have ridden for several days he said nothing about his slaves having run all the way to come to you and tell you that the kyrofatalapynx is loose  illustration  what cried turilira in a voice like the explosion of a powder magazine loose  yes said the man hes been loose for four days  the giant pulled in his head and tingaling could hear him hurrying downstairs to open the great door the man came in and all the slaves and as a good many of turiliras people were up by this time there was a great hubbub of voices in the lower hall but though tingaling listened up by the banisters until the cold wind on the staircase had nearly frozen his little bare legs which were not much longer than your fingernail and about as thick as a big darningneedle he could make out nothing at all of the talk so he went back to the bed and got in under the edge of the counterpane and lay there with just his head sticking out until he dropped asleep at daybreak turilira came into the room and stooping over the bed called to him to get up as there was to be an early breakfast as the giant carried him downstairs on his finger he told the fairy that he was deeply grieved but that he would be obliged to leave him for the rest of the day on account of the kyrofatalapynx having broken loose  but what is that asked tingaling  why dont you know it is alook here you fellows didnt i tell you that breakfast was to be all ready when i came down what do you mean you lazy rascals skip now and have everything ready this minute  and the men skipped and the cooks cooked and the fires blazed and the pots boiled and bubbled and the giant sat down in a great hurry with the man who came on horseback sitting crosslegged on one side of the table and tingaling on the other so he forgot to finish his sentence about the kyrofatalapynx during the meal there was nothing but noise and confusion and tingaling could not get in a word the giant had a dish of broiled sheep before him and he was crunching them up as fast as he could and talking with his mouth full to the man all the time and the slaves and the servants were all eating and drinking and running about until there was no hearing ones own voice unless it was a very big one so although tingaling was dying of curiosity to know what the kyrofatalapynx was he could not get an answer from any one  as soon as the giant was done eating he jumped up and shouted for his hat and his boots and if the men did not run fast enough he shouted at them all the louder if tingaling had not stayed on the table i dont know what would have become of him in the confusion the giant had now pushed off his slippers and was waiting until the men should bring his boots and as one lazy fellow was poking around as if he was half asleep turilira was so irritated at his slowness that he slipped the toe of his stockinged foot under him and gave him a tremendous send right out of the door and he went flying over the trees at the bottom of the lawn and over the barleyfield on the other side of the ditch and over the pasture where the cows were kept and over the pomegranate orchard and over the palmgrove by the little lake and over hassan ab kolyars cottage right smack down into the soft marsh back of the sunflower garden and he didnt get back to the castle until his master had been gone an hour as the giant sat on the edge of the table pulling on his boots he told tingaling that he must make himself as comfortable as possible until he came back and that he would not be gone longer than he could possibly help but although the fairy asked him again and again to tell him what the kyrofatalapynx was he never seemed to hear him so busy was he talking to everybody at once now turilira was nearly ready to go and tingaling was standing close to the fringe on his scarf which lay over one end of the table  illustration  how i should like to go with him said the little fairy and he took hold of the fringe but he doesnt want me or he would take me along i would ask him if he would only be quiet a minute  just then up jumped the giant and as tingaling had not let go of the fringe he was jerked up too he held on bravely and as he did not wish to swing about on the scarf he climbed up to the giants shoulder and took tight hold of his long hair with the man and his slaves in a large round basket in one hand and his great club in the other away went turilira with strides longer than across the street and he walked so fast that tingaling had to hold on tight to keep from being blown away  about noon they came to a large palace surrounded by smaller dwellings and on the porch of the palace there stood a king and a queen and three princesses and they were all crying on the steps in the grounds and gardens and everywhere were the lords and ladies and common people and they were all crying too when these disconsolate people saw the giant approaching they set up a great shout of joy and rushed to meet him calling out o the kyrofatalapynx has broken loose  turilira went up to the palace and sat down on the great portico with his feet on the ground and the people told him all speaking at once and not having even manners enough to let the king have the first say that the kyrofatalapynx had grown awfully strong and savage since the giant had tied him up and that he had at last broken loose and was now ravaging the country he had carried off ever so many camels and horses and sheep and oxen and had threatened to eat up every person in those parts who was under age but since he had found out that they had sent for turilira he had gone into the forest and they knew not when he would come forth then up spoke a woodman above all the clamor and he said he knew when he would come out for he had been in the forest that morning and had stumbled on the kyrofatalapynx which was so busy making something that he did not see him and he heard him mutter to himself over and over again when he comes ill rush out and finish him and then ill be head of them all  all right cried turilira ill wait down there by the edge of the forest and when he sees me he can rush out and then you will all soon know who will be finished  so the giant went over to the wood and sat down and waited after a while he got very sleepy and he thought he would take a little nap until the kyrofatalapynx should come in order that the people might wake him up in time he tied a long rope to one of his earrings his eyes had been a little weak in his youth and everybody took hold of the end of the rope and they promised to pull good and hard when they heard the trees crushing in the forest so the giant went to sleep and the people all listened for the kyrofatalapynxholding their breaths and standing ready to jerk the rope when he should come  poor little tingaling was nearly consumed with curiosity what was the kyrofatalapynx he slipped down to the ground without being noticed by anybody and as they all seemed so intent listening and watching he felt afraid to speak to any of them directly a happy thought struck him  i will go into the wood myself whatever the kyfymytalygyby is he wont be likely to see me and i can run and tell turilira where he is before he comes out of the wood  so away he went and soon was deep in the darkness of the forest but he could hear no noise and saw nothing that appeared to have life even the very birds and insects seemed to have flown away after wandering some distance he suddenly met a fairy a little bit of a fellow but somewhat larger than himself and entirely green tingaling spoke to him and told him what he was after  that isnt exactly his name said the green fairy politely but i know what you mean if you come this way i can show him to you  so tingaling followed him and presently they came to the edge of an opening in the middle of the forest and there sure enough was the kyrofatalapynx with one of his great red tails coiled around an immense oaktree and the other around a huge rock he sat with his elephantine legs gathered up under him as if he were about to spring over the treetops but he had no such idea in his great hands as big as travellingtrunks he held a long iron bar one end of which he was sharpening against a stone by his side lay an immense bow made of a tall young yewtree and the cord was a long and tough grapevine as he sat sharpening this great arrow he grinned until his horrid teeth looked like a palefence around a little garden and he muttered to himself as he worked awayfour hundred and nine more rubs and i can send it twang through him twang twang twang  isnt he horrid whispered tingaling  yes indeed said the green fairy when he was young he came out of the mouth of a volcano and the king here who is very fond of wonderful things got turilira to catch him and chain him up for him in a great yard he had made for him but now that he is grown up no chains can hold him and i expect he will kill the giant with that great iron arrow before he can come near him  o cried tingaling he mustnt do that we must never let him do that  we said the fairy in a voice of astonishment  yes yes i mean us o what shall we do lets cut his bowstring said tingaling in great excitement and drawing his little sword the green fairy although polite could not help laughing at this idea but tingaling slipped softly to where the bow was lying a little behind the kyrofatalapynx and commenced to cut away at it but although the green fairy took the sword when he was tired they could make but little impression on the stout grapevine nearly as thick as they were high  lets nick the sword said tingaling and then it will be a saw and so with a sharp little flint they nicked the edge of it and the edge of the green fairys knife for he had no sword and as they commenced to saw away as hard as they could at the grapevine they heard the kyrofatalapynx muttering only three hundred and seven more rubs and thentwang twang twang  they worked like little heroes now and as the fairys sword was of the sharpest steel they cut a good way into the vine but just when they were nearly tired out they heard the wordsninetythree more rubs andtwang twang twang  o lets saw lets saw cried tingaling and its a wonder the kyrofatalapynx did not hear him and they worked as hard as they did at first  six more rubs andtwang twang twang cried the kyrofatalapynx and the two little fairies fell down exhausted and disheartened the vine was cut but little more than half through  up rose the mighty creature and with his bow and arrow in his hands he pushed quietly through the wood the two fairies jumped up in a few minutes and hurried after him and as he went very slowly so as not to be perceived they reached the edge of the wood just as he crashed out into the open field  o shouted all the people and they pulled the rope with a terrible jerk up sprang the giant but there stood the kyrofatalapynx with his long iron arrow already fitted into his bow ha ha he cried i shall put it through youtwang and he drew his arrow to its very head and all the people fell down on their faces and even turilira turned a little pale but snap went the bowstring and down fell the arrow then up rushed the giant and with one crushing blow of his rockknobbed club he laid the kyrofatalapynx stonedead  the king and the queen and the princesses and all the people jumped up and in their wild joy they would have kissed the clothes off the good giant had he been willing to wait  all right he cried i must be off ive a friend at home waiting for me no thanks you can stuff him now goodby  and away he went and poor little tingaling was left behind  when he saw the giant walking away like a steamengine on stilts tingaling began to cry  did you come with him said the green fairy well hes gone and you can live with me now  but tingaling was so overcome with sorrow and begged so hard that his new friend should tell him of some way to follow the giant that the latter after thinking a while took him up into the kings pigeonhouse warning him to be careful not to let any of the birds pick him up the green fairy pointed out a gray pigeon to tingaling  now said he if we can get a string around the middle feather of his tail we are all right  how so asked tingaling  why then you get on and start him off and by pulling the string you can make him go any way you wish for you know he steers himself with his tail  good cried tingaling and they both looked for a string when they had found one they stole up to the pigeon who was eating corn and tied it fast to the middle feather of his tail without his knowing anything about it  now jump on and ill start him off said the green fairy and tingaling ran up the pigeons tail which almost touched the floor and took his seat on its back holding tight on to its feathers then the green fairy ran around by the pigeons head and shouted in its ear as it was pecking cornhawk  the bird just lifted up its head and gave one shoot right out of the window of the pigeonhouse it went high up into the air and tingaling when he looked around and saw which way he ought to go pulled his string this way and that way and he found that he could steer the pigeon very well and even make him keep up in the air by pulling his tailfeather straight up so on they went and they got to the giants castle before the giant himself the pigeon flew over the castle but tingaling steered him back again and backward and forward two or three times until the bird thought he might as well stop there and so he alighted on the roof and off jumped tingaling the first thing he saw there after the pigeon had flown away again was the green fairy  why where did you come from cried tingaling  o said the other laughing and jumping up and down i thought id come too and i hung on to his leg it was nice sitting up among his warm feathers when his legs were curled up under him a great deal better than being on top  tingaling was very glad to have his friend with him and he took him downstairs when the giant got home there they were both in the middle of the table in the great hall ready to welcome him turilira did not ask where the green fairy came from but he was glad to see him and he ordered supper to be laid on a table out on the lawn for he was warm with his long walk after supper the two fairies came down to the giants end of the table and he told them all that had happened and how fortunate it was that the bowstring of the kyrofatalapynx had broken  he did it cried the green fairy pointing to tingaling and then he told the whole story of their doings and tingaling had to explain how he had gone with the giant turilira listened until they had quite finished and then exclaimed well i never saw such a little thing as you are tingaling for being in the right place at the right time never never and he brought his hand down on the table with such an emphatic bang that tingaling and the green fairy shot into the air like rifleballs tingaling went up up and up until a high wind took him and it blew him over a river and a wood and a high hill and a wide plain and then he fell down down downright into the middle of a soft powder puffball with which a lady was powdering her neck  mercy on us cried the lady when she saw a little fairy in the puffball that she was just going to put up to her throat  illustration  its only i nerralina cried tingaling who immediately recognized her wait a minute until i get my breath  sure enough it was nerralina the princesss lady who had been on a visit to her mother in a distant country and returning had ordered her slaves to pitch her tent where she now was about half a days journey from the palace tingaling told his story and they had a nice time talking of their past adventures and in the morning nerralina took tingaling with her to his home in the palace gardens  as to the green fairy he came down in a spider web when he got out and stood on the grass he said i shall not go back to that giant he is good but he is too violent  so he went to the river and got a nice chip and he loaded it with honeysuckles and clover blossoms and pushed it off into the stream he then lay down on his back in the middle of his clover and sucking a honeysuckle floated away in the moonlight down to his home where he arrived in two or three days just as his honeysuckles were all gone  when turilira saw what he had done he was in great trouble indeed he ordered all his slaves to bring their little children and he gathered up great handfuls of them and spread them out all over the grass so that they might look for the two lost fairies but of course they could not find them and just as the sun was setting and the giant was going to bed in despair there came a horseman from nerralina telling him that tingaling was safe and was going home with her early in the morning turilira went to the palace gardens and tingaling seeing him they went down to the wood where they were when this story opened turilira wanted tingaling to go back and finish his visit  no said the fairy i like you very much indeed but im afraid im most too little for your house  perhaps thats true said the giant and when you want to see them there are so many good people here in the palace i am sure i like common human beings very much and i would wish to be with them always if they were not so little  i like them too said tingaling and would live with them all the time if they were not so big
