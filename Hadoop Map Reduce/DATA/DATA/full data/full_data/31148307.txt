margret      ii        sitteth the fair ladye         close to the river side     which runneth on with a merry tone         her merry thoughts to guide       it runneth through the trees         it runneth by the hill     nathless the ladys thoughts have found         a way more pleasant still                 margret margret      iii        the night is in her hair         and giveth shade to shade     and the pale moonlight on her forehead white         like a spirits hand is laid       her lips part with a smile         instead of speakings done     i ween she thinketh of a voice

ladys shadow lies         upon the running river     it lieth no less in its quietness         for that which resteth never       most like a trusting heart         upon a passing faith     or as upon

      margret margret      xii        i have  and here her lips         some word in pause did keep     and gave the while a quiet smile         as if they paused in sleep       i have  a brother dear         a knight of knightly fame     i broidered him a knightly scarf         with letters of my name                 margret margret      xiii        i fed his grey goshawk         i kissed his fierce bloodhoùnd     i sate at home when he might come         and caught his horns far sound       i sang him hunters songs         i poured him the red wine     he looked across the cup and said         i love thee sister mine                 margret margret      xiv        it trembled on the grass         with a low shadowy laughter     the sounding river which rolled for ever         stood dumb and stagnant after       brave knight thy brother is         but better loveth he     thy chaliced wine than thy chaunted song         and better both than thee                 margret margret      xv        the lady did not heed         the rivers silence while     her own thoughts still ran at their will         and calm was still her smile       my little sister wears         the look our mother wore     i smooth her locks with a golden comb         i bless her evermore                 margret margret      xvi        i gave her my first bird         when first my voice it knew     i made her share my posies rare         and told her where they grew       i taught her gods dear name         with prayer and praise to tell     she looked from heaven into my face         and said i love thee well                 margret margret      xvii        it trembled on the grass         with a low shadowy laughter     you could see each bird as it woke and stared         through the shrivelled foliage after       fair child thy sister is         but better loveth she     thy golden comb than thy gathered flowers         and better both than thee                 margret margret      xviii        thy lady did not heed         the withering on the bough     still calm her smile albeit the while         a little pale her brow       i have a father old         the lord of ancient halls     an hundred friends are in his court         yet only me he calls                 margret margret      xix        an hundred knights are in his court         yet read i by his knee     and when forth they go to the tourneyshow         i rise not up to see       t is a weary book to read         my trysts at set of sun     but loving and dear beneath the stars         is his blessing when ive done                 margret margret      xx        it trembled on the grass         with a low shadowy laughter     and moon and star though bright and far         did shrink and darken after       high lord thy father is         but better loveth he     his ancient halls than his hundred friends         his ancient halls than thee                 margret margret      xxi        the lady did not heed         that the far stars did fail     still calm her smile albeit the while          nay but she is not pale       i have more than a friend         across the mountains dim     no others voice is soft to me         unless it nameth him                 margret margret      xxii        though louder beats my heart         i know his tread again     and his fair plume aye unless turned away         for the tears do blind me then       we brake no gold a sign         of stronger faith to be     but i wear his last look in my soul         which said i love but thee                 margret margret      xxiii        it trembled on the grass         with a low shadowy laughter     and the wind did toll as a passing soul         were sped by churchbell after       and shadows stead of light         fell from the stars above     in flakes of darkness on her face         still bright with trusting love                 margret margret      xxiv        he loved but only thee         that love is transient too     the wild hawks bill doth dabble still         i the mouth that vowed thee true       will he open his dull eyes         when tears fall on his brow     behold the deathworm to his heart         is a nearer thing than thou                 margret margret      xxv        her face was on the ground         none saw the agony     but the men at sea did that night agree         they heard a drowning cry       and when the morning brake         fast rolled the rivers tide     with the green trees waving overhead         and a white corse laid beside                 margret margret      xxvi        a knights bloodhound and he         the funeral watch did keep     with a thought o the chase he stroked its face         as it howled to see him weep       a fair child kissed the dead         but shrank before its cold     and alone yet proudly in his hall         did stand a baron old                 margret margret      xxvii        hang up my harp again         i have no voice for song     not song but wail and mourners pale         not bards to love belong       o failing human love         o light by darkness known     o false the while thou treadest earth         o deaf beneath the stone                 margret margret     isobels child            so find we profit     by losing of our prayers      shakespeare       i      to rest the weary nurse has gone       an eightday watch had watchèd she     still rocking beneath sun and moon       the baby on her knee     till isobel its mother said     the fever wanethwend to bed       for now the watch comes round to me      ii        then wearily the nurse did throw         her pallet in the darkest place     of that sick room and slept and dreamed       for as the gusty wind did blow         the nightlamps flare across her face     she saw or seemed to see but dreamed       that the poplars tall on the opposite hill     the seven tall poplars on the hill     did clasp the setting sun until     his rays dropped from him pined and still       as blossoms in frost     till he waned and paled so weirdly crossed     to the colour of moonlight which doth pass     over the dank ridged churchyard grass     the poplars held the sun and he     the eyes of the nurse that they should not see     not for a moment the babe on her knee     though she shuddered to feel that it grew to be     too chill and lay too heavily      iii      she only dreamed for all the while       t was lady isobel that kept       the little baby and it slept     fast warm as if its mothers smile     laden with loves dewy weight     and red as rose of harpocrate     dropt upon its eyelids pressed     lashes to cheek in a sealèd rest      iv      and more and more smiled isobel     to see the baby sleep so well     she knew not that she smiled     against the lattice dull and wild     drive the heavy droning drops       drop by drop the sound being one     as momently times segments fall     on the ear of god who hears through all       eternitys unbroken monotone     and more and more smiled isobel     to see the baby sleep so well     she knew not that she smiled     the wind in intermission stops       down in the beechen forest         then cries aloud       as one at the sorest         selfstung selfdriven     and rises up to its very tops     stiffening erect the branches bowed       dilating with a tempestsoul     the trees that with their dark hands break     through their own outline and heavy roll       shadows as massive as clouds in heaven         across the castle lake     and more and more smiled isobel     to see the baby sleep so well     she knew not that she smiled     she knew not that the storm was wild     through the uproar drear she could not hear     the castle clock which struck anear     she heard the low light breathing of her child      v      o sight for wondering look     while the external nature broke     into such abandonment     while the very mist heartrent     by the lightning seemed to eddy     against nature with a din     a sense of silence and of steady     natural calm appeared to come     from things without and enter in     the human creatures room      vi      so motionless she sate       the babe asleep upon her knees     you might have dreamed their souls had gone     away to things inanimate     in such to live in such to moan     and that their bodies had taen back       in mystic change all silences     that cross the sky in cloudy rack     or dwell beneath the reedy ground     in waters safe from their own sound         only she wore     the deepening smile i named before     and that a deepening love expressed     and who at once can love and rest      vii      in sooth the smile that then was keeping     watch upon the baby sleeping       floated with its tender light     downward from the drooping eyes     upward from the lips apart       over cheeks which had grown white     with an eightday weeping     all smiles come in such a wise       where tears shall fall or have of old     like northern lights that fill the heart       of heaven in sign of cold      viii      motionless she sate     her hair had fallen by its weight     on each side of her smile and lay     very blackly on the arm     where the baby nestled warm     pale as baby carved in stone     seen by glimpses of the moon       up a dark cathedral aisle     but through the storm no moonbeam fell     upon the child of isobel     perhaps you saw it by the ray       alone of her still smile      ix            a solemn thing it is to me             to look upon a babe that sleeps             wearing in its spiritdeeps           the undeveloped mystery             of our adams taint and woe           which when they developed be             will not let it slumber so           lying new in life beneath           the shadow of the coming death           with that soft low quiet breath             as if it felt the sun           knowing all things by their blooms           not their roots yea sun and sky           only by the warmth that comes           out of each earth only by             the pleasant hues that oer it run           and human love by drops of sweet             white nourishment still hanging round             the little mouth so slumberbound           all which broken sentiency           and conclusion incomplete             will gather and unite and climb           to an immortality             good or evil each sublime           through life and death to life again             o little lids now folded fast             must ye learn to drop at last               our large and burning tears           o warm quick body must thou lie           when the time comes round to die               still from all the whirl of years           bare of all the joy and pain           o small frail being wilt thou stand           at gods right hand           lifting up those sleeping eyes           dilated by great destinies     to an endless waking thrones and seraphim     through the long ranks of their solemnities     sunning thee with calm looks of heavens surprise           but thine alone on him     or else selfwilled to tread the godless place     god keep thy will feel thine own energies     cold strong objèctless like a dead mans clasp     the sleepless deathless life within thee grasp     while myriad faces like one changeless face     with woe not loves shall glass thee everywhere     and overcome thee with thine own despair      x      more soft less solemn images     drifted oer the ladys heart       silently as snow     she had seen eight days depart     hour by hour on bended knees       with palewrung hands and prayings low     and broken through which came the sound     of tears that fell against the ground     making sad stopsdear lord dear lord     she still had prayed the heavenly word     broken by an earthly sigh     thou who didst not erst deny     the motherjoy to mary mild     blessèd in the blessèd child     which hearkened in meek babyhood     her cradlehymn albeit used     to all that music interfused     in breasts of angels high and good     oh take not lord my babe away     oh take not to thy songful heaven     the pretty baby thou hast given     or ere that i have seen him play     around his fathers knees and known     that he knew how my love has gone     from all the world to him     think god among the cherubim     how i shall shiver every day     in thy june sunshine knowing where     the gravegrass keeps it from his fair     still cheeks and feel at every tread     his little body which is dead     and hidden in thy turfy fold     doth make thy whole warm earth acold     o god i am so young so young       i am not used to tears at nights     instead of slumbernot to prayer     with sobbing lips and hands outwrung     thou knowest all my prayings were       i bless thee god for past delights     thank god i am not used to bear     hard thoughts of death the earth doth cover     no face from me of friend or lover     and must the first who teaches me     the form of shrouds and funerals be     mine own firstborn belovèd he     who taught me first this motherlove     dear lord who spreadest out above     thy loving transpierced hands to meet     all lifted hearts with blessing sweet     pierce not my heart my tender heart     thou madest tender thou who art     so happy in thy heaven alway     take not mine only bliss away      xi      she so had prayed and god who hears     through seraphsongs the sound of tears     from that belovèd babe had taen     the fever and the beating pain     and more and more smiled isobel     to see the baby sleep so well       she knew not that she smiled i wis     until the pleasant gradual thought     which near her heart the smile enwrought     now soft and slow itself did seem     to float along a happy dream       beyond it into speech like this      xii      i prayed for thee my little child       and god has heard my prayer     and when thy babyhood is gone     we two together undefiled     by mens repinings will kneel down       upon his earth which will be fair     not covering thee sweet to us twain       and give him thankful praise      xiii      dully and wildly drives the rain     against the lattices drives the rain      xiv      i thank him now that i can think       of those same future days     nor from the harmless image shrink       of what i there might see     strange babies on their mothers knee     whose

forlorn     strewn round us like a dead worlds shroud in ghastly fragments torn     and through the night and through the hush and over the flapping         wing     we heard beside the heavenly gate the angels murmuring     we heard them say put day to day and count the days to seven     and god will draw onora up the golden stairs of heaven     and yet the evil ones have leave that purpose to defer     for if she has no need of him he has no need of her  evil spirit      speak out to me speak bold and free  onora in sleep                             and then i heard thee say     i count

her rein and a word yet to say     her dropt eyelids suggest the soft answers beneath     and the little quick smiles come and go with her breath             when she sigheth or speaketh      iv      and the tender bridemother breaks off unaware     from an ave to think that her daughter is fair     till in nearing the chapel and glancing before     she seeth her little son stand at the door             is it play that he seeketh      v      is it play when his eyes wander innocentwild     and sublimed with a sadness unfitting a child     he trembles not weeps not the passion is done     and calmly he kneels in their midst with the sun             on his head like a glory      vi      o fairfeatured maids ye are many he cried     but in fairness and vileness who matcheth the bride     o bravehearted youths ye are many but whom     for the courage and woe can ye match with the groom             as ye see them before ye      vii      out spake the brides mother the vileness is thine     if thou shame thine own sister a bride at the shrine     out spake the brides lover the vileness be mine     if he shame mine own wife at the hearth or the shrine             and the charge be

lovegift kind brother quoth he     she may wear an she listeth a brown rosary             like a purehearted lady      x      then swept through the chapel the long bridal train     though he spake to the bride she replied not again     on as one in a dream pale and stately she went     where the altarlights burn oer the great sacrament             faint with daylight but steady      xi      but her brother had passed in between them and her     and calmly knelt down on the highaltar stair     of an infantine aspect so stern to the view     that the priest could not smile on the childs eyes of blue             as he would for another      xii      he knelt like a child marblesculptured and white     that seems kneeling to pray on the tomb of a knight     with a look taken up to each iris of stone     from the greatness and death where he kneeleth but none             from the face of a mother      xiii      in your chapel o priest ye have wedded and shriven     fair wives for the hearth and fair sinners for heaven     but this fairest my sister ye think now to wed     bid her kneel where she standeth and shrive her instead             o shrive her and wed not      xiv      in

still saints and see     how she wears on her bosom a brown rosary             is it used for the praying      xvi      the youths looked asideto laugh there were a sin     and the maidens lips

spake low and led onward the bride     and before the high altar they stood side by side     the ritebook is opened the rite is begun     they have knelt down together to rise up as one             who laughed by the altar      xviii      the maidens looked forward the youths looked around     the bridegrooms eye flashed from his prayer at the sound     and each saw the bride as if no bride she were     gazing cold at the priest without gesture of prayer             as he read from the psalter      xix      the priest never knew that she did so but still     he felt a power on him too strong for his will     and whenever the great name was there to be read     his voice sank to silencethat could not be said             or the air could not hold it      xx      i have sinnèd quoth he i have sinnèd i wot     and the tears ran adown his old cheeks at the thought     they dropped fast on the book but he read on the same     and aye was the silence where should be the name             as the choristers told it      xxi      the ritebook is closed and the rite being done     they who knelt down together arise up as one     fair riseth the brideoh a fair bride is she     but for all

xxiv      long and still was her gaze while they chafèd him there     and breathed in the mouth whose last life had kissed her     but when they stood uponly they with a start     the shriek from her

and their voices low with fashion not with feeling softly freighted     all the air about the windows with elastic laughters sweet      xx      for at eve the open windows flung their light out on the terrace     which the floating orbs of curtains did with gradual shadow sweep     while the swans upon the river fed at morning by the heiress     trembled downward through their snowy wings at music in their sleep      xxi      and there evermore was music both of instrument and singing     till the finches of the shrubberies grew restless in the dark     but the cedars stood up motionless each in a moonlights ringing     and the deer half in the glimmer strewed the hollows of the park      xxii      and though sometimes she would bind me with her silvercorded speeches     to commix my words

     in the morning horn of huntsman hoof of steed and laugh of rider     spread out cheery from the courtyard till we lost them in the hills     while herself and other ladies and her suitors left

divineness of the smile hid in her eyes      xxvi      for her eyes alone smile constantly her lips have serious sweetness     and her front is calm the dimple rarely ripples on the cheek     but her deep blue eyes smile constantly as if they in discreetness     kept the secret of a happy dream she did not care to speak      xxvii      thus she drew me the first morning out across into the garden

soul of fasting saint     whereby lies a marble silence sleeping lough the sculptor wrought         her     so asleep she is forgetting to say husha fancy quaint      xxx      mark how heavy white her eyelids not a dream between them lingers     and the left hands index droppeth from the lips upon the cheek     while the right handwith the symbolrose held slack within the         fingers     has fallen backward in the basinyet this silence will not speak      xxxi      that the essential meaning growing may exceed the special symbol     is the thought as i conceive it it applies more high and low     our true noblemen will often through right nobleness grow humble     and assert an inward honour by denying outward show      xxxii      nay your silence said i truly holds her symbolrose but slackly     yet she holds it or would scarcely be a silence to our ken     and your nobles wear their ermine on the outside or walk blackly     in the presence of the social law as mere ignoble men

xxxv      half in playfulness she spoke i thought and half in indignation     friends who listened laughed her words off while her lovers deemed         her fair     a fair woman flushed with feeling in her noblelighted station     near the statues white reposingand both bathed in sunny air      xxxvi      with the trees round not so distant but you heard their vernal murmur     and beheld in light and shadow the leaves in and outward move     and the little fountain leaping toward the sunheart to be warmer     then recoiling in a tremble from the too much light above      xxxvii      t is a picture for remembrance and thus morning after morning     did i follow as she drew me by the spirit to her feet     why her greyhound followed also dogswe both were dogs for         scorning     to be sent back when she pleased it and her path lay through the wheat      xxxviii      and thus morning after morning spite of vows and spite of sorrow     did i follow at her drawing while the weekdays passed along     just to feed the swans this noontide or to see the fawns tomorrow     or to teach the hillside echo some sweet tuscan in a song      xxxix      ay for sometimes on the hillside while we sate down in the gowans     with the forest green behind us and its shadow cast before     and the river running under and across it from the rowans     a brown partridge whirring near us till we felt the air it bore      xl      there obedient to her praying did i read aloud the poems     made to tuscan flutes or instruments more various of our own     read the pastoral parts

the chariot wheels jar in the gate through which you drive them         forth      xliii      after when we were grown tired of books the silence round us flinging     a slow arm of sweet compression felt with beatings at the breast     she would break out on a sudden in a gush of woodland singing     like a childs emotion in a goda naiad tired of rest      xliv      oh to see or hear her singing scarce i know which is divinest     for her looks sing tooshe modulates her gestures on the tune     and her mouth stirs with the song like song and when the notes are         finest     t is the eyes that shoot out vocal light and seem to swell them on      xlv      then we talkedoh how we talked her voice so cadenced in the         talking     made another singingof the soul a music without bars

as if she always thought         them     she had sympathies so rapid open free as bird on branch     just as ready to fly east as west whichever way besought them     in the birchenwood a chirrup or a cockcrow in the grange      xlvii      in her utmost lightness there is truthand often she speaks lightly     has a grace in being gay which even mournful souls approve     for the root of some grave earnest thought is understruck so rightly     as to justify the foliage and the waving flowers above      xlviii      and she talked onwe talked rather upon all things substance         shadow     of the sheep that browsed the grasses of the reapers in the corn     of the little children from the schools seen winding through the         meadow     of the poor rich world beyond them still kept poorer by its scorn      xlix      so of men and so of lettersbooks are men of higher stature     and the only men that speak aloud for future times to hear     so of mankind in the abstract which

vibration and impulsion to an end beyond its own     as the branch of a green osier when a child would overcome it     springs up freely from his claspings and goes swinging in the sun      lix      as i mused i heard a murmur it grew deep as it grew longer     speakers using earnest languagelady geraldine you would     and i heard a voice that pleaded ever on in accents stronger     as a sense

stood up blindly and my burning heart within     seemed to seethe and fuse my senses till they ran on all sides         darkening     and scorched weighed like melted metal round my feet that stood

like thesemere madness friend i need not write them         fuller     for i hear my hot soul dropping on the lines in showers of tears     oh a woman friend a woman why a beast had scarce been duller     than roar bestial loud complaints against the shining of the spheres      lxxxii      but at last there came a pause i stood all vibrating with thunder     which my soul had used the silence drew her face up like a call     could you guess what word she uttered she looked up as if in wonder     with tears beaded on her lashes and saidbertramit was all      lxxxiii      if she had cursed me and she might have or if even with queenly         bearing     which at need is used by women she had risen up and said     sir you are my guest and therefore i have given you a full hearing     now

weight     of the calm which crushed my passion i seemed drowning in a vapour     and her gentleness destroyed me whom her scorn made desolate      lxxxv      so struck backward and exhausted by that inward flow of passion     which had rushed on sparing nothing into forms of abstract truth     by a logic agonizing through unseemly demonstration     and by youths own anguish turning grimly grey the hairs of youth      lxxxvi      by the sense accursed and instant that if even i spake wisely     i spake baselyusing truth if what i spake indeed was true     to avenge wrong on a womanher who sate there weighing nicely     a poor manhoods worth found guilty of such deeds as i could do      lxxxvii      by such wrong and woe exhaustedwhat i suffered and occasioned     as a wild horse

it from her scornful sight but not beyond the gate     she is too kind to be cruel and too haughty not to pardon     such a man as i t were something to be level to her hate      xc      but for meyou now are conscious why my friend i write this letter     how my life is read all backward and the charm of life undone     i shall leave her house at dawn i would tonight if i were better     and i charge my soul to hold my body strengthened for the sun      xci      when the sun has dyed the oriel i depart with no last gazes     no weak moanings one word only left in writing for her hands     out of reach of all derision and some unavailing praises     to make front against this anguish in the far and foreign lands      xcii      blame me not i would not squander life in griefi am

    the runaway slave at pilgrims point       i      i stand on the mark beside the shore       of the first white pilgrims bended knee     where exile turned to ancestor       and god was thanked for liberty     i have run through the night my skin is as dark     i bend my knee down on this mark       i look on the sky and the sea      ii      o pilgrimsouls i speak to you       i see you come proud and slow     from the land of the spirits pale as dew       and round me and round me ye go     o pilgrims i have gasped and run     all night long from the whips of one       who in your names works sin and woe      iii      and thus i thought that i would come       and kneel here where ye knelt before     and feel your souls around me hum       in undertone to the oceans roar     and lift my black face my black hand     here in your names to curse this land       ye blessed in freedoms evermore      iv      i am black i am black       and yet god made me they say     but if he did so smiling back       he must have cast his work away     under the feet of his white creatures     with a look of scorn that the dusky features       might be trodden again to clay      v      and yet he has made dark things       to be glad and merry as light     theres a little dark bird sits and sings       theres a dark stream ripples out of sight     and the dark frogs chant in the safe morass

 our blackness shuts like prisonbars     the poor souls crouch so far behind     that never a comfort can they find       by reaching through the prisonbars      vii      indeed we live beneath the sky       that great smooth hand of god stretched out     on all his children fatherly       to save them from the dread and doubt     which would be if from this low place     all opened straight up to his face       into the grand eternity      viii      and still gods sunshine and his frost       they make us hot they make us cold     as if we were not black and lost       and the beasts and birds in wood and fold     do fear and take us for very men     could the whippoorwill or the cat of the glen       look into my eyes and be bold      ix      i am black i am black       but once i laughed in girlish glee     for one of my colour stood in the track       where the drivers drove and looked at me     and tender and full was the look he gave     could a slave look so at another slave       i look at the sky and the sea      x      and from that hour our spirits grew       as free as if unsold unbought     oh strong enough since we were two       to conquer the world we thought     the drivers drove us day by day     we did not mind we went one way       and no better a freedom sought      xi      in the sunny ground between the canes       he said i love you as he passed     when the shingleroof rang sharp with the rains       i heard how he vowed it fast     while others shook he smiled in the hut     as he carved me a bowl of the cocoanut       through the roar of the hurricanes      xii      i sang his name instead of a song       over and over i sang his name     upward and downward i drew it along       my various notesthe same the same     i sang it low that the slavegirls near     might never guess from aught they could hear       it was only a namea name      xiii      i look on the sky and the sea       we were two to love and two to pray     yes two o god who cried to thee       though nothing didst thou say     coldly thou satst behind the sun     and now i cry who am but one       thou wilt not speak today      xiv      we were black we were black       we had no claim to love and bliss     what marvel if each went to wrack       they wrung my cold hands out of his     they dragged himwhere i crawled to touch     his bloods mark in the dust  not much       ye pilgrimsouls though plain as this      xv      wrong followed by a deeper wrong       mere griefs too good for such as i     so the white men brought the shame ere long       to strangle the sob of my agony     they would not leave me for my dull     wet eyesit was too merciful       to let me weep pure tears and die      xvi      i am black i am black       i wore a child upon my breast     an amulet that hung too slack       and in my unrest could not rest     thus we went moaning child and mother     one to another one to another       until all ended for the best      xvii      for hark i will tell you low low       i am black you see     and the babe who lay on my bosom so       was far too white too white for me     as white as the ladies who scorned to pray     beside me at church but yesterday       though my tears had washed a place for my knee      xviii      my own own child i could not bear       to look in his face it was so white     i covered him up with a kerchief there       i covered his face in close and tight     and he moaned and struggled as well might be     for the white child wanted his liberty       ha ha he wanted the masterright      xix      he moaned and beat with his head and feet       his little feet that never grew     he struck them out as it was meet       against my heart to break it through     i might have sung and made him mild     but i dared not sing to the whitefaced child       the only song i knew      xx      i pulled the kerchief very close       he could not see the sun i swear     more then alive than now he does       from between the roots of the mango  where     i know where close a child and mother     do wrong to look at one another       when one is black and one is fair      xxi      why in that single glance i had       of my childs face  i tell you all     i saw a look that made me mad       the masters look that used to fall     on my soul like his lash  or worse     and so to save it from my curse       i twisted it round in my shawl      xxii      and he moaned and trembled from foot to head       he shivered from head to foot     till after a time he lay instead       too suddenly still and mute     i felt beside a stiffening cold     i dared to lift up just a fold       as in lifting a leaf of the mangofruit      xxiii      but my fruit  ha hathere had been       i laugh to think on t at this hour     your fine white angels who have seen       nearest the secret of gods power     and plucked my fruit to make them wine     and sucked the soul of that child of mine       as the hummingbird sucks the soul of the flower      xxiv      ha ha the trick of the angels white       they freed the white childs spirit so     i said not a word but day and night       i carried the body to and fro     and it lay on my heart like a stone as chill     the sun may shine out as much as he will       i am cold though it happened a month ago      xxv      from the white mans house and the black mans hut       i carried the little body on     the forests arms did round us shut       and silence through the trees did run     they asked no question as i went     they stood too high for astonishment       they could see god sit on his throne      xxvi      my little body kerchiefed fast       i bore it on through the forest on     and when i felt it was tired at last       i scooped a hole beneath the moon     through the foresttops the angels far     with a white sharp finger from every star       did point and mock at what was done      xxvii      yet when it was all done aught       earth twixt me and my baby strewed     all changed to black earthnothing white       a dark child in the darkensued     some comfort and my heart grew young     i sate down smiling there and sung       the song i learnt in my maidenhood      xxviii      and thus we two were reconciled       the white child and black mother thus     for as i sang it soft and wild       the same song more melodious     rose from the grave whereon i sate     it was the dead child singing that       to join the souls of both of us      xxix      i look on the sea and the sky       where the pilgrims ships first anchored lay     the free sun rideth gloriously       but the pilgrimghosts have slid away     through the earliest streaks of the morn     my face is black but it glares with a scorn       which they dare not meet by day      xxx      hain their stead their hunter sons       ha ha they are on methey hunt in a ring     keep off i brave you all at once       i

xxxi      man drop that stone you dared to lift       i wish you who stand there five abreast     each for his own wifes joy and gift       a little corpse as safely at rest     as mine in the mangoes yes but she     may keep live babies on her knee       and sing the song she likes the best      xxxii      i am not mad i am black       i see you staring in my face     i know you staring shrinking back       ye are born of the washingtonrace     and this land is the free america     and this mark on my wristi prove what i say       ropes tied me up here to the floggingplace      xxxiii      you think i shrieked then not a sound       i hung as a gourd hangs in the sun     i only cursed them all around       as softly as i might have done     my very own child from these sands     up to the mountains lift your hands       o slaves and end what i begun      xxxiv      whips curses these must answer those       for in this union you have set     two kinds of men in adverse rows       each loathing each and all forget     the seven wounds in christs body fair     while he sees gaping everywhere       our countless wounds that pay no debt      xxxv      our wounds are different your white men       are after all not gods indeed     nor able to make christs again       do good with bleeding we who bleed     stand off we help not in our loss     we are too heavy for our cross       and fall and crush you and your seed      xxxvi      i fall i swoon i look at the sky       the clouds are breaking on my brain     i am floated along as if i should die       of libertys exquisite pain     in the name of the white child waiting for me     in the deathdark where we may kiss and agree     white men i leave you all cursefree       in my broken hearts disdain     the cry of the children      pheu pheu ti prosderkesthe m ommasin tekna      medea       i      do ye hear the children weeping o my brothers         ere the sorrow comes with years     they are leaning their young heads against their mothers         and that cannot stop their tears     the young lambs are bleating in the meadows       the young birds are chirping in the nest     the young fawns are playing with the shadows       the young flowers are blowing toward the west     but the young young children o my brothers         they are weeping bitterly     they are weeping in the playtime of the others         in the country of the free      ii      do you question the young children in the sorrow         why their tears are falling so     the old man may weep for his tomorrow         which is lost in long ago     the old tree is leafless in the forest       the old year is ending in the frost     the old wound if stricken is the sorest       the old hope is hardest to be lost     but the young young children o my brothers         do you ask them why they stand     weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers         in our happy fatherland      iii      they look up with their pale and sunken faces         and their looks are sad to see     for the mans hoary anguish draws and presses         down the cheeks of infancy     your old earth they say is very dreary       our young feet they say are very weak     few paces have we taken yet are weary       our graverest is very far to seek     ask the aged why they weep and not the children         for the outside earth is cold     and we young ones stand without in our bewildering         and the graves are for the old      iv      true say the children it may happen         that we die before our time     little alice died last year her grave is shapen         like a snowball in the rime     we looked into the pit prepared to take her       was no room for any work in the close clay     from the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her       crying get up little alice it is day     if you listen by that grave in sun and shower       with your ear down little alice never cries     could we see her face be sure we should not know her       for the smile has time for growing in her eyes     and merry go her moments lulled and stilled in         the shroud by the kirkchime     it is good when it happens say the children         that we die before our time      v      alas alas the children they are seeking         death in life as best to have     they are binding up their hearts away from breaking         with a cerement from the grave     go out children from the mine and from the city       sing out children as the little thrushes do     pluck your handfuls of the meadowcowslips pretty       laugh aloud to feel your fingers let them through     but they answer are your cowslips of the meadows         like our weeds anear the mine     leave us quiet in the dark of the coalshadows         from your pleasures fair and fine      vi      for oh say the children we are weary         and we cannot run or leap     if we cared for any meadows it were merely         to drop down in them and sleep     our knees tremble sorely in the stooping       we fall upon our faces trying to go     and underneath our heavy eyelids drooping       the reddest flower would look as pale as snow     for all day we drag our burden tiring         through the coaldark underground     or all day we drive the wheels of iron         in the factories round and round      vii      for all day the wheels are droning turning         their wind comes in our faces     till our hearts turn our heads with pulses burning         and the walls turn in their places     turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling       turns the long light that drops adown the wall     turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling       all are turning all the day and we with all     and all day the iron wheels are droning         and sometimes we could pray     o ye wheels breaking out in a mad moaning         stop be silent for today      viii      ay be silent let them hear each other breathing         for a moment mouth to mouth     let them touch each others hands in a fresh wreathing         of their tender human youth     let them feel that this cold metallic motion       is not all the life god fashions or reveals     let them prove their living souls against the notion       that they live in you or under you o wheels     still all day the iron wheels go onward         grinding life down from its mark     and the childrens souls which god is calling sunward         spin on blindly in the dark      ix      now tell the poor young children o my brothers         to look up to him and pray     so the blessed one who blesseth all the others         will bless them another day     they answer who is god that he should hear us       while the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred     when we sob aloud the human creatures near us       pass by hearing not or answer not a word     and we hear not for the wheels in their resounding         strangers speaking at the door     is it likely god with angels singing round him         hears our weeping any more      x      two words indeed of praying we remember         and at midnights hour of harm     our father looking upward in the chamber         we say softly for a charm6     we know no other words except our father       and we think that in some pause of angels song     god may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather       and hold both within his right hand which is strong     our father if he heard us he would surely         for they call him good and mild     answer smiling down the steep world very purely         come and rest with me my child      xi      but no say the children weeping faster         he is speechless as a stone     and they tell us of his image is the master         who commands us to work on     go to say the childrenup in heaven       dark wheellike turning clouds are all we find     do not mock us grief has made us unbelieving       we look up for god but tears have made us blind     do you hear the children weeping and disproving         o my brothers what ye preach     for gods possible is taught by his worlds loving         and the children doubt of each      xii      and well may the children weep before you         they are weary ere they run     they have never seen the sunshine nor the glory         which is brighter than the sun     they know the grief of man without its wisdom       they sink in mans despair without its calm     are slaves without the liberty in christdom       are martyrs by the pang without the palm     are worn as if with age yet unretrievingly

above us showed     a universal and unmoving cloud     on which the cliffs permitted us to see     only the outline of their majesty     as masterminds when gazed at by the crowd     and shining with a gloom the water grey           swang in its moontaught way      iii            nor moon nor stars were out     they did not dare to tread so soon about     though trembling in the footsteps of the sun     the light was neither nights nor days but one     which lifelike had a beauty in its doubt     and silences impassioned breathings round           seemed wandering into sound      iv            o solemnbeating heart     of nature i have knowledge that thou art     bound unto mans by cords he cannot sever     and what time they are slackened by him ever     so to attest his own supernal part     still runneth thy vibration fast and strong           the slackened cord along      v            for though we never spoke     of the grey water and the shaded rock     dark wave and stone unconsciously were fused     into the plaintive speaking that we used     of absent friends and memories unforsook     and had we seen each others face we had           seen haply each was sad     the seamew  affectionately inscribed to m e h       i      how joyously the young seamew     lay dreaming on the waters blue     whereon our little bark had thrown     a little shade the only one     but shadows ever man pursue      ii      familiar with the waves and free     as if their own white foam were he     his heart upon the heart of ocean     lay learning all its mystic motion     and throbbing to the throbbing sea      iii      and such a brightness in his eye     as if the ocean and the sky     within him had lit up and nurst     a soul god gave him not at first     to comprehend their majesty      iv      we were not cruel yet did sunder     his white wing from the blue waves under     and bound it while his fearless eyes     shone up to ours in calm surprise     as deeming us some ocean wonder      v      we bore our ocean bird unto     a grassy place where he might view     the flowers that curtsey to the bees     the waving of the tall green trees     the falling of the silver dew      vi      but flowers of earth were pale to him     who had seen the rainbow fishes swim     and when earths dew around him lay     he thought of oceans wingèd spray     and his eye waxèd sad and dim      vii      the green trees round him only made     a prison with their darksome shade     and drooped his wing and mournèd he     for his own boundless glittering sea     albeit he knew not they could fade      viii      then one her gladsome face did bring     her gentle voices murmuring     in oceans stead his heart to move     and teach him what was human love     he thought it a strange mournful thing      ix      he lay down in his grief to die     first looking to the sealike sky     that hath no waves because alas     our human touch did on him pass     and with our touch our agony     felicia hemans  to l e l  referring to her monody on the poetess       i      thou baycrowned living one that oer the baycrowned dead art bowing     and oer the shadeless moveless brow the vital shadow throwing     and oer the sighless songless lips the wail and music wedding     and dropping oer the tranquil eyes the tears not of their shedding      ii      take music from the silent dead whose meaning is completer     reserve thy tears for living brows where all such tears are meeter     and leave the violets in the grass to brighten where thou treadest     no flowers for her no need of flowers albeit bring flowers thou         saidest      iii      yes flowers to crown the cup and lute since both may come to         breaking     or flowers to greet the bridethe hearts own beating works its         aching     or flowers to soothe the captives sight from earths free bosom         gathered     reminding of his earthly hope then withering as it withered      iv      but bring not near the solemn corse a type of human seeming     lay only dusts stern verity upon the dust undreaming     and while the calm perpetual stars shall look upon it solely     her spherèd soul shall look on them with eyes more bright and holy      v      nor mourn o living one because her part in life was mourning     would she have lost the poets fire for anguish of the burning     the minstrel harp for the strained string the tripod for the         afflated     woe or the vision for those tears in which it shone dilated      vi      perhaps she shuddered while the worlds cold hand her brow was         wreathing     but never wronged that mystic breath which breathed in all her         breathing     which drew from rocky earth and man abstractions high and moving     beauty if not the beautiful and love if not the loving      vii      such visionings have paled in sight the saviour she descrieth     and little recks who wreathed the brow which on his bosom lieth     the whiteness of his innocence oer all her garments flowing     there learneth she the sweet new song she will not mourn in knowing      viii      be happy crowned and living one and as thy dust decayeth     may thine own england say for thee what now for her it sayeth     albeit softly in our ears her silver song was ringing     the footfall of her parting soul is softer than her singing     l e ls last question      do you think of me as i think of you     from her poem written during the voyage to the cape       i      do you think of me as i think of you     my friends my friendsshe said it from the sea     the english minstrel in her minstrelsy     while under brighter skies than erst she knew     her heart grew dark and groped there as the blind     to reach across the waves friends left behind     do you think of me as i think of you      ii      it seemed not much to askas i of you     we all do ask the same no eyelids cover     within the meekest eyes that question over     and little in the world the loving do     but sit among the rocks and listen for     the echo of their own love evermore     do you think of me as i think of you      iii      lovelearnèd she had sung of love and love     and like a child that sleeping with dropt head     upon the fairybook he lately read     whatever household noises round him move     hears in his dream some elfin turbulence     even so suggestive to her inward sense     all sounds of life assumed one tune of love      iv      and when the glory of her dream withdrew     when knightly gestes and courtly pageantries     were broken in her visionary eyes     by tears the solemn seas attested true     forgetting that sweet lute beside her hand     she asked notdo you praise me o my land

that lone moment might confirm her dear     for when her questioned friends in agony     made passionate response we think of thee     her place was in the dust too deep to hear      vi      could she not wait to catch their answering breath     was she content content with oceans sound     which dashed its mocking infinite around     one thirsty for a little lovebeneath     those stars content where last her song had gone     they mute and cold in radiant life as soon     their singer was to be in darksome death8      vii      bring your vain answerscry we think of thee     how think ye of her warm in long ago     delights or crowned with budding bays not so     none smile and none are crowned where lieth she     with all her visions unfulfilled save one     her childhoods of the palmtrees in the sun     and lo their shadow on her sepulchre      viii      do ye think of me as i think of you     o friends o kindred o dear brotherhood     of all the world what are we that we

but while on mortal lips i shape anew     a sigh to mortal issues verily     above the unshaken stars that see us die     a vocal pathos rolls and he who drew     all life from dust and for all tasted
