xxiii again at crokers hall     xxiv conclusion     volume i  chapter i  mrs baggett   mr william whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in hampshire thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers pocket he always breakfasted exactly at nine and the letters were supposed to be brought to him at a quarter past the postman was really due at his halldoor at a quarter before nine but though he had lived in the same house for above fifteen years and though he was a man very anxious to get his letters he had never yet learned the truth about them he was satisfied in his ignorance with 915 am but on this occasion the postboy as usual was ten minutes after that time mr whittlestaff had got through his second cup of tea and was stranded in his chair having nothing to do with the empty cup and plates before him for the space of two minutes and consequently when he had sent some terrible message out to the postboy and then had read the one epistle which had arrived on this morning he thus liberated his mind ill be whipped if i will have anything to do with her but this must not be taken as indicating the actual state of his mind but simply the condition of anger to which he had been reduced by the postboy if any one were to explain to him afterwards that he had so expressed himself on a subject of such importance he would have declared of himself that he certainly deserved to be whipped himself in order that he might in truth make up his mind on the subject he went out with his hat and stick into the long walk and there thought out the matter to its conclusion the letter which he held in his pocket ran as follows      st tawells norwich february 18     my dear mr whittlestaffpoor mrs lawrie has gone at    last she died this morning at seven oclock and poor    mary is altogether alone in the world i have asked her    to come in among us for a few days at any rate till the    funeral shall be over but she has refused knowing i    suppose how crowded and how small our house is what is    she to do you know all the circumstances much better than    i do she says herself that she had always been intended    for a governess and that she will of course follow out    the intention which had been fixed on between her and her    father before his death but it is a most weary prospect    especially for one who has received no direct education    for the purpose she has devoted herself for the last    twelve months to mrs lawrie as though she had been her    mother you did not like mrs lawrie nor did i nor    indeed did poor mary love her very dearly but she at    any rate did her duty by her stepmother i know that in    regard to actual money you will be generous enough but do    turn the matter over in your mind and endeavour to think    of some future for the poor girlyours very faithfully     emma king   it was in answer to such a letter as this that mr whittlestaff had declared that hed be whipped if hed have anything to do with her but that expression which must not in truth be accepted as meaning anything must not be supposed to have had even that dim shadow of a meaning which the words may be supposed to bear he had during the last three months been asking himself the question as to what should be mary lawries fate in life when her stepmother should have gone and had never quite solved the question whether he could or would not bring into his own house almost as a daughter a young woman who was in no way related to him he had always begun these exercises of thought by telling himself that the world was a censorious old fool and that he might do just as he pleased as to making any girl his daughter but then before dinner he had generally come to the conclusion that mrs baggett would not approve mrs baggett was his housekeeper and was to him certainly a person of importance he had not even suggested the idea to mrs baggett and was sure that mrs baggett would not approve as to sending mary lawrie out into the world as a governessthat plan he was quite sure would not answer  two years ago had died his best beloved friend captain patrick lawrie with him we have not anything to do except to say that of all men he was the most impecunious late in life he had married a second wifea woman who was hard sharp and possessed of an annuity the future condition of his only daughter had been a terrible grief to him but from mr whittlestaff he had received assurances which had somewhat comforted him she shant want i cant say anything further such had been the comfort given by mr whittlestaff and since his friends death mr whittlestaff had been liberal with presentswhich mary had taken most unwillingly under her stepmothers guidance such had been the state of things when mr whittlestaff received the letter when he had been walking up and down the long walk for an extra hour mr whittlestaff expressed aloud the conclusion to which he had come i dont care one straw for mrs baggett it should be understood as having been uttered in direct opposition to the first assurance made by him that hed be whipped if hed have anything to do with her in that hour he had resolved that mary lawrie should come to him and be made with all possible honours of ownership with all its privileges and all its responsibilities the mistress of his house and he made up his mind also that such had ever been his determination he was fifty and mary lawrie was twentyfive i can do just what i please with her he said to himself as though she were my own girl by this he meant to imply that he would not be expected to fall in love with her and that it was quite out of the question that she should fall in love with him go and tell mrs baggett that ill be much obliged to her if shell put on her bonnet and come out to me here this he said to a gardeners boy and the order was not at all an unusual one when he wanted to learn what mrs baggett intended to give him for dinner he would send for the old housekeeper and take a walk with her for twenty minutes habit had made mrs baggett quite accustomed to the proceeding which upon the whole she enjoyed she now appeared with a bonnet and a wadded cloak which her master had given her its about that letter sir said mrs baggett  how do you know  didnt i see the handwriting and the black edges mrs lawrie aint no more  mrs lawrie has gone to her long account  im afeared sir she wont find it easy to settle the bill said mrs baggett who had a sharp cynical way of expressing her disapprobation  mrs baggett judge not lest you be judged mrs baggett turned up her nose and snuffed the air the woman has gone and nothing shall be said against her here the girl remains now ill tell you what i mean to do  she isnt to come here mr whittlestaff  here she is to come and here she is to remain and here she is to have her part of everything as though she were my own daughter and as not the smallest portion of the good things that is to come to her she is to have her share in your heart mrs baggett  i dont know nothing about my heart mr whittlestaff them as finds their way to my heart has to work their way there whos miss lawrie that im to be knocked about for a new comer  she is just mary lawrie  im that old that i dont feel like having a young missus put over me and it aint for your good mr whittlestaff you aint a young mannor you aint an old un and she aint no relations to you thats the worst part of it as sure as my name is dorothy baggett youll be falling in love with her then mrs baggett with the sense of the audacity of what she had said looked him full in the face and violently shook her head  now go in he said and pack my things up for three nights im going to norwich and i shant want any dinner tell john i shall want the cart and he must be ready to go with me to the station at 215  i ought to be ready to cut the tongue out of my head said mrs baggett as she returned to the house for i might have known it was the way to make him start at once  not in three days but before the end of the week mr whittlestaff returned home bringing with him a darkfeatured tall girl clothed of course in deepest mourning from head to foot to mrs baggett she was an object of intense interest because although she had by no means assented to her masters proposal made on behalf of the young lady and did tell herself again and again during mr whittlestaffs absence that she was quite sure that mary lawrie was a baggage yet in her heart she knew it to be impossible that she could go on living in the house without loving one whom her master loved with regard to most of those concerned in the household she had her own way unless she would favour the groom and the gardener and the boy and the girls who served below her mr whittlestaff would hardly be contented with those subordinates he was the easiest master under whom a servant could live but his favour had to be won through mrs baggetts smiles during the last two years however there had been enough of discussion about mary lawrie to convince mrs baggett that in regard to this interloper as mrs baggett had once called her mr whittlestaff intended to have his own way such being the case mrs baggett was most anxious to know whether the young lady was such as she could love  strangely enough when the young lady had come mrs baggett for twelve months could not quite make up her mind the young lady was very different from what she had expected of interference in the house there was almost literally none mary had evidently heard much of mrs baggetts virtuesand infirmitiesand seemed to understand that she also had in many things to place herself under mrs baggetts orders lord love you miss mary she was heard to say as if we did not all understand that you was to be missus of everything at crokers hallfor such was the name of mr whittlestaffs house but those who heard it knew that the words were spoken in supreme good humour and judged from that that mrs baggetts heart had been won but mrs baggett still had her fears and was not yet resolved but that it might be her duty to turn against mary lawrie with all the violence in her power for the first month or two after the young ladys arrival she had almost made up her mind that mary lawrie would never consent to become mrs whittlestaff an old gentleman will seldom fall in love without some encouragement or at any rate will not tell his love mary lawrie was as cold to him as though he had been seventyfive instead of fifty and she was also as dutifulby which she showed mrs baggett more strongly even than by her coldness that any idea of marriage was on her part out of the question  this strange to say mrs baggett resented for though she certainly felt as would do any ordinary mrs baggett in her position that a wife would be altogether detrimental to her interest in life yet she could not endure to think that a little stuckup minx taken in from charity should run counter to any of her masters wishes on one or two occasions she had spoken to mr whittlestaff respecting the young lady and had been cruelly snubbed this certainly did not create good humour on her part and she began to fancy herself angry in that the young lady was so ceremonious with her master but as months ran by she felt that mary was thawing and that mr whittlestaff was becoming more affectionate of course there were periods in which her mind veered round but at the end of the year mrs baggett certainly did wish that the young lady should marry her old master i can go down to portsmouth she said to the baker who was a most respectable old man and was nearer to mrs baggetts confidence than any one else except her master and weary out the rest on em there when she spoke of wearying out the rest on em her friend perfectly understood that she alluded to what years she might still have to live and to the abject misery of her latter days which would be the consequence of her resigning her present mode of life mrs baggett was supposed to have been born at portsmouth and therefore to allude to that one place which she knew in the world over and beyond the residences in which her master and her masters family had resided  before i go on to describe the characters of mr whittlestaff and miss lawrie i must devote a few words to the early life of mrs baggett dorothy tedcaster had been born in the house of admiral whittlestaff the officer in command at the portsmouth dockyard there her father or her mother had family connections to visit whom dorothy when a young woman had returned from the then abode of her loving mistress mrs whittlestaff with mrs whittlestaff she had lived absolutely from the hour of her birth and of mrs whittlestaff her mind was so full that she did conceive her to be superior if not absolutely in rank at any rate in all the graces and favours of life to her majesty and all the royal family dorothy in an evil hour went back to portsmouth and there encountered that worst of military heroes sergeant baggett with many lamentations and confessions as to her own weakness she wrote to her mistress acknowledging that she did intend to marry b mrs whittlestaff could do nothing to prevent it and dorothy did marry b of the misery and illusage of the dirt and poverty which poor dorothy baggett endured during that year it needs not here to tell that something had passed between her and her old mistress when she returned to her must i suppose have been necessary but of her married life in subsequent years mrs baggett never spoke at all even the baker only knew dimly that there had been a sergeant baggett in existence years had passed since that bad quarter of an hour in her life before mrs baggett had been made over to her present master and he though he probably knew something of the abominable sergeant never found it necessary to mention his name for this mrs baggett was duly thankful and would declare among all persons the baker included that for a gentleman to be a gentleman no gentleman was such a gentleman as her master  it was now fiveandtwenty years since the admiral had died and fifteen since his widow had followed him during the latter period mrs baggett had lived at crokers hall with mr whittlestaff and within that period something had leaked out as to the sergeant how it had come to pass that mr whittlestaffs establishment had been mounted with less of the paraphernalia of wealth than that of his parents shall be told in the next chapter but it was the case that mrs baggett in her very heart of hearts was deeply grieved at what she considered to be the poverty of her master youre a stupid old fool mrs baggett her master would say when in some private moments her regrets would be expressed havent you got enough to eat and a bed to lie on and an old stocking full of money somewhere what more do you want  a stocking full of money she would say wiping her eyes there aint no such thing and as for eating of course i eats as much as i wants i eats more than i wants if you come to that  then youre very greedy  but to think that you shouldnt have a man in a black coat to pour out a glass of wine for you sir  i never drink wine mrs baggett  well whisky i suppose a fellow like that wouldnt be above pouring out a glass of whisky for a gentlemanthough theres no knowing now what those fellows wont turn up their noses at but its a comedown in the world mr whittlestaff  if you think ive come down in the world youd better keep it to yourself and not tell me i dont think that ive come down  you bear up against it finely like a man sir but for a poor woman like me i do feel it such was mrs baggett and the record of her life but this little conversation took place before the coming of mary lawrie     chapter ii  mr whittlestaff   mr whittlestaff had not been a fortunate man as fortune is generally counted in the world he had not succeeded in what he had attempted he had indeed felt but little his want of success in regard to money but he had encountered failure in one or two other matters which had touched him nearly in some things his life had been successful but these were matters in which the world does not write down a mans good luck as being generally conducive to his happiness he had never had a headache rarely a cold and not a touch of the gout one little finger had become crooked and he was recommended to drink whisky which he did willinglybecause it was cheap he was now fifty and as fit bodily and mentally for hard work as ever he had been and he had a thousand ayear to spend and spent it without ever feeling the necessity of saving a shilling and then he hated no one and those who came in contact with him always liked him he trod on nobodys corns and was generally speaking the most popular man in the parish these traits are not generally reckoned as marks of good fortune but they do tend to increase the amount of happiness which a man enjoys in this world to tell of his misfortunes a somewhat longer chronicle of his life would be necessary but the circumstances need only be indicated here he had been opposed in everything to his fathers views his father finding him to be a clever lad had at first designed him for the bar but he before he had left oxford utterly repudiated all legal pursuits what the devil do you wish to be said his father who at that time was supposed to be able to leave his son £2000 ayear the son replied that he would work for a fellowship and devote himself to literature the old admiral sent literature to all the infernal gods and told his son that he was a fool but the lad did not succeed in getting his fellowship and neither father nor mother ever knew the amount of suffering which he endured thereby he became plaintive and wrote poetry and spent his pocketmoney in publishing it which again caused him sorrow not for the loss of his money but by the obscurity of his poetry he had to confess to himself that god had not conferred upon him the gift of writing poetry and having acknowledged so much he never again put two lines together of all this he said nothing but the sense of failure made him sad at heart and his father when he was in those straits only laughed at him not at all believing the assurances of his sons misery which from time to time were given to him by his wife  then the old admiral declared that as his son would do nothing for himself he must work for his son and he took in his old age to going into the city and speculating in shares then the admiral died the shares came to nothing and calls were made and when mrs whittlestaff followed her husband her son looking about him bought crokers hall reduced his establishment and put down the manservant whose departed glory was to mrs baggett a matter of such deep regret  but before this time mr whittlestaff had encountered the greatest sorrow of his life even the lost fellowship even the rejected poetry had not caused him such misery as this he had loved a young lady and had been acceptedand then the young lady had jilted him at this time of his life he was about thirty and as to the outside world he was absolutely dumfounded by the catastrophe up to this period he had been a sportsman in a moderate degree fishing a good deal shooting a little and devoted to hunting to the extent of a single horse but when the blow came he never fished or shot or hunted again i think that the young lady would hardly have treated him so badly had she known what the effect would be her name was catherine bailey and she married one compas who as years went on made a considerable reputation as an old bailey barrister his friends feared at the time that mr whittlestaff would do some injury either to himself or mr compas but no one dared to speak to him on the subject his mother indeed did dareor half dared but he so answered his mother that he stopped her before the speech was out of her mouth dont say a word mother i cannot bear it and he stalked out of the house and was not seen for many hours  there had then in the bitter agony of his spirit come upon him an idea of blood he himself must goor the man then he remembered that she was the mans wife and that it behoved him to spare the man for her sake then when he came to think in earnest of selfdestruction he told himself that it was a cowards refuge he took to his classics for consolation and read the philosophy of cicero and the history of livy and the war chronicles of cæsar they did him goodin the same way that the making of many shoes would have done him good had he been a shoemaker in catching fishes and riding after foxes he could not give his mind to the occupation so as to abstract his thoughts but ciceros de natura deorum was more effectual gradually he returned to a gentle cheerfulness of life but he never burst out again into the violent exercise of shooting a pheasant after that his mother died and again he was called upon to endure a lasting sorrow but on this occasion the sorrow was of that kind which is softened by having been expected he rarely spoke of his motherhad never up to this period at which our tale finds him mentioned his mothers name to any of those about him mrs baggett would speak of her saying much in the praise of her old mistress mr whittlestaff would smile and seem pleased and so the subject would pass away there was something too reverend to him in his idea of his mother to admit of his discussing her character with the servant but he was well pleased to hear her thus described of the other woman of catherine bailey of her who had falsely given herself up to so poor a creature as compas after having received the poetry of his vows he could endure no mention whatever and though mrs baggett knew probably well the whole story no attempt at naming the name was ever made  such had been the successes and the failures of mr whittlestaffs life when mary lawrie was added as one to his household the same idea had occurred to him as to mrs baggett he was not a young man because he was fifty but he was not quite an old man because he was only fifty he had seen mary lawrie often enough and had become sufficiently well acquainted with her to feel sure that if he could win her she would be a loving companion for the remainder of his life he had turned it all over in his mind and had been now eager about it and now bashful on more than one occasion he had declared to himself that he would be whipped if he would have anything to do with her should he subject himself again to some such agony of despair as he had suffered in the matter of catherine bailey it might not be an agony such as that but to him to ask and to be denied would be a terrible pain and as the girl did receive from his hands all that she hadher bread and meat her bed her very clotheswould it not be better for her that he should stand to her in the place of a father than a lover she might come to accept it all and not think much of it if he would take before himself the guise of an old man but were he to appear before her as a suitor for her hand would she refuse him looking forward he could perceive that there was room for infinite grief if he should make the attempt and then things should not go well with him  but the more he saw of her he was sure also that there was room for infinite joy he compared her in his mind to catherine bailey and could not but feel that in his youth he had been blind and fatuous catherine had been a fairhaired girl and had now blossomed out into the anxious mother of ten fairhaired children the anxiety had no doubt come from the evil courses of her husband had she been contented to be mrs whittlestaff there might have been no such look of care and there might perhaps have been less than ten children but she would still have been fairhaired blowsy and fat mr whittlestaff had with infinite trouble found an opportunity of seeing her and her flock unseen by them and a portion of his agony had subsided but still there was the fact that she had promised to be his and had become a thing sacred in his sight and had then given herself up to the arms of mr compas but now if mary lawrie would but accept him how blessed might be the evening of his life  he had confessed to himself often enough how sad and dreary he was in his desolate life he had told himself that it must be so for the remainder of all time to him when catherine bailey had declared her purpose to him of marrying the successful young lawyer he had at once made up his mind that his doom was fixed and had not regarded his solitude as any deep aggravation of his sorrow but he had come by degrees to find that a man should not give up his life because of a fickle girl and especially when he found her to be the mother of ten flaxen haired infants he had too as he declared to himself waited long enough  but mary lawrie was very different from catherine bailey the catherine he had known had been bright and plump and joyous with a quick goodnatured wit and a rippling laughter which by its silvery sound had robbed him of his heart there was no plumpness and no silversounding laughter with mary she shall be described in the next chapter let it suffice to say here that she was somewhat staid in her demeanour and not at all given to putting herself forward in conversation but every hour that he passed in her company he became more and more sure that if any wife could now make him happy this was the woman who could do so  but of her manner to himself he doubted much she was gratitude itself for what he was prepared to do for her but with her gratitude was mingled respect and almost veneration she treated him at first almost as a servantat any rate with none of the familiarity of a friend and hardly with the reserve of a grownup child gradually in obedience to his evident wishes she did drop her reserve and allowed herself to converse with him but it was always as a young person might with all modesty converse with her superior he struggled hard to overcome her reticence and did at last succeed but still there was that respect verging almost into veneration which seemed to crush him when he thought that he might begin to play the lover  he had got a pony carriage for her which he insisted that she should drive herself but i never have driven she had said taking her place and doubtfully assuming the reins while he sat beside her she had at this time been six months at crokers hall  there must be a beginning for everything and you shall begin to drive now then he took great trouble with her teaching her how to hold the reins and how to use the whip till at last something of familiarity was engendered and he went out with her day after day showing her all those pretty haunts among the downs which are to be found in the neighbourhood of alresford  this did well for a time and mr whittlestaff thought that he was progressing but he had not as yet quite made up his mind that the attempt should be made at all if he can be imagined to have talked to a friend as he talked to himself that friend would have averred that he spoke more frequently against marriageor rather against the young ladys marriagethan in favour of it after all it will never do he would have said to this friend i am an old man and an old man shouldnt ask a young girl to sacrifice herself mrs baggett looks on it only as a question of butchers and bakers there are no doubt circumstances in which butchers and bakers do come uppermost but here the butchers and bakers are provided i wouldnt have her marry me for that sake love i fear is out of the question but for gratitude i would not have her do it it was thus that he would commonly have been found speaking to his friend there were moments in which he roused himself to better hopeswhen he had drank his glass of whisky and water and was somewhat elate with the consequences ill do it he would then have said to his friend only i cannot exactly say when and so it went on till at last he became afraid to speak out and tell her what he wanted  mr whittlestaff was a tall thin man not quite six feet with a face which a judge of male beauty would hardly call handsome but which all would say was impressive and interesting we seldom think how much is told to us of the owners character by the first or second glance of a man or womans face is he a fool or is he clever is he reticent or outspoken is he passionate or longsufferingnay is he honest or the reverse is he malicious or of a kindly nature of all these things we form a sudden judgment without any thought and in most of our sudden judgments we are roughly correct it is so or seems to us to be so as a matter of coursethat the man is a fool or reticent or malicious and without giving a thought to our own phrenological capacity we pass on with the conviction no one ever considered that mr whittlestaff was a fool or malicious but people did think that he was reticent and honest the inner traits of his character were very difficult to be read even mrs baggett had hardly read them all correctly he was shamefaced to such a degree that mrs baggett could not bring herself to understand it and there was present to him a manner of speech which practice had now made habitual but which he had originally adopted with the object of hiding his shamefacedness under the veil of a dashing manner he would speak as though he were quite free with his thoughts when at the moment he feared that thoughts should be read of which he certainly had no cause to be ashamed his fellowship his poetry and his early love were all to his thinking causes of disgrace which required to be buried deep within his own memory but the true humility with which he regarded them betokened a character for which he need not have blushed but that he thought of those matters at allthat he thought of himself at allwas a matter to be buried deep within his own bosom  through his short darkbrown hair the grey locks were beginning to show themselvessigns indeed of age but signs which were very becoming to him at fifty he was a much betterlooking man than he had been at thirtyso that that foolish fickle girl catherine bailey would not have rejected him for the cruelly sensuous face of mr compas had the handsome irongrey tinge been then given to his countenance he as he looked at the glass told himself that a greyhaired old fool such as he was had no right to burden the life of a young girl simply because he found her in bread and meat that he should think himself goodlooking was to his nature impossible his eyes were rather small but very bright the eyebrows black and almost bushy his nose was wellformed and somewhat long but not so as to give that peculiar idea of length to his face which comes from great nasal prolongation his upper lip was short and his mouth large and manly the strength of his character was better shown by his mouth than by any other feature he wore hardly any beard as beards go nowunless indeed a whisker can be called a beard which came down closely shorn about half an inch below his ear a very common sort of individual he said of himself as he looked in the glass when mary lawrie had been already twelve months in the house but then a man ought to be common a man who is uncommon is either a dandy or a buffoon  his clothes were all made after one pattern and of one colour he had indeed his morning clothes and his evening clothes those for the morning were very nearly black whereas for the evening they were entirely so he walked about the neighbourhood in a soft hat such as clergymen now affect and on sundays he went to church with the old wellestablished respectable chimneypot on sundays too he carried an umbrella whereas on weekdays he always had a large stick and it was observed that neither the umbrella nor the stick was adapted to the state of the weather  such was mr whittlestaff of crokers hall a small residence which stood halfway up on the way to the downs about a mile from alresford he had come into the neighbourhood having bought a small freehold property without the knowledge of any of the inhabitants it was just as though he had come out of the sun said the old baker forgetting that most men or their ancestors must have come to their present residences after a similar fashion and he had brought mrs baggett with him who had confided to the baker that she had felt herself that strange on her first arrival that she didnt know whether she was standing on her head or her heels  mrs baggett had since become very gracious with various of the neighbours she had the paying of mr whittlestaffs bills and the general disposal of his custom from thence arose her popularity but he during the last fifteen years had crept silently into the society of the place at first no one had known anything about him and the neighbourhood had been shy but by degrees the parsons and then the squires had taken him by the hand so that the social endowments of the place were more than mr whittlestaff even desired     chapter iii  mary lawrie   there is nothing more difficult in the writing of a story than to describe adequately the person of a hero or a heroine so as to place before the mind of the reader any clear picture of him or her who is described a courtship is harder stillso hard that we may say generally that it is impossible southeys lodore is supposed to have been effective but let any one with the words in his memory stand beside the waterfall and say whether it is such as the words have painted it it rushes and it foams as described by the poet much more violently than does the real water and so does everything described unless in the hands of a wonderful master but i have clear images on my brain of the characters of the persons introduced i know with fair accuracy what was intended by the character as given of amelia booth of clarissa of di vernon and of maggie tulliver but as their persons have not been drawn with the pencil for me by the artists who themselves created them i have no conception how they looked of thackerays beatrix i have a vivid idea because she was drawn for him by an artist under his own eye i have now to describe mary lawrie but have no artist who will take the trouble to learn my thoughts and to reproduce them consequently i fear that no true idea of the young lady can be conveyed to the reader and that i must leave him to entertain such a notion of her carriage and demeanour as must come to him at the end from the reading of the whole book  but the attempt must be made if only for fashion sake so that no adventitious help may be wanting to him or more probably to her who may care to form for herself a personification of mary lawrie she was a tall thin staid girl who never put herself forward in any of those walks of life in which such a young lady as she is called upon to show herself she was silent and reserved and sometimes startled even when appealed to in a household so quiet as that of mr whittlestaff those who had seen her former life had known that she had lived under the dominion of her stepmother and had so accounted for her manner and then added to this was the sense of entire dependence on a stranger which no doubt helped to quell her spirit but mr whittlestaff had eyes with which to see and ears with which to hear and was not to be taken in by the outward appearance of the young lady he had perceived that under that quiet guise and timid startled look there existed a power of fighting a battle for herself or for a friend if an occasion should arise which should appear to herself to be sufficient he had known her as one of her fathers household and of her stepmothers and had seen probably some little instance of selfassertion such as had not yet made itself apparent to mrs baggett  a man who had met her once and for a few minutes only would certainly not declare her to be beautiful she too like mr whittlestaff was always contented to pass unobserved but the chance man had he seen her for long would surely remark that miss lawrie was an attractive girl and had he heard her talk freely on any matter of interest would have called her very attractive she would blaze up into sudden eloquence and then would become shamestricken and abashed and dumfounded so as to show that she had for a moment forgotten her audience and then the audiencethe chance manwould surely set his wits to work and try to reproduce in her a renewal of that intimacy to which she had seemed to yield herself for the moment  but yet i am not describing her after the accepted fashion i should produce a catalogue of features and tell how every one of them was formed her hair was dark and worn very plain but with that graceful care which shows that the owner has not slurred over her toilet with hurried negligence of complexion it can hardly be said that she had any so little was the appearance of her countenance diversified by a change of hue if i am bound to declare her colour i must in truth say that she was brown there was none even of that flying hue which is supposed to be intended when a woman is called a brunette when she first came to crokers hall health produced no variation nor did any such come quickly though before she had lived there a year and a half now and again a slight tinge of dark ruby would show itself on her cheek and then vanish almost quicker than it had come mr whittlestaff when he would see this would be almost beside himself in admiration  her eyes were deep blue so deep that the casual observer would not at first recognise their colour but when you had perceived that they were blue and had brought the fact home to your knowledge their blueness remained with you as a thing fixed for ever and you would feel if you yourself were thoughtful and contemplative and much given to study a ladys eyes that such as they were every lady would possess the like if only it were given to her to choose  her nose was slight and fine and perhaps lent to her face of all her features its most special grace her lips alas were too thin for true female beauty and lacked that round and luscious fulness which seems in many a girls face to declare the purpose for which they were made through them her white teeth would occasionally be seen and then her face was at its best as for instance when she was smiling but that was seldom and at other moments it seemed as though she were too careful to keep her mouth closed  but if her mouth was defective the symmetry of her chin carrying with it the oval of her cheek and jaws was perfect how many a face otherwise lovely to look upon is made mean and comparatively base either by the lengthening or the shortening of the chin that absolute perfection which miss lawrie owned we do not perhaps often meet but when found i confess that nothing to me gives so sure an evidence of true blood and goodbreeding  such is the catalogue of mary lawries features drawn out with care by one who has delighted for many hours to sit and look at them all the power of language which the writer possesses has been used in thus reproducing them but now when this portion of his work is done he feels sure that no reader of his novel will have the slightest idea of what mary lawrie was like  an incident must now be told of her early life of which she never spoke to man woman or child her stepmother had known the circumstance but had rarely spoken of it there had come across her path in norwich a young man who had stirred her heart and had won her affections but the young man had passed on and there as far as the present and the past were concerned had been an end of it the young man had been no favourite with her stepmother and her father who was almost on his deathbed had heard what was going on almost without a remark he had been told that the man was penniless and as his daughter had been to him the dearest thing upon earth he had been glad to save himself the pain of expressing disapproval john gordon had however been a gentleman and was fit in all things to be the husband of such a girl as mary lawrieexcept that he was penniless and she also had possessed nothing he had passed on his way without speaking and had goneeven mary did not know whither she had accepted her fate and had never allowed the name of john gordon to pass her lips  the days passed very quickly at crokers hall but not so quickly but that mary knew well what was going on in mr whittlestaffs mind how is it that a girl understands to a certainty the state of a mans heart in regard to heror rather not his heart but his purpose a girl may believe that a man loves her and may be deceived but she will not be deceived as to whether he wishes to marry her gradually came the conviction on miss lawries mind of mr whittlestaffs purpose and as it did so came the conviction also that she could not do it of this he saw nothing but he was instigated by it to be more eagerand was at the same time additionally abashed by something in her manner which made him feel that the task before him was not an easy one  mrs baggett who knew well all the symptoms as her master displayed them became angry with mary lawrie who was mary lawrie that she should take upon herself to deny mr whittlestaff anything no doubt it would as she told herself be better for mrs baggett in many respects that her master should remain unmarried she assured herself that if a mistress were put over her head she must retire to portsmouthwhich of all places for her had the dreariest memories she could remain where she was very well while mary lawrie remained also where she was but it provoked her to think that the offer should be made to the girl and should be refused what on earth it is they sees in em is what i never can understand she aint prettynot to sayand she looks as though butter wouldnt melt in her mouth but shes got it inside her and some of them days itll come out then mrs baggett determined that she would have a few words on the subject with mary lawrie  mary had now been a year and four months at crokers hall and had under pressure from mr whittlestaff assumed something of the manner rather than of the airs of a mistress to mrs baggett this the old woman did not at all resent because the reality of power was still in her hands but she could not endure that the idolatry of love should always be present in her masters face if the young woman would only become mrs whittlestaff then the idolatry would pass away at any rate her master would not continue to make an ass of himself as mrs baggett phrased it  dont you think miss as that mr whittlestaff is looking very peeky  is he mrs baggett  deed and he is to my thinking and its all along of you hes got a fancy into his mindand why shouldnt he have his fancy  i dont know im sure but mary did know she did know what the fancy was and why mr whittlestaff shouldnt have it  i tell you fairly miss there is nothing i hate so much as vagaries in young women  i hope there are no vagaries to be hated in me mrs baggett  well im not quite so sure you do go as straightforward as most on em but i aint quite sure but that there are a few twists and twirls what do you suppose he wants to be at  how am i to say then she bethought herself that were she to tell the truth she could say very well  do you mean as you dont know said the old woman  am i bound to tell you if i do know  if you wish to do the best for him you are whats the good of beating about the bush why dont you have him  mary did not quite know whether it behoved her to be angry with the old servant and if so how she was to show her anger you shouldnt talk such nonsense mrs baggett  thats all very well it is all nonsense but nonsense has to be talked sometimes heres a gentleman as you owe everything to if he wanted your head from your shoulders you shouldnt make any scruple what are you that you shouldnt let a gentleman like him have his own way asking your pardon but i dont mean it any way out of disrespect of course it would be all agin me an old woman doesnt want to have a young mistress over her head and if shes my sperrit she wouldnt bear it i wont any way  then why do you ask me to do this thing  because a gentleman like him should have his own way and an old hag like me shouldnt stand for anything no more shouldnt a young woman like you who has had so much done for her now miss mary you see ive told you my mind freely  but he has never asked me  you just sit close up to him and hell ask you free enough i shouldnt speak as i have done if there had been a morsel of doubt about it do you doubt it yourself miss to this miss lawrie did not find it necessary to return any answer  when mrs baggett had gone and mary was left to herself she could not but think over what the woman had said to her in the first place was she not bound to be angry with the woman and to express her anger was it not impertinent nay almost indecent that the woman should come to her and interrogate her on such a subject the inmost most secret feelings of her heart had been ruthlessly inquired into and probed by a menial servant who had asked questions of her and made suggestions to her as though her part in the affair had been of no consequence what are you that you shouldnt let a gentleman like him have his own way why was it not so much to her as to mr whittlestaff was it not her all the consummation or destruction of every hope the making or unmaking of her joy or of her happiness could it be right that she should marry any man merely because the man wanted her were there to be no questions raised as to her own life her own contentment her own ideas of what was proper it was true that this woman knew nothing of john gordon but she must have known that there might be a john gordonwhom she mary lawrie was required to set on one side merely because mr whittlestaff wanted her mrs baggett had been grossly impertinent in daring to talk to her of mr whittlestaffs wants  but then as she walked slowly round the garden she found herself bound to inquire of herself whether what the woman said had not been true did she not eat his bread did she not wear his clothes were not the very boots on her feet his property and she was there in his house without the slightest tie of blood or family connection he had taken her from sheer charity and had saved her from the terrible dependency of becoming a friendless governess looking out to the life which she had avoided it seemed to her to be full of abject misery and he had brought her to his own house and had made her the mistress of everything she knew that she had been undemonstrative in her manner and that such was her nature but her heart welled over with gratitude as she thought of the sweetness of the life which he had prepared for her was not the question true what am i that i should stand in the way and prevent such a man as that from having what he wants  and then she told herself that he personally was full of good gifts how different might it have been with her had some elderly men wanted her such as she had seen about in the world how much was there in this man that she knew that she could learn to love and he was one of whom she need in no wise be ashamed he was a gentleman pleasant to look at sweet in manner comely and clean in appearance would not the world say of her how lucky she had been should it come to pass that she should become mrs whittlestaff then there were thoughts of john gordon and she told herself that it was a mere dream john gordon had gone and she knew not where he was and john gordon had never spoken a word to her of his love after an hours deliberation she thought that she would marry mr whittlestaff if he asked her though she could not bring herself to say that she would sit close up to him in order that he might do so     chapter iv  mary lawrie accepts mr whittlestaff   by the end of the week mary lawrie had changed her mind she had thought it over and had endeavoured to persuade herself that mr whittlestaff did not care about it very much indeed there were moments during the week in which she flattered herself that if she would abstain from sitting close up to him he would say nothing about it but she resolved altogether that she would not display her anger to mrs baggett mrs baggett after all had done it for the best and there was something in mrs baggetts mode of argument on the subject which was not altogether unflattering to mary it was not as though mrs baggett had told her that mr whittlestaff could make himself quite happy with mrs baggett herself if mary lawrie would be good enough to go away the suggestion had been made quite in the other way and mrs baggett was prepared altogether to obliterate herself mary did feel that mr whittlestaff ought to be made a god as long as another woman was willing to share in the worship with such absolute selfsacrifice  at last the moment came and the question was asked without a minute being allowed for consideration it was in this wise the two were sitting together after dinner on the lawn and mrs baggett had brought them their coffee it was her wont to wait upon them with this delicacy though she did not appear either at breakfast or at dinner except on remarkable occasions she now had some little word to say meant to be conciliatory and comforting and remarked that surely miss mary meant to get a colour in her cheeks at last  dont be foolish mrs baggett said mary but mrs baggetts back was turned and she did not care to reply  it is true mary said mr whittlestaff putting his hand on her shoulder as he turned round to look in her face  mrs lawrie used to tell me that i always blushed black and i think that she was about right  i do not know what colour you blush said mr whittlestaff  i daresay not  but when it does come i am conscious of the sweetest colour that ever came upon a ladys cheek and i tell myself that another grace has been added to the face which of all faces in the world is to my eyes the most beautiful what was she to say in answer to a compliment so highflown as this to one from whose mouth compliments were so uncommon she knew that he could not have so spoken without a purpose declared at any rate to his own heart he still held her by the arm but did not once progress with his speech while she sat silent by his side and blushing with that dark ruby streak across her cheeks which her stepmother had intended to vilify when she said that she had blushed black mary he continued after a pause can you endure the thought of becoming my wife now she drew her arm away and turned her face and compressed her lips and sat without uttering a word of course i am an old man  it is not that she muttered  but i think that i can love you as honestly and as firmly as a younger one i think that if you could bring yourself to be my wife you would find that you would not be treated badly  oh no no no she exclaimed  nothing at any rate would be kept from you when i have a thought or a feeling a hope or a fear you shall share it as to money  dont do that there should be no talk of money from you to me  perhaps not it would be best that i should be left to do as i may think most fitting for you i have one incident in my life which i would wish to tell you i loved a girlmany years sinceand she illused me i continued to love her long but that image has passed from my mind he was thinking as he said this of mrs compas and her large family it will not be necessary that i should refer to this again because the subject is very painful but it was essential that i should tell you and now mary how shall it be he added after a pause  she sat listening to all that he had to say to her but without speaking a word he too had had his john gordon but in his case the girl he had loved had treated him badly she mary had received no bad treatment there had been love between them ample love love enough to break their hearts at least she had found it so but there had been no outspoken speech of love because of that the wound made now that it had been in some sort healed had not with her been so cruel as with mr whittlestaff john gordon had come to her on the eve of his going and had told her that he was about to start for some distant land there had been loud words between him and her stepmother and mrs lawrie had told him that he was a pauper and was doing no good about the house and mary had heard the words spoken she asked him whither he was going but he did not reply your mother is right i am at any rate doing no good here he had said but had not answered her question further then mary had given him her hand and had whispered goodbye if i return he added the first place i will come to shall be norwich then without further farewell ceremony he had gone from that day to this she had had his form before her eyes but now if she accepted mr whittlestaff it must be banished no one at any rate knew of her wound she must tell himshould she be moved at last to accept him it might be that he would reject her after such telling if so it would be well but in that case what would be her future would it not be necessary that she should return to that idea of a governess which had been so distasteful to her mary can you say that it shall be so he asked quietly after having remained silent for some ten minutes  could it be that all her fate must be resolved in so short a time since first the notion that mr whittlestaff had asked her to be his wife had come upon her she had thought of it day and night but as is so usual with the world at large she had thought altogether of the past and not of the future the past was a valley of dreams which could easily be surveyed whereas the future was a high mountain which it would require much labour to climb when we think that we will make our calculations as to the future it is so easy to revel in our memories instead mary had in truth not thought of her answer though she had said to herself over and over again why it should not be so  have you no answer to give me he said  oh mr whittlestaff you have so startled me this was hardly true he had not startled her but had brought her to the necessity of knowing her own mind  if you wish to think of it you shall take your own time then it was decided that a week should be accorded to her and during that week she passed much of her time in tears and mrs baggett would not leave her alone to give mrs baggett her due it must be acknowledged that she acted as best she knew how for her masters interest without thinking of herself i shall go down to portsmouth im not worth thinking of i aint theres them at portsmouth asll take care of me you dont see why i should go i daresay not but i am older than you and i see what you dont see ive borne with you as a miss because youve not been upsetting but still when ive lived with him for all those years without anything of the kind it has set me hard sometimes as married to him i wouldnt put up with you so i tell you fairly but that dont signify it aint you as signifies or me as signifies its only him you have got to bring yourself to think of that whats the meaning of your duty to your neighbour and doing unto others and all the rest of it you aint got to think just of your own self no more havent i  mary said to herself silently that it was john gordon of whom she had to think she quite recognised the truth of the lesson about selfishness but love to her was more imperious than gratitude  theres them at portsmouth asll take care of me no doubt dont you mind about me i aint going to have a good time at portsmouth but people aint born to have good times of it youre going to have a good time but it aint for that but for what your duty tells you you that havent a bit or a sup but what comes from him and you to stand shillyshallying i cant abide the idea  it was thus that mrs baggett taught her great lessonthe greatest lesson we may say which a man or a woman can learn and though she taught it immoderately fancying as a woman that another woman should sacrifice everything to a man still she taught it with truth she was minded to go to portsmouth although portsmouth to her in the present state of circumstances was little better than a hell upon earth but mary could not quite see mr whittlestaffs claim in the same light the one point on which it did seem to her that she had made up her mind was mr gordons claim which was paramount to everything yes he was gone and might never return it might be that he was dead it might be even that he had taken some other wife and she was conscious that not a word had passed her lips that could be taken as a promise there had not been even a hint of a promise but it seemed to her that this duty of which mrs baggett spoke was due rather to john gordon than to mr whittlestaff  she counted the daysnay she counted the hours till the week had run by and when the precise moment had come at which an answer must be givenfor in such matters mr whittlestaff was very precisejohn gordon was still the hero of her thoughts well dear he said putting his hand upon her arm just as he had done on that former occasion he said no more but there was a world of entreaty in the tone of his voice as he uttered the words  mr whittlestaff  well dear  i do not think i can i do not think i ought you never heard ofmr john gordon  never  he used to come to our house at norwich andandi loved him  what became of him he asked in a strangely altered voice was there to be a mr compas here too to interfere with his happiness  he was poor and he went away when my stepmother did not like him  you had engaged yourself to him  oh no there had been nothing of that kind you will understand that i should not speak to you on such a subject were it not that i am bound to tell you my whole heart but you will never repeat what you now hear  there was no engagement  there was no question of any such thing  and he is gone  yes said mary he has gone  and will not come back again then she looked into his faceoh so wistfully when did it happen  when my father was on his deathbed he had come sooner than that but then it was that he went i think mr whittlestaff that i never ought to marry any one after that and therefore it is that i have told you  you are a good girl mary  i dont know about that i think that i ought to deceive you at least in nothing  you should deceive no one  no mr whittlestaff she answered him ever so meekly but there was running in her mind a feeling that she had not deceived any one and that she was somewhat hardly used by the advice given to her  he has gone altogether he asked again  i do not know where he iswhether he be dead or alive  but if he should come back  she only shook her headmeaning him to understand that she could say nothing of his purposes should he come back he had made her no offer he had said that if he returned he would come first to norwich there had been something of a promise in this but oh so little and she did not dare to tell him that hitherto she had lived upon that little  i do not think that you should remain single for ever on that account how long is it now since mr gordon went  there was something in the tone in which he mentioned mr gordons name which went against the grain with mary she felt that he was spoken of almost as an enemy i think it is three years since he went  three years is a long time has he never written  not to me how should he write there was nothing for him to write about  it has been a fancy  yesa fancy he had made this excuse for her and she had none stronger to make for herself  he certainly did not think the better of her in that she had indulged in such a fancy but in truth his love was sharpened by the opposition which this fancy made it had seemed to him that his possessing her would give a brightness to his life and this brightness was not altogether obscured by the idea that she had ever thought that she had loved another person as a woman she was as lovable as before though perhaps less admirable at any rate he wanted her and now she seemed to be more within his reach than she had been the week has passed by mary and i suppose that now you can give me an answer then she found that she was in his power she had told him her story as though with the understanding that if he would take her with her fancy she was ready to surrender herself am i not to have an answer now  i suppose so  what is it to be  if you wish for me i will be yours  and you will cease to think of mr gordon  i shall think of him but not in a way that you would begrudge me  that will suffice i know that you are honest and i will not ask you to forget him altogether but there had better be no speaking of him it is well that he should be banished from your mind and now dearest dearest love give me your hand she put her hand at once into his and a kiss she just turned herself a little round with her eyes bent upon the ground nay there must be a kiss then he bent over her and just touched her cheek mary you are now all my own yesshe was now all his own and she would do for him the best in her power he had not asked for her love and she certainly had not given it she knew well how impossible it would be that she should give him her love i know you are disturbed he said i wish also for a few minutes to think of it all then he turned away from her and went up the garden walk by himself  she slowly loitering went into the house alone and seated herself by the open window in her bedchamber as she sat there she could see him up the long walk going and returning as he went his hands were folded behind his back and she thought that he appeared older than she had ever remarked him to be before what did it signify she had undertaken her business in life and the duties she thought would be within her power she was sure that she would be true to him as far as truth to his material interests was concerned his comforts in life should be her first care if he trusted her at all he should not become poorer by reason of his confidence and she would be as tender to him as the circumstances would admit she would not begrudge him kisses if he cared for them they were his by all the rights of contract he certainly had the best of the bargain but he should never know how much the best of it he had he had told her that there had better be no speaking of john gordon there certainly should be none on her part she had told him that she must continue to think of him there at any rate she had been honest but he should not see that she thought of him  then she endeavoured to assure herself that this thinking would die out looking round the world her small world how many women there were who had not married the men they had loved first how few perhaps had done so life was not goodnatured enough for smoothness such as that and yet did not they as a rule live well with their husbands what right had she to expect anything better than their fate each poor insipid dame that she saw toddling on with halfadozen children at her heels might have had as good a john gordon of her own as was hers and each of them might have sat on a summer day at an open window looking out with something oh so far from love at the punctual steps of him who was to be her husband  then her thoughts turned would turn could not be kept from turning to john gordon he had been to her the personification of manliness that which he resolved to do he did with an iron will but his manners to all women were soft and to her seemed to have been suffused with special tenderness but he was chary of his wordsas he had even been to her he had been the son of a banker at norwich but just as she had become acquainted with him the bank had broke and he had left oxford to come home and find himself a ruined man but he had never said a word to her of the family misfortune he had been six feet high with dark hair cut very short somewhat full of sport of the roughest kind which however he had abandoned instantly things have so turned out he had once said to mary that i must earn something to eat instead of riding after foxes she could not boast that he was handsome what does it signify she had once said to her stepmother who had declared him to be stiff upsetting and ugly a man is not like a poor girl who has nothing but the softness of her skin to depend upon then mrs lawrie had declared to him that he did no good coming about the houseand he went away  why had he not spoken to her he had said that one word promising that if he returned he would come to norwich she had lived three years since that and he had not come back and her house had been broken up and she though she would have been prepared to wait for another three yearsthough she would have waited till she had grown grey with waitingshe had now fallen into the hands of one who had a right to demand from her that she should obey him and it is not that i hate him she said to herself i do love him he is all good but i am glad that he has not bade me not to think of john gordon     chapter v  i suppose it was a dream   it seemed to her as she sat there at the window that she ought to tell mrs baggett what had occurred there had been that between them which as she thought made it incumbent on her to let mrs baggett know the result of her interview with mr whittlestaff so she went downstairs and found that invaluable old domestic interfering materially with the comfort of the two younger maidens she was determined to let them know what was what as she expressed it  you oughtnt to be angry with me because ive done nothing said jane the housemaid sobbing  thats just about it said mrs baggett and why havent you done nothing do you suppose you come here to do nothing was it doing nothing when eliza tied down them strawberries without putting in eer a drop of brandy it drives me mortial mad to think what you young folks are coming to  i aint agoing anywhere mrs baggett because of them strawberries being tied down which if you untie them as i always intended will have the sperrits put on them as well now as ever and as for your going mad mrs baggett i hope it wont be along of me  drat your imperence  i aint imperence at all heres miss lawrie and she shall say whether im imperence  mrs baggett i want to speak to you if youll come into the other room said mary  you are imperent both of you i cant say a word but im taken up that short that theyve been and tied all the jam down so that itll all go that mouldy that nobody can touch it and then when i says a word they turns upon me then mrs baggett walked out of the kitchen into her own small parlour which opened upon the passage just opposite the kitchen door they was agoing to be opened this very afternoon said eliza firing a parting shot after the departing enemy  mrs baggett ive got to tell you mary began  well  he came to me for an answer as he said he would  well  and i told him it should be as he would have it  of course you would i knew that  you told me that it was your duty and mine to give him whatever he wanted  i didnt say nothing of the kind miss  oh mrs baggett  i didnt i said if he wanted your head you was to let him take it but if he wanted mine you wasnt to give it to him  he asked me to be his wife and i said i would  then i may as well pack up and be off for portsmouth  no not so i have obeyed you and i think that in these matters you should obey him too  i daresay but at my age i aint so well able to obey i daresay as them girls knew all about it or they wouldnt have turned round upon me like that its just like the likes of them when is it to be miss lawriebecause i wont stop in the house after you be the missus of it thats flat if you were to talk till youre deaf and dumb i wouldnt do it oh it dont matter whats to become of me i know that  but it will matter very much  not a haporth  you ask him mrs baggett  hes got his plaything thats all he cares about ive been with him and his family almost from a baby and have grown old aserving him and it dont matter to him whether i goes into the hedges and ditches or where i goes they say that service is no heritance and they says true im to go to but dont mind me he wont and why should you do you think youll ever do half as much for him as ive done hes got his troubles before him nowthats the worst of it  this was very bad mrs baggett had been loud in laying down for her the line of duty which she should follow and she to the best of her ability had done as mrs baggett had told her it was the case that mrs baggett had prevailed with her and now the woman turned against her was it true that he had his troubles before him because of her acceptance of his offer if so might it not yet be mended was it too late of what comfort could she be to him seeing that she had been unable to give him her heart why should she interfere with the womans happiness in a spirit of true humility she endeavoured to think how she might endeavour to do the best of one thing she was quite quite surethat all the longings of her very soul were fixed upon that other man he was awayperhaps he had forgotten her perhaps he was married not a word had been spoken to her on which she could found a fair hope but she had never been so certain of her loveof her love as a true undoubted and undoubtable factof an unchangeable factas she was now and why should this poor old woman with her many years of service be disturbed she went again up to her bedroom and sitting at her open window and looking out saw him still pacing slowly up and down the long walk as she looked at him he seemed to be older than before his hands were still clasped behind his back there was no look about him as that of a thriving lover care seemed to be on his facenay even present almost visibly on his very shoulders she would go to him and plead for mrs baggett  but in that case what should become of herself she was aware that she could no longer stay in his house as his adopted daughter but she could go forthand starve if there was nothing better for her but as she thought of starvation she stamped with one foot against the other as though to punish herself for her own falsehood he would not let her starve he would get some place for her as a governess and she was not in the least afraid of starvation it would be sweeter for her to work with any kind of hardship around her and to be allowed to think of john gordon with her heart free than to become the comfortable mistress of his house she would not admit the plea of starvation even to herself she wanted to be free of him and she would tell him so and would tell him also of the ruin he was about to bring on his old servant  she watched him as he came back into the house and then she rose from her chair but i shall never see him again she said as she paused before she left the room  but what did that matter her not seeing him again ought to make should make no difference with her it was not that she might see him but that she might think of him with unsullied thoughts that should be her objectthat and the duty that she owed to mrs baggett why was not mrs baggett entitled to as much consideration as was she herselfor even he she turned to the glass and wiped her eyes with the sponge and brushed her hair and then she went across the passage to mr whittlestaffs library  she knocked at the doorwhich she had not been accustomed to doand then at his bidding entered the room oh mary he said laughing is that the way you begin by knocking at the door  i think one knocks when one wants a moment of reprieve  you mean to say that you are bashful in assuming your new privileges then you had better go back to your old habits because you always used to come where i was you must come and go now like my very second self then he came forward from the desk at which he was wont to stand and write and essayed to put his arm round her waist she drew back but still he was not startled it was but a cold kiss i gave you down below you must kiss me now you as a wife kisses her husband  never  what now he was startled  mr whittlestaff praypray do not be angry with me  what is the meaning of it  then she bethought herselfhow she might best explain the meaning it was hard upon her this having to explain it and she told herself very foolishly that it would be better for her to begin with the story of mrs baggett she could more easily speak of mrs baggett than of john gordon but it must be remembered on her behalf that she had but a second to think how she might best begin her story i have spoken to mrs baggett about your wishes  well  she has lived with you and your family from before you were born  she is an old fool who is going to hurt her and if it did hurt her are you and i to be put out of our course because of her she can remain here as long as she obeys you as her mistress  she says that after so many years she cannot do that  she shall leave the house this very night if she disturbs your happiness and mine what is an old woman like that to tell her master when he may and when he may not marry i did not think you had been so soft  she could not explain it all to himall that she thought upon the subject she could not say that the interference of any domestic between such a one as john gordon and his lovebetween him and her if she were happy enough to be his lovewould be an absurdity too foolish to be considered they that happy two would be following the bent of human nature and would speak no more than a soft word to the old woman if a soft word might avail anything their love their happy love would be a thing too sacred to admit of any question from any servant almost from any parent but why in this matter was not mrs baggetts happiness to be of as much consequence as mr whittlestaffsespecially when her own peace of mind lay in the same direction as mrs baggetts she says that you are only laying up trouble for yourself in this and i think that it is true  then he rose up in his wrath and spoke his mind freely and showed her at once that john gordon had not dwelt much on his mind he had bade her not to speak of him and then he had been contented to look upon him as one whom he would not be compelled to trouble himself with any further i think mary that you are making too little of me and of yourself to talk to me or even to consider in such a matter what a servant says to you as you have given me your affection you should now allow nothing that any one can say to you to make you even think of changing your purpose how grossly must he be mistaken when he could imagine that she had given him her heart had she not expressly told him that her love had been set upon another person to me you are everything i have been thinking as i walked up and down the path there of all that i could do to make you happy and i was so happy myself in feeling that i had your happiness to look after how should i not let the wind blow too coldly on you how should i be watchful to see that nothing should ruffle your spirits what duties what pleasures what society should i provide for you how should i change my habits so as to make my advanced years fit for your younger life and i was teaching myself to hope that i was not yet too old to make this altogether impossible then you come to me and tell me that you must destroy all my dreams dash all my hopes to the groundbecause an old woman has shown her temper and her jealousy  this was trueaccording to the light in which he saw her position had there been nothing between them two but a mutual desire to be married the reason given by her for changing it all would be absurd as he had continued to speak slowly adding on one argument to another with a certain amount of true eloquence she felt that unless she could go back to john gordon she must yield but it was very hard for her to go back to john gordon in the first place she must acknowledge in doing so that she had only put forward mrs baggett as a false plea and then she must insist on her love for a man who had never spoken to her of love it was so hard that she could not do it openly i had thought so little of the value i could be to you  your value to me is infinite i think mary that there has come upon you a certain melancholy which is depressing you your regard to me is worth now more than any other possession or gift that the world can bestow and i had taken pride to myself in saying that it had been given yesher regard she could not contradict him as to that and have you thought of your own position after all that has passed between us you can hardly go on living here as you have done  i know that  then what would become of you if you were to break away from me  i thought you would get a place for me as a governessor a companion to some lady  would that satisfy your ambition i have got a place for youbut it is here as he spoke he laid his hand upon his heart not as a companion to a lady are you required to fulfil your duties here on earth it is a fuller task of work that you must do i trusti trust that it may not be more tedious she looked at him again and he did not now appear so old there was a power of speech about the man and a dignity which made her feel that she could in truth have loved himhad it not been for john gordon unfortunately i am older than youvery much older but to you there may be this advantage that you can listen to what i may say with something of confidence in my knowledge of the world as my wife you will fill a position more honourable and more suitable to your gifts than could belong to you as a governess or a companion you will have much more to do and will be able to go nightly to your rest with a consciousness that you have done more as the mistress of our house than you could have done in that tamer capacity you will have caresand even those will ennoble the world to you and you to the world that other life is a poor shrunken deathrather than life it is a way of passing her days which must fall to the lot of many a female who does not achieve the other and it is well that they to whom it falls should be able to accommodate themselves to it with contentment and selfrespect i think that i may say of myself that even as my wife you will stand higher than you would do as a companion  i am sure of it  not on that account should you accept any man that you cannot love had she not told him that she did not love himeven that she loved another and yet he spoke to her in this way you had better tell mrs baggett to come to me  there is the memory of that other man she murmured very gently  then the scowl came back upon his faceor not a scowl but a look rather of cold displeasure if i understand you rightly the gentleman never addressed you as a lover  never  i see it all mary mrs baggett has been violent and selfish and has made you think thoughts which should not have been put in your head to disturb you you have dreamed a dream in your early lifeas girls do dream i supposeand it has now to be forgotten is it not so  i suppose it was a dream  he has passed away and he has left you to become the happiness of my life send mrs baggett to me and i will speak to her then he came up to herfor they had been standing about a yard apartand pressed his lips to hers how was it possible that she should prevent him  she turned round and slowly left the room feeling as she did so that she was again engaged to him for ever and ever she hated herself because she had been so fickle but how could she have done otherwise she asked herself as she went back to her room at what period during the interview which was now over she could have declared to him the real state of her mind he had as it were taken complete possession of her by right of the deed of gift which she had made of herself that morning she had endeavoured to resume the gift but had altogether failed she declared to herself that she was weak impotent purposeless but she admitted on the other hand that he had displayed more of power than she had ever guessed at his possessing a woman always loves this display of power in a man and she felt that she could have loved him had it not been for john gordon  but there was one comfort for her none knew of her weakness her mind had vacillated like a shuttlecock but no one had seen the vacillation she was in his hands and she must simply do as he bade her then she went down to mrs baggetts room and told the old lady to go upstairs at her masters behest im agoing said mrs baggett im agoing i hope hell find every one else as good at doing what he tells em but i aint agoing to be adoing for him or for any one much longer     chapter vi  john gordon   mrs baggett walked into her masters room loudly knocking at the door and waiting for a loud answer he was pacing up and down the library thinking of the injustice of her interference and she was full of the injury to which she had been subjected by circumstances she had been perfectly sincere when she had told mary lawrie that mr whittlestaff was entitled to have and to enjoy his own wishes as against both of them in the first place he was a manand as a man was to be indulged at whatever cost to any number of women and then he was a man whose bread they had both eaten mary had eaten his bread as bestowed upon her from sheer charity according to mrs baggetts view of the world at large mary was bound to deliver herself body and soul to mr whittlestaff were soul sacrifice demanded from her as for herself her first duty in life was to look after him were he to be sick unfortunately mr whittlestaff never was sick but mrs baggett was patiently looking forward to some happy day when he might be brought home with his leg broken he had no imprudent habits hunting shooting or suchlike but chance might be good to her then the making of all jams and marmalades for which he did not care a straw and which he only ate to oblige her was a comfort to her she could manage occasionally to be kept out of her bed over some boiling till one oclock and then the making of butter in the summer would demand that she should be up at three thus she was enabled to consider that her normal hours of work were twentytwo out of the twentyfour she did not begrudge them in the least thinking that they were all due to mr whittlestaff now mr whittlestaff wanted a wife and of course he ought to have her his juggernauts car must roll on its course over her body or mary lawries but she could not be expected to remain and behold mary lawries triumph and mary lawries power that was out of the question and as she was thus driven out of the house she was entitled to show a little of her ill humour to the proud bride she must go to portsmouthwhich she knew was tantamount to a living death she only hated one person in all the world and he as she knew well was living at portsmouth there were to her only two places in the world in which anybody could livecrokers hall and portsmouth crokers hall was on the whole the proper region set apart for the habitation of the blest portsmouth was the other placeand thither she must go to remain even in heaven as housekeeper to a young woman was not to be thought of it was written in the book of fate that she must go but not on that account need she even pretend to keep her temper  whats all this that you have been saying to miss lawrie began mr whittlestaff with all the dignity of anger  what have i been saying of to miss mary  i am not at all well pleased with you  i havent said a word again you sir nor not again nothing as you are likely to do  miss lawrie is to become my wife  so i hears her say  there was something of a check in thisa check to mr whittlestaffs pride in marys conduct did mrs baggett intend him to understand that mary had told the whole story to the old woman and had boasted of her promotion  you have taught her to think that she should not do as we have proposedbecause of your wishes  i never said nothing of the kindso help me that i should put myself up again you sir oh no i knows my place better than that i wouldnt stand in the way of anything as was for your goodor even of what you thought was goodnot to be made housekeeper to well it dont matter where i couldnt change for the better nor wages wouldnt tempt me  what was it you said about going away  here mrs baggett shook her head you told miss lawrie that you thought it was a shame that you should have to leave because of her  i never said a word of the kind mr whittlestaff nor yet sir i dont think as miss lawrie ever said so im begging your pardon for contradicting you and well i ought but anything is better than making illblood between lovers mr whittlestaff winced at being called a lover but allowed the word to pass by i never said nothing about shame  what did you say  i said as how i must leave younothing but that it aint a matter of the slightest consequence to you sir  rubbish  very well sir i mustnt demean me to say as anything i had said wasnt rubbish when you said as it was but for all that ive got to go  nonsense  yes in course  why have you got to go  because of my feelings sir  i never heard such trash  thats true no doubt sir but still if youll think of it old women does have feelings not as a young one but still theyre there  whos going to hurt your feelings  in this house sir for the last fifteen years ive been topsawyer of the female gender  then im not to marry at all  youve gone on and you haventthats all i aint afinding no fault but you haventand im the sufferer here mrs baggett began to sob and to wipe her eyes with a clean handkerchief which she must surely have brought into the room for the purpose if you had taken some beautiful young lady  i have taken a beautiful young lady said mr whittlestaff now becoming more angry than ever  you wont listen to me sir and then you boil over like that no doubt miss mary is as beautiful as the best on em i knew how it would be when she came among us with her streaky brown cheeks oud make an anchor wish to kiss em here mr whittlestaff again became appeased and made up his mind at once that he would tell mary about the anchor as soon as things were smooth between them but if it had been some beautiful young lady out of another houseone of them from the park for instancewho hadnt been here amost under my own thumb i shouldnt ve minded it  the long and the short of it is mrs baggett that i am going to be married  i suppose you are sir  and as it happens the lady i have selected happens to have been your mistress for the last two years  she wont be my missus no more said mrs baggett with an air of fixed determination  of course you can do as you like about that i cant compel any one to live in this house against her will but i would compel you if i knew how for your own benefit  there aint no compelling  what other place have you got you can go to i cant conceive it possible that you should live in any other family  not in no family wages wouldnt tempt me but theres them as supposes that theyve a claim upon me then the woman began to cry in earnest and the clean pockethandkerchief was used in a manner which would soon rob it of its splendour  there was a slight pause before mr whittlestaff rejoined has he come back again he said almost solemnly  hes at portsmouth now sir and mrs baggett shook her head sadly  and wants you to go to him  he always wants that when he comes home ive got a bit of money and he thinks theres some one to earn a morsel of bread for himor rayther a glass of gin i must go this time  i dont see that you need go at all at any rate miss lawries marriage wont make any difference  it do sir she said sobbing  i cant see why  nor i cant explain i could stay on here and wouldnt be afraid of him a bit  then why dont you stay  its my feelings if i was to stay here i could just send him my wages and never go nigh him but when im alone about the world and forlorn i aint got no excuse but what i must go to him  then remain where you are and dont be a fool  but if a person is a fool whats to be done then in course im a fool i knows that very well theres no saying no other but i cant go on living here if miss mary is to be put over my head in that way baggett has sent for me and i must go baggett is at portsmouth ahanging on about the old shop and hell be drunk as long as theres gin to be had with or without paying they do tell me as his nose is got to be awful theres a man for a poor woman to go and spend her savings on hes had amost all on em already twentytwo pound four and sixpence he had out o me the last time he was in the country and he dont do nothing to have him locked up it would be better for me if hed get hisself locked up i do think its wrong because a young girl has been once foolish and said a few words before a parson as she is to be the slave of a drunken rednosed reprobate for the rest of her life aint there to be no way out of it  it was thus that mrs baggett told the tale of her married blissnot however without incurring the censure of her master because of her folly in resolving to go he had just commenced a lecture on the sin of pride in which he was prepared to show that all the evils which she could receive from the rednosed veteran at portsmouth would be due to her own stiffnecked obstinacy when he was stopped suddenly by the sound of a knock at the front door it was not only the knock at the door but the entrance into the hall of some man for the halldoor had been open into the garden and the servantgirl had been close at hand the library was at the top of the low stairs and mr whittlestaff could not but hear the demand made the gentleman had asked whether miss lawrie was living there  whos that said mr whittlestaff to the housekeeper  its not a voice as i know sir the gentleman in the meantime was taken into the drawingroom and was closeted for the moment with mary  we must now go downstairs and closet ourselves for a few moments with mary lawrie before the coming of the strange gentleman she had left the presence of mr whittlestaff half an hour since and felt that she had a second time on that day accepted him as her husband she had accepted him and now she must do the best she could to suit her life to his requirements her first feeling when she found herself alone was one of intense disgust at her own weakness he had spoken to her of her ambition and he had told her that he had found a place for her in which that ambition might find a fair scope and he had told her also that in reference to john gordon she had dreamed a dream it might be so but to her thinking the continued dreaming of that dream would satisfy her ambition better than the performance of those duties which he had arranged for her she had her own ideas of what was due from a girl and to a girl and to her thinking her love for john gordon was all the world to her she should not have been made to abandon her thoughts even though the man had not spoken a word to her she knew that she loved him even though a time might come when she should cease to do so that time had not come yet she vacillated in her mind between condemnation of the cruelty of mr whittlestaff and of her own weakness and then too there was some feeling of the hardship inflicted upon her by john gordon he had certainly said that which had justified her in believing that she possessed his heart but yet there had been no word on which she could fall back and regard it as a promise  it might perhaps be better for her that she should marry mr whittlestaff all her friends would think it to be infinitely better could there be anything more moonstruck more shandy more wretchedly listless than for a girl a penniless girl to indulge in dreams of an impossible lover when such a tower of strength presented itself to her as was mr whittlestaff she had consented to eat his bread and all her friends had declared how lucky she had been to find a man so willing and so able to maintain her and now this man did undoubtedly love her very dearly and there would be as she was well aware no peril in marrying him was she to refuse him because of a soft word once spoken to her by a young man who had since disappeared altogether from her knowledge and she had already accepted himhad twice accepted him on that very day and there was no longer a hope for escape even if escape were desirable what a fool must she be to sit there still dreaming her impossible dream instead of thinking of his happiness and preparing herself for his wants he had told her that she might be allowed to think of john gordon though not to speak of him she would neither speak of him nor think of him she knew herself she said too well to give herself such liberty he should be to her as though he had never been she would force herself to forget him if forgetting lies in the absence of all thought it was no more than mr whittlestaff had a right to demand and no more than she ought to be able to accomplish was she such a weak simpleton as to be unable to keep her mind from running back to the words and to the visage and to every little personal trick of one who could never be anything to her he has gone for ever she exclaimed rising up from her chair he shall be gone i will not be a martyr and a slave to my own memory the thing came and has gone and there is an end of it then jane opened the door with a little piece of whispered information please miss a mr gordon wishes to see you the door was opened a little wider and john gordon stood before her  there he was with his short black hair his bright pleasant eyes his masterful mouth his dark complexion and broad handsome manly shoulders such as had dwelt in her memory every day since he had departed there was nothing changed except that his raiment was somewhat brighter and that there was a look of prosperity about him which he had lacked when he left her he was the same john gordon who had seemed to her to be entitled to all that he wanted and who certainly would have had from her all that he had cared to demand when he had appeared before her she had jumped up ready to rush into his arms but then she had repressed herself and had fallen back and she leant against the table for support  so i have found you here he said  yes i am here  i have been after you down to norwich and have heard it all mary i am here on purpose to seek you your father and mrs lawrie are both gone he was going when i left you  yes mr gordon they are both gone and i am alonebut for the kindness of a most generous friend  i had heard of course of mr whittlestaff i hope i shall not be told now that i am doing no good about the house at any rate i am not a pauper i have mended that little fault then he looked at her as though he thought that there was nothing for him but to begin the conversation where it had been so roughly ended at their last meeting  did it not occur to him that something might have come across her life during a period of nearly three years which would stand in his way and in hers but as she gazed into his face it seemed as though no such idea had fallen upon him but during those two or three minutes a multitude of thoughts crowded on poor marys mind was it possible that because of the coming of john gordon mr whittlestaff should withdraw his claim and allow this happy young hero to walk off with the reward which he still seemed to desire she felt sure that it could not be so even during that short space of time she resolved that it could not be so she knew mr whittlestaff too well and was sure that her lover had arrived too late it all passed through her brain and she was sure that no change could be effected in her destiny had he come yesterday indeed but before she could prepare an answer for john gordon mr whittlestaff entered the room  she was bound to say something though she was little able at the moment to speak at all she was aware that some ceremony was necessary she was but ill able to introduce these two men to each other but it had to be done mr whittlestaff she said this is mr john gordon who used to know us at norwich  mr john gordon said mr whittlestaff bowing very stiffly  yes sir that is my name i never had the pleasure of meeting you at norwich though i often heard of you there and since i left the place i have been told how kind a friend you have been to this young lady i trust i may live to thank you for it more warmly though not more sincerely than i can do at this moment  of john gordons fate since he had left norwich a few words must be told as mrs lawrie had then told him he was little better than a pauper he had however collected together what means he had been able to gather and had gone to cape town in south africa thence he had made his way up to kimberley and had there been at work among the diamondfields for two years if there be a place on gods earth in which a man can thoroughly make or mar himself within that space of time it is the town of kimberley i know no spot more odious in every way to a man who has learned to love the ordinary modes of english life it is foul with dust and flies it reeks with bad brandy it is fed upon potted meats it has not a tree near it it is inhabited in part by tribes of south african niggers who have lost all the picturesqueness of niggerdom in working for the white mans wages the white man himself is insolent illdressed and ugly the weather is very hot and from morning till night there is no occupation other than that of looking for diamonds and the works attending it diamondgrubbers want food and brandy and lawyers and policemen they want clothes also and a few horses and some kind of education is necessary for their children but diamondsearching is the occupation of the place and if a man be sharp and clever and able to guard what he gets he will make a fortune there in two years more readily perhaps than elsewhere john gordon had gone out to kimberley and had returned the owner of many shares in many mines     chapter vii  john gordon and mr whittlestaff   mr gordon had gone out to south africa with the settled intention of doing something that might enable him to marry mary lawrie and he had carried his purpose through with a manly resolution he had not found kimberley much to his taste and had not made many dear friends among the settled inhabitants he had found there but he had worked on buying and selling shares in mines owning a quarter of an eighth there and half a tenth here and then advancing till he was the possessor of many complete shares in many various adventures which were quite intelligible to him though to the ordinary stayathome englishman they seem to be so full of peril as not to be worth possessing as in other mines the profit is shared monthly and the system has the advantage of thus possessing twelve quarterdays in the year the result is that time is more spread out and the man expects to accomplish much more in twelve months than he can at home in two years a man may have made a fortune and lost it and be on his way to make it again john gordon had suffered no reverses and with twentyfour quarterdays at each of which he had received ten or twenty per cent he had had time to become rich he had by no means abandoned all his shares in the diamondmines but having wealth at command he had determined to carry out the first purpose for which he had come to south africa therefore he returned to norwich and having there learned marys address now found himself in her presence at crokers hall  mr whittlestaff when he heard john gordons name was as much astonished as had been mary herself here was marys loverthe very man whom mary had named to him it had all occurred on this very morning so that even the look of her eyes and the tone of her voice as those few words of hers had been spoken were fresh in his memory he used to come to our house at norwichand i loved him then she had told him that this lover had been poor and had gone away he had since that argued it out with himself and with her too on the theory though not expressed that a lover who had gone away now nearly three years ago and had not been heard of and had been poor when he went was of no use and should be forgotten let there be no mention of him between us he had intended to say and the memory of him will fade away but now on this very day he was back among them and there was mary hardly able to open her mouth in his presence  he had bowed twice very stiffly when gordon had spoken of all that he had done on marys behalf arrangements have been made he said which may i trust tend to miss lawries advantage perhaps i ought not to say so myself but there is no reason why i should trouble a stranger with them  i hope i may never be considered a stranger by miss lawrie said gordon turning round to the young lady  no not a stranger said mary certainly not a stranger  but this did not satisfy john gordon who felt that there was something in her manner other than he would have it and yet even to him it seemed to be impossible now at this first moment to declare his love before this man who had usurped the place of her guardian in fact he could not speak to her at all before mr whittlestaff he had hurried back from the diamondfields in order that he might lay all his surprisingly gotten wealth at marys feet and now he felt himself unable to say a word to mary of his wealth unless in this mans presence he told himself as he had hurried home that there might be difficulties in his way he might find her marriedor promised in marriage he had been sure of her love when he started he had been quite confident that though no absolute promise had been made from her to him or from him to her there had then been no reason for him to doubt in spite of that she might have married now or been promised in marriage he knew that she must have been poor and left in want when her stepmother had died she had told him of the intentions for her life and he had answered that perhaps in the course of events something better might come up for her then he had been called a pauper and had gone away to remedy that evil if it might be possible he had heard while working among the diamonds that mr whittlestaff had taken her to his own home he had heard of mr whittlestaff as the friend of her father and nothing better he thought could have happened but mary might have been weak during his absence and have given herself up to some other man who had asked for her hand she was still at heart mary lawrie so much had been made known to him but from the words which had fallen from her own lips and from the statement which had fallen from mr whittlestaff he feared that it must be so mr whittlestaff had said that he need not trouble a stranger with marys affairs and mary in answer to his appeal had declared that he could not be considered as a stranger to her  he thought a moment how he would act and then he spoke boldly to both of them i have hurried home from kimberley mr whittlestaff on purpose to find mary lawrie  mary when she heard this seated herself on the chair that was nearest to her for any service that it might be to her his coming was too late as she thought of this her voice left her so that she could not speak to him  you have found her said mr whittlestaff very sternly  is there any reason why i should go away again he had not at this moment realised the idea that mr whittlestaff himself was the man to whom mary might be engaged mr whittlestaff to his thinking had been a paternal providence a godsent support in lieu of father who had come to mary in her need he was prepared to shower all kinds of benefits on mr whittlestaffdiamonds polished and diamonds in the rough diamonds pure and white and diamonds pinktintedif only mr whittlestaff would be less stern to him but even yet he had no fear of mr whittlestaff himself  i should be most happy to welcome you here as an old friend of marys said mr whittlestaff if you will come to her wedding mr whittlestaff also had seen the necessity for open speech and though he was a man generally reticent as to his own affairs thought it would be better to let the truth be known at once mary when the word had been spoken as to her wedding blushed black as her stepmother had said of her a dark ruby tint covered her cheeks and her forehead but she turned away her face and compressed her lips and clenched her two fists close together  miss lawries wedding said john gordon is miss lawrie to be married and he purposely looked at her as though asking her the question but she answered never a word  yes miss lawrie is to be married  it is sad tidings for me to hear said john gordon when last i saw her i was rebuked by her stepmother because i was a pauper it was true misfortunes had come in my family and i was not a fit person to ask miss lawrie for her love but i think she knew that i loved her i then went off to do the best within my power to remedy that evil i have come back with such money as might suffice and now i am told of miss lawries wedding this he said again turning to her as though for an answer but from her there came not a word  i am sorry you should be disappointed mr gordon said mr whittlestaff but it is so then there came over john gordons face a dark frown as though he intended evil he was a man whose displeasure when he was displeased those around him were apt to fear but mr whittlestaff himself was no coward have you any reason to allege why it should not be so john gordon only answered by looking again at poor mary i think there has been no promise made by miss lawrie i think that i understand from her that there has been no promise on either side and indeed no word spoken indicating such a promise it was quite clear at any rate that this guardian and his ward had fully discussed the question of any possible understanding between her and john gordon  no there was none it is true  well  it is true i am left without an inch of ground on which to found a complaint there was no word no promise you know the whole story only too well there was nothing but unlimited loveat any rate on my part mr whittlestaff knew well that there had been love on her part also and that the love still remained but she had promised to get over that passion and there could be no reason why she should not do so simply because the man had returned he said he had come from kimberley mr whittlestaff had his own ideas about kimberley kimberley was to him a very rowdy placethe last place in the world from which a discreet young woman might hope to get a wellconducted husband under no circumstances could he think well of a husband who presented himself as having come direct from the diamondfields though he only looked stern and held his peace if miss lawrie will tell me that i may go away i will go said gordon looking again at mary but how could mary answer him  i am sure said mr whittlestaff that miss lawrie will be very sorry that there should be any ground for a quarrel i am quite well aware that there was some friendship between you two then you went as you say and though the friendship need not be broken the intimacy was over she had no special reason for remembering you as you yourself admit she has been left to form any engagement that she may please any other expectation on your part must be unreasonable i have said that as an old friend of miss lawries i should be happy to welcome you here to her wedding i cannot even name a day as yet but i trust that it may be fixed soon you cannot say even to yourself that miss lawrie has treated you badly  but he could say it to himself and though he would not say it to mr whittlestaff had she been there alone he would have said it to her there had been no promiseno word of promise but he felt that there had been that between them which should have been stronger than any promise and with every word which came from mr whittlestaffs mouth he disliked mr whittlestaff more and more he could judge from marys appearance that she was downhearted that she was unhappy that she did not glory in her coming marriage no girls face ever told her hearts secret more plainly than did marys at this moment but mr whittlestaff seemed to glory in the marriage to him it seemed that the getting rid of john gordon was the one thing of importance so it was at least that john gordon interpreted his manner but the name of the suitor had not yet been told him and he did not in the least suspect it may i ask you when it is to be he asked  that is a question which the lady generally must answer said mr whittlestaff turning on his part also to mary  i do not know said mary  and who is the happy man said john gordon he expected an answer to the question also from mary but mary was still unable to answer him you at any rate will tell me sir the name of the gentleman  i am the gentleman said mr whittlestaff holding himself somewhat more erect as he spoke the position it must be acknowledged was difficult he could see that this strange man this john gordon looked upon him william whittlestaff to be altogether an unfit person to take mary lawrie for his wife by the tone in which he asked the question and by the look of surprise which he put on when he received the answer gordon showed plainly that he had not expected such a reply what an old man like you to become the husband of such a girl as mary lawrie is this the purpose for which you have taken her into your house and given her those good things of which you have boasted it was thus that mr whittlestaff had read the look and interpreted the speech conveyed in gordons eye not that mr whittlestaff had boasted but it was thus that he read the look he knew that he had gathered himself up and assumed a special dignity as he made his answer  oh indeed said john gordon and now he turned himself altogether round and gazed with his full frowning eyes fixed upon poor mary  if you knew it all you would feel that i could not help myself it was thus that mary would have spoken if she could have given vent to the thoughts within her bosom  yes sir it is i who think myself so happy as to have gained the affections of the young lady she is to be my wife and it is she herself who must name the day when she shall become so i repeat the invitation which i gave you before i shall be most happy to see you at my wedding if as may be the case you shall not be in the country when that time comes and if now that you are here you will give miss lawrie and myself some token of your renewed friendship we shall be happy to see you if you will come at once to the house during such time as it may suit you to remain in the neighbourhood considering the extreme difficulty of the position mr whittlestaff carried himself quite as well as might have been expected  under such circumstances said gordon i cannot be a guest in your house thereupon mr whittlestaff bowed but i hope that i may be allowed to speak a few words to the young lady not in your presence  certainly if the young lady wishes it  i had better not said mary  are you afraid of me  i am afraid of myself it had better not be so mr whittlestaff has told you only the truth i am to be his wife and in offering me his hand he has added much to the infinite kindnesses which he has bestowed upon me  oh if you think so  i do think so if you only knew it all you would think so too  how long has this engagement existed asked gordon but to this question mary lawrie could not bring herself to give an answer  if you are not afraid of what he may say to you said mr whittlestaff  i am certainly afraid of nothing that mr gordon may say  then i would accede to his wishes it may be painful but it will be better to have it over mr whittlestaff in giving this advice had thought much as to what the world would say of him he had done nothing of which he was ashamednor had mary she had given him her promise and he was sure that she would not depart from it it would he thought be infinitely better for her for many reasons that she should be married to him than to this wild young man who had just now returned to england from the diamondmines and would soon he imagined go back there again but the young man had asked to see the girl whom he was about to marry alone and it would not suit him to be afraid to allow her so much liberty  i shall not hurt you mary said john gordon  i am sure you would not hurt me  nor say an unkind word  oh no you could do nothing unkind to me i know but you might spare me and yourself some pain  i cannot do it he said i cannot bring myself to go back at once after this long voyage instantly as i should do without having spoken one word to you i have come here to england on purpose to see you nothing shall induce me to abandon my intention of doing so but your refusal i have received a blowa great blowand it is you who must tell me that there is certainly no cure for the wound  there is certainly none said mary  perhaps i had better leave you together said mr whittlestaff as he got up and left the room     chapter viii  john gordon and mary lawrie   the door was closed and john gordon and mary were alone together she was still seated and he coming forward stood in front of her mary he saidand he put out his right hand as though to take hers but she sat quite still making no motion to give him her hand nor did she say a word to her her promise her reiterated promise to mr whittlestaff was bindingnot the less binding because it had only been made on this very day she had already acknowledged to this other man that the promise had been made and she had asked him to spare her this interview he had not spared her and it was for him now to say while it lasted what there was to be said she had settled the matter in her own mind and had made him understand that it was so settled there was nothing further that she could tell him mary now that we are alone will you not speak to me  i have nothing to say  should i not have come to you  you should not have stayed when you found that i had promised myself to another  is there nothing else that i may wish to say to you  there is nothing else that you should wish to say to the wife of another man  you are not his wifenot yet  i shall be his wife mr gordon you may be sure of that and i thinkthink i can say of myself that i shall be a true wife he has chosen to take me and as he has so chosen his wishes must be respected he has asked you to remain here as a friend understanding that to be the case but as you do not choose you should go  do you wish me to stay and to see you become his wife  i say nothing of that it is not for me to insist on my wishes i have expressed one wish and you have refused to grant it nothing can pass between you and me which must not i should say be painful to both of us  you would have me go thenso that you should never hear of or see me again  i shall never see you i suppose what good would come of seeing you  and you can bear to part with me after this fashion  it has to be borne the world is full of hard things which have to be borne it is not made to run smoothly altogether either for you or for me you must bear your crossand so must i  and that is the only word i am to receive after having struggled so hard for you and having left all my work and all my cares and all my property in order that i might come home and catch just one glance of your eye can you not say a word to me a word of kindness that i may carry back with me  not a word if you will think of it you ought not to ask me for a word of kindness what does a kind word meana kind word coming from me to you there was a time when i wanted a kind word but i did not ask for it at the time it did not suit nor does it suit now put yourself in mr whittlestaffs case would you wish the girl to whom you were engaged to say kind words behind your back to some other man if you heard them would you not think that she was a traitor he has chosen to trust meagainst my advice indeed but he has trusted me and i know myself to be trustworthy there shall be no kind word spoken  mary said he when did all this happen  it has been happening i suppose from the first day that i came into his house  but when was it settled when did he ask you to be his wife or when rather did you make him the promise john gordon fancied that since he had been at crokers hall words had been spoken or that he had seen signs indicating that the engagement had not been of a long date and in every word that she had uttered to him he had heard whispered under her breath an assurance of her perfect love for himself he had been sure of her love when he had left the house at norwich in which he had been told that he had been lingering there to no good purpose but he had never been more certain than he was at this moment when she coldly bade him go and depart back again to his distant home in the diamondfields and now in her mock anger and in her indignant words with the purpose of her mind written so clearly on her brow she was to him more lovable and more beautiful than ever could it be fair to him as a man that he should lose the prize which was to him of such inestimable value merely for a word of cold assent given to this old man and given as he thought quite lately his devotion to her was certainly assured nothing could be more fixed less capable of a doubt than his love and he too was somewhat proud of himself in that he had endeavoured to entangle her by no promise till he had secured for himself and for her the means of maintaining her he had gone out and he had come back with silent hopes with hopes which he had felt must be subject to disappointment because he knew himself to be a reticent selfrestrained man and because he had been aware that the world as she had said is full of hard things which have to be borne  but now if as he believed the engagement was but of recent date there would be a hardship in it which even he could not bear patientlya hardship the endurance of which must be intolerable to her if it were so the man could hardly be so closefisted so hardhearted so cruelminded as to hold the girl to her purpose when did you promise to be his wife he said repeating his question now there came over marys face a look of weakness the opposite to the strength which she had displayed when she had bade him not ask her for a word of kindness to her the promise was the same was as strong even though it had been made but that morning as though weeks and months had intervened but she felt that to him there would be an apparent weakness in the promise of her engagement if she told him that it was made only on that morning when was it mary  it matters nothing she said  but it does matterto me  then a sense of what was fitting told her that it was incumbent on her to tell him the truth sooner or later he would assuredly know and it was well that he should know the entire truth from her lips she could not put up with the feeling that he should go away deceived in any degree by herself  it was this morning she said  this very morning  it was on this morning that i gave my word to mr whittlestaff and promised to become his wife  and had i been here yesterday i should not have been too late  here she looked up imploringly into his face she could not answer that question nor ought he to press for an answer and the words were no sooner out of his mouth than he felt that it was so it was not to her that he must address any such remonstrance as that this morning he repeatedonly this morning  but he did not know nor could she tell him that she had pleaded her love for him when mr whittlestaff had asked her she could not tell him of that second meeting at which she had asked mr whittlestaff that even yet he should let her go it had seemed to her as she had thought of it that mr whittlestaff had behaved well to her had intended to do a good thing to her and had ignored the other man who had vanished as it were from the scene of their joint lives because he had become one who ought not to be allowed to interest her any further she had endeavoured to think of it with stern justice accusing herself of absurd romance and giving mr whittlestaff credit for all goodness this had been before john gordon had appeared among them and now she struggled hard not to be less just to mr whittlestaff than before because of this accident she knew him well enough to be aware that he could not easily be brought to abandon the thing on which he had set his mind it all passed through her mind as she prepared her answer for john gordon it can make no difference she said a promise is a promise though it be but an hour old  that is to be my answer  yes that is to be your answer ask yourself and you will know that there is no other answer that i can honestly make you  how is your own heart in the affair  there she was weak and knew as she spoke that she was weak it matters not at all she said  it matters not at all he repeated after her i can understand that my happiness should be nothing if you and he were satisfied of course it would be nothing if you were satisfied there would be an end to it because if your pleasure and his work together i must necessarily be left out in the cold but it is not so i take upon myself to say that you are not satisfied  you will not allow me to answer for myself  no not in this matter will you dare to tell me that you do not love me she remained silent before him and then he went on to reason with her you do not deny it i hear it in your voice and see it in your face when we parted in norwich did you not love me then  i shall answer no such question a young woman has often to change her mind as to whom she loves before she can settle down as one mans wife or anothers  you do not dare to be true if i am rough with you it is for your sake as well as my own we are young and as was natural we learnt to love each other then you came here and were alone in the world and i was gone though there had been no word of marriage between us i had hoped that i might be remembered in my absence perhaps you did remember me i cannot think that i was ever absent from your heart but i was away and you could not know how loyal i was to my thoughts of you i am not blaming you mary i can well understand that you were eating his bread and drinking his cup and that it appeared to you that everything was due to him you could not have gone on eating his bread unless you had surrendered yourself to his wishes you must have gone from this and have had no home to which to go it is all true but the pity of it mary the pity of it  he has done the best he could by me  perhaps so but if done from that reason the surrender will be the easier  no no no i know more of him than you do no such surrender will come easy to him he has set his heart upon this thing and as far as i am concerned he shall have it  you will go to him with a lie in your mouth  i do not know i cannot say what the words may be if there be a lie i will tell it  then you do love me still  you may cheat me out of my thoughts but it will be to no good whether i lie or tell the truth i will do my duty by him there will be no lying to the best of my ability i will love him and him only all my care shall be for him i have resolved and i will force myself to love him all his qualities are good there is not a thought in his mind of which he need be ashamed  not when he will use his power to take you out of my arms  no sir for i am not your property you speak of dealing with me as though i must necessarily belong to you if i did not belong to him it is not so  oh mary  it is not so what might be the case i will not take upon myself to sayor what might have been i was yesterday a free woman and my thoughts were altogether my own today i am bound to him and whether it be for joy or for sorrow i will be true to him now mr gordon i will leave you  half a moment he said standing between her and the door it cannot be that this should be the end of all between us i shall go to him and tell him what i believe to be the truth  i cannot hinder you but i shall tell him that what you say is false  you know it to be true  i shall tell him that it is false  can you bring yourself to utter a lie such as that  i can bring myself to say whatever may be best for him and most conducive to his wishes but as she said this she was herself aware that she had told mr whittlestaff only on this morning that she had given her heart to john gordon and that she would be unable to keep her thoughts from running to him she had implored him to leave her to herself so that the memory of her love might be spared then when this young man had been still absent when there was no dream of his appearing again before her when the consequence would be that she must go forth into the world and earn her own bitter bread aloneat that moment she knew that she had been true to the memory of the man what had occurred since to alter her purpose so violently was it the presence of the man she did love and the maidenly instincts which forbade her to declare her passion in his presence or was it simply the conviction that her promise to mr whittlestaff had been twice repeated and could not now admit of being withdrawn but in spite of her asseverations there must have been present to her mind some feeling that if mr whittlestaff would yield to the prayer of john gordon all the gulf would be bridged over which yawned between herself and perfect happiness kimberley yes indeed or anywhere else in the wide world as he left the room she did now tell herself that in spite of all that she had said she could accompany him anywhere over the world with perfect bliss how well had he spoken for himself and for his love how like a man he had looked when he had asked her that question will you dare to tell me that you do not love me she had not dared even though at the moment she had longed to leave upon him the impression that it was so she had told him that she would lie to mr whittlestafflie on mr whittlestaffs own behalf but such a lie as this she could not tell to john gordon he had heard it in her voice and seen it in her face she knew it well and was aware that it must be so  the pity of it she too said to herself the pity of it if he had but come a week soonerbut a day sooner before mr whittlestaff had spoken out his mindno lovetale would ever have run smoother in that case she would have accepted john gordon without a moments consideration when he should have told her of his distant home of the roughness of his life of the changes and chances to which his career must be subject she would have assured him with her heart full of joy that she would accept it all and think her lot so happy as to admit of no complaint mr whittlestaff would then have known the condition of her heart before he had himself spoken a word and as the trouble would always have been in his own bosom there would so to say have been no trouble at all a mans sorrows of that kind do not commence or at any rate are not acutely felt while the knowledge of the matter from which they grow is confined altogether to his own bosom  but she resolved sitting there after john gordon had left her that in the circumstances as they existed it was her duty to bear what sorrow there was to be borne poor john gordon he must bear some sorrow too if there should be cause to him for grief there would be loss of money and loss of time which would of themselves cause him grief poor john gordon she did not blame him in that he had gone away and not said one word to draw from her some assurance of her love it was the nature of the man which in itself was good and noble but in this case it had surely been unfortunate with such a passion at his heart it was rash in him to have gone across the world to the diamondfields without speaking a word by which they two might have held themselves as bound together the pity of it  but as circumstances had gone honour and even honesty demanded that mr whittlestaff should not be allowed to suffer he at least had been straightforward in his purpose and had spoken as soon as he had been assured of his own mind mr whittlestaff should at any rate have his reward     chapter ix  the rev montagu blake   john gordon when he left the room went out to look for mr whittlestaff but was told that he had gone into the town mr whittlestaff had had his own troubles in thinking of the unlucky coincidence of john gordons return and had wandered forth determined to leave those two together so that they might speak to each other as they pleased and during his walk he did come to a certain resolution should a request of any kind be made to him by john gordon it should receive not the slightest attention he was a man to whom he owed nothing and for whose welfare he was not in the least solicitous why should i be punished and he be made happy it was thus he spoke to himself should he encounter the degradation of disappointment in order that john gordon should win the object on which he had set his heart certainly not his own heart was much dearer to him than that of john gordon  but if a request should be made to him by mary lawrie alas if it were so then there must be sharp misery in store for him in the first place were she to make the request were she to tell him to his face she who had promised to be his wife that this man was dear to her how was it possible that he should go to the altar with the girl and there accept from her her troth she had spoken already of a fancy which had crossed her mind respecting a man who could have been no more than a dream to her of whose whereabouts and conditionnay of his very existenceshe was unaware and she had told him that no promise no word of love had passed between them yes you may think of him he had said meaning not to debar her from the use of thought which should be open to all the world but let him not be spoken of then she had promised and when she had come again to withdraw her promise she had done so with some cockandbull story about the old woman which had had no weight with him then he had her presence during the interview between the three on which to form his judgment as far as he could remember as he wandered through the fields thinking of it she had not spoken hardly above a word during that interview she had sat silent apparently unhappy but not explaining the cause of her unhappiness it might well be that she should be unhappy in the presence of her affianced husband and her old lover but now if she would tell him that she wished to be relieved from him and to give herself to this stranger she should be allowed to go but he told himself also that he would carry his generosity no further he was not called upon to offer to surrender himself the mans coming had been a misfortune but let him go and in process of time he would be forgotten it was thus that mr whittlestaff resolved as he walked across the country while he left the two lovers to themselves in his own parlour  it was now nearly five oclock and mr whittlestaff as gordon was told dined at six he felt that he would not find the man before dinner unless he remained at the houseand for doing so he had no excuse he must return in the evening or sleep at the inn and come back the next morning he must manage to catch the man alone because he was assuredly minded to use upon him all the power of eloquence which he had at his command and as he thought it improbable so to find him in the evening he determined to postpone his task but in doing so he felt that he should be at a loss the eager words were hot now within his memory having been sharpened against the anvil of his thoughts by his colloquy with mary lawrie tomorrow they might have cooled his purpose might be as strong but a man when he wishes to use burning words should use them while the words are on fire  john gordon had a friend at alresford or rather an acquaintance on whom he had determined to call unless circumstances as they should occur at crokers hall should make him too ecstatic in his wish for any such operation the ecstasy certainly had not come as yet and he went forth therefore to call on the reverend mr blake of mr blake he only knew that he was a curate of a neighbouring parish and that they two had been at oxford together so he walked down to the inn to order his dinner not feeling his intimacy with mr blake sufficient to justify him in looking for his dinner with him a man always dines let his sorrow be what it may a woman contents herself with tea and mitigates her sorrow we must suppose by an extra cup john gordon ordered a roast fowlthe safest dinner at an english country innand asked his way to the curates house  the rev montagu blake was curate of little alresford a parish though hardly to be called a village lying about three miles from the town the vicar was a feeble old gentleman who had gone away to die in the riviera and mr blake had the care of souls to himself he was a man to whom his lines had fallen in pleasant places there were about 250 men women and children in his parish and not a dissenter among them for looking after these folk he had £120 per annum and as pretty a little parsonage as could be found in england there was a squire with whom he was growing in grace and friendship who being the patron of the living might probably bestow it upon him it was worth only £250 and was not therefore too valuable to be expected he had a modest fortune of his own £300 ayear perhaps andfor the best of his luck shall be mentioned lasthe was engaged to the daughter of one of the prebendaries of winchester a pretty bright little girl with a further sum of £5000 belonging to herself he was thirty years of age in the possession of perfect health and not so strict in matters of religion as to make it necessary for him to abandon any of the innocent pleasures of this world he could dine out and play cricket and read a novel and should he chance when riding his cob about the parish or visiting some neighbouring parish to come across the hounds he would not scruple to see them over a field or two so that the rev montagu blake was upon the whole a happy fellow  he and john gordon had been thrown together at oxford for a short time during the last months of their residence and though they were men quite unlike each other in their pursuits circumstances had made them intimate it was well that gordon should take a stroll for a couple of hours before dinner and therefore he started off for little alresford going into the parsonage gate he was overtaken by blake and of course introduced himself dont you remember gordon at exeter  john gordon gracious me of course i do what a good fellow you are to come and look a fellow up where have you come from and where are you going to and what brings you to alresford beyond the charitable intention of dining with me oh nonsense not dine but you will and i can give you a bed too and breakfast and shall be delighted to do it for a week ordered your dinner then well unorder it ill send the boy in and put that all right shall i make him bring your bag back gordon however though he assented to the proposition as regarded dinner made his friend understand that it was imperative that he should be at the inn that night  yes said blake when they had settled down to wait for their dinner i am parson herea sort of a one at least i am not only curate but live in expectation of higher things our squire here who owns the living talks of giving it to me there isnt a better fellow living than mr furnival or his wife or his four daughters  will he be as generous with one of them as with the living  there is no necessity as far as i am concerned i came here already provided in that respect if youll remain here till september youll see me a married man one kattie forrester intends to condescend to become mrs montagu blake though i say it as shouldnt a sweeter human being doesnt live on the earth i met her soon after i had taken orders but i had to wait till i had some sort of a house to put her into her father is a clergyman like myself so we are all in a boat together shes got a little bit of money and ive got a little bit of money so that we shant absolutely starve now you know all about me and what have you been doing yourself  john gordon thought that this friend of his had been most communicative he had been told everything concerning his friends life had mr blake written a biography of himself down to the present period he could not have been more full or accurate in his details but gordon felt that as regarded himself he must be more reticent i intended to have joined my fathers bank but that came to grief  yes i did hear of some trouble in that respect  and then i went out to the diamondfields  dear me that was a long way  yes it is a long wayand rather rough towards the end  did you do any good at the diamondfields i dont fancy that men often bring much money home with them  i brought some  enough to do a fellow any good in his after life  well yes enough to content me only that a man is not easily contented who has been among diamonds  crescit amor diamonds said the parson i can easily understand that and then when a fellow goes back again he is so apt to lose it all dont you expect to see your diamonds turn into slatestones  not except in the ordinary way of expenditure i dont think the gnomes or the spirits will interfere with themthough the thieves may if they can get a hand upon them but my diamonds have for the most part been turned into ready money and at the present moment take the comfortable shape of a balance at my bankers  id leave it thereor buy land or railway shares if i had realised in that venture enough to look at id never go out to the diamondfields again  its hard to bring an occupation of that kind to an end all at once said john gordon  crescit amor diamonds repeated the reverend montagu blake shaking his head if you gave me three i could easily imagine that i should toss up with another fellow who had three also double or quits till i lost them all but well make sure of dinner at any rate without any such hazardous proceeding then they went into the diningroom and enjoyed themselves without any reference having been made as yet to the business which had brought john gordon into the neighbourhood of alresford  youll find that port wine rather good i cant afford claret because it takes such a lot to go far enough to tell the truth when im alone i confine myself to whisky and water blake is a very good name for whisky  why do you make a ceremony with me  because its so pleasant to have an excuse for such a ceremony it wasnt you only i was thinking of when i came out just now and uncorked the bottle think what it is to have a prudent mind i had to get it myself out of the cellar because girls cant understand that wine shouldnt be treated in the same way as physic bytheby what brought you into this part of the world at all  i came to see one mr whittlestaff  what old william whittlestaff then let me tell you you have come to see as honest a fellow and as goodhearted a christian as any that i know  you do know him  oh yes i know him id like to see the man whose bond is better than old whittlestaffs did you hear what he did about that young lady who is living with him she was the daughter of a friendsimply of a friend who died in pecuniary distress old whittlestaff just brought her into his house and made her his own daughter it isnt every one who will do that you know  why do you call him old said john gordon  well i dont know he is old  just turned fifty  fifty is old i dont mean that he is a cripple or bedridden perhaps if he had been a married man hed have looked younger he has got a very nice girl there with him and if he isnt too old to think of such things he may marry her do you know miss lawrie  yes i know her  dont you think shes nice only my goose is cooked id go in for her sooner than any one i see about  sooner than your own squires four daughters  wellyes theyre nice girls too but i dont quite fancy one out of four and theyd look higher than the curate  a prebendary is as high as a squire said gordon  there are prebendaries and there are squires our squire isnt a swell though hes an uncommonly good fellow if i get a wife from one and a living from the other i shall think myself very lucky miss lawrie is a handsome girl and everything that she ought to be but if you were to see kattie forrester i think you would say that she was a 1 i sometimes wonder whether old whittlestaff will think of marrying  gordon sat silent turning over one or two matters in his mind how supremely happy was this young parson with his kattie forrester and his promised livingin earning the proceeds of which there need be no risk and very little labourand with his bottle of port wine and comfortable house all the world seemed to have smiled with montagu blake but with him though there had been much success there had been none of the worlds smiles he was aware at this moment or thought that he was aware that the world would never smile on himunless he should succeed in persuading mr whittlestaff to give up the wife whom he had chosen then he felt tempted to tell his own story to this young parson they were alone together and it seemed as though providence had provided him with a friend and the subject of mary lawries intended marriage had been brought forward in a peculiar manner but he was by nature altogether different from mr blake and could not blurt out his lovestory with easy indifference do you know mr whittlestaff well he asked  pretty well ive been here four years and hes a near neighbour i think i do know him well  is he a sort of man likely to fall in love with such a girl as miss lawrie seeing that she is an inmate of his house  well said the parson after some consideration if you ask me i dont think he is he seems to have settled himself down to a certain manner of life and will not i should say be stirred from it very quickly if you have any views in that direction i dont think hell be your rival  is he a man to care much for a girls love  i should say not  but if he had once brought himself to ask her said gordon  and if she had accepted him suggested the other  thats what i mean  i dont think hed let her go very easily hes a sort of dog whom you cannot easily persuade to give up a bone if he has set his heart upon matrimony he will not be turned from it do you know anything of his intentions  i fancy that he is thinking of it  and you mean that you were thinking of it too with the same lady  no i didnt mean that then he added after a pause that is just what i did not mean to say i did not mean to talk about myself but since you ask me the question i will answer it trulyi have thought of the same lady and my thoughts were earlier in the field than his i must say goodnight now he said rising somewhat brusquely from his chair i have to walk back to alresford and must see mr whittlestaff early in the morning according to your view of the case i shant do much with him and if it be so i shall be off to the diamondfields again by the first mail  you dont say so  that is to be my lot in life i am very glad to have come across you once again and am delighted to find you so happy in your prospects you have told me everything and i have done pretty much the same to you i shall disappear from alresford and never more be heard of you neednt talk much about me and my love for though i shall be out of the way at kimberley many thousand miles from here a man does not care to have his name in every ones mouth  oh no said blake i wont say a word about miss lawrieunless indeed you should be successful  there is not the remotest possibility of that said gordon as he took his leave  i wonder whether she is fond of him said the curate to himself when he resolved to go to bed instead of beginning his sermon that night i shouldnt wonder if she is for he is just the sort of man to make a girl fond of him     chapter x  john gordon again goes to crokers hall   on the next morning when john gordon reached the corner of the road at which stood crokers hall he met outside on the roadway close to the house a most disreputable old man with a wooden leg and a red nose this was mr baggett or sergeant baggett as he was generally called and was now known about all alresford to be the husband of mr whittlestaffs housekeeper for news had got abroad and tidings were told that mr baggett was about to arrive in the neighbourhood to claim his wife everybody knew it before the inhabitants of crokers hall and now since yesterday afternoon all crokers hall knew it as well as the rest of the world he was standing there close to the house which stood a little back from the road between nine and ten in the morning as drunk as a lord but i think his manner of drunkenness was perhaps in some respects different from that customary with lords though he had only one leg of the flesh and one of wood he did not tumble down though he brandished in the air the stick with which he was accustomed to disport himself a lord would i think have got himself taken to bed but the sergeant did not appear to have any such intention he had come out on to the road from the yard into which the backdoor of the house opened and seemed to john gordon as though having been so far expelled he was determined to be driven no furtherand he was accompanied at a distance by his wife now timothy baggett began the unfortunate woman you may just take yourself away out of that as fast as your legs can carry you before the police comes to fetch you  my legs whoever heared a fellow told of his legs when there was one of them wooden and as for the perlice i shall want the perlice to fetch my wife along with me i aint agoing to stir out of this place without mrs b im a hold man and wants a woman to look arter me come along mrs b then he made a motion as though to run after her still brandishing the stick in his hand but she retreated and he came down seated on the pathway by the roadside as though he had only accomplished an intended manoeuvre get me a drop o summat mrs b and i dont mind if i stay here half an hour longer then he laughed loudly nodding his head merrily at the bystandersas no lord under such circumstances certainly would have done  all this happened just as john gordon came up to the corner of the road from whence by a pathway turned the main entrance into mr whittlestaffs garden he could not but see the drunken rednosed man and the old woman whom he recognised as mr whittlestaffs servant and a crowd of persons around idlers out of alresford who had followed sergeant baggett up to the scene of his present exploits crokers hall was not above a mile from the town just where the town was beginning to become country and where the houses all had gardens belonging to them and the larger houses a field or two yes sir master is at home if youll please to ring the bell one of the girls will come out this was said by mrs baggett advancing almost over the body of her prostrate husband drunken brute she said by way of a salute as she passed him he only laughed aloud and looked around upon the bystanders with triumph  at this moment mr whittlestaff came down through the gate into the road oh mr gordon good morning sir you find us rather in a disturbed condition this morning i am sorry i did not think of asking you to come to breakfast but perhaps under all the circumstances it was better not that dreadful man has put us sadly about he is the unfortunate husband of my hardly less unfortunate housekeeper  yes sir he is my husbandthats true said mrs baggett  im wery much attached to my wife if you knew all about it sir and i wants her to come home with me service aint no inheritance nor yet aint wages when they never amounts to more than twenty pounds ayear  its thirty you false ungrateful beast said mrs baggett but in the meantime mr whittlestaff had led the way into the garden and john gordon had followed him before they reached the halldoor mary lawrie had met them  oh mr whittlestaff she said is it not annoying that dreadful man with the wooden leg is here and collecting a crowd round the place good morning mr gordon it is the poor womans neerdowell husband she is herself so decent and respectable that she will be greatly harassed what can we do mr whittlestaff cant we get a policeman in this way the conversation was led away to the affairs of sergeant and mrs baggett to the ineffable distress of john gordon when we remember the kind of speeches which gordon intended to utter the sort of eloquence which he desired to use it must be admitted that the interruption was provoking even if mary would leave them together it would be difficult to fall back upon the subject which gordon had at heart  it is matter of consideration whether when important subjects are to be brought upon the tapis the ultimate result will or will not depend much on the manner in which they are introduced it ought not to be the case that they shall be so prejudiced bytheby my dear fellow now i think of it can you lend me a couple of thousand pounds for twelve months would that generally be as efficacious as though the wouldbe borrower had introduced his request with the general paraphernalia of distressing solemnities the borrower at any rate feels that it would not and postpones the moment till the fitting solemnities can be produced but john gordon could not postpone his moment he could not go on residing indefinitely at the claimants arms till he could find a proper opportunity for assuring mr whittlestaff that it could not be his duty to marry mary lawrie he must rush at his subject let the result be what it might indeed he had no hopes as to a favourable result he had slept upon it as people say when they intend to signify that they have lain awake and had convinced himself that all eloquence would be vain was it natural that a man should give up his intended wife simply because he was asked gordons present feeling was an anxious desire to be once more on board the ship that should take him again to the diamondfields so that he might be at peace knowing then as he would know that he had left mary lawrie behind for ever at this moment he almost repented that he had not left alresford without any farther attempt but there he was on mr whittlestaffs ground and the attempt must be made if only with the object of justifying his coming  miss lawrie he began if you would not mind leaving me and mr whittlestaff alone together for a few minutes i will be obliged to you this he said with quite sufficient solemnity so that mr whittlestaff drew himself up and looked hard and stiff as though he were determined to forget sergeant baggett and all his peccadilloes for the moment  oh yes certainly but mr whittlestaff looked sternly at her as though to bid her go at once you must believe nothing as coming from me unless it comes out of my own mouth then she put her hand upon his arm as though half embracing him  you had better leave us perhaps said mr whittlestaff and then she went  now the moment had come and john gordon felt the difficulty it had not been lessened by the assurance given by mary herself that nothing was to be taken as having come from her unless it was known and heard to have so come and yet he was thoroughly convinced that he was altogether loved by her and that had he appeared on the scene but a day sooner she would have accepted him with all her heart mr whittlestaff he said i want to tell you what passed yesterday between me and miss lawrie  is it necessary he asked  i think it is  as far as i am concerned i doubt the necessity miss lawrie has said a word to meas much i presume as she feels to be necessary  i do not think that her feeling in the matter should be a guide for you or for me what we have both of us to do is to think what may be best for her and to effect that as far as may be within our power  certainly said mr whittlestaff but it may so probably be the case that you and i shall differ materially as to thinking what may be best for her as far as i understand the matter you wish that she should be your wife i wish that she should be mine i think that as my wife she would live a happier life than she could do as yours and as she thinks also here mr whittlestaff paused  but does she think so  you heard what she said just now  i heard nothing as to her thoughts of living said john gordon nor in the interview which i had with her yesterday did i hear a word fall from her as to herself we have got to form our ideas as to that from circumstances which shall certainly not be made to appear by her own speech when you speak against me  i have not said a word against you sir  perhaps you imply said gordon not stopping to notice mr whittlestaffs last angry toneperhaps you imply that my life may be that of a rover and as such would not conduce to miss lawries happiness  i have implied nothing  to suit her wishes i would remain altogether in england i was very lucky and am not a man greedy of great wealth she can remain here and i will satisfy you that there shall be enough for our joint maintenance  what do i care for your maintenance or what does she do you know sir that you are talking to me about a lady whom i intend to make my wifewho is engaged to marry me goodness gracious me  i own sir that it is singular  very singularvery singular indeed i never heard of such a thing it seems that you knew her at norwich  i did know her well  and then you went away and deserted her  i went away mr whittlestaff because i was poor i was told by her stepmother that i was not wanted about the house because i had no means that was true and as i loved her dearly i started at once almost in despair but still with something of hopewith a shade of hopethat i might put myself in the way of enabling her to become my wife i did not desert her  very well then you came back and found her engaged to be my wife you had it from her own mouth when a gentleman hears that what has he to do but to go away  there are circumstances here  what does she say herself there are no circumstances to justify you if you would come here as a friend i offered to receive you as you had been known to her i did not turn my back upon you but now your conduct is so peculiar that i cannot ask you to remain here any longer they were walking up and down the long walk and now mr whittlestaff stood still as though to declare his intention that the interview should be considered as over  i know that you wish me to go away said gordon  well yes unless you withdraw all idea of a claim to the young ladys hand  but i think you should first hear what i have to say you will not surely have done your duty by her unless you hear me  you can speak if you wish to speak said mr whittlestaff  it was not till yesterday that you made your proposition to miss lawrie  what has that to do with it  had i come on the previous day and had i been able then to tell her all that i can tell her now would it have made no difference  did she say so asked the fortunate lover but in a very angry tone  no she did not say so it was with difficulty that i forced from her an avowal that her engagement was so recent but she did confess that it was so and she confessed not in words but in her manner that she had found it impossible to refuse to you the request that you had asked  i never heard a man assert so impudently that he was the sole owner of a ladys favours upon my word i think that you are the vainest man whom i ever met  let it be so i do not care to defend myself but only her whether i am vain or not is it not true that which i say i put it to you as man to man whether you do not know that it is true if you marry this girl will you not marry one whose heart belongs to me will you not marry one of whom you knew two days since that her heart was mine will you not marry one who if she was free this moment would give herself to me without a pang of remorse  i never heard anything like the mans vanity  but is it true whatever may be my vanity or selfseeking or unmanliness if you will is not what i say gods truth it is not about my weaknesses or your weaknesses that we should speak but about her happiness  just so i dont think she would be happy with you  then it is to save her from me that you are marrying herso that she may not sink into the abyss of my unworthiness  partly that  but if i had come two days since when she would have received me with open arms  you have no right to make such a statement  i ask yourself whether it is not true she would have received me with open arms and would you then have dared as her guardian to bid her refuse the offer made to her when you had learned as you would have done that she loved me that i had loved her with all my heart before i left england that i had left it with the view of enabling myself to marry her that i had been wonderfully successful that i had come back with no other hope in the world than that of giving it all to her that i had been able to show you my whole life so that no girl need be afraid to become my wife  what do i know about your life you may have another wife living at this moment  no doubt i may be guilty of any amount of villainy but then as her friend you should make inquiry you would not break a girls heart because the man to whom she is attached may possibly be a rogue in this case you have no ground for the suspicion  i never heard of a man who spoke of himself so grandiloquently  but there is ample reason why you should make inquiry in truth as i said before it is her happiness and not mine nor your own that you should look to if she has taken your offer because you had been good to her in her desolationbecause she had found herself unable to refuse aught to one who had treated her so well if she had done all this believing that i had disappeared from her knowledge and doubting altogether my return if it be soand you know that it is sothen you should hesitate before you lead her to her doom  you heard her say that i was not to believe any of these things unless i got them from her own mouth  i did and her word should go for nothing either with you or with me she has promised and is willing to sacrifice herself to her promise she will sacrifice me too because of your goodnessand because she is utterly unable to put a fair value upon herself to me she is all the world from the first hour in which i saw her to the present the idea of gaining her has been everything put aside the words which she just spoke what is your belief of the state of her wishes  i can tell you my belief of the state of her welfare  there your own prejudice creeps in and i might retaliate by charging you with vanity as you have done meonly that i think such vanity very natural but it is her you should consult on such a matter she is not to be treated like a child of whom does she wish to become the wife i boldly say that i have won her love and that if it be so you should not desire to take her to yourself you have not answered me nor can i expect you to answer me but look into yourself and answer it there think how it will be with you when the girl who lies upon your shoulder shall be thinking ever of some other man from whom you have robbed her goodbye mr whittlestaff i do not doubt but that you will turn it all over in your thoughts then he escaped by a wicketgate into the road at the far end of the long walk and was no more heard of at crokers hall on that day     chapter xi  mrs baggett trusts only in the funds   mr whittlestaff when he was left alone in the long walk was disturbed by many troublesome thoughts the knowledge that his housekeeper was out on the road and that her drunken disreputable husband was playing the fool for the benefit of all the idlers that had sauntered out from alresford to see him added something to his grief why should not the stupid woman remain indoors and allow him her master to send for the police she had declared that she would go with her husband and he could not violently prevent her this was not much when added to the weight of his care as to mary lawrie but it seemed to be the last ounce destined to break the horses back as is the proverbial fate of all last ounces  just as he was about to collect his thoughts so as to resolve what it might be his duty to do in regard to mary mrs baggett appeared before him on the walk with her bonnet on her head what are you going to do you stupid woman  i am agoing with he she said in the midst of a torrent of sobs and tears its a dooty they says if you does your dooty all will come right in the end it may be but i dont see it no further than taking him back to portsmouth  what on earth are you going to portsmouth for now and why why now hes not more drunk than he has been before nor yet less abominable let the police lock him up for the night and send him back to portsmouth in the morning why should you want to go with him now  because youre going to take a missus said mrs baggett still sobbing  its more than i know or you know or anyone knows and mr whittlestaff spoke as though he had nearly reduced himself to his housekeepers position  not marry her she exclaimed  i cannot say if you will let me alone to manage my own affairs it will be best  that man has been here interfering you dont mean to say that youre going to be put upon by such a savage as that as has just come home from south africa diamonds indeed id diamond him i dont believe not in a single diamond theyre all rubbish and paste if youre going to give her up to that fellow youre not the gentleman i take you for  but if i dont marry you wont have to go he said unable to refrain from so selfevident an argument  me going whats me going whats me or that drunken old reprobate out there to the likes of you id stay only if it was to see that mr john gordon isnt let to put his foot here in this house and then id go john gordon indeed to come up between you and her when you had settled your mind and she had settled hern if she favours john gordon ill tear her best frock off her back  how dare you speak in that way of the lady who is to be your mistress  she aint to be my mistress i wont have no mistress when her time is come i shall be in the poorhouse at portsmouth because i shant be able to earn a penny to buy gin for him as she said this mrs baggett sobbed bitterly  youre enough to drive a man mad i dont know what it is you want or you dont want  i wishes to see miss lawrie do her dooty and become your wife as a lady should do you wishes it and she ought to wish it too drat her if she is going back from her word  she is not going back from her word nothing is more excellent nothing more true nothing more trustworthy than miss lawrie you should not allow yourself to speak of her in such language  is it you then as is going back  i do not know to tell the truth mrs baggett i do not know  then let me tell you sir im an old woman whom youve known all your life pretty nigh and you can trust me dont give up to none of em youve got her word and keep her to it whats the good o your fine feelings if youre to break your heart you means well by her and will make her happy can you say as much for him when them diamonds is gone whats to come next i aint no trust in diamonds not to live out of but only in the funds which is reglar i wouldnt let her see john gordon againnever till she was mrs whittlestaff after that shell never go astray nor yet wont her thoughts  god bless you mrs baggett he said  shes one of them when shes your own shell remain your own all out shell stand the washing im an old woman and i knows em  and yet you cannot live with such a lady as her  no if she was one of them nambypambys asd let an old woman keep her old place it might do  she shall love you always for what you said just now  love me i dont doubt her loving me shell love me because she is lovingnot that i am lovable shell want to do amost everything about the house and i shall want the same and her wants are to stand uppermostthat is if she is to be mrs whittlestaff  i do not know i have to think about it  dont think about it no more but just go in and do it dont have no more words with him nor yet with hernor yet with yourself let it come on just as though it were fixed by fate its in your own hands now sir and dont you be thinking of being too goodnatured there aint no good comes from it a man may maunder away his mind in softnesses till he aint worth nothing and dont do no good to no one you can give her bread to eat and clothes to wear and can make her respectable before all men and women what has he to say only that he is twenty years younger than you love rot it i suppose youll come in just now sir and see my boxes when theyre ready to start so saying she turned round sharply on the path and left him  in spite of the excellent advice which mr whittlestaff had received from his housekeeper bidding him not have any more words even with himself on the matter he could not but think of all the arguments which john gordon had used to him according to mrs baggett he ought to content himself with knowing that he could find food and raiment and shelter for his intended wife and also in feeling that he had her promise and her assurance that that promise should be respected there was to him a very rock in all this upon which he could build his house with absolute safety and he did not believe of her that were he so to act she would turn round upon him with future tears or neglect her duty because she was ever thinking of john gordon he knew that she would be too steadfast for all that and that even though there might be some sorrow at her heart it would be well kept down out of his sight out of the sight of the world at large and would gradually sink out of her own sight too but if it be given to a man to maunder away his mind in softnesses he cannot live otherwise than as nature has made him such a man must maunder mrs baggett had understood accurately the nature of his character but had not understood that as was his character so must he act he could not alter his own self he could not turn round upon himself and bid himself be other than he was it is necessary to be stern and cruel and determined a man shall say to himself in this particular emergency of my life i will be stern and cruel general good will come out of such a line of conduct but unless he be stern and cruel in other matters alsounless he has been born stern and cruel or has so trained himselfhe cannot be stern and cruel for that occasion only all this mr whittlestaff knew of himself as sure as he was there thinking over john gordon and mary lawrie would he maunder away his mind in softnesses he feared it of himself was sure of it of himself and hated himself because it was so  he did acknowledge to himself the truth of the position as asserted by john gordon had the man come but a day earlier he would have been in time to say the first word and then as mr whittlestaff said to himself there would not for him have been a chance and in such case there would have been no reason as far as mr whittlestaff could see why john gordon should be treated other than as a happy lover it was the one day in advance which had given him the strength of his position but it was the one day also which had made him weak he had thought much about mary for some time past he had told himself that by her means might be procured some cure to the wound in his heart which had made his life miserable for so many years but had john gordon come in time the past misery would only have been prolonged and none would have been the wiser even mrs baggett would have held her peace and not thrown it in his teeth that he had attempted to marry the girl and had failed as it was all the world of alresford would know how it had been with him and all the world of alresford as they looked at him would tell themselves that this was the man who had attempted to marry mary lawrie and had failed  it was all trueall that john gordon alleged on his own behalf but then he was able to salve his own conscience by telling himself that when john gordon had run through his diamonds there would be nothing but poverty and distress there was no reason for supposing that the diamonds would be especially shortlived or that john gordon would probably be a spendthrift but diamonds as a source of income are volatilenot trustworthy as were the funds to mrs baggett and then the nature of the source of income offered enabled him to say so much as a plea to himself could he give the girl to a man who had nothing but diamonds with which to pay his weekly bills he did tell himself again and again that mary lawrie should not be encouraged to put her faith in diamonds but he felt that it was only an excuse in arguing the matter backwards and forwards he could not but tell himself that he did believe in john gordon  and then an idea a grand idea but one very painful in its beauty crept into his mind even though these diamonds should melt away and become as nothing there was his own income fixed and sure as the polar star in the consolidated british three per cents if he really loved this girl could he not protect her from poverty even were she married to a john gordon broken down in the article of his diamonds if he loved her was he not bound by some rule of chivalry which he could not define even to himself to do the best he could for her happiness he loved her so well that he thought that for her sake he could abolish himself let her have his money his house and his horses let her even have john gordon he could with a certain feeling of delight imagine it all but then he could not abolish himself there he would be subject to the remarks of men there is he men would say of him who has maundered away his mind in softnesseswho in his life has loved two girls and has at last been thrown over by both of them because he has been no better than a soft maundering idiot it would be thus that his neighbours would speak of him in his vain effort to abolish himself  it was not yet too late he had not yielded an inch to this man he could still be stern and unbending he felt proud of himself in that he had been stern and unbending as far as the man was concerned and as regarded mary he did feel sure of her if there was to be weakness displayed it would be in himself mary would be true to her promisetrue to her faith true to the arrangement made for her own life she would not provoke him with arguments as to her love for john gordon and as mrs baggett had assured him even in her thoughts she would not go astray if it were but for that word mrs baggett should not be allowed to leave his house  but what as to marys love any such question was maunderingly soft it was not for him to ask it he did believe in her altogether and was perfectly secure that his name and his honour were safe in her hands and she certainly would learn to love him shell stand the washing he said to himself repeating another morsel of mrs baggetts wisdom and thus he made up his mind that he would on this occasion if only on this occasion be stern and cruel surely a man could bring himself to sternness and cruelty for once in his life when so much depended on it  having so resolved he walked back into the house intending to see mary lawrie and so to speak to her as to give her no idea of the conversation which had taken place between him and john gordon it would not be necessary he thought that he should mention to her john gordons name any more let his marriage go on as though there were no such person as john gordon it would be easier to be stern and cruel when he could enact the character simply by silence he would hurry on his wedding as quickly as she would allow him and then the good thingthe good that was to come out of sternness and crueltywould be achieved  he went through from the library to knock at marys door and in doing so had to pass the room in which mrs baggett had slept tranquilly for fifteen years there in the doorway was a big trunk and in the lock of the door was a key a brilliant idea at once occurred to mr whittlestaff he shoved the big box in with his foot locked the door and put the key in his pocket at that moment the heads of the gardener and the groom appeared up the back staircase and after them mrs baggett  why mrs baggett the door is locked said the gardener  it is to be sure said the groom why mrs baggett you must have the key in your own pocket  i aint got no such thing do you bring the box down with you  i have got the key in my pocket said mr whittlestaff in a voice of much authority you may both go down mrs baggetts box is not to be taken out of that room today  not taken out oh mr whittlestaff why the porter is here with his barrow to take it down to the station  then the porter must have a shilling and go back again empty and so he stalked on to bid miss lawrie come to him in the library  i never heard of such a go in all my lifeand he means it too said thornybush the gardener  i never quite know what he means said hayonotes the groom but hes always in earnest whatever it is i never see one like the master for being in earnest but hes too deep for me in his meaning i suppose we is only got to go back so they retreated down the stairs leaving mrs baggett weeping in the passage  you should let a poor old woman have her box she said whining to her master whom she followed to the library  no i wont you shant have your box youre an old fool  i know im an old foolbut i ought to have my box  you wont have it you may just go down and get your dinner when you want to go to bed you shall have the key  i ought to have my box miss mary its my own box what am i to do with baggett they have given him more gin out there and hes as drunk as a beast i think i ought to have my own box shall i tell thornybush as he may come back the trainll be gone and then what am i to do with baggett hell get hisself that drunk you wont be able to stir him and it is my own box mr whittlestaff  to all which mr whittlestaff turned a deaf ear she should find that there was no maundering softness with him now he felt within his own bosom that it behoved him to learn to become stern and cruel he knew that the key was in his pocket and found that there was a certain satisfaction in being stern and cruel mrs baggett might sob her heart out after her box and he would decline to be moved  whatll i do about baggett sir said the poor woman coming back hes a lying there at the gate and the perlice doesnt like to touch him because of you sir he says as how if you could take him into the stables hed sleep it off among the straw but then hed be just as bad after this first go tomorrow  to this however mr whittlestaff at once acceded he saw a way out of the immediate difficulty he therefore called hayonotes to him and succeeded in explaining his immediate meaning hayonotes and the policeman between them lifted baggett and deposited the man in an empty stall where he was accommodated with ample straw and an order was given that as soon as he had come to himself he should be provided with something to eat  summat to eat said mrs baggett in extreme disgust provide him with a lockup and plenty of cold water     chapter xii  mr blakes good news   in the afternoon after lunch had been eaten there came a ring at the backdoor and mr montagu blake was announced there had been a little contretemps or misadventure it was mr blakes habit when he called at crokers hall to ride his horse into the yard there to give him up to hayonotes and make his way in by the back entrance on this occasion hayonotes had been considerably disturbed in his work and was discussing the sad condition of mr baggett with thornybush over the gate of the kitchengarden consequently mr blake had taken his own horse into the stable and as he was about to lead the beast up to the stall had been stopped and confused by sergeant baggetts protruding wooden leg  alloa whats up now said a voice addressing mr blake from under the straw do you go down old chap and get us threepennorth of cream o the valley from the cock  then mr blake had been aware that this prior visitor was not in a condition to be of much use to him and tied up his own horse in another stall but on entering the house mr blake announced the fact of there being a stranger in the stables and suggested that the onelegged gentleman had been looking at somebody taking a glass of gin then mrs baggett burst out into a loud screech of agony the nasty drunken beast he ought to be locked up into the darkest hole theyve got in all alresford  but who is the gentleman said mr blake  my husband sir i wont deny him he is the cross as i have to carry and precious heavy he is you must have heard of sergeant baggettthe most drunkenest beastliest idlest scoundrel as ever the queen had in the army and the most difficultest for a woman to put up with in the way of a husband let a woman be ever so decent hed drink her gowns and her petticoats down to her very underclothing how would you like sir to have to take up with such a beast as that after living all your life as comfortable as any lady in the land wouldnt that be a comedown mr blake and then to have your box locked up and be told that the key of your bedroom door is in the masters pocket thus mrs baggett continued to bewail her destiny  mr blake having got rid of the old woman and bethinking himself of the disagreeable incidents to which a gentleman with a larger establishment than his own might be liable made his way into the sittingroom where he found mary lawrie alone and having apologised for the manner of his intrusion and having said something intended to be jocose as to the legs of the warrior in the stable at once asked a question as to john gordon  mr gordon said mary he was here this morning with mr whittlestaff but i know nothing of him since  he hasnt gone back to london  i dont know where he has gone he slept in alresford last night but i know nothing of him since  he sent his bag by the boy at the inn down to the railway station when he came up here i found his bag there but heard nothing of him they told me at the inn that he was to come up here and i thought i should either find him here or meet him on the road  do you want to find him especially  well yes  do you know mr gordon  well yes i do that is to say he dined with me last night we were at oxford together and yesterday evening we got talking about our adventures since  he told you that he had been at the diamondfields  oh yes i know all about the diamondfields but mr hall particularly wants to see him up at the park mr hall was the squire with four daughters who lived at little alresford mr hall says that he knew his father many years ago and sent me out to look for him i shall be wretched if he goes away without coming to little alresford house he cant go back to london before four oclock because there is no train you know nothing about his movements  nothing at all for some years past mr gordon has been altogether a stranger to me mr blake looked into her face and was aware that there was something to distress her he at once gathered from her countenance that mr whittlestaff had been like the dog that stuck to his bone and that john gordon was like the other dogthe disappointed oneand had been turned out from the neighbourhood of the kennel i should imagine that mr gordon has gone away if not to london then in some other direction it was clear that the young lady intended him to understand that she could say nothing and knew nothing as to mr gordons movements  i suppose i must go down to the station and leave word for him there said mr blake miss lawrie only shook her head mr hall will be very sorry to miss him and then i have some special good news to tell him  special good news could it be that something had happened which would induce mr whittlestaff to change his mind that was the one subject which to her at the present moment was capable of meaning specially good tidings  yes indeed miss lawrie double good news i may say old mr harbottle has gone at last at san remo mary did know who mr harbottle wasor had been mr harbottle had been the vicar at little alresford for whose death mr blake was waiting in order that he might enter in together upon the good things of matrimony and the living he was a man so contented and talked so frequently of the good things which fortune was to do for him that the tidings of his luck had reached even the ears of mary lawrie thats an odd way of putting it of course continued mr blake but then he was quite old and very asthmatic and couldnt ever come back again of course im very sorry for himin one way but then im very glad in another it is a good thing to have the house in my own hands so as to begin to paint at once ready for her coming her father wouldnt let her be married till i had got the living and i think he was right because i shouldnt have liked to spend money in painting and such like on an uncertainty as the old gentleman had to die why shouldnt i tell the truth of course i am glad though it does sound so terrible  but what are the double good news  oh i didnt tell you miss forrester is to come to the park she is not coming because mr harbottle is dead thats only a coincidence we are not going to be married quite at oncestraight off the reel you know i shall have to go to winchester for that but now that old harbottle has gone ill get the day fixed you see if i dont but i must really be off miss lawrie mr hall will be terribly vexed if i dont find gordon and theres no knowing where he may go whilst im talking here then he made his adieux but returned before he had shut the door after him you couldnt send somebody with me miss lawrie i shall be afraid of that woodenlegged man in the stables for fear he should get up and abuse me he asked me to get him some ginwhich was quite unreasonable but on being assured that he would find the groom about the place he went out and the trot of his horse was soon heard upon the road  he did succeed in finding john gordon who was listlessly waiting at the claimants arms for the coming of the four oclock train which was to take him back to london on his way as he told himself to the diamondfields he had thrown all his heart all the energy of which he was the master into the manner in which he had pleaded for himself and for mary with mr whittlestaff but he felt the weakness of his position in that he could not remain present upon the ground and see the working of his words having said what he had to say he could only go and it was not to be expected that the eloquence of an absent man of one who had declared that he was about to start for south africa should be regarded he knew that what he had said was true and that being true it ought to prevail but having declared it there was nothing for him to do but to go away he could not see mary herself again nor if he did so would she be so likely to yield to him as was mr whittlestaff he could have no further excuse for addressing himself to the girl who was about to become the wife of another man therefore he sat restless idle and miserable in the little parlour at the claimants arms thinking that the long journey which he had made had been taken all in vain and that there was nothing left for him in the world but to return to kimberley and add more diamonds to his stockintrade  oh gordon said blake bursting into the room youre the very man i want to find you cant go back to london today  cant i  quite out of the question mr hall knew your father intimately when you were only a little chap  will that prevent my going back to london  certainly it will he wants to renew the acquaintance he is a most hospitable kindhearted man and who knows one of the four daughters might do yet  who is mr hall no doubt he had heard the name on the previous evening but hall is common and had been forgotten  who is mr hall why he is the squire of little alresford and my patron i forget you havent heard that mr harbottle is dead at last of course i am very sorry for the old gentleman in one sense but it is such a blessing in another im only just thirty and its a grand thing my tumbling into the living in this way  i neednt go back because mr harbottle is dead  but kattie forrester is coming to the park i told you last night but i daresay youve forgotten it and i couldnt tell then that mr hall was acquainted with you or that he would be so anxious to be hospitable he says that im to tell you to take your bag up to the house at once there never was anything more civil than that of course i let him know that we had been at oxford together that does go for something  the university and your society together suggested gordon  dont chaff because im in earnest kattie forrester will be in by the very train that was to take you on to london and im to wait and put her into mr halls carriage one of the daughters i dont doubt will be there and you can wait and see her if you like it if youll get your bag ready the coachman will take it with katties luggage theres the park carriage coming down the street now ill go out and stop old steadypace the coachman only dont you keep him long because i shouldnt like kattie to find that there was no one to look after her at the station  there seemed to be an opening in all this for john gordon to remain at any rate a day longer in the neighbourhood of mary lawrie and he determined that he would avail himself of the opportunity he therefore together with his friend blake saw the coachman and gave instructions as to finding the bag at the station and prepared himself to walk out to the park you can go down to the station he said to blake and can ride back with the carriage  of course i shall see you up at the house said blake indeed ive been asked to stay there whilst kattie is with them nothing can be more hospitable than mr hall and his four daughters id give you some advice only i really dont know which youd like the best there is a sort of similarity about them but that wears off when you come to know them i have heard people say that the two eldest are very much alike if that be so perhaps youll like the third the best the third is the nicest as her hair may be a shade darker than the others i really must be off now as i wouldnt for worlds that the train should come in before im on the platform with that he went into the yard and at once trotted off on his cob  gordon paid his bill and started on his walk to little alresford park looking back into his early memories he could just remember to have heard his father speak of mr hall but that was all his father was now dead and certainly he thought had not mentioned the name for many years but the invitation was civil and as he was to remain in the neighbourhood it might be that he should again have an opportunity of seeing mary lawrie or mr whittlestaff he found that little alresford park lay between the town and mr blakes church so that he was at the gate sooner than he expected he went in and having time on his hands deviated from the road and went up a hill which was indeed one of the downs though between the park paling here he saw deer feeding and he came after a while to a beech grove he had now gone down the hill on the other side and found himself close to as pretty a labourers cottage as he remembered ever to have seen it was still june and it was hot and he had been on his legs nearly the whole morning then he began to talk or rather to think to himself what a happy fellow is that man montagu blake he has every thingnot that he wants but that he thinks that he wants the work of his life is merely play he is going to marry a wifenot who is but whom he thinks to be perfection he looks as though he were never ill a day in his life how would he do if he were grubbing for diamonds amidst the mud and dust of kimberley instead of that he can throw himself down on such a spot as this and meditate his sermon among the beechtrees then he began to think whether the sermon could be made to have some flavour of the beechtrees and how much better in that case it would be and as he so thought he fell asleep  he had not been asleep very long perhaps not five minutes when he became aware in his slumbers that an old man was standing over him one does thus become conscious of things before the moment of waking has arrived so positively as to give to the sleeper a false sense of the reality of existence i wonder whether you can be mr gordon said the old man  but i am said gordon i wonder how you know me  because i expect you there was something very mysterious in thiswhich however lost all mystery as soon as he was sufficiently awake to think of things you are mr blakes friend  yes i am mr blakes friend  and i am mr hall i didnt expect to find you sleeping here in gar wood but when i find a strange gentleman asleep in gar wood i put two and two together and conclude that you must be mr gordon  its the prettiest place in all the world i think  yes we are rather proud of gar woodespecially when the deer are browsing on the hillside to the left as they are now if you dont want to go to sleep again well walk up to the house theres the carriage i can hear the wheels the girls have gone down to fetch your friends bride mr blake is very fond of his brideas i dare say you have found out  then as the two walked together to the house mr hall explained that there had been some little difference in years gone by between old mr gordon and himself as to money i was very sorry but i had to look after myself you knew nothing about it i dare say  i have heard your namethats all  i need not say anything more about it said mr hall only when i heard that you were in the country i was very glad to have the opportunity of seeing you blake tells me that you know my friend whittlestaff  i did not know him till yesterday morning  then you know the young lady there a charming young lady she is my girls are extremely fond of mary lawrie i hope we may get them to come over while you are staying here  i can only remain one nightor at the most two mr hall  pooh pooh we have other places in the neighbourhood to show you quite as pretty as gar wood though thats a bounce i dont think there is any morsel quite so choice as gar wood when the deer are there what an eye you must have mr gordon to have made it out by yourself at once but then after all it only put you to sleep i wonder whether the rookery will put you to sleep we go in this way so as to escape the formality of the front door and ill introduce you to my daughters and miss forrester     volume ii  chapter xiii  at little alresford   mr hall was a pleasant english gentleman now verging upon seventy years of age who had never had a headache in his life as he was wont to boast but who lived very carefully as one who did not intend to have many headaches he certainly did not intend to make his head ache by the cares of the work of the world he was very well offthat is to say that with so many thousands a year he managed to live upon half this he had done for very many years because the estate was entailed on a distant relative and because he had not chosen to leave his children paupers when the girls came he immediately resolved that he would never go up to londonand kept his resolve not above once in three or four years was it supposed to be necessary that he showed his head to a london hairdresser he was quite content to have a practitioner out from alresford and to pay him one shilling including the journey his tenants in these bad times had always paid their rents but they had done so because their rents had not been raised since the squire had come to the throne mr hall knew well that if he was anxious to save himself from headaches in that line he had better let his lands on easy terms he was very hospitable but he never gave turtle from london or fish from southampton or strawberries or peas on the first of april he could give a dinner without champagne and thought forty shillings a dozen price enough for port or sherry or even claret he kept a carriage for his four daughters and did not tell all the world that the horses spent a fair proportion of their time at the plough the four daughters had two saddlehorses between them and the father had another for his own use he did not huntand living in that part of hampshire i think he was right he did shoot after the manner of our forefatherswould go out for instance with mr blake and perhaps mr whittlestaff and would bring home three pheasants four partridges a hare and any quantity of rabbits that the cook might have ordered he was a man determined on no account to live beyond his means and was not very anxious to seem to be rich he was a man of no strong affections or peculiarly generous feelings those who knew him and did not like him said that he was selfish they who were partial to him declared that he never owed a shilling that he could not pay and that his daughters were very happy in having such a father he was a goodlooking man with wellformed features but one whom you had to see often before you could remember him and as i have said before he never had a headache in his life when your father wasnt doing quite so well with the bank as his friends wished he asked me to do something for him well i didnt see my way  i was a boy then and i heard nothing of my fathers business  i dare say not but i cannot help telling you he thought i was unkind i thought that he would go on from one trouble to anotherand he did he quarrelled with me and for years we never spoke indeed i never saw him again but for the sake of old friendship i am very glad to meet you this he said as he was walking across the hall to the drawingroom  there gordon met the young ladies with the clergyman and had to undergo the necessary introductions he thought that he could perceive at once that his story as it regarded mary lawrie had been told to all of them gordon was quick and could learn from the manners of his companions what had been said about him and could perceive that they were aware of something of his story blake had no such quickness and could attribute none of it to another i am very proud to have the pleasure of making you acquainted with these five young ladies as he said this he had just paused in his narrative of mr whittlestaffs love and was certain that he had changed the conversation with great effect but the young ladies were unable not to look as young ladies would have looked when hearing the story of an unfortunate gentlemans love and mr blake would certainly have been unable to keep such a secret  this is miss hall and this is miss augusta hall said the father people do think that they are alike  oh papa what nonsense you neednt tell mr gordon that  no doubt he would find it out without telling continued the father  i cant see it for the life of me said mr blake he evidently thought that civility demanded such an assertion mr gordon looking at the two young ladies felt that he would never know them apart though he might live in the house for a year  evelina is the third continued mr hall pointing out the one whom mr blake had specially recommended to his friends notice evelina is not quite so like but shes like too  papa what nonsense you do talk said evelina  and this is mary mary considers herself to be quite the hope of the family spem gregis ha ha  what does spem gregis mean im sure i dont know said mary the four young ladies were about thirty varying up from thirty to thirtyfive they were fairhaired healthy young women with good commonsense not beautiful though very like their father  and now i must introduce you to miss forresterkattie forrester said mr blake who was beginning to think that his own young lady was being left out in the cold  yes indeed said mr hall as i had begun with my own i was obliged to go on to the end miss forrestermr gordon miss forrester is a young lady whose promotion has been fixed in the world  mr hall how can you do me so much injury as to say that you take away from me the chance of changing my mind  yes said the oldest miss hall and mr gordon the possibility of changing his mr gordon what a sad thing it is that mr harbottle should never have had an opportunity of seeing his old parish once again  i never knew him said gordon  but he had been here nearly fifty years and then to leave the parish without seeing it any more its very sad when you look at it in that light  he has never resided here permanently for a quarter of a century said mr blake  off and on in the summer time said augusta of course he could not take much of the duty because he had a clergymans throat i think it a great pity that he should have gone off so suddenly  miss forrester wont wish to have his resurgam sung i warrant you said mr hall  i dont know much about resurgams said the young lady but i dont see why the parish shall not be just as well in mr blakes hands then the young bride was taken away by the four elder ladies to dress and the gentlemen followed them half an hour afterwards  they were all very kind to him and sitting after dinner mr hall suggested that mr whittlestaff and miss lawrie should be asked over to dine on the next day john gordon had already promised to stay until the third and had made known his intention of going back to south africa as soon as he could arrange matters ive got nothing to keep me here he said and as there is a good deal of money at stake i should be glad to be there as soon as possible  oh come i dont know about your having nothing to keep you here said blake but as to mr halls proposition regarding the inhabitants of crokers lodge gordon said nothing he could not object to the guests whom a gentleman might ask to his own house but he thought it improbable that either mr whittlestaff or mary should come if he chose to appear and to bring her with him it must be his own lookout at any rate he gordon could say and could do nothing on such an occasion he had been betrayed into telling his secret to this garrulous young parson there was no help for spilt milk but it was not probable that mr blake would go any further and he at any rate must be content to bear the mans society for one other evening i dont see why you shouldnt manage to make things pleasant even yet said the parson but to this john gordon made no reply  in the evening some of the sisters played a few pieces at the piano and miss forrester sang a few songs mr hall in the meantime went fast asleep john gordon couldnt but tell himself that his evenings at kimberley were as a rule quite as exciting but then kattie forrester did not belong to him and he had not found himself able as yet to make a choice between the young ladies it was however interesting to see the manner in which the new vicar hung about the lady of his love and the evident but innocent pride with which she accepted the attentions of her admirer  dont you think shes a beautiful girl said blake coming to gordons room after they had all retired to bed such genuine wit and so bright and her singing you know is quite perfectabsolutely just what it ought to be i do know something about singing myself because ive had all the parish voices under my own charge for the last three years a practice like that goes a long way you know to this mr gordon could only give that assent which silence is intended to imply shell have £5000 at once you know which does make her in a manner equal to either of the miss halls i dont quite know what theyll have but not more than that i should think the property is entailed and hes a saving man but if he can have put by £20000 he has done very well dont you think so  very well indeed  i suppose i might have had one of them i dont mind telling you in strictest confidence but goodness gracious after i had once seen kattie forrester there was no longer a doubt i wish youd tell me what you think about her  about miss forrester  you neednt mind speaking quite openly to me im that sort of fellow that i shouldnt mind what any fellow said ive formed my own ideas and am not likely to change them but i should like to hear you know how she strikes a fellow who has been at the diamondfields i cannot imagine but that you must have a different idea about women to what we have then mr blake sat himself down in an armchair at the foot of the bed and prepared himself to discuss the opinion which he did not doubt that his friend was about to deliver  a very nice young woman indeed said john gordon who was anxious to go to bed  ah you knowthats a kind of thing that anybody can say there is no real friendship in that i want to know the true candid opinion of a man who has travelled about the world and has been at the diamondfields it isnt everybody who has been at the diamondfields continued he thinking that he might thereby flatter his friend  no not everybody i suppose a young woman is the same there as here if she have the same natural gifts miss forrester would be pretty anywhere  thats a matter of course any fellow can see that with half an eye absolutely beautiful i should say rather than pretty  just so its only a variation in terms you know  but then her manner her music her language her wit and the colour of her hair when i remember it all i think im the luckiest fellow in the world i shall be a deal happier with her than with augusta hall dont you think so augusta was the one intended for me but bless you i couldnt look at her after i had seen kattie forrester i dont think youve given me your true unbiassed opinion yet  indeed i have said john gordon  well i should be more freespoken than that if you were to ask me about mary lawrie but then of course mary lawrie is not your engaged one it does make a difference if it does turn out that she marries mr whittlestaff i shant think much of her i can tell you that as it is as far as looks are concerned you cant compare her to my kattie  comparisons are odious said gordon  well yes when you are sure to get the worst of them you wouldnt think comparisons odious if you were going to marry kattie and it was my lot to have mary lawrie well yes i dont mind going to bed now as you have owned so much as that  of all the fools said gordon to himself as he went to his own chamberof all the fools who were ever turned out in the world to earn their own bread he is the most utterly foolish yet he will earn his bread and will come to no especial grief in the work if he were to go out to kimberley no one would pay him a guinea aweek but he will perform the high work of a clergyman of the church of england indifferently well  on the next morning a messenger was sent over to crokers hall and came back after due lapse of time with an answer to the effect that mr whittlestaff and miss lawrie would have pleasure in dining that day at little alresford park thats right said mr blake to the lady of his love we shall now perhaps be able to put the thing into a proper groove im always very lucky in managing such matters not that i think that gordon cares very much about the young lady judging from what he says of her  then i dont see why you should interest yourself  for the young ladys sake a lady always prefers a young gentleman to an old one only think what youd feel if you were married to mr whittlestaff  oh montagu how can you talk such nonsense  i dont suppose you ever would because you are not one of those sort of young ladies i dont suppose that mary lawrie likes it herself and therefore id break the match off in a moment if i could thats what i call goodnatured  after lunch they all went off to the rookery which was at the other side of the park from gar wood it was a beautiful spot lying at the end of the valley through which they had to get out from their carriage and to walk for half a mile only for the sake of doing honour to miss forrester they would have gone on foot but as it was they had all the six horses among them mr gordon was put up on one of the young ladies steeds the squire and the parson each had his own and miss evelina was also mounted as mr blake had suggested perhaps with the view to the capture of mr gordon as its your first day whispered mr blake to kattie it is so nice i think that the carriage and horses should all come out of course there is nothing in the distance but there should be a respect shown on such an occasion mr hall does do everything of this kind just as it should be  i suppose you know the young lady who is coming here tonight said evelina to mr gordon  oh yes i knew her before i went abroad  but not mr whittlestaff  i had never met mr whittlestaff though i had heard much of his goodness  and now they are to be married does it not seem to you to be very hard  not in the least the young lady seems to have been left by her father and stepmother without any engagement and indeed without any provision she was brought here in the first place from sheer charity and i can certainly understand that when she was here mr whittlestaff should have admired her  thats a matter of course said evelina  mr whittlestaff is not at all too old to fall in love with any young lady this is a pretty placea very lovely spot i think i like it almost better than gar wood then there was no more said about mary lawrie till they all rode back to dinner     chapter xiv  mr whittlestaff is going out to dinner   theres an invitation come asking us to dine at little alresford today this was said soon after breakfast by mr whittlestaff to mary lawrie on the day after mr gordons coming i think well go  could you not leave me behind  by no means i want you to become intimate with the girls who are good girls  but mr gordon is there  exactly that is just what i want it will be better that you and he should meet each other without the necessity of making a scene from this it may be understood that mr whittlestaff had explained to mary as much as he had thought necessary of what had occurred between him and john gordon and that marys answers had been satisfactory to his feelings mary had told him that she was contented with her lot in life as mr whittlestaff had proposed it for her she had not been enthusiastic but then he had not expected it she had not assured him that she would forget john gordon he had not asked her she had simply said that if he were satisfiedso was she i think that with me dearest at any rate you will be safe i am quite sure that i shall be safe she had answered and that had been sufficient  but the reader will also understand from this that he had sought for no answer to those burning questions which john gordon had put to him had she loved john gordon the longest did she love him the best there was no doubt a certain cautious selfishness in the way in which he had gone to work and yet of general selfishness it was impossible to accuse him he was willing to give her everythingto do all for her and he had first asked her to be his wife with every observance and then he could always protect himself on the plea that he was doing the best he could for her his property was assuredin the three per cents as mrs baggett had suggested whereas john gordons was all in diamonds how frequently do diamonds melt and come to nothing they are things which a man can carry in his pocket and lose or give away they cannotso thought mr whittlestaffbe settled in the hands of trustees or left to the charge of an executor they cannot be substantiated who can say that when looking to a ladys interest this bit of glass may not come up instead of that precious stone john gordon might be a very steady fellow but we have only his own word for thatas mr whittlestaff observed to himself there could not be a doubt but that mr whittlestaff himself was the safer staff of the two on which a young lady might lean he did make all these excuses for himself and determined that they were of such a nature that he might rely upon them with safety but still there was a pang in his bosoma silent secretwhich kept on whispering to him that he was not the best beloved he had however resolved steadfastly that he would not put that question to mary if she did not wish to declare her love neither did he it was a pity a thousand pities that it should be so a change in her heart might however take place it would come to pass that she would learn that he was the superior staff on which to lean john gordon might disappear among the diamondfields and no more be heard of he at any rate would do his best for her so that she should not repent her bargain but he was determined that the bargain as it had been struck should be carried out therefore in communicating to mary the invitation which he had received from little alresford he did not find it necessary to make any special speech in answer to her inquiry about john gordon  she understood it all and could not in her very heart pronounce a judgment against him she knew that he was doing that which he believed would be the best for her welfare she overwhelmed by the debt of her gratitude had acceded to his request and had been unable afterwards to depart from her word she had said that it should be so and she could not then turn upon him and declare that when she had given him her hand she had been unaware of the presence of her other lover there was an injustice an unkindness an ingratitude a selfishness in this which forbade her to think of it as being done by herself it was better for her that she should suffer though the suffering should be through her whole life than that he should be disappointed no doubt the man would suffer tooher hero her loverhe with whom she would so willingly have risked everything either with or without the diamonds she could not however bear to think that mr whittlestaff should be so very prudent and so very wise solely on her behalf she would go to him but for other reasons than that as she walked about the place half the day up and down the long walk she told herself that it was useless to contend with her love she did love john gordon she knew that she loved him with her whole heart she knew that she must be true to himbut still she would marry mr whittlestaff and do her duty in that state of life to which it had pleased god to call her there would be a sacrificea sacrifice of twobut still it was justice  had she not consented to take everything from mr whittlestaff her bread her meat her raiment the shelter under which she lived and the position in the world which she now enjoyed had the man come but a day earlier it would all have been well she would have told her love before mr whittlestaff had spoken of his wants circumstances had been arranged differently and she must bear it but she knew that it would be better for her that she should see john gordon no more had he started at once to london and gone thence to the diamondfields without seeing her again there would be a feeling that she had become the creature of stern necessity there would have been no hope for heras also no fear had he started a second time for south africa she would have looked upon his further return with any reference to her own wants as a thing impossible but now how would it be with her mr whittlestaff had told her with a stern indifference that she must again meet this man sit at the table with him as an old friend and be again subject to his influence it will be better that you and he should meet he had said without the necessity of making a scene how could she assure him that there would be no scene  then she thought that she would have recourse to that ordinary feminine excuse a headache but were she to do so she would own the whole truth to her master she would have declared that she so loved the man that she could not endure to be in his presence she must now let the matter pass as he had intended she must go to mr halls house and there encounter him she loved with what show of coldness she might be able to assume  but the worst of it all lay in thisthat she could not but think that he had been induced to remain in the neighbourhood in order that he might again try to gain his point she had told herself again and again that it was impossible that she must decide as she had decided and that mr whittlestaff had decided so also he had used what eloquence was within his reach and it had been all in vain he could now appeal only to herself and to such appeal there could be but one answer and how was such appeal to be made in mr halls drawingroom surely john gordon had been foolish in remaining in the neighbourhood nothing but trouble could come of it  so you are going to see this young man again this came from mrs baggett who had been in great perturbation all the morning the sergeant had slept in the stables through the night and had had his breakfast brought to him warm by his own wife but he had sat up among the straw and had winked at her and had asked her to give him threepence of gin with the catlap to this she had acceded thinking probably that she could not altogether deprive him of the food to which he was accustomed without injury then under the influence of the gin and the promise of a ticket to portsmouth which she undertook to get for him at the station he was induced to go down with her and was absolutely despatched her own box was still locked up and she had slept with one of the two maids all this had not happened without great disturbance in the household she herself was very angry with her master because of the box she was very angry with mary because mary was she thought averse to her old lover she was very angry with mr gordon because she well understood that mr gordon was anxious to disturb the arrangement which had been made for the family she was very angry with her husband not because he was generally a drunken old reprobate but because he had especially disgraced her on the present occasion by the noise which he had made in the road no doubt she had been treated unfairly in the matter of the box and could have succeeded in getting the law of her master but she could not turn against her master in that way she could give him a bit of her own mind and that she did very freely but she could not bring herself to break the lock of his door and then as things went now she did think it well that she should remain a few days longer at crokers hall the occasion of her masters marriage was to be the cause of her going away she could not endure not to be foremost among all the women at crokers hall but it was intolerable to her feelings that any one should interfere with her master and she thought that if need were she could assist him by her tongue therefore she was disposed to remain yet a few days in her old place and had come after she had got the ticket for her husbandwhich had been done before mr whittlestaffs breakfastto inform her master of her determination dont be a fool mr whittlestaff had said  im always a fool whether i go or stay so that dont much matter this had been her answer and then she had gone in to scold the maids  as soon as she had heard of the intended dinnerparty she attacked mary lawrie so youre going to see this young man again  mr whittlestaff is going to dine at little alresford and intends to take me with him  oh yes thats all very well hed have left you behind if hed been of my way of thinking mr gordon here and mr gordon there i wonder whats mr gordon he aint no better than an ordinary miner coals and diamonds is all one to meid rather have the coals for choice but mary was not in a humour to contest the matter with mrs baggett and left the old woman the mistress of the field  when the time arrived for going to the dinner mr whittlestaff took mary in the pony carriage with him there is always a groom about there he said so we need not take the boy his object was as mary in part understood that he should be able to speak what last words he might have to utter without having other ears than hers to listen to them  mary would have been surprised had she known how much painful thought mr whittlestaff gave to the matter to her it seemed as though he had made up his mind without any effort and was determined to abide by it he had thought it well to marry her and having asked her and having obtained her consent he intended to take advantage of her promise that was her idea of mr whittlestaff as to which she did not at all blame him but he was in truth changing his purpose every quarter of an houror not changing it but thinking again and again throughout the entire day whether he would not abandon himself and all his happiness to the romantic idea of making this girl supremely happy were he to do so he must give up everything the world would have nothing left for him as to which he could feel the slightest interest there came upon him at such moments insane ideas as to the amount of sacrifice which would be demanded of him she should have everythinghis house his fortune and he john gordon as being a part of her should have them also he whittlestaff would abolish himself as far as such abolition might be possible the idea of suicide was abominable to himwas wicked cowardly and inhuman but if this were to take place he could wish to cease to live then he would comfort himself by assuring himself again and again that of the two he would certainly make the better husband he was older yes it was a pity that he should be so much the elder and he knew that he was old of his agesuch a one as a girl like mary lawrie could hardly be brought to love passionately he brought up against himself all the hard facts as sternly as could any younger rival he looked at himself in the glass over and over again and always gave the verdict against his own appearance there was nothing to recommend him so he told himselfjudging of himself most unfairly he set against himself as evils little points by which marys mind and marys judgment would never be affected but in truth throughout it all he thought only of her welfare but there came upon him constantly an idea that he hardly knew how to be as good to her as he would have been had it not been for catherine bailey to have attempted twice and twice to have failed so disastrously he was a man to whom to have failed once in such a matter was almost death how should he bear it twice and still live nevertheless he did endeavour to think only of her welfare you wont find it cold my dear he said  cold why mr whittlestaff its quite hot  i meant hot i did mean to say hot  ive got my parasol  ohahyes so i perceive go on tommy that foolish old woman will settle down at last i think to this mary could make no answer because according to her ideas mrs baggetts settling down must depend on her masters marriage i think it very civil of mr hall asking us in this way  i suppose it is  because you may be sure he had heard of your former acquaintance with him  do you think so  not a doubt about it he said as much to me in his note that young clergyman of his will have told him everything percontatorem fugito nam garrulus idem est ive taught you latin enough to understand that but mary if you wish to change your mind this will be your last opportunity his heart at that moment had been very tender towards her and she had resolved that hers should be very firm to him     chapter xv  mr whittlestaff goes out to dinner   this would be her last opportunity so mary told herself as she got out of the carriage at mr halls front door it was made manifest to her by such a speech that he did not expect that she should do so but looked upon her doing so as within the verge of possibility she could still do it and yet not encounter his disgust or his horror how terrible was the importance to herself and as she believed to the other man also was she not justified in so thinking mr gordon had come home travelling a great distance at much risk to his property at great loss of time through infinite trouble and danger merely to ask her to be his wife had a letter reached her from him but a week ago bidding her to come would she not have gone through all the danger and all the trouble how willingly would she have gone it was the one thing that she desired and as far as she could understand the signs which he had given it was the one one thing which he desired he had made his appeal to that other man and as far as she could understand the signs which had reached her had been referred with confidence to her decision now she was told that the chance of changing her mind was still in her power  the matter was one of terrible importance but was its importance to mr whittlestaff as great as to john gordon she put herself altogether out of the question she acknowledged to herself with a false humility that she was nobodyshe was a poor woman living on charity and was not to be thought of when the position of these two men was taken into consideration it chanced that they both wanted her which wanted the most which of the two would want her for the longest to which would her services be of the greater avail in assisting him to his happiness could there be a doubt was it not in human nature that she should bind herself to the younger man and with him go through the world whether safely or in danger  but though she had had time to allow these questions to pass through her mind between the utterance of mr whittlestaffs words and her entrance into mr halls drawingroom she did not in truth doubt she knew that she had made up her mind on the matter mr gordon would in all probability have no opportunity of saying another word to her but let him say what word he might it should be in vain nothing that he could say nothing that she could say would avail anything if this other man would release herthen indeed she would be released but there was no chance of such release coming in truth mary did not know how near the chance was to heror rather how near the chance had been he had now positively made up his mind and would say not a word further unless she asked him if mary said nothing to john gordon on this evening he would take an opportunity before they left the house to inform mr hall of his intended marriage when once the word should have passed his mouth he could not live under the stigma of a second catherine bailey  miss lawrie pray let me make you known to my intended this came from mr montagu blake who felt himself to be justified by his peculiar circumstances in so far taking upon himself the work of introducing the guests in mr halls house of course youve heard all about it i am the happiest young man in hampshireand she is the next  speak for yourself montagu i am not a young man at all  youre a young mans darling which is the next thing to it  how are you whittlestaff said mr hall wonderful weather isnt it im told that youve been in trouble about that drunken husband which plagues the life out of that respectable housekeeper of yours  he is a trouble but if he is bad to me how much worse must he be to her  thats true he must be very bad i should think miss mary why dont you come over this fine weather and have tea with my girls and kattie forrester in the woods you should take your chance while you have a young man willing to wait upon you  i shall be quite delighted said blake and so will john gordon  only that i shall be in london this time tomorrow said gordon  thats nonsense you are not going to kimberley all at once the young ladies expect you to bring out a lot of diamonds and show them before you start have you seen his diamonds miss lawrie  indeed no said mary  i think i should have asked just to see them said evelina hall why should they join her name with his in this uncivil manner or suppose that she had any special power to induce him to show his treasures  when you first find a diamond said mr hall what do you do with it do you ring a bell and call together your friends and begin to rejoice  no indeed the diamond is generally washed out of the mud by some nigger and we have to look very sharp after him to see that he doesnt hide it under his toenails its not a very romantic kind of business from first to last  only profitable said the curate  thats as may be it is subject to greater losses than the preaching of sermons  i should like to go out and see it all said miss hall looking into miss lawries face this also appeared to mary to be illnatured  then the butler announced the dinner and they all followed mr hall and the curates bride out of one room into the other this young lady said he is supposed to be in the ascendant just at the present moment she cant be married above two or three times at the most i say this to excuse myself to miss lawrie who ought perhaps to have the post of honour to this some joking reply was made and they all sat down to their dinner miss lawrie was at mr halls left hand and at her left hand john gordon was seated mary could perceive that everything was arranged so as to throw herself and john gordon togetheras though they had some special interest in each other of all this mr whittlestaff saw nothing but john gordon did perceive something and told himself that that ass blake had been at work but his perceptions in the matter were not half as sharp as those of mary lawrie  i used to be very fond of your father gordon said mr hall when the dinner was half over its all done and gone now dear dear dear  he was an unfortunate man and perhaps expected too much from his friends  i am very glad to see his son here at any rate i wish you were not going to settle down so far away from us  kimberley is a long way off  yes indeed and when a fellow gets out there he is apt to stay i suppose  i shall do so probably i have nobody near enough to me here at home to make it likely that i shall come back  you have uncles and aunts said mr hall  one uncle and two aunts i shall suit their views and my cousins better by sending home some diamonds than by coming myself  how long will that take asked mr hall the conversation was kept up solely between mr hall and john gordon mr whittlestaff took no share in it unless when he was asked a question and the four girls kept up a whisper with miss forrester and montagu blake  i have a share in rather a good thing said gordon and if i could get out of it so as to realise my property i think that six months might suffice  oh dear then we may have you back again before the years out mr whittlestaff looked up at this as though apprised that the danger was not yet over but he reflected that before twelve months were gone he would certainly have made mary lawrie his wife  kimberley is not a very alluring place said john gordon i dont know any spot on gods earth that i should be less likely to choose as my abiding restingplace  except for the diamonds  except for the diamonds as you remark and therefore when a man has got his fill of diamonds he is likely to leave  his fill of diamonds said augusta hall  shouldnt you like to try your fill of diamonds asked blake  not at all said evelina id rather have strawberries and cream  i think i should like diamonds best said mary whereupon evelina suggested that her younger sister was a greedy little creature  as soon as youve got your fill of diamonds which wont take more than six months longer suggested mr hall youll come back again  not exactly i have an idea of going up the country across the zambesi ive a notion that i should like to make my way out somewhere in the mediterraneanegypt for instance or algiers  whatacross the equator youd never do that alive  things of that kind have been done stanley crossed the continent  but not from south to north i dont believe in that you had better remain at kimberley and get more diamonds  hed be with diamonds like the boy with the bacon said the clergyman when prepared for another wish hed have more than he could eat  to tell the truth said john gordon i dont quite know what i should do it would depend perhaps on what somebody else would join me in doing my life was very lonely at kimberley and i do not love being alone  then why dont you take a wife said montagu blake very loudly as though he had hit the target right in the bullseye he so spoke as to bring the conversation to an abrupt end mr whittlestaff immediately looked conscious he was a man who on such an occasion could not look otherwise than conscious and the five girls with all of whom the question of the loves of john gordon and mary lawrie had been fully discussed looked conscious mary lawrie was painfully conscious but endeavoured to hide it not unsuccessfully but in her endeavour she had to look unnaturally sternand was conscious too that she did that mr hall whose feelings of romance were not perhaps of the highest order looked round on mr whittlestaff and mary lawrie montagu blake felt that he had achieved a triumph yes said he if those are your feelings why dont you take a wife  one man may not be so happy as another said gordon laughing you have suited yourself admirably and seem to think it quite easy for a man to make a selection  not quite such a selection as mine perhaps said blake  then think of the difficulty do you suppose that any second miss forrester would dream of going to the diamondfields with me  perhaps not said blake not a second miss forresterbut somebody else  something inferior  wellyes inferior to my miss forrester certainly  you are the most conceited young man that i ever came across said the young lady herself  and i am not inclined to put up with anything that is very inferior said john gordon he could not help his eye from glancing for a moment round upon mary lawrie she was aware of it though no one else noticed it in the room she was aware of it though any one watching her would have said that she had never looked at him  a man may always find a woman to suit him if he looks well about him said mr hall sententiously dont you think so whittlestaff  i dare say he may said mr whittlestaff very flatly and as he said so he made up his mind that he would for that day postpone the task of telling mr hall of his intended marriage  the evening passed by and the time came for mr whittlestaff to drive miss lawrie back to crokers hall she had certainly spent a most uneventful period as far as action or even words of her own was concerned but the afternoon was one which she would never forget she had been quite quite sure when she came into the house but she was more than sure now at every word that had been spoken she had thought of herself and of him would he not have known how to have chosen a fit companiononly for this great misfortune and would she have been so much inferior to miss forrester would he have thought her inferior to any one would he not have preferred her to any other female whom the world had at the present moment produced oh the pity of it the pity of it  then came the bidding of adieu gordon was to sleep at little alresford that night and to take his departure by early train on the next morning of the adieux spoken the next morning we need take no notice but only of the word or two uttered that night goodbye mr gordon said mr whittlestaff having taken courage for the occasion and having thought even of the necessary syllables to be spoken  goodbye mr whittlestaff and he gave his rival his hand in apparently friendly grasp to those burning questions he had asked he had received no word of reply but they were questions which he would not repeat again  goodbye mr gordon said mary she had thought of the moment much but had determined at last that she would trust herself to nothing further he took her hand but did not say a word he took it and pressed it for a moment and then turned his face away and went in from the hall back to the door leading to the drawingroom mr whittlestaff was at the moment putting on his greatcoat and mary stood with her bonnet and cloak on at the open front door listening to a word or two from kattie forrester and evelina hall oh i wish i wish it might have been said kattie forrester  and so do i said evelina cant it be  goodnight said mary boldly stepping out rapidly into the moonlight and mounting without assistance to her place in the open carriage  i beg your pardon said mr hall following her but there came not a word from her  mr whittlestaff had gone back after john gordon bytheby he said what will be your address in london  the oxford and cambridge in pall mall said he  oh yes the club there it might be that i should have a word to send to you but i dont suppose i shall he added as he turned round to go away then he shook hands with the party in the hall and mounting up into the carriage drove mary and himself away homewards towards crokers hall  not a word was spoken between them for the first mile nor did a sound of a sob or an audible suspicion of a tear come from mary why did those girls know the secret of her heart in that way why had they dared to express a hope as to an event or an idea as to a disappointment all knowledge of which ought to be buried in her own bosom had she spoken of her love for john gordon she was sure that no word had escaped her and were it surmised was it not customary that such surmises should be kept in the dark but here these young ladies had dared to pity her for her vain love as though like some village maiden she had gone about in tears bewailing herself that some groom or gardener had been faithless but sitting thus for the first mile she choked herself to keep down her sobs  mary at last he whispered to her  well mr whittlestaff  mary we are both of us unhappy  i am not unhappy she said plucking up herself suddenly why do you say that i am unhappy  you seem so i at any rate am unhappy  what makes you so  i did wrong to take you to dine in company with that man  it was not for me to refuse to go  no there is no blame to you in itnor is there blame to me but it would have been better for us both had we remained away then he drove on in silence and did not speak another word till they reached home  well said mrs baggett following them into the diningroom  what do you mean by well  what did the folks say to you at mr halls i can see by your face that some of them have been saying summat  nobody has been saying anything that i know of said mr whittlestaff do you go to bed then when mrs baggett was gone and mary had listlessly seated herself on a chair her lover again addressed her i wish i knew what there is in your heart yet she would not tell him but turned away her face and sat silent have you nothing to say to me  what should i have to say to you i have nothing to say of that of which you are thinking  he has gone now mary  yes he has gone  and you are contented it did seem hard upon her that she should be called upon to tell a lieto say that which he must know to be a lieand to do so in order that he might be encouraged to persevere in achieving his own object but she did not quite understand him are you contented he repeated again  then she thought that she would tell the lie if it was well that she should make the sacrifice for his sake why should it not be completed if she had to give herself to him why should not the gift be as satisfactory as it might be made to his feelings yes i am contented  and you do not wish to see him again  certainly not as your wife  you do not wish it at all he rejoined whether you be my wife or otherwise  i think you press me too hard then she remembered herself and the perfect sacrifice which she was minded to make no i do not wish again to see mr gordon at all now if you will allow me i will go to bed i am thoroughly tired out and i hardly know what i am saying  yes you can go to bed he said then she gave him her hand in silence and went off to her own room  she had no sooner reached her bed than she threw herself on it and burst into tears all this which she had to endureall that she would have to bearwould be she thought too much for her and there came upon her a feeling of contempt for his cruelty had he sternly resolved to keep her to her promised word and to forbid her all happiness for the futureto make her his wife let her heart be as it mighthad he said you have come to my house and have eaten my bread and have drunk of my cup and have then promised to become my wife and now you shall not depart from it because this interloper has come between usthen though she might have felt him to be cruel still she would have respected him he would have done as she believed as other men do but he wished to gain his object and yet not appear to be cruel it was so that she thought of him and it shall be as he would have it she said to herself but though she saw far into his character she did not quite read it aright  he remained there alone in his library into the late hours of the night but he did not even take up a book with the idea of solacing his hours he too had his idea of selfsacrifice which went quite as far as hers but yet he was not as sure as was she that the selfsacrifice would be a duty he did not believe as did she in the character of john gordon what if he should give her up to one who did not deserve herto one whose future would not be stable enough to secure the happiness and welfare of such a woman as was mary lawrie he had no knowledge to guide him nor had shenor for the matter of that had john gordon himself any knowledge of what his own future might be of his own future mr whittlestaff could speak and think with the greatest confidence it would be safe happy and bright should mary lawrie become his wife should she not do so it must be altogether ruined and confounded  he could not conceive it to be possible that he should be required by duty to make such a sacrifice but he knew of himself that if her happiness her true and permanent happiness would require it then the sacrifice should be made     chapter xvi  mrs baggetts philosophy   the next day was saturday and mr whittlestaff came out of his room early intending to speak to mrs baggett he had declared to himself that it was his purpose to give her some sound advice respecting her own affairsas far as her affairs and his were connected together but low down in his mind below the stratum in which his declared resolution was apparent to himself there was a hope that he might get from her some comfort and strength as to his present purpose not but that he would ultimately do as he himself had determined but to tell the truth he had not quite determined and thought that a word from mrs baggett might assist him  as he came out from his room he encountered mary intent upon her household duties it was something before her usual time and he was surprised she had looked ill overnight and worn and he had expected that she would keep her bed what makes you so early mary he spoke to her with his softest and most affectionate tone  i couldnt sleep and i thought i might as well be up she had followed him into the library and when there he put his arm round her waist and kissed her forehead it was a strange thing for him to do she felt that it was sovery very strange but it never occurred to her that it behoved her to be angry at his caress he had kissed her once before and only once and it had seemed to her that he had intended that their lovemaking should go on without kisses but was she not his property to do as he pleased with her and there could be no ground for displeasure on her part  dear mary he said if you could only know how constant my thoughts are to you she did not doubt that it was so but just so constant were her thoughts to john gordon but from her to him there could be no show of affectionnothing but the absolute coldness of perfect silence she had passed the whole evening with him last night and had not been allowed to speak a single word to him beyond the ordinary greetings of society she had felt that she had not been allowed to speak a single word to any one because he had been present mr whittlestaff had thrown over her the deadly mantle of his ownership and she had consequently felt herself to be debarred from all right over her own words and actions she had become his slave she felt herself in very truth to be a poor creature whose only duty it was in the world to obey his volition she had told herself during the night that with all her motives for loving him she was learning to regard him with absolute hatred and she hated herself because it was so oh what a tedious affair was this of living how tedious how sad and miserable must her future days be as long as days should be left to her could it be made possible to her that she should ever be able to do her duty by this husband of hersfor her in whose heart of hearts would be seated continually the image of this other man  bytheby said he i want to see mrs baggett i suppose she is about somewhere  oh dear yes since the trouble of her husband has become nearer she is earlier and earlier every day shall i send her then she departed and in a few minutes mrs baggett entered the room  come in mrs baggett  yes sir  i have just a few words which i want to say to you your husband has gone back to portsmouth  yes sir he have this she said in a very decided tone as though her master need trouble himself no further about her husband  i am very glad that it should be so its the best place for himunless he could be sent to australia  he aint adone nothing to fit himself for botany bay mr whittlestaff said the old woman bobbing her head at him  i dont care what place he has fitted himself for so long as he doesnt come here he is a disreputable old man  you neednt be so hard upon him mr whittlestaff he aint adone nothing much to you barring sleeping in the stable one night when he had had a drop o drink too much and the old woman pulled out a great handkerchief and began to wipe her eyes piteously  what a fool you are mrs baggett  yes i am a fool i knows that  heres this disreputable old man eating and drinking your hardearned wages  but they are my wages and whos a right to them only he  i dont say anything about that only he comes here and disturbs you  well yes he is disturbing if its only because of his wooden leg and red nose i dont mean to say as hes the sort of a man as does a credit to a gentlemans house to see about the place but he was my lot in matrimony and ive got to put up with him i aint agoing to refuse to bear the burden which came to be my lot i dont suppose hes earned a single shilling since he left the regiment and that is hard upon a poor woman whos got nothing but her wages  now look here mrs baggett  yes sir  send him your wages  and have to go in rags myselfin your service  you wont go in rags dont be a fool  i am a fool mr whittlestaff you cant tell me that too often  you wont go in rags you ought to know us well enough  who is us mr whittlestaff they aint no usjust yet  wellme  yes i know you mr whittlestaff  send him your wages you may be quite sure that youll find yourself provided with shoes and stockings and the rest of it  and be a woluntary burden beyond what i earns nevernot as long as miss mary is coming to live here as missus of your house i should do summat as i should have to repent of but mr whittlestaff ive got to look the world in the face and bear my own crosses i never can do it no younger  youre an old woman now and you talk of throwing yourself upon the world without the means of earning a shilling  i think id earn some at something old as i am till i fell down flat dead she said i have that sperit in me that id still be doing something but it dont signify im not going to remain here when miss mary is to be put over me thats the long and the short of it all  now had come the moment in which if ever mr whittlestaff must get the strength which he required he was quite sure of the old womanthat her opinion would not be in the least influenced by any desire on her own part to retain her position as his housekeeper i dont know about putting miss mary over you he said  dont know about it she shouted  my mind is not absolutely fixed  as she said anything  not a word  or he has he been and dared to speak up about miss mary and hewho as far as i can understand has never done a haporth for her since the beginning whats mr gordon i should like to know diamonds whats diamonds in the way of a steady income theyre all a flash in the pan and moonshine and dirtiness i hates to hear of diamonds theres all the ill in the world comes from them and youd give her up to be taken off by such a one as he among the diamonds i make bold to tell you mr whittlestaff that you ought to have more strength of mind than what that comes to youre telling me every day as im an old fool  so you are  i didnt never contradict you nor i dont mean if you tells me so as often again and i dont mean to be that impident as to tell my master as i aint the only fool about the place it wouldnt be no wise becoming  but you think it would be true  i says nothing about that thats not the sort of language anybody has heard to come out of my mouth either before your face or behind your back but i do say as a man ought to behave like a man what give up to a chap as spends his time in digging for diamonds never  what does it matter what he digs for you know nothing about his business  but i know something about yours mr whittlestaff i know where you have set your wishes and i know that when a man has made up his mind in such an affair as this he shouldnt give way to any young diamond dealer of them all  not to him  and whats she are you to give up everything because shes lovesick for a day or two is everything to be knocked to pieces here at crokers hall because he has come and made eyes at her she was glad enough to take what you offered before he had come this way  she was not glad enough that is it she was not glad enough  she took you at any rate and id never make myself mean enough to make way for such a fellow as that  it isnt for him mrs baggett  it is for him who else to walk away and just leave the game open because he has come down to hampshire there aint no spirit of standing up and fighting about it  with whom am i to fight  with both of emtill you have your own way a foolish stupid weak girl like that  i wont have her abused  shes very well i aint asaying nothing against her if shell do what you bid her shell turn out right enough you asked her and she said shed do it is not that so theres nothing i hate so much as them romantic ways and everything is to be made to give way because a young chap is six foot high i hates romance and manly beauty as they call it and all the rest of it where is she to get her bread and meat thats what i want to know  therell be bread and meat for her  i dare say but youll have to pay for it while shes philandering about with him and thats what you call fine feelings i call it all rubbish if youve a mind to make her mrs whittlestaff make her mrs whittlestaff drat them fine feelings i never knew no good come of what people call fine feelings if a young woman does her work as it should be shes got no time to think of em and if a man is master he should be master hows a man to give way to a girl like that and then stand up and face the world around him a man has to be master and when hes come to be a little oldlike he has to see that he will be master i never knew no good come of one of them softgoing fellows who is minded to give up whenever a woman wants anything whats a woman it aint natural that she should have her way and she dont like a man a bit better in the longrun because he lets her theres miss mary if youre stiff with her now shell come out right enough in a month or two shes lived without mr gordon well enough since shes been here now hes come and we hear a deal about these fine feelings you take my word and say nothing to nobody about the young man hes gone by this time or hes agoing let him go say i and if miss mary takes on to whimper a bit dont you see it  mrs baggett took her departure and mr whittlestaff felt that he had received the comfort or at any rate the strength of which he had been in quest in all that the woman had said to him there had been a reecho of his own thoughtsof one side at any rate of his own thoughts he knew that true affection and the substantial comforts of the world would hold their own against all romance and he did not believein his theory of ethics he did not believethat by yielding to what mrs baggett called fine feelings he would in the longrun do good to those with whom he was concerned in the world were he to marry mary lawrie now mary whittlestaff would he thought in ten years time be a happier woman than were he to leave her that was the solid conviction of his mind and in that he had been strengthened by mrs baggetts arguments he had desired to be so strengthened and therefore his interview had been successful  but as the minutes passed by as every quarter of an hour added itself to the quarters that were gone and as the hours grew on and the weakness of evening fell upon him all his softness came back again they had dined at six oclock and at seven he declared his purpose of strolling out by himself on these summer evenings he would often take mary with him but he now told her with a sort of apology that he would rather go alone do she said smiling up into his face dont let me ever be in your way of course a man does not always want to have to find conversation for a young lady  if you are the young lady i should always want itonly that i have things to think of  go and think of your things i will sit in the garden and do my stitching  about a mile distant where the downs began to rise there was a walk supposed to be common to all who chose to frequent it but which was entered through a gate which gave the place within the appearance of privacy there was a little lake inside crowded with waterlilies when the time for the waterlilies had come and above the lake a path ran up through the woods very steep and as it rose higher and higher altogether sheltered it was about a mile in length till another gate was reached but during the mile the wanderer could go off on either side and lose himself on the grass among the beechtrees it was a favourite haunt with mr whittlestaff here he was wont to sit and read his horace and think of the affairs of the world as horace depicted them many a morsel of wisdom he had here made his own and had then endeavoured to think whether the wisdom had in truth been taken home by the poet to his own bosom or had only been a glitter of the intellect never appropriated for any useful purpose gemmas marmor ebur he had said sunt qui non habeant est qui non curat habere i suppose he did care for jewels marble and ivory as much as any one me lentus glyceræ torret amor meæ i dont suppose he ever loved her really or any other girl thus he would think over his horace always having the volume in his pocket  now he went there but when he had sat himself down in a spot to which he was accustomed he had no need to take out his horace his own thoughts came to him free enough without any need of his looking for them to poetry after all was not mrs baggetts teaching a damnable philosophy let the man be the master and let him get everything he can for himself and enjoy to the best of his ability all that he can get that was the lesson as taught by her but as he sat alone there beneath the trees he told himself that no teaching was more damnable of course it was the teaching by which the world was kept going in its present course but when divested of its plumage was it not absolutely the philosophy of selfishness because he was a man and as a man had power and money and capacity to do the things after which his heart lusted he was to do them for his own gratification let the consequences be what they might to one whom he told himself that he loved did the lessons of mrs baggett run smoothly with those of jesus christ  then within his own mind he again took mrs baggetts side of the question how mean a creature must he not become if he were now to surrender this girl whom he was anxious to make his wife he knew of himself that in such a matter he was more sensitive than others he could not let her go and then walk forth as though little or nothing were the matter with him now for the second time in his life he had essayed to marry and now for the second time all the world would know that he had been accepted and then rejected it was he thought more than he could endureand live  then after he had sat there for an hour he got up and walked home and as he went he tried to resolve that he would reject the philosophy of mrs baggett and accept the other if i only knew he said as he entered his own gate if one could only see clearly then he found mary still seated in the garden nothing is to be got he said by asking you for an answer  in what have i failed  never mind let us go in and have a cup of tea but she knew well in what he accused her of failing and her heart turned towards him again     chapter xvii  mr whittlestaff meditates a journey   the next day was sunday and was passed in absolute tranquillity nothing was said either by mr whittlestaff or by mary lawrie nor to the eyes of those among whom they lived was there anything to show that their minds were disturbed they went to church in the morning as was usual with them and mary went also to the evening service it was quite pleasant to see mrs baggett start for her slow sabbath morning walk and to observe how her appearance altogether belied that idea of rags and tatters which she had given as to her own wardrobe a nicer dressed old lady or a more becoming black silk gown you shall not see on a sunday morning making her way to any country church in england while she was looking so pleasant and demureone may say almost so handsome in her oldfashioned and apparently new bonnetwhat could have been her thoughts respecting the rednosed onelegged warrior and her intended life to be passed in fetching twopennorths of gin for him and her endeavours to get for him a morsel of wholesome food she had had her breakfast out of her own china teacup which she used to boast was her own property as it had been given to her by mr whittlestaffs mother and had had her little drop of cream and to tell the truth her boiled egg which she always had on a sunday morning to enable her to listen to the long sermon of the rev mr lowlad she would talk of her hopes and her burdens and undoubtedly she was in earnest but she certainly did seem to make her hay very comfortably while the sun shone  everything on this sunday morning was pleasant or apparently pleasant at crokers hall in the evening when mary and the maidservants went to church leaving mrs baggett at home to look after the house and go to sleep mr whittlestaff walked off to the wooded path with his horace he did not read it very long the bits which he did usually read never amounted to much at a time he would take a few lines and then digest them thoroughly wailing over them or rejoicing as the case might be he was not at the present moment much given to joy intermissa venus diu rursus bella moves parce precor precor this was the passage to which he turned at the present moment and very little was the consolation which he found in it what was so crafty he said to himself or so vain as that an old man should hark back to the pleasures of a time of life which was past and gone non sum qualis eram he said and then thought with shame of the time when he had been jilted by catherine baileythe time in which he had certainly been young enough to love and be loved had he been as lovable as he had been prone to love then he put the book in his pocket his latter effort had been to recover something of the sweetness of life and not as had been the poets to drain those dregs to the bottom but when he got home he bade mary tell him what mr lowlad had said in his sermon and was quite cheery in his manner of picking mr lowlads theology to piecesfor mr whittlestaff did not altogether agree with mr lowlad as to the uses to be made of the sabbath  on the next morning he began to bustle about a little as was usual with him before he made a journey and it did escape him while he was talking to mrs baggett about a pair of trousers which it turned out that he had given away last summer that he meditated a journey to london on the next day  you aint agoing said mrs baggett  i think i shall  then dont take my word for it sirdont but mr whittlestaff only snubbed her and nothing more was said about the journey at the moment  in the course of the afternoon visitors came miss evelina hall with miss forrester had been driven into alresford and now called in company with mr blake mr blake was full of his own good tidings but not so full but that he could remember before he took his departure to say a half whispered word on behalf of john gordon what do you think mr whittlestaff since you were at little alresford weve settled the day  you neednt be telling it to everybody about the county said kattie forrester  why shouldnt i tell it to my particular friends i am sure miss lawrie will be delighted to hear it  indeed i am said mary  and mr whittlestaff also are you not mr whittlestaff  i am very happy to hear that a couple whom i like so well are soon to be made happy but you have not yet told us the day  the 1st of august said evelina hall  the 1st of august said mr blake is an auspicious day i am sure there is some reason for regarding it as auspicious though i cannot exactly remember what it is something about augustus i think  i never heard of such an idea to come from a clergyman of the church of england said the bride i declare montagu never seems to think that hes a clergyman at all  it will be better for him said mr whittlestaff and for all those about him that he should ever remember the fact and never seem to do so  all the same said blake although the 1st of august is auspicious i was very anxious to be married in july only the painters said they couldnt be done with the house in time one is obliged to go by what these sort of people say and do were to have a months honeymoononly just a month because mr lowlad wont make himself as agreeable as he ought to do about the services and newface the plumber and glazier says he cant have the house done as kattie would like to live in it before the end of august where do you think were going to miss lawrie you would never guess  perhaps to rome said mary at a shot  not quite so far were going to the isle of wight its rather remarkable that i never spent but one week in the isle of wight since i was born we havent quite made up our mind whether its to be black gang chine or ventnor its a matter of dresses you see  dont be a fool montagu said miss forrester  well it is if we decide upon ventnor she must have frocks and things to come out with  i suppose so said mr whittlestaff  but shell want nothing of the kind at black gang  do hold your tongue and not make an ass of yourself what do you know what dresses i shall want as it is i dont think i shall go either to the one place or the other the smiths are at ryde and the girls are my great friends i think well go to ryde after all  im so sorry mr whittlestaff that we cant expect the pleasure of seeing you at our wedding it is of course imperative that kattie should be married in the cathedral her father is one of the dignitaries and could not bear not to put his best foot foremost on such an occasion the dean will be there of course im afraid the bishop cannot come up from farnham because he will have friends with him i am afraid john gordon will have gone by that time or else we certainly would have had him down i should like john gordon to be present because he would see how the kind of thing is done the name of john gordon at once silenced all the matrimonial chitchat which was going on among them it was manifest both to mr whittlestaff and to mary that it had been lugged in without a cause to enable mr blake to talk about the absent man it would have been pleasant eh kattie  we should have been very glad to see mr gordon if it would have suited him to come said miss forrester  it would have been just the thing for him and we at oxford together and everything dont you think he would have liked to be there it would have put him in mind of other things you know  to this appeal there was no answer made it was impossible that mary should bring herself to talk about john gordon in mixed company and the allusion to him stirred mr whittlestaffs wrath of course it was understood as having been spoken in marys favour and mr whittlestaff had been made to perceive by what had passed at little alresford that the little alresford people all took the side of john gordon and were supposed to be taking the side of mary at the same time there was not one of them he said to himself that had half the sense of mrs baggett and there was a vulgarity about their interference of which mrs baggett was not guilty  he is half way on his road to the diamondfields said evelina  and went away from here on saturday morning said montagu blake he has not started yetnot dreamed of it i heard him whisper to mr whittlestaff about his address hes to be in london at his club i didnt hear him say for how long but when a man gives his address at his club he doesnt mean to go away at once i have a plan in my head some of those boats go to the diamondfields from southampton all the steamers go everywhere from southampton winchester is on the way to southampton nothing will be easier for him than to drop in for our marriage on his way out that is if he must go at last then he looked hard at mary lawrie  and bring some of his diamonds with him said evelina hall that would be very nice but not a word more was said then about john gordon by the inhabitants of crokers hall after that the visitors went and montagu blake chaperoned the girls out of the house without an idea that he had made himself disagreeable  that young man is a most egregious ass said mr whittlestaff  he is goodnatured and simple but i doubt whether he sees things very plainly  he has not an idea of what a man may talk about and when he should hold his tongue and he is such a fool as to think that his idle chatter can influence others i dont suppose a bishop can refuse to ordain a gentleman because he is a general idiot otherwise i think the bishop is responsible for letting in such an ass as this mary said to herself as she heard this that it was the most illnatured remark which she had ever known to fall from the mouth of mr whittlestaff  i think i am going away for a few days mr whittlestaff said to mary when the visitors were gone  where are you going  well i suppose i shall be in london when one goes anywhere it is generally to london though i havent been there for more than two months  not since i came to live with you she said you are the most stayathome person by way of a gentleman that i ever heard of then there was a pause for a few minutes and he said nothing further might a person ask what you are going for this she asked in the playful manner which she knew he would take in good part  well i dont quite know that a person can i am going to see a man upon business and if i began to tell you part of it i must tell it allwhich would not be convenient  may i not ask how long you will be away there cant be any dreadful secret in that and i shall want to know what to get for your dinner when you come back she was standing now at his elbow and he was holding her by the arm it was to him almost as though she were already his wife and the feeling to him was very pleasant only if she were his wife or if it were positively decided among them that she would become so he would certainly tell her the reason for which he might undertake any journey indeed there was no reason connected with any business of his which might not be told other than that special reason which was about to take him to london he only answered her now by pressing her hand and smiling into her face will it be for a month  oh dear no what should i do away from home for a month  how can i tell the mysterious business may require you to be absent for a whole year fancy my being left at home all that time you dont think of it but you have never left me for a single night since you first brought me to live here  and you have never been away  oh no why should i go away what business can a woman have to move from home especially such a woman as i am  you are just like mrs baggett she always talks of women with supreme contempt and yet she is just as proud of herself as the queen when you come to contradict her  you never contradict me  perhaps the day may come when i shall then he recollected himself and added or perhaps the day may never come never mind put up my things for one week at any rate i shall not be above a week gone then she left him and went away to his room to do what was necessary  she knew the business on which he was about to travel to london as well as though he had discussed with her the whole affair in the course of the last two or three days there had been moments in which she had declared to herself that he was cruel there had been moments in which she had fainted almost with sorrow when she thought of the life which fate had in store for her there must be endless misery while there might have been joy so ecstatic in its nature as to make it seem to her to be perennial then she had almost fallen and had declared him to be preternaturally cruel but these moments had been short and had endured only while she had allowed herself to dream of the ecstatic joy which she confessed to herself to be an unfit condition of life for her and then she had told herself that mr whittlestaff was not cruel and that she herself was no better than a weak poor flighty creature unable to look in its face life and all its realities and then she would be lost in amazement as she thought of herself and all her vacillations  she now was resolved to take his part and to fight his battle to the end when he had told her that he was going up to london and going up on business as to which he could tell her nothing she knew that it behoved her to prevent him from taking the journey john gordon should be allowed to go in quest of his diamonds and mr whittlestaff should be persuaded not to interfere with him it was for her sake and not for john gordons that he was about to make the journey he had asked her whether she were willing to marry him and she had told him that he was pressing her too hard she would tell him nownow before it was too latethat this was not so his journey to london must at any rate be prevented     chapter xviii  mr and mrs tookey   on the day arranged early on the morning after the dinner at little alresford park john gordon went up to london he had not been much moved by the intimation made to him by mr whittlestaff that some letter should be written to him at his london address he had made his appeal to mr whittlestaff and had received no answer whatever and he had after a fashion made his appeal also to the girl he felt sure that his plea must reach her his very presence then in this house had been an appeal to her he knew that she so far believed in him as to be conscious that she could at once become his wifeif she were willing to throw over his rival he knew also that she loved himor had certainly loved him he did not know the nature of her regard nor was it possible that he should ever know thatunless she were his wife she had given a promise to that other man andit was thus he read her charactershe could be true to her promise without any great heartbreak at any rate she intended to be true to it he did not for a moment suspect that mr whittlestaff was false mary had declared that she would not withdraw her wordthat only from her own mouth was to be taken her intention of such withdrawal and that such intention she certainly would never utter of her character he understood muchbut not quite all he was not aware of the depth of her feeling but mr whittlestaff he did not understand at all of all those vacillating softnesses he knew nothingor of those moments spent with the poet in which he was wont to fight against the poets pretences and of those other moments spent with mrs baggett in which he would listen to and always finally reject those invitations to manly strength which she would always pour into his ears that mr whittlestaff should spend hour after hour and now day after day in teaching himself to regard nothing but what might best suit the girls happinessof that he was altogether in the dark to his thinking mr whittlestaff was a hard man who having gained his object intended to hold fast by what he had gained he john gordon knew or thought that he knew that mary as his wife would lead a happier life than with mr whittlestaff but things had turned out unfortunately and there was nothing for him but to return to the diamondfields  therefore he had gone back to london with the purpose of preparing for his journey a man does not start for south africa tomorrow or if not tomorrow then the next day he was aware that there must be some delay but any place would be better in which to stay than the neighbourhood of crokers hall there were things which must be done and people with whom he must do it but of all that he need say nothing down at alresford therefore when he got back to london he meant to make all his arrangementsand did so far settle his affairs as to take a berth on board one of the mail steamers  he had come over in company with a certain lawyer who had gone out to kimberley with a view to his profession and had then as is the case with all the world that goes to kimberley gone into diamonds diamonds had become more to him than either briefs or pleadings he had been there for fifteen years and had ruined himself and made himself halfadozen times he had found diamonds to be more pleasant than law and to be more compatible with champagne tinned lobsters and young ladies he had married a wife and had parted with her and taken another mans wife and paid for her with diamonds he had then possessed nothing and had afterwards come forth a thirdpart owner of the important stickinthemud claim which at one time was paying 12 per cent per month it must be understood that the stickinthemud claim was an almost infinitesimal portion of soil in the great kimberley mine it was but the sixteenth part of an original subdivision but from the centre of the great basin or rather bowl which forms the mine there ran up two wires to the high mound erected on the circumference on which continually two iron cages were travelling up and down coming back empty but going up laden with gemmiferous dirt here travelled the diamonds of the stickinthemud claim the owner of onethird of which mr fitzwalker tookey had come home with john gordon  taking a first general glance at affairs in the diamondfields i doubt whether we should have been inclined to suspect that john gordon and fitzwalker tookey would have been likely to come together as partners in a diamond speculation but john gordon had in the course of things become owner of the other two shares and when fitzwalker tookey determined to come home he had done so with the object of buying his partners interest this he might have done at onceonly that he suffered under the privation of an insufficiency of means he was a man of great intelligence and knew well that no readier mode to wealth had ever presented itself to him than the purchase of his partners shares much was said to persuade john gordon but he would not part with his documents without seeing security for his money therefore messrs gordon and tookey put the old stickinthemud into the hands of competent lawyers and came home together  i am not at all sure that i shall sell john gordon had said  but i thought that you offered it  yes for money down for the sum named i will sell now but if i start from here without completing the bargain i shall keep the option in my own hands the fact is i do not know whether i shall remain in england or return if i do come back i am not likely to find anything better than the old stickinthemud to this mr tookey assented but still he resolved that he would go home hence it came to pass that mr fitzwalker tookey was now in london and that john gordon had to see him frequently here tookey had found another wouldbe partner who had the needed money and it was fervently desired by mr tookey that john gordon might not go back to south africa  the two men were not at all like in their proclivities but they had been thrown together and each had learned much of the inside life of the other the sort of acquaintance with whom a steady man becomes intimate in such a locality often surprises the steady man himself fitzwalker tookey had the antecedents and education of a gentleman champagne and lobster suppersthe lobster coming out of tin casesdiamonds and strange ladies even with bloated cheeks and strong language had not altogether destroyed the vestiges of the temple he at any rate was fond of a companion with whom he could discuss his english regrets and john gordon was not inclined to shut himself up altogether among his precious stones and to refuse the conversation of a man who could talk tookey had told him of his great distress in reference to his wife by g you know the cruellest thing you ever heard in the world i was a little tight one night and the next morning she was off with atkinson who got away with his pocket full of diamonds poor girl she went down to the portuguese settlement and he was nabbed hes doing penal service now down at cape town thats a kind of thing that does upset a fellow and poor fitzwalker began to cry  among such confidences gordon allowed it to escape from him that were he to become married in england he did not think it probable that he should return thus it was known at least to his partner that he was going to look for a wife and the desire in mr tookeys breast that the wife might be forthcoming was intense well he said immediately on gordons return to london  what does well mean  of course you went down there to look after the lady  i have never told you so  but you diddid you not  i have told you nothing about any lady though you are constantly asking questions as a fact i think i shall go back next month  to kimberley  i think so the stake i have there is of too great importance to be abandoned  i have the money ready to pay overabsolute cash on the nail you dont call that abandoning it  the claim has gone up in value 25 per cent as you have already heard  yes it has gone up a little but not so much as that it will come down as much by the next mail with diamonds you never can stick to anything  thats true but you can only go by the prices as you see them quoted they may be up 25 per cent again by next mail at any rate i am going back  the devil you are  thats my present idea as i like to be on the square with you altogether i dont mind saying that i have booked a berth by the kentucky castle  the deuce you have and you wont take a wife with you  i am not aware that i shall have such an impediment  then fitzwalker tookey assumed a very long face it is difficult to trace the workings of such a mans mind or to calculate the meagre chances on which he is too often driven to base his hopes of success he feared that he could not show his face in kimberley unless as the representative of the whole old stickinthemud and with that object he had declared himself in london to have the actual power of disposing of gordons shares gordon had gone down to hampshire and would no doubt be successful with the young lady at any rateas he described it to himselfhe had gone in for that he could see his way in that direction but in no other upon my word this you know iswhat i callrather throwing a fellow over  i am as good as my word  i dont know about that gordon  but i do and i wont hear any assertion to the contrary i offered you the shares for a certain price and you rejected them  i did not do that  you did do thatexactly then there came up in my mind a feeling that i might probably wish to change my purpose  and i am to suffer for that  not in the least i then told you that you should still have the shares for the price named but i did not offer them to any one else so i came homeand you chose to come with me but before i started and again after i told you that the offer did not hold good and that i should not make up my mind as to selling till after i got to england  we understood that you meant to be married  i never said so i never said a word about marriage i am now going back and mean to manage the mine myself  without asking me  yes i shall ask you but i have twothirds i will give you for your share 10 per cent more than the price you offered me for each of my shares if you do not like that you need not accept the offer but i dont mean to have any more words about it  mr fitzwalker tookeys face became longer and longer and he did in truth feel himself to be much aggrieved within his very soul there were still two lines of conduct open to him he might move the stern man by a recapitulation of the sorrow of his circumstances or he might burst out into passionate wrath and lay all his ruin to his partners doing he might still hope that in this latter way he could rouse all kimberley against gordon and thus creep back into some vestige of property under the shadow of gordons iniquities he would try both he would first endeavour to move the stern man to pity i dont think you can imagine the condition in which you are about to place me  i cant admit that i am placing you anywhere  ill just explain of course i know that i can tell you everything in strictest confidence  i dont know it at all  oh yes i can you remember the story of my poor wife  yes i remember  shes in london now  what she got back from the portuguese settlement  yes she did not stay there long i dont suppose that the portuguese are very nice people  perhaps not  at any rate they dont have much money among them  not after the lavish expenditure of the diamondfields suggested gordon  just so poor matilda had been accustomed to all that money could buy for her i never used to be closefisted with her though sometimes i would be tight  as far as i could understand you never used to agree at all  i dont think we did hit it off perhaps it was my fault  you used to be a little free in your way of living  i was i confess that i was so i was young then but i am older now i havent touched a b and s before eleven oclock since i have been in london above two or three times i do mean to do the best i can for my young family it was the fact that mr tookey had three little children boarding out in kimberley  and what is the lady doing in london  to tell the truth shes at my lodgings  ohh  i do admit it she is  she is indifferent to the gentleman in the cape town penal settlement  altogether i dont think she ever really cared for him to tell the truth she only wanted some one to take her away fromme  and now she trusts you again  oh dear yescompletely she is my wife you know still  i suppose so  that sacred tie has never been severed you must always remember that i dont know what your feelings are on such a subject but according to my views it should not be severed roughly when there are children that should always be borne in mind dont you think so  the children should be borne in mind  just so thats what i mean who can look after a family of young children so well as their young mother men have various ways of looking at the matter to this john gordon gave his ready consent and was anxious to hear in what way his assistance was to be asked in again putting mr and mrs tookey with their young children respectably on their feet there are men you know standoff sort of fellows who think that a woman should never be forgiven  it must depend on how far the husband has been in fault  exactly now these standoff sort of fellows will never admit that they have been in fault at all thats not my case  you drank a little  for the matter of that so did she when a woman drinks she gets herself to bed somehow a man gets out upon a spree thats what i used to do and then i would hit about me rather recklessly i have no doubt matilda did get it sometimes when there has been that kind of thing forgive and forget is the best thing you can do  i suppose so  and then at the fields there isnt the same sort of prudish life which one is accustomed to in england here in london a man is nowhere if he takes his wife back nobody knows her because there are plenty to know of another sort but there things are not quite so strict of course she oughtnt to have gone off with atkinsona vulgar low fellow too  and you oughtnt to have licked her  thats just it it was tit for tat i think thats the way i look at it at any rate we are living together now and no one can say were not man and wife  therell be a deal of trouble saved in that way  a great deal we are man and wife and can begin again as though nothing had happened no one can say that blacks the white of our eye shell take to those darling children as though nothing had happened you cant conceive how anxious she is to get back to them and theres no other impediment thats a comfort  another impediment would have upset you rather  i couldnt have put up with that mr fitzwalker tookey looked very grave and highminded as he made the assertion but theres nothing of that kind its all open sailing nowwhat are we to live upon just for a beginning  you have means out there  not as things are at presenti am sorry to say to tell the truth my third share of the old stickinthemud is gone i had to raise money when it was desirable that i should come with you  not on my account  and then i did owe something at any rate its all gone now i should find myself stranded at kimberley without a red cent  what can i do  welli will explain poker  hodge will buy your shares for the sum named joshua poker who is out there has got my third share poker  hodge have the money down and when i have arranged the sale will undertake to give me the agency at one per cent on the whole take for three years certain thatll be £1000 ayear and its odd if i cant float myself again in that time gordon stood silent scratching his head or if youd give me the agency on the same terms it would be the same thing i dont care a straw for poker  hodge  i daresay not  but youd find me as true as steel  what little good i did at the fields i did by looking after my own business  then what do you propose let poker  hodge have them and i shall bless you for ever to this mild appeal mr tookey had been brought by the manner in which john gordon had scratched his head i think you are bound to do it you know to this he was brought by the subsequent look which appeared in john gordons eyes  i think not  men will say so  i dont care a straw what men say or women  and you to come back in the same ship with me and my wife you couldnt do it the fields wouldnt receive you gordon bethought himself whether this imagined rejection might not arise rather from the character of his travelling companions to bring back the mother of three little sainted babes and then to walk in upon every shilling of property which had belonged to their father you never could hold up your head in kimberley again  i should have to stand abashed before your virtue  yes you would i should be known to have come back with my poor repentant wifethe mother of three dear babes and she would be known to have returned with her misguided husband the humanity of the fields would not utter a word of reproval to either of us but upon my word i should not like to stand in your shoes and how you could sit opposite to her and look her in the face on the journey out i dont know  it would be unpleasant  deuced unpleasant i should say you remember the old roman saying never be conscious of anything within your own bosom only think how you would feel when you were swelling it about in kimberley while that poor lady wont be able to buy a pair of boots for herself or her children i say nothing about myself i didnt think you were the man to do iti didnt indeed  gordon did find himself moved by the diversity of lights through which he was made to look at the circumstances in question in the first place there was the journey back with mr tookey and his wife companions he had not anticipated the lady would probably begin by soliciting his intimacy which on board ship he could hardly refuse with a fellowpassenger whose husband has been your partner you must quarrel bitterly or be warm friends upon the whole he thought that he could not travel to south africa with mr and mrs fitzwalker tookey and then he understood what the mans tongue would do if he were there for a month in advance the whole picture of life too at the fields was not made attractive by mr tookeys description he was not afraid of the reception which might be accorded to mrs tookey but saw that tookey found himself able to threaten him with violent evils simply because he would claim his own then there shot across his brain some reminiscence of mary lawrie and a comparison between her and her life and the sort of life which a man must lead under the auspices of mrs tookey mary lawrie was altogether beyond his reach but it would be better to have her to think of than the other to know his idea of the diamondfields was disturbed by the promised return of his late partner and his wife  and you mean to reduce me to this misery asked mr tookey  i dont care a straw for your misery  what  not for your picture of your misery i do not doubt but that when you have been there for a month you will be drunk as often as ever and just as free with your fists when a woman comes in your way  never  and i do not see that i am at all bound to provide for you and for your wife and children you have seen many ups and downs and will be doomed to see many more as long as you can get hold of a bottle of wine  i mean to take the pledgei do indeed i must do it gradually because of my constitutionbut i shall do it  i dont in the least believe in itnor do i believe in any man who thinks to redeem himself after such a fashion it may still be possible that i shall not go back  thank god  i may kill beasts in buenos ayres or take a teafarm in thibet or join the colonists in tennessee in that case i will let you know what arrangement i may propose to make about the kimberley claim at any rate i may say thisi shall not go back in the same vessel with you  i thought it would have been so comfortable  you and mrs tookey would find yourself more at your ease without me  not in the least dont let that thought disturb you whatever misery fate may have in store for me you will always find that for the hour i will endeavour to be a good companion sufficient for the day is the evil thereof that is the first of my mottoes  at any rate i shall not go back in the kentucky castle if you do  im afraid our money is paid  so is mine but that does not signify you have a week yet and i will let you know by eleven oclock on thursday what steps i shall finally take if in any way i can serve you i will do so but i can admit no claim  a thousand thanks and i am so glad you approve of what i have done about matilda im sure that a steadygoing fellow like you would have done the same to this john gordon could make no answer but left his friend and went away about his own business he had to decide between tennessee thibet and buenos ayres and wanted his time for his own purposes  when he got to dinner at his club he found a letter from mr whittlestaff which had come by the daymail it was a letter which for the time drove thibet and buenos ayres and tennessee also clean out of his mind it was as follows      crokers hall  june 188     dear mr john gordoni shall be in town this afternoon    probably by the same train which will bring this letter    and will do myself the honour of calling upon you at your    club the next day at twelvei am dear mr john gordon    faithfully yours     william whittlestaff   then there was to be an answer to the appeal which he had made of what nature would be the answer as he laid his hand upon his heart and felt the violence of the emotion to which he was subjected he could not doubt the strength of his own love     chapter xix  mr whittlestaffs journey discussed   i dont think that if i were you i would go up to london mr whittlestaff said mary this was on the tuesday morning  why not  i dont think i would  why should you interfere  i know i ought not to interfere  i dont think you ought especially as i have taken the trouble to conceal what i am going about  i can guess said mary  you ought not to guess in such a matter you ought not to have it on your mind at all i told you that i would not tell you i shall go thats all that i have got to say  the words with which he spoke were illnatured and savage the reader will find them to be so if he thinks of them they were such that a father would hardly speak under any circumstances to a grownup daughtermuch less that a lover would address to his mistress and mary was at present filling both capacities she had been taken into his house almost as an adopted daughter and had since that time had all the privileges accorded to her she had now been promoted still higher and had become his affianced bride that the man should have turned upon her thus in answer to her counsel was savage or at least ungracious but at every word her heart became fuller and more full of an affection as for something almost divine what other man had ever shown such love for any woman and this love was shown to herwho was nothing to himwho ate the bread of charity in his house and it amounted to this that he intended to give her up to another manhe who had given such proof of his lovehe of whom she knew that this was a question of almost life and deathbecause in looking into his face she had met there the truth of his heart since that first avowal made before gordon had comemade at a moment when some such avowal from her was necessaryshe had spoken no word as to john gordon she had endeavoured to show no sign she had given herself up to her elder lover and had endeavoured to have it understood that she had not intended to transfer herself because the other man had come across her path again like a flash of lightning she had dined in company with her younger lover without exchanging a word with him she had not allowed her eyes to fall upon him more than she could help lest some expression of tenderness should be seen there not a word of hope had fallen from her lips when they had first met because she had given herself to another she was sure of herself in that no doubt there had come moments in which she had hopednay almost expectedthat the elder of the two might give her up and when she had felt sure that it was not to be so her very soul had rebelled against him but as she had taken time to think of it she had absolved him and had turned her anger against herself whatever he wantedthat she believed it would be her duty to do for him as far as its achievement might be in her power  she came round and put her arm upon him and looked into his face dont go to london i ask you not to go  why should i not go  to oblige me you pretend to have a secret and refuse to say why you are going of course i know  i have written a letter to say that i am coming  it is still lying on the halltable downstairs it will not go to the post till you have decided  who has dared to stop it  i have i have dared to stop it i shall dare to put it in the fire and burn it dont go he is entitled to nothing you are entitled to havewhatever it is that you may want though it is but such a trifle  a trifle mary  yes a woman has a little gleam of prettiness about herthough here it is but of a common order  anything so uncommon i never came near before  let that pass whether common or uncommon it matters nothing it is something soft which will soon pass away and of itself can do no good it is contemptible  you are just mrs baggett over again  very well i am quite satisfied mrs baggett is a good woman she can do something beyond lying on a sofa and reading novels while her good looks fade away it is simply because a woman is pretty and weak that she is made so much of and is encouraged to neglect her duties by gods help i will not neglect mine do not go to london  he seemed as though he hesitated as he sat there under the spell of her little hand upon his shoulder and in truth he did hesitate could it not be that he should be allowed to sit there all his days and have her hand about his neck somewhat after this fashion was he bound to give it all up what was it that ordinary selfishness allowed what depth of selfindulgence amounted to a wickedness which a man could not permit himself to enjoy without absolutely hating himself it would be easy in this case to have all that he wanted he need not send the letter he need not take this wretched journey to london looking forward as he thought that he could look judging from the girls character he believed that he would have all that he desiredall that a gracious god could give himif he would make her the recognised partner of his bed and his board then would he be proud when men should see what sort of a wife he had got for himself at last in place of catherine bailey and why should she not love him did not all her words tend to show that there was love  and then suddenly there came a frown across his face as she stood looking at him she was getting to know the manner of that frown now she stooped down to kiss it away from his brow it was a brave thing to do but she did it with a consciousness of her courage now i may burn the letter she said as though she were about to depart upon the errand  no by heaven he said let me have a sandwich and a glass of wine for i shall start in an hour  with a glance of his thoughts he had answered all those questions he had taught himself what ordinary selfishness allowed ordinary selfishnesssuch selfishness as that of which he would have permitted himself the indulgencemust have allowed him to disregard the misery of john gordon and to keep the girl to himself as far as john gordon was concerned he would not have cared for his sufferings he was as much to himselfor morethan could be john gordon he did not love john gordon and could have doomed him to tearing his hairnot without regret but at any rate without remorse he had settled that question but with mary lawrie there must be a neverdying pang of selfaccusation were he to take her to his arms while her love was settled elsewhere it was not that he feared her for himself but that he feared himself for her sake god had filled his heart with love of the girland if it was love could it be that he would destroy her future for the gratification of his own feelings i tell you it is no good he said as she crouched down beside him almost sitting on his knee  at this moment mrs baggett came into the room detecting mary almost in the embrace of her old master hes come back again sir said mrs baggett  who has come back  the sergeant  then you may tell him to go about his business he is not wanted at any rate you are to remain here and have your own way like an old fool  i am that sir  there is not any one coming to interfere with you  sir  then mary got up and stood sobbing at the open window at any rate youll have to remain here to look after the house even if i go away where is the sergeant  hes in the stable again  what drunk  well no hes not drunk i think his wooden leg is affected sooner than if he had two like mine or yours sir and he did manage to go in of his self now that he knows the way hes there among the hay and i do think its very unkind of hayonotes to say as hell spoil it but how am i to get him out unless i goes away with him  let him stay there and give him some dinner i dont know what else youve to do  he cant stay alwaysin course sir as hayonotes sayswhats he to do with a woodenlegged sergeant in his stable as a permanence i had come to say i was to go home with him  youre to do nothing of the kind  what is it you mean then about my taking care of the house  never you mind when i want you to know i shall tell you then mrs baggett bobbed her head three times in the direction of mary lawries back as though to ask some question whether the leaving the house might not be in reference to marys marriage but she feared that it was not made in reference to mr whittlestaffs marriage also what had her master meant when he had said that there was no one coming to interfere with her mrs baggett you neednt ask any questions just at present mrs baggett he said  you dont mean as you are going up to london just to give her up to that young fellow  i am going about my own business and i wont be inquired into said mr whittlestaff  then youre going to do what no man ought to do  you are an impertinent old woman said her master  i daresay i am all the same its my duty to tell you my mind you cant eat me mr whittlestaff and it wouldnt much matter if you could when youve said that youll do a thing you ought not to go back for any other man let him be who it mayespecially not in respect of a female its weak and nobody wouldnt think a straw of you for doing it its some idea of being generous that you have got into your head there aint no real generosity in it i say it aint manly and thats what a man ought to be  mary though she was standing at the window pretending to look out of it knew that during the whole of this conversation mrs baggett was making signs at heras though indicating an opinion that she was the person in fault it was as though mrs baggett had said that it was for her saketo do something to gratify herthat mr whittlestaff was about to go to london she knew that she at any rate was not to blame she was struggling for the same end as mrs baggett and did deserve better treatment you oughtnt to bother going up to london sir on any such errand and so i tells you mr whittlestaff said mrs baggett  i have told him the same thing myself said mary lawrie turning round  if you told him as though you meant it he wouldnt go said mrs baggett  thats all you know about it said mr whittlestaff now the fact is i wont stand this kind of thing if you mean to remain here you must be less free with your tongue  i dont mean to remain here mr whittlestaff its just that as im coming to theres timothy baggett is down there among the hosses and he says as i am to go with him so ive come up here to say that if hes allowed to sleep it off today ill be ready to start tomorrow  i tell you i am not going to make any change at all said mr whittlestaff  you was saying you was going awayfor the honeymoon i did suppose  a man may go away if he pleases without any reason of that kind oh dear oh dear that letter is not gone i insist that that letter should go i suppose i must see about it myself then when he began to move the women moved also mary went to look after the sandwiches and mrs baggett to despatch the letter in ten minutes the letter was gone and half an hour afterwards mr whittlestaff had himself driven down to the station  what is it he means miss said mrs baggett when the master was gone  i do not know said mary who was in truth very angry with the old woman  he wants to make you mrs whittlestaff  in whatever he wants i shall obey himif i only knew how  its what you is bound to do miss mary think of what he has done for you  i require no one to tell me that  what did mr gordon come here for disturbing everybody nobody asked himat least i suppose nobody asked him there was an insinuation in this which mary found it hard to bear but it was better to bear it than to argue on such a point with the servant and he said things which put the master about terribly  it was not my doing  but hes a man as neednt have his own way why should mr gordon have everything just as he likes it i never heard tell of mr gordon till he came here the other day i dont think so much of mr gordon myself to this mary of course made no answer hes no business disturbing people when hes not sent for i cant abide to see mr whittlestaff put about in this way i have known him longer than you have  no doubt  hes a man thatll be driven pretty nigh out of his mind if hes disappointed then there was silence as mary was determined not to discuss the matter any further if you come to that you neednt marry no one unless you pleases mary was still silent they shouldnt make me marry them unless i was that way minded i cant abide such doings the old woman again went on after a pause i knows what i knows and i sees what i sees  what do you know said mary driven beyond her powers of silence  the meaning is that mr whittlestaff is to be disappointed after he have received a promise didnt he have a promise to this mrs baggett got no reply though she waited for one before she went on with her argument you knows he had and a promise between a lady and gentleman ought to be as good as the law of the land you stand there as dumb as grim death and wont say a word and yet it all depends upon you why is it to go about among everybody that hes not to get a wife just because a mans come home with his pockets full of diamonds its that that peoplell say and theyll say that you went back from your word just because of a few precious stones i wouldnt like to have it said of me anyhow  this was very hard to bear but mary found herself compelled to bear it she had determined not to be led into an argument with mrs baggett on the subject feeling that even to discuss her conduct would be an impropriety she was strong in her own conduct and knew how utterly at variance it had been with all that this woman imputed to her the glitter of the diamonds had been merely thrown in by mrs baggett in her passion mary did not think that any one would be so base as to believe such an accusation as that it would be said of her that her own young lover had come back suddenly and that she had preferred him to the gentleman to whom she was tied by so many bonds it would be said that she had given herself to him and had then taken back the gift because the young lover had come across her path and it would be told also that there had been no word of promise given to this young lover all that would be very bad without any allusion to a wealth of diamonds it would not be said that before she had pledged herself to mr whittlestaff she had pleaded her affection for her young lover when she had known nothing even of his present existence it would not be known that though there had been no lovers vows between her and john gordon there had yet been on both sides that unspoken love which could not have been strengthened by any vows against all that she must guard herself without thinking of the diamonds she had endeavoured to guard herself and she had thought also of the contentment of the man who had been so good to her she had declared to herself that of herself she would think not at all and she had determined also that all the likingsnay the affection of john gordon himselfshould weigh not at all with her she had to decide between the two men and she had decided that both honesty and gratitude required her to comply with the wishes of the elder she had done all that she could with that object and was it her fault that mr whittlestaff had read the secret of her heart and had determined to give way before it this had so touched her that it might almost be said that she knew not to which of her two suitors her heart belonged all this if stated in answer to mrs baggetts accusations would certainly exonerate herself from the stigma thrown upon her but to mrs baggett she could not repeat the explanation  it nigh drives me wild said mrs baggett i dont suppose you ever heard of catherine bailey  never  and i aint agoing to tell you its a romance as shall be wrapped inside my own bosom it was quite a tragedywas catherine bailey and one as would stir your heart up if you was to hear it catherine bailey was a young woman but im not going to tell you the storyonly that she was no more fit for mr whittlestaff than any of them stupid young girls that walks about the streets gaping in at the shopwindows in alresford i do you the justice miss lawrie to say as you are such a female as he ought to look after  thank you mrs baggett  but she led him into such trouble because his heart is soft as was dreadful to look at he is one of them as always wants a wife why didnt he get one before youll say because till you came in the way he was always thinking of catherine bailey mrs compas she become drat her and her babies i often said to myself what was compas no more than an old bailey lawyernot fit to be looked at alongside of our mr whittlestaff no more aint mr john gordon to my thinking you think of all that miss mary and make up your mind whether youll break his heart after giving a promise heartbreaking aint to him what it is to john gordon and the likes of him     chapter xx  mr whittlestaff takes his journey   mr whittlestaff did at last get into the train and have himself carried up to london and he ate his sandwiches and drank his sherry with an air of supreme satisfactionas though he had carried his point and so he had he had made up his mind on a certain matter and with the object of doing a certain piece of work he had escaped from the two dominant women of his household who had done their best to intercept him so far his triumph was complete but as he sat silent in the corner of the carriage his mind reverted to the purpose of his journey and he cannot be said to have been triumphant he knew it all as well as did mrs baggett and he knew too that except mrs baggett and the girl herself all the world was against him that ass montagu blake every time he opened his mouth as to his own bride let out the idea that john gordon should have his bride because john gordon was young and lusty and because he whittlestaff might be regarded as an old man the miss halls were altogether of the same opinion and were not slow to express it all alresford would know it and would sympathise with john gordon and as it came to be known that he himself had given up the girl whom he loved he could read the ridicule which would be conveyed by the smiles of his neighbours  to tell the truth of mr whittlestaff he was a man very open to such shafts of ridicule the robur et æs triplex which fortified his heart went only to the doing of a good and unselfish action and did not extend to providing him with that adamantine shield which virtue should of itself supply he was as pervious to these stings as a man might be who had not strength to act in opposition to them he could screw himself up to the doing of a great deed for the benefit of another and could as he was doing so deplore with inward tears the punishment which the world would accord to him for the deed as he sat there in the corner of his carriage he was thinking of the punishment rather than of the glory and the punishment must certainly come now it would be a punishment lasting for the remainder of his life and so bitter in its kind as to make any further living almost impossible to him it was not that he would kill himself he did not meditate any such step as that he was a man who considered that by doing an outrage to gods work an offence would be committed against god which admitted of no repentance he must live through it to the last but he must live as a man who was degraded he had made his effort but his effort would be known to all alresford mr montagu blake would take care of that  the evil done to him would be one which would admit of no complaint from his own mouth he would be left alone living with mrs baggettwho of course knew all the facts the idea of mrs baggett going away with her husband was of course not to be thought of that was another nuisance a small evil in comparison with the great misfortune of his life  he had brought this girl home to his house to be the companion of his days and she had come to have in his mouth a flavour as it were and sweetness beyond all other sweetnesses she had lent a grace to his days of which for many years he had not believed them to be capable he was a man who had thought much of love reading about it in all the poets with whose lines he was conversant he was one who in all that he read would take the gist of it home to himself and ask himself how it was with him in that matter his favourite horace had had a fresh love for every day but he had told himself that horace knew nothing of love of petrarch and laura he had thought but even to petrarch laura had been a subject for expression rather than for passion prince arthur in his love for guinevere went nearer to the mark which he had fancied for himself imogen in her love for posthumus gave to him a picture of all that love should be it was thus that he had thought of himself in all his readings and as years had gone by he had told himself that for him there was to be nothing better than reading but yet his mind had been full and he had still thought to himself that in spite of his mistake in reference to catherine bailey there was still room for a strong passion  then mary lawrie had come upon him and the sun seemed to shine nowhere but in her eyes and in the expression of her face he had told himself distinctly that he was now in love and that his life had not gone so far forward as to leave him stranded on the dry sandhills she was there living in his house subject to his orders affectionate and docile but as far as he could judge a perfect woman and as far as he could judge there was no other man whom she loved then with many doubtings he asked her the question and he soon learned the truthbut not the whole truth  there had been a man but he was one who seemed to have passed by and left his mark and then to have gone on altogether out of sight she had told him that she could not but think of john gordon but that that was all she would if he asked it plight her troth to him and become his wife although she must think of john gordon this thinking would last but for a while he told himself and he at his agewhat right had he to expect aught better than that she was of such a nature that when she had given herself up in marriage she would surely learn to love her husband so he had accepted her promise and allowed himself for one hour to be a happy man  then john gordon had come to his house falling upon it like the blast of a storm he had come at onceinstantlyas though fate had intended to punish him whittlestaff utterly and instantly mary had told him that she could not promise not to think of him who had once loved her when lo and behold the man himself was there who ever suffered a blow so severe as this he had left them together he had felt himself compelled to do so by the exigencies of the moment it was impossible that he should give either one or the other to understand that they would not be allowed to meet in his house they had met and mary had been very firm for a few hours there had existed in his bosom the feeling that even yet he might be preferred  but gradually that feeling had disappeared and the truth had come home to him she was as much in love with john gordon as could any girl be with the man whom she adored and the other rock on which he had depended was gradually shivered beneath his feet he had fancied at first that the man had come back as do so many adventurers without the means of making a woman happy it was not for john gordon that he was solicitous but for mary lawrie if john gordon were a pauper or so nearly so as to be able to offer mary no home then it would clearly be his duty not to allow the marriage in such case the result to him would be if not heavenly sweet enough at any rate to satisfy his longings she would come to him and john gordon would depart to london and to the world beyond and there would be an end of him but it became palpable to his senses generally that the mans fortunes had not been such as this and then there came home to him a feeling that were they so it would be his duty to make up for marys sake what was wantingsince he had discovered of what calibre was the man himself  it was at mr halls house that the idea had first presented itself to him with all the firmness of a settled project it would be he had said to himself a great thing for a man to do what after all is the meaning of love but that a man should do his best to serve the woman he loves who cares a straw for him he said to himself as though to exempt himself from any idea of general charity and to prove that all the good which he intended to do was to be done for love alone not a straw whether he shall stay at home here and have all that is sweetest in the world or be sent out alone to find fresh diamonds amidst the dirt and misery of that horrid place is as nothing as far as he is concerned i am at any rate more to myself than john gordon i do not believe in doing a kindness of such a nature as that to such a one but for her and i could not hold her to my bosom knowing that she would so much rather be in the arms of another man all this he said to himself but he said it in words fully formed and with the thoughts on which the words were based clearly established  when he came to the end of his journey he had himself driven to the hotel and ordered his dinner and ate it in solitude still supported by the ecstasy of his thoughts he knew that there was before him a sharp cruel punishment and then a weary lonely life there could be no happiness no satisfaction in store for him he was aware that it must be so but still for the present there was a joy to him in thinking that he would make her happy and in that he was determined to take what immediate delight it would give him he asked himself how long that delight could last and he told himself that when john gordon should have once taken her by the hand and claimed her as his own the time of his misery would have come  there had hung about him a dream clinging to him up to the moment of his hotel dinner by which he had thought it possible that he might yet escape from the misery of pandemonium and be carried into the light and joy of paradise but as he sat with his beefsteak before him and ate his accustomed potato with apparently as good a gusto as any of his neighbours the dream departed he told himself that under no circumstances should the dream be allowed to become a reality the dream had been of this wise with all the best intentions in his power he would offer the girl to john gordon and then not doubting gordons acceptance of her would make the same offer to the girl herself but what if the girl refused to accept the offer what if the girl should stubbornly adhere to her original promise was he to refuse to marry her when she should insist that such was her right was he to decline to enter in upon the joys of paradise when paradise should be thus opened to him he would do his best loyally and sincerely with his whole heart but he could not force her to make him a wretch miserable for the rest of his life  in fact it was she who might choose to make the sacrifice and thus save him from the unhappiness in store for him such had been the nature of his dream as he was eating his beefsteak and potatoes he told himself that it could not be so and that the dream must be flung to the winds a certain amount of strength was now demanded of him and he thought that he would be able to use it no my dear not me it may not be that you should become my wife though all the promises under heaven had been given though you say that you wish it it is a lie which may not be ratified though you implore it of me it cannot be granted it is he that is your love and it is he that must have you i love you too god in his wisdom knows but it cannot be so go and be his wife for mine you shall never become i have meant well but have been unfortunate now you know the state of my mind than which nothing is more fixed on this earth it was thus that he would speak to her and then he would turn away and the term of his misery would have commenced  on the next morning he got up and prepared for his interview with john gordon he walked up and down the sward of the green park thinking to himself of the language which he would use if he could only tell the man that he hated him while he surrendered to him the girl whom he loved so dearly it would be well for in truth there was nothing of christian charity in his heart towards john gordon but he thought at last that it would be better that he should announce his purpose in the simplest language he could hate the man in his own heart as thoroughly as he desired but it would not be becoming in him were he on such an occasion to attempt to rise to the romance of tragedy it will be all the same a thousand years hence he said to himself as he walked in at the club door     chapter xxi  the green park   he asked whether mr john gordon was within and in two minutes found himself standing in the hall with that hero of romance mr whittlestaff told himself as he looked at the man that he was such a hero as ought to be happy in his love whereas of himself he was conscious of a personal appearance which no girl could be expected to adore he thought too much of his personal appearance generally complaining to himself that it was mean whereas in regard to mary lawrie it may be said that no such idea had ever entered her mind it was just because he had come first she would have said if asked and the he alluded to would have been john gordon he had come first and therefore i had learned to love him it was thus that mary lawrie would have spoken but mr whittlestaff as he looked up into john gordons face felt that he himself was mean  you got my letter mr gordon  yes i got it last night  i have come up to london because there is something that i want to say to you it is something that i cant very well put up into a letter and therefore i have taken the trouble to come to town as he said this he endeavoured no doubt to assert his own dignity by the look which he assumed nor did he intend that mr gordon should know anything of the struggle which he had endured  but mr gordon knew as well what mr whittlestaff had to say as did mr whittlestaff himself he had turned the matter over in his own mind since the letter had reached him and was aware that there could be no other cause for seeing him which could bring mr whittlestaff up to london but a few days since he had made an appeal to mr whittlestaffan appeal which certainly might require much thought for its answerand here was mr whittlestaff with his reply it could not have been made quicker it was thus that john gordon had thought of it as he had turned mr whittlestaffs letter over in his mind the appeal had been made readily enough the making of it had been easy the words to be spoken had come quickly and without the necessity for a moments premeditation he had known it all and from a full heart the mouth speaks but was it to have been expected that a man so placed as had been mr whittlestaff should be able to give his reply with equal celerity he john gordon had seen at once on reaching crokers hall the state in which things were almost hopelessly he had made his appeal to the man who had her promise then he had met the man at mr halls house and hardly a word had passed between them what word could have been expected montagu blake with all his folly had judged rightly in bringing them together when he received the letter john gordon had remembered that last word which mr whittlestaff had spoken to him in the squires hall he had thought of the appeal and had resolved to give an answer to it it was an appeal which required an answer he had turned it over in his mind and had at last told himself what the answer should be john gordon had discovered all that when he received the letter and it need hardly be said that his feelings in regard to mr whittlestaff were very much kinder than those of mr whittlestaff to him  perhaps you wouldnt mind coming out into the street said mr whittlestaff i cant say very well what ive got to say in here  certainly said gordon i will go anywhere  let us go into the park it is green there and there is some shade among the trees then they went out of the club into pall mall and mr whittlestaff walked on ahead without a word no we will not go down there he said as he passed the entrance into st jamess park by marlborough house and led the way through st jamess palace into the green park well go on till we come to the trees there are seats there unless the people have occupied them all one cant talk here under the blazing sunat least i cant then he walked on at a rapid pace wiping his brow as he did so yes theres a seat ill be hanged if that man isnt going to sit down upon it what a beast he is no i cant sit down on a seat that another man is occupying i dont want any one to hear what ive got to say there two women have gone a little farther on then he hurried to the vacant bench and took possession of it it was placed among the thick trees which give a perfect shade on the north side of the park and had mr whittlestaff searched all london through he could not have found a more pleasant spot in which to make his communication this will do said he  very nicely indeed said john gordon  i couldnt talk about absolutely private business in the hall of the club you know  i could have taken you into a private room mr whittlestaff had you wished it  with everybody coming in and out just as they pleased i dont believe in private rooms in london clubs what ive got to say can be said better sub dio i suppose you know what it is that ive got to talk about  hardly said john gordon but that is not exactly true i think i know but i am not quite sure of it on such a subject i should not like to make a surmise unless i were confident  its about miss lawrie  i suppose so  what makes you suppose that said whittlestaff sharply  you told me that you were sure i should know  so i am quite sure you came all the way down to alresford to see her if you spoke the truth you came all the way home from the diamondfields with the same object  i certainly spoke the truth mr whittlestaff  then whats the good of your pretending not to know  i have not pretended i merely said that i could not presume to put the young ladys name into your mouth until you had uttered it yourself there could be no other subject of conversation between you and me of which i was aware  you had spoken to me about her said mr whittlestaff  no doubt i had when i found that you had given her a home and had made yourself as it were a father to her  i had not made myself her fathernor yet her mother i had loved her as you profess to do  my profession is at any rate true  i daresay you may or you maynt i at any rate know nothing about it  why otherwise should i have come home and left my business in south africa i think you may take it for granted that i love her  i dont care twopence whether you do or dont said mr whittlestaff its nothing to me whom you love i should have been inclined to say at first sight that a man groping in the dirt for diamonds wouldnt love any one and even if you did though you might break your heart and die it would be nothing to me had you done so i should not have heard of you nor should i have wished to hear of you  there was an incivility in all this of which john gordon felt that he was obliged to take some notice there was a want of courtesy in the mans manner rather than his words which he could not quite pass by although he was most anxious to do so i daresay not said he but here i am and here also is miss lawrie i had said what i had to say down at alresford and of course it is for you now to decide what is to be done i have never supposed that you would care personally for me  you neednt be so conceited about yourself  i dont know that i am said gordonexcept that a man cannot but be a little conceited who has won the love of mary lawrie  you think it impossible that i should have done so  at any rate i did it before you had seen her though i may be conceited i am not more conceited for myself than you are for yourself had i not known her you would probably have engaged her affections i had known her and you are aware of the result but it is for you to decide miss lawrie thinks that she owes you a debt which she is bound to pay if you exact it  exact it exclaimed mr whittlestaff there is no question of exacting john gordon shrugged his shoulders i say there is no question of exacting the words should not have been used she has my full permission to choose as she may think fit and she knows that she has it what right have you to speak to me of exacting  mr whittlestaff had now talked himself into such a passion and was apparently so angry at the word which his companion had used that john gordon began to doubt whether he did in truth know the purpose for which the man had come to london could it be that he had made the journey merely with the object of asserting that he had the power of making this girl his wife and of proving his power by marrying her what is it that you wish mr whittlestaff he asked  wish what business have you to ask after my wishes but you know what my wishes are very well i will not pretend to keep them in the dark she came to my house and i soon learned to desire that she should be my wife if i know what love is i loved her if i know what love is i do love her still she is all the world to me i have no diamonds to care for i have no rich mines to occupy my heart i am not eager in the pursuit of wealth i had lived a melancholy lonely life till this young woman had come to my tabletill i had felt her sweet hand upon minetill she had hovered around me covering everything with bright sunshine then i asked her to be my wifeand she told me of you  she told you of me  yes she told me of youof you who might then have been dead for aught she knew and when i pressed her she said that she would think of you always  she said so  yes that she would think of you always but she did not say that she would always love you and in the same breath she promised to be my wife i was contentedand yet not quite contented why should she think of you always but i believed that it would not be so i thought that if i were good to her i should overcome her i knew that i should be better to her than you would be  why should i not be good to her  there is an old saying of a young mans slave and an old mans darling she would at any rate have been my darling it might be that she would have been your slave  my fellowworkman in all things  you think so now but the man always becomes the master if you grovelled in the earth for diamonds she would have to look for them amidst the mud and slime  i have never dreamed of taking her to the diamondfields  it would have been so in all other pursuits  she would have had none that she had not chosen said john gordon  how am i to know that how am i to rest assured that the world would be smooth to her if she were your creature i am not assuredi do not know  who can tell as you say can i promise her a succession of joys if she be my wife she is not one who will be likely to look for such a life as that she will know that she must take the rough and smooth together  there would have been no rough with me said mr whittlestaff  i do not believe in such a life said john gordon a woman should not wear a stuff gown always but the silk finery and the stuff gown should follow each other to my taste the more there may be of the stuff gown and the less of the finery the more it will be to my wishes  i am not speaking of her gowns it is not of such things as those that i am thinking here mr whittlestaff got up from the bench and began walking rapidly backwards and forwards under the imperfect shade on the path you will beat her  i think not  beat her in the spirit you will domineer over her and desire to have your own way when she is toiling for you you will frown at her because you have business on hand or perhaps pleasure you will leave her in solitude there may a time come when the diamonds shall have all gone  if she is to be mine that time will have come already the diamonds will be sold did you ever see a diamond in my possession why do you twit me with diamonds if i had been a coalowner should i have been expected to keep my coals  these things stick to the very soul of a man they are a poison of which he cannot rid himself they are like gambling they make everything cheap that should be dear and everything dear that should be cheap i trust them not at alland i do not trust you because you deal in them  i tell you that i shall not deal in them but mr whittlestaff i must tell you that you are unreasonable  no doubt i am a poor miserable man who does not know the world i have never been to the diamondfields of course i understand nothing of the charms of speculation a quiet life with my book is all that i care forwith just one other thing one other thing you begrudge me that  mr whittlestaff it does not signify a straw what i begrudge you mr whittlestaff had now come close to him and was listening to him nor as i take it what you begrudge me before i left england she and i had learned to love each other it is so still for the sake of her happiness do you mean to let me have her  i do  you do  of course i do you have known it all along of course i do do you think i would make her miserable would it be in my bosom to make her come and live with a stupid silly old man to potter on from day to day without any excitement would i force her into a groove in which her days would be wretched to her had she come to me and wanted bread and have seen before her all the misery of poverty the stonecoldness of a governesss life had she been left to earn her bread without any one to love her it might then have been different she would have looked out into another world and have seen another prospect a comfortable home with kindness and her needs supplied would have sufficed she would then have thought herself happy in becoming my wife there would then have been no cruelty but she had seen you and though it was but a dream she thought that she could endure to wait better that than surrender all the delight of loving so she told me that she would think of you poor dear i can understand now the struggle which she intended to make then in the very nick of time in the absolute moment of the dayso that you might have everything and i nothingyou came you came and were allowed to see her and told her all your story you filled her heart full with joy but only to be crushed when she thought that the fatal promise had been given to me i saw it all i knew it i thought to myself for a few hours that it might be so but it cannot be so  oh mr whittlestaff  it cannot be so he said with a firm determined voice as though asserting a fact which admitted no doubt  mr whittlestaff what am i to say to you  you what are you to say nothing what should you say why should you speak it is not for love of you that i would do this thing nor yet altogether from love of her not that i would not do much for her sake i almost think that i would do it entirely for her sake if there were no other reason but to shame myself by taking that which belongs to another as though it were my own property to live a coward in mine own esteem though i may be the laughingstock and the butt of all those around me i would still be a man to myself i ought to have felt that it was sufficient when she told me that some of her thoughts must still be given to you she is yours mr gordon but i doubt much whether you care for the possession  not care for her up to the moment when i received your note i was about to start again for south africa south africa is no place for hernor for me either with such a wife mr whittlestaff will you not allow me to say one word to you in friendship  not a word  how am i to come and take her out of your house  she must manage it as best she can but no i would not turn her from my door for all the world could do for me this too will be part of the punishment that i must bear you can settle the day between you i suppose and then you can come down and after the accustomed fashion you can meet her at the churchdoor then you can come to my house and eat your breakfast there if you will you will see fine things prepared for yousuch as a woman wants on those occasionsand then you can carry her off wherever you please i need know nothing of your whereabouts good morning now do not say anything further but let me go my way     chapter xxii  john gordon writes a letter   when they parted in the park mr whittlestaff trudged off to his own hotel through the heat and sunshine he walked quickly and never looked behind him and went as though he had fully accomplished his object in one direction and must hurry to get it done in another to gordon he had left no directions whatever was he to be allowed to go down to mary or even to write her a letter he did not know whether mary had ever been told of this wonderful sacrifice which had been made on her behalf he understood that he was to have his own way and was to be permitted to regard himself as betrothed to her but he did not at all understand what steps he was to take in the matter except that he was not to go again to the diamondfields but mr whittlestaff hurried himself off to his hotel and shut himself up in his own bedroomand when there he sobbed alas like a child  the wife whom he had won for himself was probably more valuable to him than if he had simply found her disengaged and ready to jump into his arms she at any rate had behaved well mr whittlestaff had no doubt proved himself to be an angel perfect all roundsuch a man as you shall not meet perhaps once in your life but mary too had so behaved as to enhance the love of any man who had been already engaged to her as he thought of the whole story of the past week the first idea that occurred to him was that he certainly had been present to her mind during the whole period of his absence though not a word had passed between them and though no word of absolute love for each other had even been spoken before she had been steady to him with no actual basis on which to found her love he had known and she had been sure and therefore she had been true to him of course being a true man himself he worshipped her all the more mr whittlestaff was absolutely undoubtedly perfect but in gordons estimation mary was not far off perfection but what was he to do now so that he might approach her  he had pledged himself to one thing and he must at once go to work and busy himself in accomplishing it he had promised not to return to africa and he must at once see mr tookey and learn whether that gentlemans friends would be allowed to go on with the purchase as arranged he knew poker  hodge to be moneyed men or to be men at any rate in command of money if they would not pay him at once he must look elsewhere for buyers but the matter must be settled tookey had promised to come to his club this day and there he would go and await his coming  he went to his club but the first person who came to him was mr whittlestaff mr whittlestaff when he had left the park had determined never to see john gordon again or to see him only during that ceremony of the marriage which it might be that he would even yet escape all that was still in the distant future dim ideas as to some means of avoiding it flitted through his brain but even though he might see gordon on that terrible occasion he need not speak to him and it would have to be done then and then only but now another idea certainly very vague had found its way into his mind and with the object of carrying it out mr whittlestaff had come to the club oh mr whittlestaff how do you do again  im much the same as i was before thank you there hasnt happened anything to improve my health  i hope nothing may happen to injure it  it doesnt much matter you said something about some property youve got in diamonds and you said once that you must go out to look after it  but im not going now i shall sell my share in the mines i am going to see a mr tookey about it immediately  cant you sell them to me  the diamond sharesto you  why not to me if the thing has to be done at once of course you and i must trust each other i suppose you can trust me  certainly i can  as i dont care much about it whether i get what i buy or not it does not much matter for me but in truth in such an affair as this i would trust you why should not i go in your place  i dont think you are the man who ought to go there  i am too old im not a cripple if you mean that i dont see why i shouldnt go to the diamondfields as well as a younger man  it is not about your age mr whittlestaff but i do not think you would be happy there  happy i do not know that my state of bliss here is very great if i had bought your shares as you call them and paid money for them i dont see why my happiness need stand in the way  you are a gentleman mr whittlestaff  well i hope so  and of that kind that you would have your eyes picked out of your head before you had been there a week dont go take my word for it that life will be pleasanter to you here than there and that for you the venture would be altogether dangerous here is mr tookey at this point of the conversation mr tookey entered the halldoor and some fashion of introduction took place between the two strangers john gordon led the way into a private room and the two others followed him heres a gentleman anxious to buy my shares tookey said gordon  what the whole lot of the old stickinthemud hell have to shell down some money in order to do that if i were to be asked my opinion i should say that the transaction was hardly one in the gentlemans way of business  i suppose an honest man may work at it said mr whittlestaff  its the honestest business i know out said fitzwalker tookey but it does require a gentleman to have his eyes about him  havent i got my eyes  oh certainly certainly said tookey i never knew a gentleman have them brighter but there are eyes and eyes heres mr gordon did have a stroke of luck out therequite wonderful but because he tumbled on to a good thing its no reason that others should and hes sold his claim already if he doesnt go himselfeither to me or else to poker  hodge  im afraid it is so said john gordon  theres my darling wife who is going out with me and who means to stand all the hardship of the hard work amidst those scenes of constant laboura lady who is dying to see her babies there i am sure sir that mr gordon wont forget his promises to me and my wife  if you have the money ready  there is mr poker in a hansom cab outside and ready to go with you to the bank at once as the matter is rather pressing if you will come with him he will explain everything i will follow in another cab and then everything can be completed john gordon did make an appointment to meet mr poker in the city later on in the day and then was left together with mr whittlestaff at the club  it was soon decided that mr whittlestaff should give up all idea of the diamondfields and in so doing he allowed himself to be brought back to a state of semicourteous conversation with his happy rival well yes you may write to her i suppose indeed i dont know what right i have to say that you may or you maynt shes more yours than mine i suppose turn her out i dont know what makes you take such an idea as that in your head john gordon had not suggested that mr whittlestaff would turn mary lawrie outthough he had spoken of the steps he would have to take were he to find mary left without a home she shall have my house as her own till she can find another as she will not be my wife she shall be my daughtertill she is somebody elses wife i told you before that you may come and marry her indeed i cant help myself of course you may go on as you would with some other girlonly i wish it were some other girl you can go and stay with montagu blake if you please it is nothing to me everybody knows it now then he did say goodbye though he could not be persuaded to shake hands with john gordon  mr whittlestaff did not go home that day but on the next remaining in town till he was driven out of it by twentyfour hours of absolute misery he had said to himself that he would remain till he could think of some future plan of life that should have in it some better promise of success for him than his sudden scheme of going to the diamondfields but there was no other plan which became practicable in his eyes on the afternoon of the very next day london was no longer bearable to him and as there was no other place but crokers hall to which he could take himself with any prospect of meeting friends who would know anything of his ways of life he did go down on the following day one consequence of this was that mary had received from her lover the letter which he had written almost as soon as he had received mr whittlestaffs permission to write the letter was as follows      dear maryi do not know whether you are surprised by    what mr whittlestaff has done but i amso much so that    i hardly know how to write to you on the matter if you    will think of it i have never written to you and have    never been in a position in which writing seemed to be    possible nor do i know as yet whether you are aware of    the business which has brought mr whittlestaff to town     i suppose i am to take it for granted that all that he    tells me is true though when i think what it is that i    have to acceptand that on the word of a man who is not    your father and who is a perfect stranger to meit does    seem as though i were assuming a great deal and yet it is    no more than i asked him to do for me when i saw him at    his own house     i had no time then to ask for your permission nor had    i asked for it would you have granted it to me you had    pledged yourself and would not have broken your pledge    if i asked for your hand at all it was from him that i    had to ask how will it be with me if you shall refuse to    come to me at his bidding     i have never told you that i loved you nor have you    expressed your willingness to receive my love dear mary    how shall it be no doubt i do count upon you in my very    heart as being my own after this week of troubles it    seems as though i can look back upon a former time in    which you and i had talked to one another as though we had    been lovers may i not think that it was so may it not be    so may i not call you my mary     and indeed between man and man as i would say only that    you are not a man have i not a right to assume that it    is so i told him that it was so down at crokers hall    and he did not contradict me and now he has been the most    indiscreet of men and has allowed all your secrets to    escape from his breast he has told me that you love me    and has bade me do as seems good to me in speaking to you    of my love     but mary why should there be any mock modesty or    pretence between us when a man and woman mean to become    husband and wife they should at any rate be earnest in    their profession i am sure of my love for you and of my    earnest longing to make you my wife tell meam i not    right in counting upon you for wishing the same thing     what shall i say in writing to you of mr whittlestaff to    me personally he assumes the language of an enemy but he    contrives to do so in such a way that i can take it only    as the expression of his regret that i should be found to    be standing in his way his devotion to you is the most    beautiful expression of selfabnegation that i have ever    met he tells me that nothing is done for me but it is    only that i may understand how much more is done for you    next to meyes mary next to myself he should be the    dearest to you of human beings i am jealous already    almost jealous of his goodness would that i could look    forward to a life in which i would be regarded as his    friend     let me have a line from you to say that it is as i would    wish it and name a day in which i may come to visit you    i shall now remain in london only to obey your behests as    to my future life i can settle nothing till i can discuss    it with you as it will be your life also god bless you    my own oneyours affectionately     john gordon     we are not to return to the diamondfields i have    promised mr whittlestaff that it shall be so   mary when she received this letter retired into her own room to read it for indeed her life in publicher life that is to which mrs baggett had accesshad been in some degree disturbed since the departure of the master of the house mrs baggett certainly proved herself to be a most unreasonable old woman she praised mary lawrie up to the sky as being the only woman fitted to be her masters wife at the same time abusing mary for driving her out of the house were the marriage to take place and then abusing her also because mr whittlestaff had gone to town to look up another lover on marys behalf it isnt my fault i did not send him said mary  you could make his going of no account you neednt have the young man when he comes back he has come here disturbing us all with his diamonds in a most objectionable manner  you would be able to remain here and not have to go away with that dreadfully drunken old man this mary had said because there had been rather a violent scene with the onelegged hero in the stable  whats that to do with it baggett aint the worst man in the world by any means if he was a little cross last night he aint so always youd be cross yourself miss if you didnt get straw enough under you to take off the hardness of the stones  but you would go and live with him  aint he my husband why shouldnt a woman live with her husband and what does it matter where i live or how you aint going to marry john gordon i know to save me from timothy baggett then the letter had comethe letter from marys lover and mary retired to her own room to read it the letter she thought was perfect but not so perfect as was mr whittlestaff when she had read the letter although she had pressed it to her bosom and kissed it a score of times although she had declared that it was the letter of one who was from head to foot a man still there was room for that jealousy of which john gordon had spoken when mary had said to herself that he was of all human beings surely the best it was to mr whittlestaff and not to john gordon that she made allusion     chapter xxiii  again at crokers hall   about three oclock on that day mr whittlestaff came home the ponycarriage had gone to meet him but mary remained purposely out of the way she could not rush out to greet him as she would have done had his absence been occasioned by any other cause but he had no sooner taken his place in the library than he sent for her he had been thinking about it all the way down from london and had in some sort prepared his words during the next half hour he did promise himself some pleasure after that his life was to be altogether a blank to him he would go to that only had he made up his mind he would tell mary that she should be happy he would make mrs baggett understand that for the sake of his property she must remain at crokers hall for some period to which he would decline to name an end and then he would go  well mary he said smiling so i have got back safe  yes i see you have got back  i saw a friend of yours when i was up in london  i have had a letter you know from mr gordon  he has written has he then he has been very sudden  he said he had your leave to write  that is true he had i thought that perhaps he would have taken more time to think about it  i suppose he knew what he had to say said mary and then she blushed as though fearing that she had appeared to have been quite sure that her lover would not have been so dull  i daresay  i didnt quite mean that i knew  but you did  oh mr whittlestaff but i will not attempt to deceive you if you left it to him he would know what to sayimmediately  no doubt no doubt  when he had come here all the way from south africa on purpose to see me as he said of course he would know why should there be any pretence on my part  why indeed  but i have not answered himnot as yet  there need be no delay  i would not do it till you had come i may have known what he would say to me but i may be much in doubt what i should say to him  you may say what you like he answered her crossly and she heard the tone but he was aware of it also and felt that he was disgracing himself there was none of the halfhour of joy which he had promised himself he had struggled so hard to give her everything and he might at any rate have perfected his gift with good humour you know you have my full permission he said with a smile but he was aware that this smile was not pleasantwas not such a smile as would make her happy but it did not signify when he was gone away utterly abolished then she would be happy  i do not know that i want your permission  no no i daresay not  you asked me to be your wife  yes i did  and i accepted you the matter was settled then  but you told me of himeven at first and you said that you would always think of him  yes i told you what i knew to be true but i accepted you and i determined to love you with all my heartwith all my heart  and you knew that you would love him without any determination  i think that i have myself under more control i think that in timein a little timei would have done my duty by you perfectly  as how  loving you with all my heart  and now it was a hard question to put to her and so unnecessary and now  you have distrusted me somewhat i begged you not to go to london i begged you not to go  you cannot love two men she looked into his face as though imploring him to spare her for though she did know what was comingthough had she asked herself she would have said that she knewyet she felt herself bound to disown mr gordon as her very own while mr whittlestaff thus tantalised her no you cannot love two men you would have tried to love me and have failed you would have tried not to love him and have failed then also  then i would not have failed had you remained here and have taken me i should certainly not have failed then  i have made it easy for you my dearvery easy write your letter make it as loving as you please write as i would have had you write to me could it have been possible o mary that ought to have been my own o mary that would have made beautiful for me my future downward steps but it is not for such a purpose that a young life such as yours should be given though he should be unkind to you though money should be scarce with you though the ordinary troubles of the world should come upon you they will be better for you than the ease i might have prepared for you it will be nearer to human nature i at any rate shall be here if troubles come or if i am gone that will remain which relieves troubles you can go now and write your letter  she could not speak a word as she left the room it was not only that her throat was full of sobs but that her heart was laden with mingled joy and sorrow so that she could not find a word to express herself she went to her bedroom and took out her lettercase to do as he had bidden herbut she found that she could not write this letter should be one so framed as to make john gordon joyful but it would be impossible to bring her joy so to the surface as to satisfy him even with contentment she could only think how far it might yet be possible to sacrifice herself and him she sat thus an hour and then went back and hearing voices descended to the drawingroom there she found mr blake and kattie forrester and evelina hall they had come to call upon mr whittlestaff and herself and were full of their own news oh miss lawrie what do you think said mr blake miss lawrie however could not think nor could mr whittlestaff think of whatever is the greatest joy in the world said mr blake  dont make yourself such a goose said kattie forrester  oh but i am in earnest the greatest joy in all the world  i suppose you mean youre going to be married said mr whittlestaff  exactly how good you are at guessing kattie has named the day this day fortnight oh dear isnt it near  if you think so it shall be this day fortnight next year said kattie  oh dear no i didnt mean that at all it cant be too near and you couldnt put it off now you know because the dean has been bespoke it is a good thing to have the dean to fasten the knot dont you think so miss lawrie  i suppose one clergyman is just the same as another said mary  so i tell him it will all be one twenty years hence after all the dean is an old frump and papa does not care a bit about him  but how are you to manage with mr newface asked mr whittlestaff  thats the best part of it all mr hall is such a brick that when we come back from the isle of wight he is going to take us all in  if thats the best of it you can be taken in without me said kattie  but it is good is it not we two and her maid shes to be promoted to nurse one of these days  if youre such a fool i never will have you its not too late yet remember that all which rebukesand there were many of themmr montagu blake received with loud demonstrations of joy and so miss lawrie youre to be in the same boat too said mr blake i know all about it  mary blushed and looked at mr whittlestaff but he took upon himself the task of answering the clergymans remarks but how do you know anything about miss lawrie  you think that no one can go up to london but yourself mr whittlestaff i was up there myself yesterdayas soon as ever this great question of the day was positively settled i had to look after my own trousseau i dont see why a gentleman isnt to have a trousseau as well as a lady at any rate i wanted a new black suit fit for the hymeneal altar and when there i made out john gordon and soon wormed the truth out of him at least he did not tell me downright but he let the cat so far out of the bag that i soon guessed the remainder i always knew how it would be miss lawrie  you didnt know anything at all about it said mr whittlestaff it would be very much more becoming if you would learn sometimes to hold your tongue  then miss evelina hall struck in would miss lawrie come over to little alresford park and stay there for a few days previous to the wedding kattie forrester meant to bring down a sister with her as a bridesmaid two of the miss halls were to officiate also and it would be taken as a great favour if miss lawrie would make a fourth a great deal was said to press upon her this view of the case to which however she made many objections there was indeed a tragedy connected with her own matrimonial circumstances which did not make her well inclined to join such a party her heart was not at ease within her as to her desertion of mr whittlestaff whatever the future might bring forth the present could not be a period of joy but in the middle of the argument mr whittlestaff spoke with the voice of authority accept mr halls kindness he said and go over for a while to little alresford  and leave you all alone  im sure mr hall will be delighted if you will come too said mr blake ready at the moment to answer for the extent of his patrons house and goodnature  quite out of the question said mr whittlestaff in a tone of voice intended to put an end to that matter but i can manage to live alone for a few days seeing that i shall be compelled to do so before long by miss lawries marriage again mary looked up into his face it is so my dear this young gentleman has managed to ferret out the truth while looking for his wedding garments will you tell your papa miss evelina that mary will be delighted to accept his kindness  and gordon can come down to me said blake uproariously rubbing his hands and we can have three or four final days together like two jolly young bachelors  speaking for yourself alone said kattieyoull have to remain a jolly young bachelor a considerable time still if you dont mend your manners  i neednt mend my manners till after im married i suppose but they who knew mr blake well were wont to declare that in the matter of what miss forrester called his manners there would not be much to make his wife afraid  the affair was settled as far as it could be settled in mr gordons absence miss lawrie was to go over and spend a fortnight at little alresford just previous to kattie forresters marriage and gordon was to come down to the marriage so as to be near to mary if he could be persuaded to do so of this mr blake spoke with great certainty why shouldnt he come and spoon a bit seeing that he never did so yet in his life now i have had a lot of it  not such a lot by any means said miss forrester  according to all accounts hes got to begin it he told me that he hadnt even proposed regular doesnt that seem odd to you kattie  it seemed very odd when you did it then the three of them went away and mary was left to discuss the prospects of her future life with mr whittlestaff you had better both of you come and live here he said there would be room enough mary thought probably of the chance there might be of newcomers but she said nothing i should go away of course said mr whittlestaff  turn you out of your own house  why not i shant stay here any way i am tired of the place and though i shant care to sell it i shall make a move a man ought to make a move every now and again i should like to go to italy and live at one of those charming little towns  without a soul to speak to  i shant want anybody to speak to i shall take with me just a few books to read i wonder whether mrs baggett would go with me she cant have much more to keep her in england than i have but this plan had not been absolutely fixed when mary retired for the night with the intention of writing her letter to john gordon before she went to bed her letter took her long to write the thinking of it rather took too long she sat leaning with her face on her hands and with a tear occasionally on her cheek into the late night meditating rather on the sweet goodness of mr whittlestaff than on the words of the letter it had at last been determined that john gordon should be her husband that the fates seem to have decided and she did acknowledge that in doing so the fates had been altogether propitious it would have been very difficultnow at last she owned that truth to herselfit would have been very difficult for her to have been true to the promise she had made altogether to eradicate john gordon from her heart and to fill up the place left with a wifes true affection for mr whittlestaff to the performance of such a task as that she would not be subjected but on the other hand john gordon must permit her to entertain and to evince a regard for mr whittlestaff not similar at all to the regard which she would feel for her husband but almost equal in its depth  at last she took the paper and did write her letter as follows      dear mr gordoni am not surprised at anything that mr    whittlestaff should do which shows the goodness of his    disposition and the tenderness of his heart he is i    think the most unselfish of mankind i believe you to be    so thoroughly sincere in the affection which you express    for me that you must acknowledge that he is so if you    love me well enough to make me your wife what must you    think of him who has loved me well enough to surrender me    to one whom i had known before he had taken me under his    fostering care     you know that i love you and am willing to become your    wife what can i say to you now except that it is so it    is so and in saying that i have told you everything as    to myself of him i can only say that his regard for me    has been more tender even than that of a fatheryours    always most lovingly     mary lawrie     chapter xxiv  conclusion   the day came at last on which marys visit to little alresford was to commence two days later john gordon was to arrive at the parsonage and marys period of being spooned was to be commencedaccording to mr blakes phraseology no my dear i dont think i need go with you said mr whittlestaff when the very day was there  why not come and call  i dont much care about calling said mr whittlestaff this was exactly the state of mind to which mary did not wish to see her friend reducedthat of feeling it to be necessary to avoid his fellowcreatures  you think mr blake is silly he is a silly young man i allow but mr hall has been very civil as i am to go there for a week you might as well take me as she spoke she put her arm around him caressing him  i dont care particularly for mr blake but i dont think ill go to little alresford mary understood when he said this the second time that the thing was fixed as fate he would not go to little alresford then in about a quarter of an hour he began againi think youll find me gone when you come back again  gone where shall you have gone  im not quite comfortable here dont look so sad you dear dear girl then he crossed the room and kissed her tenderly i have a nervous irritable feeling which will not let me remain quiet of course i shall come for your marriage whenever that may be fixed  oh mr whittlestaff do not talk in that way that will be a year to come or perhaps two or three do not let it disturb you in that way or i shall swear that i will not be married at all why should i be married if you are to be miserable  it has been all settled my dear mr gordon is to be the lord of all that and though you will be supposed to have fixed the day it is he that will really fix ithe or the circumstances of his life when a young lady has promised a young gentleman the marriage may be delayed to suit the young gentlemans convenience but never to suit hers to tell the truth it will always be felt convenient that she shall be married as soon as may be after the promise has been given you will see mr gordon in a day or two and will find out then what are his wishes  do you think that i shall not consult your wishes  not in the least my dear i at any rate shall have no wishesexcept what may be best for your welfare of course i must see him and settle some matters that will have to be settled there will be money matters  i have no money said marynot a shilling he knows that  nevertheless there will be money matters which you will have the goodness to leave to me are you not my daughter mary my only child dont trouble yourself about such matters as these but do as youre bid now it is time for you to start and hayonotes will be ready to go with you having so spoken mr whittlestaff put her into the carriage and she was driven away to little alresford  it then wanted a week to the blakecumforrester marriage and the young clergyman was beginning to mix a little serious timidity with his usual garrulous high spirits upon my word you know im not at all sure that they are going to do it right he said with much emphasis to miss lawrie the marriage is to be on tuesday shes to go home on the saturday i insist upon being there on the monday it would make a fellow so awfully nervous travelling on the same day but the other girlsand youre one of them miss lawrieare to go into winchester by train on tuesday morning under the charge of john gordon if any thing were to happen to any of you only think where should i be  where should we be said miss lawrie  it isnt your marriage you know but i suppose the wedding could go on even if one of you didnt come it would be such an awful thing not to have it done when the dean is coming but mary comforted him assuring him that the halls were very punctual in all their comings and goings when any event was in hand  then john gordon came and to tell the truth mary was subjected for the first time to the ceremony of spooning when he walked up to the door across from the parsonage mary lawrie took care not to be in the way she took herself to her own bedroom and there remained with feverish palpitating heart till she was summoned by miss hall you must come down and bid him welcome you know  i suppose so but  of course you must come it must be sooner or later he is looking so different from what he was when he was here before and so he ought when one considers all things  he has not got another journey before him to south africa  without having got what he came for said miss hall then when they went down mary was told that john gordon had passed through the house into the shrubbery and was invited to follow him mary declaring that she would go alone took up her hat and boldly went after him as she passed on across the lawn she saw his figure disappearing among the trees i dont think it very civil for a young ladys young man to vanish in that way said miss hall but mary boldly and quickly followed him without another word  mary he said turning round upon her as soon as they were both out of sight among the trees mary you have come at last  yes i have come  and yet when i first showed myself at your house you would hardly receive me but this he said holding her by the hand and looking into her face with his brightest smile i had postponed my coming almost too late  yes indeed was it my fault  nonor mine when i was told that i was doing no good about the house and reminded that i was penniless what could i do but go away  but why go so far  i had to go where money could be earned considering all things i think i was quick enough where else could i have found diamonds but at the diamondfields and i have been perhaps the luckiest fellow that has gone and returned  so nearly too late  but not too late  but you were too lateonly for the inexpressible goodness of another have you thought what i owewhat you and i oweto mr whittlestaff  my darling  but i am his darling only it sounds so conceited in any girl to say so why should he care so much about meor why should you for the matter of that  mary mary come to me now and he held out both his hands she looked round fearing intrusive eyes but seeing none she allowed him to embrace her my ownat last my own how well you understood me in those old days and yet it was all without a wordalmost without a sign she bowed her head before she had escaped from his arms now i am a happy man  it is he that has done it for you  am i not thankful  how can i be thankful as i ought think of the gratitude that i owe himthink of all the love what man has loved as he has done who has brought himself so to abandon to another the reward he had thought it worth his while to wish for you must not count the value of the thing  but i do  but the price he had set upon it i was to be the comfort of his life to come and it would have been so had he not seen and had he not believed because another has loved he has given up that which he has loved himself  it was not for my sake  but it was for mine you had come first and had won my poor heart i was not worth the winning to either of you  it was for me to judge of that  just so but you do not know his heart how prone he is to hold by that which he knows he has made his own i was his own  you told him the truth when he came to you  i was his own said mary firmly had he bade me never to see you again i should never have seen you had he not gone after you himself you would never have come back  i do not know how that might be  it would have been to no good having consented to take everything from his hands i could never have been untrue to him i tell you that i should as certainly have become his wife as that girl will become the wife of that young clergyman of course i was unhappy  were you dear  yes i was very unhappy when you flashed upon me there at crokers hall i knew at once all the joy that had fallen within my reach you were there and you had come for me all the way from kimberley just for me to smile upon you did you not  indeed i did  when you had found your diamonds you thought of mewas it not so  of you only  you flatterer you dear bonny lover you whom i had always loved and prayed for when i knew not where you were you who had not left me to be like mariana but had hurried home at once for me when your mans work was donedoing just what a girl would think that a man should do for her sake but it had been all destroyed by the necessity of the case i take no blame to myself  no none  looking back at it all i was right he had chosen to want me and had a right to me i had taken his gifts given with a full hand and where were you my own one had i a right to think that you were thinking of me  i was thinking of you  yes because you have turned out to be one in a hundred but i was not to have known that then he asked me and i thought it best that he should know the truth and take his choice he did take his choice before he knew the truththat you were so far on your way to seek my hand  i was at that very moment almost within reach of it  but still it had become his he did not toss it from him then as a thing that was valueless with the truest noblest observance he made me understand how much it might be to him and then surrendered it without a word of ill humour because he told himself that in truth my heart was within your keeping if you will keep it well you must find a place for his also it was thus that mary lawrie suffered the spooning that was inflicted upon her by john gordon                                        the most important part of our narrative still remains when the day came the reverend montagu blake was duly married to miss catherine forrester in winchester cathedral by the very reverend the dean assisted by the young ladys father and it is pleasant to think that on that occasion the two clergymen behaved to each other with extreme civility mr blake at once took his wife over to the isle of wight and came back at the end of a month to enjoy the hospitality of mr hall and with them came that ladys maid of whose promotion to a higher sphere in life we shall expect soon to hear then came a period of thorough enjoyment for mr blake in superintending the work of mr newface  what a pity it is that the house should ever be finished said the bride to augusta hall because as things are now montagu is supremely happy he will never be so happy again  unless when the baby comes said augusta  i dont think hell care a bit about the baby said the bride  the writer however is of a different opinion as he is inclined to think that the reverend montagu blake will be a pattern for all fathers one word more we must add of mr whittlestaff and his future lifeand one word of mrs baggett mr whittlestaff did not leave crokers hall when october had come round he was present at marys marriage and certainly did not carry himself then with any show of outward joy he was moody and silent and as some said almost uncourteous to john gordon but before mary went down to the train in preparation of her long weddingtour he took her up to his bedroom and there said a final word to her give him my love  oh my darling you have made me so happy  you will find me better when you come back though i shall never cease to regret all that i have lost  mrs baggett accepted her destiny and remained in supreme dominion over all womenkind at crokers hall but there was private pecuniary arrangement between her and her master of which i could never learn the details it resulted however in the sending of a moneyorder every saturday morning to an old woman in whose custody the sergeant was left
