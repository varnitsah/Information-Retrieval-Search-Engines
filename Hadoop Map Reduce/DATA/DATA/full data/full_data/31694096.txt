world shall drown no more as if no judgments were in store but water  but by the stories which i tell youll heare of terrors come from hell and fires and shapes most terrible for matter  it is not long since that a child spake from the ground in a large field and made the people almost wild that heard it  of which there is a printed book wherein each man the truth may look if children speak the matters took for verdict  but this is stranger than that voice the wonders greater and the noyse and things appeare to men not boyes at woodstock  where rosamond had once a bower to keep her from queen elinour and had escapd her poysnous power by goodluck  but fate had otherwise decreed and woodstock manner saw a deed which is in hollinshed or speed chronicled  but neither hollinshed nor stow nor no historians such things show though in them wonders we well know are pickled  for nothing else is history but pickle of antiquity where things are kept in memory from stinking  which otherwise

survey the mannors and houses belonging to his majestie  london printed in the year 1660 4to   the names of the persons in the ensuing narrative mentioned with others  captain cockaine captain hart captain crook captain carelesse captain roe mr crook the lawyer mr browne the surveyor their three servants their ordinarykeeper and others the gatekeeper with the wife and servants  besides many more who each night heard the noise as sir gerrard fleetwood and his lady with his family mr hyans with his family and several others who lodged in the outer courts and during the three last nights the inhabitants of woodstock town and other neighbor villages  and there were many more both divines and others who came out of the country and from oxford to see the glass and stones and other stuffe the devil had brought wherewith to beat out the commissioners the marks upon some walls remain and many this to testifie   the preface to the ensuing narrative  since it hath pleased the almighty god out of his infinite mercy so to make us happy by restoring of our native king to us and us unto our native liberty through him that now the good may say magna temporum felicitas ubi sentire quoe velis et dicere licet quoe sentias we cannot but esteem ourselves engaged in the highest of degrees to render unto him the highest thanks we can express although surprisd with joy we become as lost in the performance when gladness and admiration strikes us silent as we look back upon the precipiece of our late condition and those miraculous deliverances beyond expression freed from the slavery and those desperate perils we dayly lived in fear of during the tyrannical times of that detestable usurper oliver cromwell he who had raked up such judges as would wrest the most innocent language into high treason when he had the cruel conscience to take away our lives upon no other ground of justice or reason the stones of london streets would rise to witness it if all the citizens were silent and with these judges had such councillors as could advise him unto worse which will less want of witness for should the many auditors be silent the press as god would have it hath given it us in print where one of them and his consciencekeeper too speaks out what shall we do with these men saith he aeger intemperans crudelem facit medicum et immedicabile vulmis ense recidendum who these men are that should be brought to such scicilian vespers the former page sets forththose which conceit utopias and have their daydreams of the return of i know not what golden age with the old line what usage when such a privy councillor had power could he expect who then had published this narrative this much so plainly shows the devil himself dislikt their doings so much more bad were they than he would have them be severer sure than was the devil to their commissioners at woodstock for he warned them with dreadful noises to drive them from their work this councillor without more ado would have all who retained conceits of allegiance to their soveraign to be absolutely cut off by the usurpers sword a sad sentence for a loyal party to a lawful king but heaven is always just the party is reprivd and do acknowledge the hand of god in it as is rightly applyd and as justly sensible of their deliverance in that the foundation which the councillor saith was already so well laid is now turned up and what he calls daydreams are come to passe that old line which as with him there seemed aliquid divini to the contrary is now restored and that rock which as he saith the prelates and all their adherents nay and their master and supporter too with all his posterity have split themselves upon is nowhere to be heard and that posterity are safely arrived in their ports and masters of that mighty navy their enemies so much encreased to keep them out with the eldest sits upon the throne his place by birthright and descent    pacatumque regit patriis virtutibus orbem  upon which throne long may he sit and reign in peace that by his just government the enemies of ours the true protestant church of that glorious martyr our late sovereign and of his royal posterity may be either absolutely converted or utterly confounded  if any shall now ask thee why this narrative was not sooner published as neerer to the times wherein the things were acted he hath the reason for it in the former lines which will the more clearly appear unto his apprehension if he shall perpend how much cruelty is requisite to the maintenance of rebellion and how great care is necessary in the supporters to obviate and divert the smallest things that tend to the unblinding of the people so that it needs will follow that they must have accounted this amongst the great obstructions to their sales of his majesties lands the devil not joining with them in the security and greater to the pulling down the royal pallaces when their chapmen should conceit the devil would haunt them in their houses for building with so ill got materials as no doubt but that he hath so numerous and confident are the relations made of the same though scarce any so totally remarkeable as this if it be not that others have been more concealed in regard of the strange circumstances as long continuances but especially the number of persons together to whom all things were so visibly both seen and done so that surely it exceeds any other for the devils thus manifesting themselves it appears evidently that there are such things as devils to persecute the wicked in this world as in the next  now if to these were added the diverse reall phantasms seen at whitehall in cromwells times which caused him to keep such mighty guards in and about his bedchamber and yet so oft to change his lodgings if those things done at st james where the devil so joald the centinels against the sides of the queens chappell doors that some of them fell sick upon it and others not taking warning by it kild one outright whom they buried in the place and all other such dreadful things those that inhabited the royal houses have been affrighted with  and if to these were likewise added a relation of all those regicides and their abettors the devil hath entered into as he did the gadarenes swine with so many more of them who hath fallen mad and dyed in hideous forms of such distractions that which hath been of this within these 12 last years in england should all of this nature our chronicles do tell with all the superstitious monks have writ be put together would make the greater volume and of more strange occurrents  and now as to the penman of this narrative know that he was a divine and at the time of those things acted which are here related the minister and schoolmaster of woodstock a person learned and discreet not byassed with factious humours his name widows who each day put in writing what he heard from their mouthes and such things as they told to have befallen them the night before therein keeping to their own words and never thinking that what he had writ should happen to be made publick gave it no better dress to set it forth and because to do it now shall not be construed to change the story the reader hath it here accordingly exposed  the 16th day of october in the year of our lord 1649 the commissioners for surveying and valuing his majesties mannorhouse parks woods deer demesnes and all things thereunto belonging by name captain crook captain hart captain cockaine captain carelesse and captain roe their messenger with mr browne their secretary and two or three servants went from woodstock town where they had lain some nights before and took up their lodgings in his majesties house after this manner the bedchamber and withdrawingroom they both lodged in and made their kitchen the presencechamber their room for dispatch of their business with all commers of the councilhall their brewhouse as of the diningroom their woodhouse where they laid in the clefts of that antient standard in the highpark for many ages beyond memory known by the name of the kings oak which they had chosen out and caused to be dug up by the roots  october 17 about the middle of the night these new guests were first awaked by a knocking at the presencechamber door which they also conceived did open and something to enter which came through the room and also walkt about that room with a heavy step during half an hour then crept under the bed where captain hart and captain carelesse lay where it did seem as it were to bite and gnaw the mat and bedcoards as if it would tear and rend the feather beds which having done a while then would heave a while and rest then heave them up again in the bed more high than it did before sometime on the one side sometime on the other as if it had tried which captain was heaviest thus having heaved some half an hour from thence it walkt out and went under the servants bed and did the like to them hence it walkt into a withdrawing room and there did the same to all who lodged there thus having welcomed them for more than two hours space it walkt out as it came in and shut the outer door again but with the clap of some mightie force these guests were in a sweat all this while but out of it falling into a sleep again it became morning first before they spake their minds then would they have it to be a dog yet they described it more to the likeness of a great bear so fell to the examining under the beds where finding only the mats scracht but the bedcoards whole and the quarter of beef which lay on the floor untoucht they entertained other thoughts  october 18 they were all awaked as the night before and now conceived that they heard all the great clefts of the kings oak brought into the presencechamber and there thumpt down and after roul about the room they could hear their chairs and stools tost from one side of the room unto the other and then as it were altogether josled thus having done an hour together it walkt into the withdrawingroom where lodged the two captains the secretary and two servants here stopt the thing a while as if it did take breath but raised a hideous one then walkt into the bedchamber where lay those as before and under the bed it went where it did heave and heave again that now they in bed were put to catch hold upon bedposts and sometimes one of the other to prevent their being tumbled out upon the ground then coming out as from under the bed and taking hold upon the bedposts it would shake the whole bed almost as if a cradle rocked thus having done here for half an hour it went into the withdrawingroom where first it came and stood at the beds feet and heaving up the beds feet flopt them down again a while until at last it heaved the feet so high that those in bed thought to have been set upon their heads and having thus for two hours entertained them went out as in the night before but with a great noise  october 19 this night they awaked not until the midst of the night they perceived the room to shake with something that walkt about the bedchamber which having done so a while it walkt into a withdrawingroom where it took up a brasse warmingpan and returning with it into the bedchamber therein made so loud a noise in these captains own words it was as loud and scurvy as a ring of five untuned bells rung backward but the captains not to seem afraid next day made mirth of what had past and jested at the devil in the pan  october 20 these captains and their company still lodging as before were wakened in this night with some things flying about the rooms and out of one room into the other as thrown with some great force captain hart being in a slumber was taken by the shoulder and shaked until he did sit up in his bed thinking that it had been one of his fellows when suddenly he was taken on the pate with a trencher that it made him shrink down into the bedclothes and all of them in both rooms kept their heads at least within their sheets so fiercely did three dozen of trenchers fly about the rooms yet captain hart ventured again to peep out to see what was the matter and what it was that threw but then the trenchers came so fast and neer about his ears that he was fain quickly to couch again in the morning they found all their trenchers pots and spits upon and about their beds and all such things as were of common use scattered about the rooms this night there were also in several parts of the room and outer rooms such noises of beating at doors and on the walls as if that several smiths had been at work and yet our captains shrunk not from their work but went on in that and lodged as they had done before  october 21 about midnight they heard great knocking at every door after a while the doors flew open and into the withdrawingroom entered something as of a mighty proportion the figure of it they knew not how to describe this walkt awhile about the room shaking the floor at every step then came it up close to the bedside where lay captains crook and carelesse and after a little pause as it were the bedcurtains both at sides and feet were drawn up and down slowly then faster again for a quarter of an hour then from end to end as fast as imagination can fancie the running of the rings then shaked it the beds as if the joints thereof had crackt then walkt the thing into the bedchamber and so plaied with those beds there then took up eight peuter dishes and bouled them about the room and over the servants in the trucklebeds then sometimes were the dishes taken up and thrown crosse the high beds and against the walls and so much battered but there were more dishes wherein was meat in the same room that were not at all removed during this in the presencechamber there was stranger noise of weightie things thrown down and as they supposed the clefts of the kings oak did roul about the room yet at the wonted hour went away and left them to take rest such as they could  october 22 hath mist of being set down the officers imployed in their work farther off came not that day to woodstock  october 23 those that lodged in the withdrawingroom in the midst of the night were awakened with the cracking of fire as if it had been with thorns and sparks of fire burning whereupon they supposed that the bedchamber had taken fire and listning to it farther they heard their fellows in bed sadly groan which gave them to suppose they might be suffocated wherefore they called upon their servants to make all possible hast to help them when the two servants were come in they found all asleep and so brought back word but that there were no bedclothes upon them wherefore they were sent back to cover them and to stir up and mend the fire when the servants had covered them and were come to the chimney in the corners they found their wearing apparrel boots and stockings but they had no sooner toucht the embers when the firebrands flew about their ears so fast that away ran they into the other room for the shelter of their coverlids then after them walkt something that stampt about the room as if it had been exceeding angry and likewise threw about the trenchers platters and all such things in the roomafter two hours went out yet stampt again over their heads  october 24 they lodged all abroad  october 25 this afternoon was come unto them mr richard crook the lawyer brother to captain crook and now deputysteward of the manner unto captain parsons and major butler who had put out mr hyans his majesties officer to entertain this new guest the commissioners caused a very great fire to be made of neer the chimneyfull of wood of the kings oak and he was lodged in the withdrawingroom with his brother and his servant in the same room about the midst of the night a wonderful knocking was heard and into the room something did rush which coming to the chimneyside dasht out the fire as with the stamp of some prodigious foot then threw down such weighty stuffe what ere it was they took it to be the residue of the clefts and roots of the kings oak close by the bedside that the house and bed shook with it captain cockaine and his fellow arose and took their swords to go unto the crooks the noise ceased at their rising so that they came to the door and called the two brothers though fully awaked and heard them call were so amazed that they made no answer until captain cockaine had recovered the boldness to call very loud and came unto the bedside then faintly first after some more assurance they came to understand one another and comforted the lawyer whilst this was thus no noise was heard which made them think the time was past of that nights trouble so that after some little conference they applied themselves to take some rest when captain cockaine was come to his own bed which he had left open he found it closely covered which he much wondered at but turning the clothes down and opening it to get in he found the lower sheet strewed over with trenchers their whole three dozen of trenchers were orderly disposed between the sheets which he and his fellow endeavoring to cast out such noise arose about the room that they were glad to get into bed with some of the trenchers the noise lasted a full half hour after this this entertainment so ill did like the lawyer and being not so well studied in the point as to resolve this the devils law case that he next day resolved to be gone but having not dispatcht all that he came for profit and perswasions prevailed with him to stay the other hearing so that he lodged as he did the night before  october 26 this night each room was better furnished with fire and candle than before yet about twelve at night came something in that dasht all out then did walk about the room making a noise not to be set forth by the comparison with any other thing sometimes came it to the bedsides and drew the curtains to and fro then twerle them then walk about again and return to the bedposts shake them with all the bed so that they in bed were put to hold one upon the other then walk about the room again and come to the servants bed and gnaw and scratch the wainscot head and shake altogether in that room at the time of this being in doing they in the bedchamber heard such strange dropping down from the roof of the room that they supposed twas like the fall of money by the sound captain cockaine not frightened with so small a noise and lying near the chimney stept out and made shift to light a candle by the light of which he perceived the room strewed over with broken glass green and some of it as it were pieces of broken bottles he had not been long considering what it was when suddenly his candle was hit out and glass flew about the room that he made haste to the protection of the coverlets the noise of thundering rose more hideous than at any time before yet at a certain time all vanisht into calmness the morning after was the glass about the room which the maid that was to make clean the rooms swept up into a corner and many came to see it but mr richard crook would stay no longer yet as he stopt going through woodstock town he was there heard to say that he would not lodge amongst them another night for a fee of 500 l  october 27 the commissioners had not yet done their work wherefore they must stay and being all men of the sword they must not seem afraid to encounter with any thing though it be the devil therefore with pistols charged and drawn swords laied by their bedsides they applied themselves to take some rest when something in the midst of night so opened and shut the window casements with such claps that it awakened all that slept some of them peeping out to look what was the matter with the windows stones flew about the rooms as if hurled with many hands some hit the walls and some the beds heads close above the pillows the dints of which were then and yet it is conceived are to be seen thus sometime throwing stones and sometime making thundering noise for two hours space it ceast and all was quiet till the morn after their rising and the maid come in to make the fire they looked about the rooms they found fourscore stones brought in that night and going to lay them together in the corner where the glass before mentioned had been swept up they found that every piece of glass had been carried away that night many people came next day to see the stones and all observed that they were not of such kind of stones as are naturall in the countrey thereabout with these were noise like claps of thunder or report of cannon planted against the rooms heard by all that lodged in the outer courts to their astonishment and at woodstock town taken to be thunder  october 28 this night both strange and differing noise from the former first wakened captain hart who lodged in the bedchamber who hearing roe and brown to groan called out to cockaine and crook to come and help them for hart could not now stir himself cockaine would faine have answered but he could not or look about something he thought stopt both his breath and held down his eyelids amazed thus he struggles and kickt about till he had awaked captain crook who half asleep grew very angry at his kicks and multiplied words it grew to an appointment in the field but this fully recovered cockaine to remember that captain hart had called for help wherefore to them he ran in the other room whom he found sadly groaning where scraping in the chimney he both found a candle and fire to light it but had not gone two steps when something blew the candle out and threw him in the chair by the bedside when presently cried out captain carelesse with a most pitiful voice come hither o come hither brother cockaine the things gone of me cockaine scarce yet himself helpt to set him up in his bed and after captain hart and having scarce done that to them and also to the other two they heard captain crook crying out as if something had been killing him cockaine snacht up the sword that lay by their bed and ran into the room to save crook but was in much more likelyhood to kill him for at his coming the thing that pressed crook went of him at which crook started out of his bed whom cockaine thought a spirit made at him at which crook cried out lord help lord save me cockaine let fall his hand and crook embracing cockaine desired his reconcilement giving him many thanks for his deliverance then rose they all and came together discoursed sometimes godly and sometimes praied for all this while was there such stamping over the roof of the house as if 1000 horse had there been trotting this night all the stones brought in the night before and laid up in the withdrawingroom were all carried again away by that which brought them in which at the wonted time left of and as it were went out and so away  october 29 their businesse having now received so much forwardnesse as to be neer dispatcht they encouraged one the other and resolved to try further therefore they provided more lights and fires and further for their assistance prevailed with their ordinary keeper to lodge amongst them and bring his mastive bitch and it was so this night with them that they had no disturbance at all  october 30 so well they had passed the night before that this night they went to bed confident and careless untill about twelve of the clock something knockt at the door as with a smiths great hammer but with such force as if it had cleft the door then entred something like a bear but seemd to swell more big and walkt about the room and out of one room into the other treading so heavily as the floare had not been strong enough to beare it when it came into the bedchamber it dasht against the beds heads some kind of glass vessell that broke in sundry pieces and sometimes would take up those pieces and hurle them about the room and into the other room and when it did not hurle the glasse at their heads it did strike upon the tables as if many smiths with their greatest hammers had been laying on as upon an anvil sometimes it thumpt against the walls as if it would beat a hole through then upon their heads such stamping as if the roof of the house were beating down upon their heads and having done thus during the space as was conjectured of two hours it ceased and vanished but with a more fierce shutting of the doors than at any time before in the morning they found the pieces of glass about the room and observed that it was much differing from that glasse brought in three nights before this being of a much thicker substance which severall persons which came in carried away some pieces of the commissioners were in debate of lodging there no more but all their businesse was not done and some of them were so conceited as to believe and to attribute the rest they enjoyed the night before this last unto the mastive bitch wherefore they resolved to get more company and the mastive bitch and try another night  october 31 this night the fires and lights prepared the ordinary keeper and his bitch with another man perswaded by him they all took their beds and fell asleep but about twelve at night such rapping was on all sides of them that it wakened all of them as the doors did seem to open the mastive bitch fell fearfully a yelling and presently ran fiercely into the bed to them in the trucklebed as the thing came by the table it struck so fierce a blow on that as that it made the frame to crack then took the warmingpan from off the table and stroke it against the walls with so much force as that it was beat flat together lid and bottom now were they hit as they lay covered over head and ears within the bedclothes captain carelesse was taken a sound blow on the head with the shoulderblade bone of a dead horse before they had been but thrown at when they peept up and mist browne had a shrewed blow on the leg with the backbone and another on the head and every one of them felt severall blows of bones and stones through the bedclothes for now these things were thrown as from an angry hand that meant further mischief the stones flew in at window as shot out of a gun nor was the bursts lesse as from without than of a cannon and all the windows broken down now as the hurling of the things did cease and the thing walkt up and down captain cockaine and hart cried out in the name of the father son and holy ghost what are you what would you have what have we done that you disturb us thus no voice replied as the captains said yet some of their servants have said otherwise and the noise ceast hereupon captains hart and cockaine rose who lay in the bedchamber renewed the fire and lights and one great candle in a candlestick they placed in the door that might be seen by them in both the rooms no sooner were they got to bed but the noise arose on all sides more loud and hideous than at any time before insomuch as to use the captains own words it returned and brought seven devils worse than itself and presently they saw the candle and candlestick in the passage of the door dasht up to the roof of the room by a kick of the hinder parts of a horse and after with the hoof trode out the snuff and so dasht out the fire in the chimnies as this was done there fell as from the ceiling upon them in the trucklebeds such quantities of water as if it had been poured out of buckets which stunk worse than any earthly stink could make and as this was in doing something crept under the high beds tost them up to the roof of the house with the commissioners in them until the testers of the beds were beaten down upon and the bedstedframes broke under them and here some pause being made they all as if with one consent started up and ran down the stairs until they came into the councel hall where two sate up abrewing but now were fallen asleep those they scared much with the wakening of them having been much perplext before with the strange noise which commonly was taken by them abroad for thunder sometimes for rumbling wind here the captains and their company got fire and candle and every one carrying something of either they returned into the presencechamber where some applied themselves to make the fire whilst others fell to prayers and having got some clothes about them they spent the residue of the night in singing psalms and prayers during which no noise was in that room but most hideously round about as at some distance  it should have been told before how that when captain hart first rose this night who lay in the bedchamber next the fire he found their book of valuations crosse the embers smoaking which he snacht up and cast upon the table there which the night before was left upon the table in the presence amongst their other papers this book was in the morning found a handful burnt and had burnt the table where it lay browne the clerk said he would not for a 100 and a 100 l that it had been burnt a handful further  this night it happened that there were six conystealers who were come with their nets and ferrets to the conyburrows by rosamonds well but with the noise this night from the mannorhouse they were so terrified that like men distracted away they ran and left their haies all ready pitched ready up and the ferrets in the conyburrows  now the commissioners more sensible of their danger considered more seriously of their safety and agreed to go and confer with mr hoffman the minister of wotton a man not of the meanest note for life or learning by some esteemed more high to desire his advice together with his company and prayers mr hoffman held it too high a point to resolve on suddenly and by himself wherefore desired time to consider upon it which being agreed unto he forthwith rode to mr jenkinson and mr wheat the two next justices of peace to try what warrant they could give him for it they both as tis said from themselves encouraged him to be assisting to the commissioners according to his calling  but certain it is that when they came to fetch him to go with them mr hoffman answered that he would not lodge there one night for 500 l and being asked to pray with them he held up his hands and said that he would not meddle upon any terms  mr hoffman refusing to undertake the quarrel the commissioners held it not safe to lodge where they had been thus entertained any longer but caused all things to be removed into the chambers over the gatehouse where they stayed but one night and what rest they enjoyed there we have but an uncertain relation of for they went away early the next morning but if it may be held fit to set down what hath been delivered by the report of others they were also the same night much affrighted with dreadful apparitions but observing that these passages spread much in discourse to be also in particulars taken notice of and that the nature of it made not for their cause they agreed to the concealing of things for the future yet this is wellknown and certain that the gatekeepers wife was in so strange an agony in her bed and in her bedchamber such noise whilst her husband was above with the commissioners that two maids in the next room to her durst not venture to assist her but affrighted ran out to call company and their master and found the woman at their coming in gasping for breath and the next day said that she saw and suffered that which for all the world she would not be hired to again  from woodstock the commissioners removed unto euelme and some of them returned to woodstock the sunday sennight after the book of valuations wanting something that was for haste left imperfect but lodged not in any of those rooms where they had lain before and yet were not unvisited as they confess themselves by the devil whom they called their nightly guest captain crook came not untill tuesday night and how he sped that night the gatekeepers wife can tell if she dareth but what she hath whispered to her gossips shall not be made a part of this our narrative nor many more particulars which have fallen from the commissioners themselves and their servants to other persons they are all or most of them alive and may add to it when they please and surely have not a better way to be revenged of him who troubled them than according to the proverb tell truth and shame the devil  there remains this observation to be added that on a wednesday morning all these officers went away and that since then diverse persons of severall qualities have lodged often and sometimes long in the same rooms both in the presence withdrawingroom and bedchamber belonging unto his sacred majesty yet none have had the least disturbance or heard the smallest noise for which the cause was not as ordinary as apparent except the commissioners and their company who came in order to the alienating and pulling down the house which is wellnigh performed    a short survey of woodstock not taken by any of the beforementioned commissioners  this survey of woodstock is appended to the preceding pamphlet   the noble seat called woodstock is one of the ancient honours belonging to the crown severall mannors owe suite and service to the place but the custom of the countrey giving it but the title of a mannor we shall erre with them to be the better understood  the mannorhouse hath been a large fabrick and accounted amongst his majesties standing

the stables by king james  about a bowshot from the gate southwest remain foundation signs of that structure erected by king henry the second for the security of lady rosamond daughter of walter lord clifford which some poets have compared to the dedalian labyrinth but the form and circuit both of the place and ruins show it to have been a house and of one pile perhaps of strength according to the fashion of those times and probably was fitted with secret places of recess and avenues to hide or convey away such persons as were not willing to be found if narrowly sought after about the midst of the place ariseth a spring called at present rosamonds well it is but shallow and shows to have been paved and walled about likely contrived for the use of them within the house when it should be of danger to go out  a quarter of a mile distant from the kings house is seated woodstook town new and old this new woodstock did arise by some buildings which henry the second gave leave to be erected as received by tradition at the suite of the lady rosamond for the use of outservants upon the wastes of the manner of bladon where is the mother church this is a hamlet belonging to it though encreased to a market town by the advantage of the court residing sometime near which of late years they have been sensible of the want of this town was made a corporation in the 11th year of henry the sixth by charter with power to send two burgesses to parliament or not as they will themselves  old woodstock is seated on the west side of the brook named glyme which also runneth through the park the town consists not of above four or five houses but it is to be conceived that it hath been much larger but very anciently so for in some old law historians there is mention of the assize at woodstock for a law made in a micelgemote the name of parliaments before the coming of the norman in the days of king ethelred  and in like manner that thereabout was a kings house if not in the same place where henry the first built the late standing pile before his for in such days those great councils were commonly held in the kings palaces some of those lands have belonged to the orders of the knights templers there being records which call them terras quas rex excambiavit cum templariis  but now this late large mannorhouse is in a manner almost turned into heaps of rubbish some seven or eight rooms left for the accommodation of a tenant that should rent the kings medows of those who had no power to let them with several high uncovered walls standing the prodigious spectacles of malice unto monarchy which ruines still bear semblance of their state and yet aspire in spight of envy or of weather to show what kings do build subjects may sometimes shake but utterly can never

to inform my readers how the manuscripts of that eminent antiquary the rev j a rochecliffe dd came into my possession there are many ways in which such things happen and it is enough to say they were rescued from an unworthy fate and that they were honestly come by as for the authenticity of the anecdotes which i have gleaned from the writings of this excellent person and put together with my own unrivalled facility the name of doctor rochecliffe will warrant accuracy wherever that name happens to be known  with his history the reading part of the world are well acquainted and we might refer the tyro to honest anthony a wood who looked up to him as one of the pillars of high church and bestows on him an exemplary character in the athenae oxonienses although the doctor was educated at cambridge englands other eye  it is well known that doctor rochecliffe early obtained preferment in the church on account of the spirited share which he took in the controversy with the puritans and that his work entitled malleus haeresis was considered as a knockdown blow by all except those who received it it was that work which made him at the early age of thirty rector of woodstock and which afterwards secured him a place in the catalogue of the celebrated century whiteand worse than being shown up by that fanatic among the catalogues of scandalous and malignant priests admitted into benefices by the prelates his opinions occasioned the loss of his living of woodstock by the ascendency of presbytery he was chaplain during most part of the civil war to sir henry lees regiment levied for the service of king charles and it was said he engaged more than once personally in the field at least it is certain that doctor rochecliffe was repeatedly in great danger as will appear from more passages than one in the following history which speaks of his own exploits like caesar in the third person i suspect however some presbyterian commentator has been guilty of interpolating two or three passages the manuscript was long in possession of the everards a distinguished family of that persuasion it is hardly necessary to say unless to some readers of very literal capacity that dr rochecliffe and his manuscripts are alike apocryphal  during the usurpation doctor rochecliffe was constantly engaged in one or other of the premature attempts at a restoration of monarchy and was accounted for his audacity presence of mind and depth of judgment one of the greatest undertakers for the king in that busy time with this trifling drawback that the plots in which he busied himself were almost constantly detected nay it was suspected that cromwell himself sometimes contrived to suggest to him the intrigues in which he engaged by which means the wily protector made experiments on the fidelity of doubtful friends and became well acquainted with the plots of declared enemies which he thought it more easy to disconcert and disappoint than to punish severely  upon the restoration doctor rochecliffe regained his living of woodstock with other church preferment and gave up polemics and political intrigues for philosophy he was one of the constituent members of the royal society and was the person through whom charles required of that learned body solution of their curious problem why if a vessel is filled brimful of water and a large live fish plunged into the water nevertheless it shall not overflow the pitcher doctor rochecliffes exposition of this phenomenon was the most ingenious and instructive of four that were given in and it is certain the doctor must have gained the honour of the day but for the obstinacy of a plain dull country gentleman who insisted that the experiment should be in the first place publicly tried when this was done the event showed it would have been rather rash to have adopted the facts exclusively on the royal authority as the fish however curiously inserted into his native element splashed the water over the hall and destroyed the credit of four ingenious essayists besides a large turkey carpet  doctor rochecliffe it would seem died about 1685 leaving many papers behind him of various kinds and above all many valuable anecdotes of secret history from which the following memoirs have been extracted on which we intend to say only a few words by way of illustration  the existence of rosamonds labyrinth mentioned in these pages is attested by drayton in the reign of queen elizabeth  rosamonds labyrinth whose ruins together with her well being paved with square stones in the bottom and also her tower from which the labyrinth did run are yet remaining being vaults arched and walled with stone and brick almost inextricably wound within one another by which if at any time her lodging were laid about by the queen she might easily avoid peril imminent and if need be by secret issues take the air abroad many furlongs about woodstock in oxfordshire draytons englands heroical epistles note a on the epistle rosamond to king henry  it is highly probable that a singular piece of phantasmagoria which was certainly played off upon the commissioners of the long parliament who were sent down to dispark and destroy woodstock after the death of charles i was conducted by means of the secret passages and recesses in the ancient labyrinth of rosamond round which successive monarchs had erected a huntingseat or lodge  there is a curious account of the disturbance given to those honourable commissioners inserted by doctor plot in his natural history of oxfordshire but as i have not the book at hand i can only allude to the work of the celebrated glanville upon witches who has extracted it as an highly accredited narrative of supernatural dealings the beds of the commissioners and their servants were hoisted up till they were almost inverted and then let down again so suddenly as to menace them with broken bones unusual and horrible noises disturbed those sacrilegious intromitters with royal property the devil on one occasion brought them a warmingpan on another pelted them with stones and horses bones tubs of water were emptied on them in their sleep and so many other pranks of the same nature played at their expense that they broke up housekeeping and left their intended spoliation only half completed the good sense of doctor plot suspected that these feats were wrought by conspiracy and confederation which glanville of course endeavours to refute with all his might for it could scarce be expected that he who believed in so convenient a solution as that of supernatural agency would consent to relinquish the service of a key which will answer any lock however intricate  nevertheless it was afterwards discovered that doctor plot was perfectly right and that the only demon who wrought all these marvels was a disguised royalista fellow called trusty joe or some such name formerly in the service of the keeper of the park but who engaged in that of the commissioners on purpose to subject them to his persecution i think i have seen some account of the real state of the transaction and of the machinery by which the wizard worked his wonders but whether in a book or a pamphlet i am uncertain i remember one passage particularly to this purpose the commissioners having agreed to retain some articles out of the public account in order to be divided among themselves had entered into an indenture for ascertaining their share in the peculation which they hid in a bowpot for security now when an assembly of divines aided by the most strict religious characters in the neighbourhood of woodstock were assembled to conjure down the supposed demon trusty joe had contrived a firework which he let off in the midst of the exorcism and which destroyed the bowpot and to the shame and confusion of the commissioners threw their secret indenture into the midst of the assembled ghostseers who became thus acquainted with their secret schemes of peculation  it is however to little purpose for me to strain my memory about ancient and imperfect recollections concerning the particulars of these fantastic disturbances at woodstock since doctor rochecliffes papers give such a much more accurate narrative than could be obtained from any account in existence before their publication indeed i might have gone much more fully into this part of my subject for the materials are amplebut to tell the reader a secret some friendly critics were of opinion they made the story hang on hand and thus i was prevailed on to be more concise on the subject than i might otherwise have been  the impatient reader perhaps is by this time accusing me of keeping the sun from him with a candle were the sunshine as bright however as it is likely to prove and the flambeau or link a dozen of times as smoky my friend must remain in the inferior atmosphere a minute longer while i disclaim the idea of poaching on anothers manor hawks we say in scotland ought not to pick out hawks eyes or tire upon each others quarry and therefore if i had known that in its date and its characters this tale was likely to interfere with that recently published by a distinguished contemporary i should unquestionably have left doctor rochecliffes manuscript in peace for the present season but before i was aware of this circumstance this little book was half through the press and i had only the alternative of avoiding any intentional imitation by delaying a perusal of the contemporary work in question some accidental collision there must be when works of a similar character are finished on the same general system of historical manners and the same historical personages are introduced of course if such have occurred i shall be probably the sufferer but my intentions have been at least innocent since i look on it as one of the advantages attending the conclusion of woodstock that the finishing of my own task will permit me to have the pleasure of reading brambletyehouse from which i have hitherto conscientiously abstained     woodstock    chapter the first     some were for gospel ministers   and some for redcoat seculars   as men most fit t hold forth the word   and wield the one and th other sword                          butlers hudibras  there is a handsome parish church in the town of woodstocki am told so at least for i never saw it having scarce time when at the place to view the magnificence of blenheim its painted halls and tapestried bowers and then return in due season to dine in hall with my learned friend the provost of  being one of those occasions on which a man wrongs himself extremely if he lets his curiosity interfere with his punctuality i had the church accurately described to me with a view to this work but as i have some reason to doubt whether my informant had ever seen the inside of it himself i shall be content to say that it is now a handsome edifice most part of which was rebuilt forty or fifty years since although it still contains some arches of the old chantry founded it is said by king john it is to this more ancient part of the building that my story refers on a morning in the end of september or beginning of october in the year 1652 being a day appointed for a solemn thanksgiving for the decisive victory at worcester a respectable audience was assembled in the old chantry or chapel of king john the condition of the church and character of the audience both bore witness to the rage of civil war and the peculiar spirit of the times the sacred edifice showed many marks of dilapidation the windows once filled with stained glass had been dashed to pieces with pikes and muskets as matters of and pertaining to idolatry the carving on the readingdesk was damaged and two fair screens of beautiful sculptured oak had been destroyed for the same pithy and conclusive reason the high altar had been removed and the gilded railing which was once around it was broken down and carried off the effigies of several tombs were mutilated and now lay scattered about the church    torn from their destined nicheunworthy meed   of knightly counsel or heroic deed  the autumn wind piped through empty aisles in which the remains of stakes and trevisses of roughhewn timber as well as a quantity of scattered hay and trampled straw seemed to intimate that the hallowed precincts had been upon some late emergency made the quarters of a troop of horse  the audience like the building was abated in splendour none of the ancient and habitual worshippers during peaceful times were now to be seen in their carved galleries with hands shadowing their brows while composing their minds to pray where their fathers had prayed and after the same mode of worship the eye of the yeoman and peasant sought in vain the tall form of old sir henry lee of ditchley as wrapped in his lace cloak and with beard and whiskers duly composed he moved slowly through the aisles followed by the faithful mastiff or bloodhound which in old time had saved his master by his fidelity and which regularly followed him to church bevis indeed fell under the proverb which avers he is a good dog which goes to church for bating an occasional temptation to warble along with the accord he behaved himself as decorously as any of the congregation and returned as much edified perhaps as most of them the damsels of woodstock looked as vainly for the laced cloaks jingling spurs slashed boots and tall plumes of the young cavaliers of this and other highborn houses moving through the streets and the churchyard with the careless ease which indicates perhaps rather an overweening degree of selfconfidence yet shows graceful when mingled with goodhumour and courtesy the good old dames too in their white hoods and black velvet gownstheir daughters the cynosure of neighbouring eyeswhere were they all now who when they entered the church used to divide mens thoughts between them and heaven but ah alice leeso sweet so gentle so condescending in thy lovelinessthus proceeds a contemporary annalist whose manuscript we have decipheredwhy is my story to turn upon thy fallen fortunes and why not rather to the period when in the very dismounting from your palfrey you attracted as many eyes as if an angel had descendedas many blessings as if the benignant being had come fraught with good tidings no creature

that i think they made me love thee better  with the house of lee had disappeared from the chantry of king john others of gentle blood and honoured lineagefreemantles winklecombes drycotts c for the air that blew over the towers of oxford was unfavourable to the growth of puritanism which was more general in the neighbouring counties there were among the congregation however one or two that by their habits and demeanour seemed country gentlemen of consideration and there were also present some of the notables of the town of woodstock cutlers or glovers chiefly whose skill in steel or leather had raised them to a comfortable livelihood these dignitaries wore long black cloaks plaited close at the neck and like peaceful citizens carried their bibles and memorandumbooks at their girdles instead of knife or sword this custom among the puritans is mentioned often in old plays and among others in the widow of watling street this respectable but least numerous part of the audience were such decent persons as had adopted the presbyterian form of faith renouncing the liturgy and hierarchy of the church of england and living under the tuition of the rev nehemiah holdenough much famed for the length and strength of his powers of predication with these grave seniors sate their goodly dames in ruff and gorget like the portraits which in catalogues of paintings are designed wife of a burgomaster and their pretty daughters whose study like that of chaucers physician was not always in the bible but who were on the contrary when a glance could escape the vigilance of their honoured mothers inattentive themselves and the cause of inattention in others  but besides these dignified persons there were in the church a numerous collection of the lower orders some brought thither by curiosity but many of them unwashed artificers bewildered in the theological discussions of the time and of as many various sects as there are colours in the rainbow the presumption of these learned thebans being in exact proportion to their ignorance the last was total and the first boundless their behaviour in the church was any thing but reverential or edifying most of them affected a cynical contempt for all that was only held sacred by human sanctionthe church was to these men but a steeplehouse the clergyman an ordinary person her ordinances dry bran and sapless pottage unfitted for the spiritualized palates of the saints and the prayer an address to heaven to which each acceded or not as in his too critical judgment he conceived fit  the elder amongst them sate or lay on the benches with their high steeplecrowned hats pulled over their severe and knitted brows waiting for the presbyterian parson as mastiffs sit in dumb expectation of the bull that is to be brought to the stake the younger mixed some of them a bolder license of manners with their heresies they gazed round on the women yawned coughed and whispered eat apples and cracked nuts as if in the gallery of a theatre ere the piece commences  besides all these the congregation contained a few soldiers some in corslets and steel caps some in buff and others in red coats these men of war had their bandeliers with ammunition slung around them and rested on their pikes and muskets they too had their peculiar doctrines on the most difficult points of religion and united the extravagances of enthusiasm with the most determined courage and resolution in the field the burghers of woodstock looked on these military saints with no small degree of awe for though not often sullied with deeds of plunder or cruelty they had the power of both absolutely in their hands and the peaceful citizen had no alternative save submission to whatever the illregulated and enthusiastic imaginations of their martial guides might suggest  after some time spent in waiting for him mr holdenough began to walk up the aisles of the chapel not with the slow and dignified carriage with which the old rector was of yore wont to maintain the dignity of the surplice but with a hasty step like one who arrives too late at an appointment and bustles forward to make the best use of his time he was a tall thin man with an adust complexion and the vivacity of his eye indicated some irascibility of temperament his dress was brown not black and over his other vestments he wore in honour of calvin a geneva cloak of a blue colour which fell backwards from his shoulders as he posted on to the pulpit his grizzled hair was cut as short as shears could perform the feat and covered with a black silk scullcap which stuck so close to his head that the two ears expanded from under it as if they had been intended as handles by which to lift the whole person moreover the worthy divine wore spectacles and a long grizzled peaked beard and he carried in his hand a small pocketbible with silver clasps upon arriving at the pulpit he paused a moment to take breath then began to ascend the steps by two at a time  but his course was arrested by a strong hand which seized his cloak it was that of one who had detached himself from the group of soldiery he was a stout man of middle stature with a quick eye and a countenance which though plain had yet an expression that fixed the attention his dress though not strictly military partook of that character he wore large hose made of calvesleather and a tuck as it was then called or rapier of tremendous length balanced on the other side by a dagger the belt was morocco garnished with pistols  the minister thus intercepted in his duty faced round upon the party who had seized him and demanded in no gentle tone the meaning of the interruption  friend quoth the intruder is it thy purpose to hold forth to these good people  ay marry is it said the clergyman and such is my bounden duty woe to me if i preach not the gospelprithee friend let me not in my labour  nay said the man of warlike mien i am myself minded to hold forth therefore do thou desist or if thou wilt do by my advice remain and fructify with those poor goslings to whom i am presently about to shake forth the crumbs of comfortable doctrine  give place thou man of satan said the priest waxing wroth respect mine ordermy cloth  i see no more to respect in the cut of thy cloak or in the cloth of which it is fashioned said the other than thou didst in the bishops rochetsthey were black and white thou art blue and brown sleeping dogs every one of you lying down loving to slumbershepherds that starve the flock but will not watch it each looking to his own gainhum  scenes of this indecent kind were so common at the time that no one thought of interfering the congregation looked on in silence the better class scandalized and the lower orders some laughing and others backing the soldier or minister as their fancy dictated meantime the struggle waxed fiercer mr holdenough clamoured for assistance  master mayor of woodstock he exclaimed wilt thou be among those wicked magistrates who bear the sword in vaincitizens will you not help your pastorworthy alderman will you see me strangled on the pulpit stairs by this man of buff and belialbut lo i will overcome him and cast his cords from me  as holdenough spoke he struggled to ascend the pulpit stairs holding hard on the banisters his tormentor held fast by the skirts of the cloak which went nigh to the choking of the wearer until as he spoke the words last mentioned in a halfstrangled voice mr holdenough dexterously slipped the string which tied it round his neck so that the garment suddenly gave way the soldier fell backwards down the steps and the liberated divine skipped into the pulpit and began to give forth a psalm of triumph over his prostrate adversary but a great hubbub in the church marred his exultation and although he and his faithful clerk continued to sing the hymn of victory their notes were only heard by fits like the whistle of a curlew during a gale of wind  the cause of the tumult was as followsthe mayor was a zealous presbyterian and witnessed the intrusion of the soldier with great indignation from the very beginning though he hesitated to interfere with an armed man while on his legs and capable of resistance but no sooner did he behold the champion of independency sprawling on his back with the divines geneva cloak fluttering in his hands than the magistrate rushed forward exclaiming that such insolence was not to be endured and ordered his constables to seize the prostrate champion proclaiming in the magnanimity of wrath i will commit every redcoat of them alli will commit him were he noll cromwell himself  the worthy mayors indignation had overmastered his reason when he made this mistimed vaunt for three soldiers who had hitherto stood motionless like statues made each a stride in advance which placed them betwixt the municipal officers and the soldier who was in the act of rising then making at once the movement of resting arms according to the manual as then practised their musketbuts rang on the church pavement within an inch of the gouty toes of master mayor the energetic magistrate whose efforts in favour of order were thus checked cast one glance on his supporters but that was enough to show him that force was not on his side all had shrunk back on hearing that ominous clatter of stone and iron he was obliged to descend to expostulation  what do you mean my masters said he is it like a decent and godfearing soldiery who have wrought such things for the land as have never before been heard of to brawl and riot in the church or to aid abet and comfort a profane fellow who hath upon a solemn thanksgiving excluded the minister from his own pulpit  we have nought to do with thy church as thou callst it said he who by a small feather in front of his morion appeared to be the corporal of the partywe see not why men of gifts should not be heard within these citadels of superstition as well as the voice of the men of crape of old and the men of cloak now wherefore we will pluck yon jack presbyter out of his wooden sentinelbox and our own watchman shall relieve the guard and mount thereon and cry aloud and spare not  nay gentlemen said the mayor if such be your purpose we have not the means to withstand you being as you see peaceful and quiet menbut let me first speak with this worthy minister nehemiah holdenough to persuade him to yield up his place for the time without farther scandal  the peacemaking mayor then interrupted the quavering holdenough and the clerk and prayed both to retire else there would he said be certainly strife  strife replied the presbyterian divine with scorn no fear of strife among men that dare not testify against this open profanation of the church and daring display of heresy would your neighbours of banbury have brooked such an insult  come come master holdenough said the mayor put us not to mutiny and cry clubs i tell you once more we are not men of war or blood  not more than may be drawn by the point of a needle said the preacher scornfullyye tailors of woodstockfor what is a glover but a tailor working on kidskini forsake you in scorn of your faint hearts and feeble hands and will seek me elsewhere a flock which will not fly from their shepherd at the braying of the first wild ass which cometh from out the great desert  so saying the aggrieved divine departed from his pulpit and shaking the dust from his shoes left the church as hastily as he had entered it though with a different reason for his speed the citizens saw his retreat with sorrow and not without a compunctious feeling as if conscious that they were not playing the most courageous part in the world the mayor himself and several others left the church to follow and appease him  the independent orator late prostrate was now triumphant and inducting himself into the pulpit without farther ceremony he pulled a bible from his pocket and selected his text from the fortyfifth psalmgird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and thy majesty and in thy majesty ride prosperouslyupon this theme he commenced one of those wild declamations common at the period in which men were accustomed to wrest and pervert the language of scripture by adapting to it modern events  see vindication of the book of common prayer against the contumelious slanders of the fanatic party terming it porridge  the author of this singular and rare tract indulges in the allegorical style till he fairly hunts down the allegory  but as for what you call porridge who hatched the name i know not neither is it worth the enquiring after for i hold porridge good food it is better to a sick man than meat for a sick man will sooner eat pottage than meat pottage will digest with him when meat will not pottage will nourish the blood fill the veins run into every part of a man make him warmer so will these prayers do set our soul and body in a heat warm our devotion work fervency in us lift up our soul to god for there be herbs of gods own planting in our pottage as ye call itthe ten commandments dainty herbs to season any pottage in the world there is the lords prayer and that is a most sweet potherb cannot be denied then there is also davids herbs his prayers and psalms helps to make our pottage relish well the psalm of the blessed virgin a good potherb though they be as some term them cockcrowed pottage yet they are as sweet as good as dainty and as fresh as they were at first the sun hath not made them sour with its heat neither hath the cold water taken away their vigour and strength compare them with the scriptures and see if they be not as well seasoned and crumbed if you find any thing in them that is either too salt too fresh or too bitter that herb shall be taken out and better put in if it can be got or none and as in kitchen pottage there are many good herbs so there is likewise in this church pottage as ye call it for first there is in kitchen pottage good water to make them so on the contrary in the other pottage there is the water of life 2 there is salt to season them so in the other is a prayer of grace to season their hearts 3 there is oatmeal to nourish the body in the other is the bread of life 4 there is thyme in them to relish them and it is very wholesomein the other is the wholesome exhortation not to harden our heart while it is called today this relisheth well 5 there is a small onion to give a tastein the other is a good herb called lord have mercy on us these and many other holy herbs are contained in it all boiling in the heart of man will make as good pottage as the world can afford especially if you use these herbs for digestion the herb repentance the herb grace the herb faith the herb love the herb hope the herb good works the herb feeling the herb zeal the herb fervency the herb ardency the herb constancy with many more of this nature most excellent for digestion ohe jam satis in this manner the learned divine hunts his metaphor at a very cold scent through a pamphlet of six mortal quarto pages  the language which in its literal sense was applied to king david and typically referred to the coming of the messiah was in the opinion of the military orator most properly to be interpreted of oliver cromwell the victorious general of the infant commonwealth which was never destined to come of age gird on thy sword exclaimed the preacher emphatically and was not that a pretty bit of steel as ever dangled from a corslet or rung against a steel saddle ay ye prick up your

cuckoldy priest of godstow you would have us think i warrant me that you wrought it and welded it grinded and polished it and all the while it never came on a woodstock stithy you were all too busy making whittles for the lazy crapemen of oxford bouncing priests whose eyes were so closed up with fat that they could not see destruction till she had them by the throat but i can tell you where the sword was forged and tempered and welded and grinded and polished when you were as i said before making whittles for false priests and daggers for dissolute gd dnme cavaliers to cut the people of englands throats withit was forged at long marston moor where blows went faster than ever rung hammer on anviland it was tempered at naseby in the best blood of the cavaliersand it was welded in ireland against the walls of droghedaand it was grinded on scottish lives at dunbarand now of late it was polished in worcester till it shines as bright as the sun in the middle heaven and there is no light in england that shall come nigh unto it  here the military part of the congregation raised a hum of approbation which being a sound like the hear hear of the british house of commons was calculated to heighten the enthusiasm of the orator by intimating the sympathy of the audience and then resumed the preacher rising in energy as he found that his audience partook in these feelings what saith the textride on prosperouslydo not stopdo not call a haltdo not quit the saddlepursue the scattered flierssound the trumpetnot a levant or a flourish but a point of warsound boot and

undoubtednever has defeat come near thy leadingstaff nor disaster attended thy banner ride on flower of englands soldiers ride on chosen leader of gods champions gird up the loins of thy resolution and be steadfast to the mark of thy high calling  another deep and stern hum echoed by the ancient embowd arches of the old chantry gave him an opportunity of an instants repose when the people of woodstock heard him and not without anxiety turn the stream of his oratory into another channel  but wherefore ye people of woodstock do i say these things to you who claim no portion in our david no interest in englands son of jesseyou who were fighting as well as your might could and it was not very formidable for the late man under that old bloodthirsty papist sir jacob astonare you not now plotting or ready to plot for the restoring as ye call it of the young man the unclean son of the slaughtered tyrantthe fugitive after whom the true hearts of england are now following that they may take and slay himwhy should your rider turn his bridle our way say you in your hearts we will none of him if we may help ourselves we will rather turn us to wallow in the mire of monarchy with the sow that was washed but newly come men of woodstock i will ask and do you answer me hunger ye still after the fleshpots of the monks of godstow and ye will say naybut wherefore except that the pots are cracked and broken and the fire is extinguished wherewith thy oven used to boil and again i ask drink ye still of the well of fornications of the fair rosamondye will say naybut wherefore  here the orator ere he could answer the question in his own way was surprised by the following reply very pithily pronounced by one of the congregationbecause you and the like of you have left us no brandy to mix with it  all eyes turned to the audacious speaker who stood beside one of the thick sturdy saxon pillars which he himself somewhat resembled being short of stature but very strongly made a squat broad little john sort of figure leaning on a quarterstaff and wearing a jerkin which though now sorely stained and discoloured had once been of the lincoln green and showed remnants of having been laced there was an air of careless good humoured audacity about the fellow and though under military restraint there were some of the citizens who could not help crying outwell said joceline joliffe  jolly joceline call ye him proceeded the preacher without showing either confusion or displeasure at the interruptioni will make him joceline of the jail if he interrupts me again one of your parkkeepers i warrant that can never forget they have borne c r upon their badges and buglehorns even as a dog bears his owners name on his collara pretty emblem for christian men but the brute beast hath the better of himthe brute weareth his own coat and the caitiff thrall wears his masters i have seen such a wag make a ropes end wag ere nowwhere was ioh rebuking you for your backslidings men of woodstockyes then ye will say ye have renounced popery and ye have renounced prelacy and then ye wipe your mouth like pharisees as ye are and who but you for purity of religion but i tell you ye are but like jehu the son of nimshi who broke down the house of baal yet departed not from the sins of jeroboam even so ye eat not fish on friday with the blinded papists nor mincedpies on the 25th day of december like the slothful prelatists but ye will gorge on sackposset each night in the year with your blind presbyterian guide and ye will speak evil of dignities and revile the commonwealth and ye will glorify yourselves in your park of woodstock and say was it not walled in first of any other in england and that by henry son of william called the conqueror and ye have a princely lodge therein and call the same a royal lodge and ye have an oak which ye call the kings oak and ye steal and eat the venison of the park and ye say this is the kings venison we will wash it down with a cup to the kings healthbetter we eat it than those roundheaded commonwealth knaves but listen unto me and take warning for these things come we to controversy with you and our name shall be a cannonshot before which your lodge in the pleasantness whereof ye take pastime shall be blown into ruins and we will be as a wedge to split asunder the kings oak into billets to heat a brown bakers oven and we will dispark your park and slay your deer and eat them ourselves neither shall you have any portion thereof whether in neck or haunch ye shall not haft a tenpenny knife with the horns thereof neither shall ye cut a pair of breeches out of the hide for all ye be cutlers and glovers and ye shall have no comfort or support neither from the sequestered traitor henry lee who called himself ranger of woodstock nor from any on his behalf for they are coming hither who shall be called mahershalalhashbaz because he maketh haste to the spoil  here ended the wild effusion the latter part of which fell heavy on the souls of the poor citizens of woodstock as tending to confirm a report of an unpleasing nature which had been lately circulated the communication with london was indeed slow and the news which it transmitted were uncertain no less uncertain were the times themselves and the rumours which were circulated exaggerated by the hopes and fears of so many various factions but the general stream of report so far as woodstock was concerned had of late run uniformly in one direction day after day they had been informed that the fatal fiat of parliament had gone out for selling the park of woodstock destroying its lodge disparking its forest and erasing as far as they could be erased all traces of its ancient fame many of the citizens were likely to be sufferers on this occasion as several of them enjoyed either by sufferance or right various convenient privileges of pasturage cutting firewood and the like in the royal chase and all the inhabitants of the little borough were hurt to think that the scenery of the place was to be destroyed its edifices ruined and its honours rent away this is a patriotic sensation often found in such places which ancient distinctions and longcherished recollections of former days render so different from towns of recent date the natives of woodstock felt it in the fullest force they had trembled at the anticipated calamity but now when it was announced by the appearance of those dark stern and at the same time omnipotent soldiersnow that they heard it proclaimed by the mouth of one of their military preachersthey considered their fate as inevitable the causes of disagreement among themselves were for the time forgotten as the congregation dismissed without psalmody or benediction went slowly and mournfully homeward each to his own place of abode                                         chapter the second     come forth old manthy daughters side     is now the fitting place for thee   when time hath quelld the oaks bold pride     the youthful tendril yet may hide       the ruins of the parent tree  when the sermon was ended the military orator wiped his brow for notwithstanding the coolness of the weather he was heated with the vehemence of his speech and action he then descended from the pulpit and spoke a word or two to the corporal who commanded the party of soldiers who replying by a sober nod of intelligence drew his men together and marched them in order to their quarters in the town  the preacher himself as if nothing extraordinary had happened left the church and sauntered through the streets of woodstock with the air of a stranger who was viewing the town without seeming to observe that he was himself in his turn anxiously surveyed by the citizens whose furtive yet frequent glances seemed to regard him as something alike suspected and dreadful yet on no account to be provoked he heeded them not but stalked on in the manner affected by the distinguished fanatics of the day a stiff solemn pace a severe and at the same time a contemplative look like that of a man discomposed at the interruptions which earthly objects forced upon him obliging him by their intrusion to withdraw his thoughts for an instant from celestial things innocent pleasures of what kind soever they held in suspicion and contempt and innocent mirth they abominated it was however a cast of mind that formed men for great and manly actions as it adopted principle and that of an unselfish character for the ruling motive instead of the gratification of passion some of these men were indeed hypocrites using the cloak of religion only as a covering for their ambition but many really possessed the devotional character and the severe republican virtue which others only affected by far the greater number hovered between these extremes felt to a certain extent the power of religion and complied with the times in affecting a great deal  the individual whose pretensions to sanctity written as they were upon his brow and gait have given rise to the above digression reached at length the extremity of the principal street which terminates upon the park of woodstock a battlemented portal of gothic appearance defended the entrance to the avenue it was of mixed architecture but on the whole though composed of the styles of the different ages when it had received additions had a striking and imposing effect an immense gate composed of rails of hammered iron with many a flourish and scroll displaying as its uppermost ornament the illfated cipher of c r was now decayed being partly wasted with rust partly by violence  the stranger paused as if uncertain whether he should demand or assay entrance he looked through the grating down an avenue skirted by majestic oaks which led onward with a gentle curve as if into the depths of some ample and ancient forest the wicket of the large iron gate being left unwittingly open the soldier was tempted to enter yet with some hesitation as he that intrudes upon ground which he conjectures may be prohibitedindeed his manner showed more reverence for the scene than could have been expected from his condition and character he slackened his stately and consequential pace and at length stood still and looked around him  not far from the gate he saw rising from the trees one or two ancient and venerable turrets bearing each its own vane of rare device glittering in the autumn sun these indicated the ancient hunting seat or lodge as it was called which had since the time of henry ii been occasionally the residence of the english monarchs when it pleased them to visit the woods of oxford which then so abounded with game that according to old fuller huntsmen and falconers were nowhere better pleased the situation which the lodge occupied was a piece of flat ground now planted with sycamores not far from the entrance to that magnificent spot where the spectator first stops to gaze upon blenheim to think of marlboroughs victories and to applaud or criticise the cumbrous magnificence of vanburghs style  there too paused our military preacher but with other thoughts and for other purpose than to admire the scene around him it was not long afterwards when he beheld two persons a male and a female approaching slowly and so deeply engaged in their own conversation that they did not raise their eyes to observe that there stood a stranger in the path before them the soldier took advantage of their state of abstraction and desirous at once to watch their motions and avoid their observation he glided beneath one of the huge trees which skirted the path and whose boughs sweeping the ground on every side ensured him against discovery unless in case of an actual search  in the meantime the gentleman and lady continued to advance directing their course to a rustic seat which still enjoyed the sunbeams and was placed adjacent to the tree where the stranger was concealed  the man was elderly yet seemed bent more by sorrow and infirmity than by the weight of years he wore a mourning cloak over a dress of the same melancholy colour cut in that picturesque form which vandyck has rendered immortal but although the dress was handsome it was put on with a carelessness which showed the mind of the wearer ill at ease his aged yet still handsome countenance had the same air of consequence which distinguished his dress and his gait a striking part of his appearance was a long white beard which descended far over the breast of his slashed doublet and looked singular from its contrast in colour with his habit  the young lady by whom this venerable gentleman seemed to be in some degree supported as they walked arm in arm was a slight and sylphlike form with a person so delicately made and so beautiful in countenance that it seemed the earth on which she walked was too grossly massive a support for a creature so aerial but mortal beauty must share human sorrows the eyes of the beautiful being showed tokens of tears her colour was heightened as she listened to her aged companion and it was plain from his melancholy yet displeased look that the conversation was as distressing to himself as to her when they sate down on the bench we have mentioned the gentlemans discourse could be distinctly overheard by the eavesdropping soldier but the answers of the young lady reached his ear rather less distinctly  it is not to be endured said the old man passionately it would stir up a paralytic wretch to start up a soldier my people have been thinned i grant you or have fallen off from me in these timesi owe them no grudge for it poor knaves what should they do waiting on me when the pantry has no bread and the buttery no ale but we have still about us some rugged foresters of the old woodstock breedold as myself most of themwhat of that old wood seldom warps in the wettingi will hold out the old house and it will not be the first time that i have held it against ten times the strength that we hear of now  alas my dear fathersaid the young lady in a tone which seemed to intimate his proposal of defence to be altogether desperate  and why alas said the gentleman angrily is it because i shut my door against a score or two of these bloodthirsty hypocrites  but their masters can as easily send a regiment or an army if they will replied the lady and what good would your present defence do excepting to exasperate them to your utter destruction  be it so alice replied her father i have lived my time and beyond it i have outlived the kindest and most princelike of masters what do i do on the earth since the dismal thirtieth of january the parricide of that day was a signal to all true servants of charles stewart to avenge his death or die as soon after as they could find a worthy opportunity  do not speak thus sir said alice lee it does not become your gravity and your worth to throw away that life which may yet be of service to your king and countryit will not and cannot always be thus england will not long endure the rulers which these bad times have assigned her in the meanwhilehere a few words escaped the listeners earsand beware of that impatience which makes bad worse  worse exclaimed the impatient old man what can be worse is it not at the worst already will not these people expel us from the only shelter we have leftdilapidate what remains of royal property under my chargemake the palace of princes into a den of thieves and then wipe their mouths and thank god as if they had done an almsdeed  still said his daughter there is hope behind and i trust the king is ere this out of their reachwe have reason to think well of my brother alberts safety  ay albert there again said the old man in a tone of reproach had it not been for thy entreaties i had gone to worcester myself but i must needs lie here like a worthless hound when the hunt is up when who knows what service i might have shown an old mans head is sometimes useful when his arm is but little worth but you and albert were so desirous that he should go aloneand now who can say what has become of him  nay nay father said alice we have good hope that albert escaped from that fatal day young abney saw him a mile from the field  young abney lied i believe said the father in the same humour of contradictionyoung abneys tongue seems quicker than his hands but far slower than his horses heels when he leaves the roundheads behind him i would rather alberts dead body were laid between charles and cromwell than hear he fled as early as young abney  my dearest father said the young lady weeping as she spoke what can i say to comfort you  comfort me sayst thou girl i am sick of comfortan honourable death with the ruins of woodstock for my monument were the only comfort to old henry lee yes by the memory of my fathers i will make good the lodge against these rebellious robbers  yet be ruled dearest father said the maiden and submit to that which we cannot gainsay my uncle everard  here the old man caught at her unfinished words thy uncle everard wenchwell get onwhat of thy precious and loving uncle everard  nothing sir she said if the subject displeases you  displeases me he replied why should it displease me or if it did why shouldst thou or any one affect to care about it what is it that hath happened of late yearswhat is it can be thought to happen that astrologer can guess at which can give pleasure to us  fate she replied may have in store the joyful restoration of our banished prince  too late for my time alice said the knight if there be such a white page in the heavenly book it will not be turned until long after my daybut i see thou wouldst escape mein a word what of thy uncle everard  nay sir said alice god knows i would rather be silent for ever than speak what might as you would take it add to your present distemperature  distemperature said her father oh thou art a sweet lipped physician and wouldst i warrant me drop nought but sweet balm and honey and oil on my distemperatureif that is the phrase for an old mans ailment when he is wellnigh heartbrokenonce more what of thy uncle everard  his last words were uttered in a high and peevish tone of voice and alice lee answered her father in a trembling and submissive tone  i only meant to say sir that i am well assured that my uncle everard when we quit this place  that is to say when we are kicked out of it by cropeared canting villains like himselfbut on with thy bountiful unclewhat will he dowill he give us the remains of his worshipful and economical housekeeping the fragments of a thricesacked capon twice aweek and a plentiful fast on the other five dayswill he give us beds beside his halfstarved nags and put them under a short allowance of straw that his sisters husbandthat i should have called my deceased angel by such a nameand his sisters daughter may not sleep on the stones or will he send us a noble each with a warning to make it last for he had never known the readypenny so hard to come by or what else will your uncle everard do for us get us a furlough to beg why i can do that without him  you misconstrue him much answered alice with more spirit than she had hitherto displayed and would you but question your own heart you would acknowledgei speak with reverencethat your tongue utters what your better judgment would disown my uncle everard is neither a miser nor a hypocriteneither so fond of the goods of this world that he would not supply our distresses amply nor so wedded to fanatical opinions as to exclude charity for other sects beside his own  ay ay the church of england is a sect with him i doubt not and perhaps with thee too alice said the knight what is a muggletonian or a ranter or a brownist but a sectary and thy phrase places them all with jack presbyter himself on the same footing with our learned prelates and religious clergy such is the cant of the day thou livest in and why shouldst thou not talk like one of the wise virgins and psalmsinging sisters since though thou hast a profane old cavalier for a father thou art own niece to pious uncle everard  if you speak thus my dear father said alice what can i answer you hear me but one patient word and i shall have discharged my uncle everards commission  oh it is a commission then surely i suspected so much from the beginningnay have some sharp guess touching the ambassador also come madam the mediator do your errand and you shall have no reason to complain of my patience  then sir replied his daughter my uncle everard desires you would be courteous to the commissioners who come here to sequestrate the parks and the property or at least heedfully to abstain from giving them obstacle or opposition it can he says do no good even on your own principles and it will give a pretext for proceeding against you as one in the worst degree of malignity which he thinks may otherwise be prevented nay he has good hope that if you follow his counsel the committee may through the interest he possesses be inclined to remove the sequestration of your estate on a moderate line thus says my uncle and having communicated his advice i have no occasion to urge your patience with farther argument  it is well thou dost not alice answered sir henry lee in a tone of suppressed anger for by the blessed rood thou hast well nigh led me into the heresy of thinking thee no daughter of mineah my beloved companion who art now far from the sorrows and cares of this weary world couldst thou have thought that the daughter thou didst clasp to thy bosom would like the wicked wife of job become a temptress to her father in the hour of affliction and recommend to him to make his conscience truckle to his interest and to beg back at the bloody hands of his masters and perhaps his sons murderers a wretched remnant of the royal property he has been robbed ofwhy wench if i must beg thinkst thou i will sue to those who have made me a mendicant no i will never show my grey beard worn in sorrow for my sovereigns death to move the compassion of some proud sequestrator who perhaps was one of the parricides no if henry lee must sue for food it shall be of some sound loyalist like himself who having but half a loaf remaining will not nevertheless refuse to share it with him for his daughter she may wander her own way which leads her to a refuge with her wealthy roundhead kinsfolk but let her no more call him father whose honest indigence she has refused to share  you do me injustice sir answered the young lady with a voice animated yet faltering cruel injustice god knows your way is my way though it lead to ruin and beggary and while you tread it my arm shall support you while you will accept an aid so feeble  thou wordst me girl answered the old cavalier thou wordst me as will shakspeare saysthou speakest of lending me thy arm but thy secret thought is thyself to hang upon markham everards  my father my father answered alice in a tone of deep grief what can thus have altered your clear judgment and kindly heartaccursed be these civil commotions not only do they destroy mens bodies but they pervert their souls and the brave the noble the generous become suspicious harsh and mean why upbraid me with markham everard have i seen or spoke to him since you forbid him my company with terms less kindi will speak it trulythan was due even to the relationship betwixt you why think i would sacrifice to that young man my duty to you know that were i capable of such criminal weakness markham everard were the first to despise me for it  she put her handkerchief to her eyes but she could not hide her sobs nor conceal the distress they intimated the old man was moved  i cannot tell he said what to think of it thou seemst sincere and wert ever a good and kindly daughterhow thou hast let that rebel youth creep into thy heart i wot not perhaps it is a punishment on me who thought the loyalty of my house was like undefiled ermine yet here is a damned spot and on the fairest gem of allmy own dear alice but do not weepwe have enough to vex us where is it that shakspeare hath it    gentle daughter   give even way unto my rough affairs   put you not on the temper of the times   nor be like them to percy troublesome  i am glad answered the young lady to hear you quote your favourite again sir our little jars are ever wellnigh ended when shakspeare comes in play  his book was the closetcompanion of my blessed master said sir henry lee after the bible with reverence for naming them together he felt more comfort in it than in any other and as i have shared his disease why it is natural i should take his medicine albeit i pretend not to my masters art in explaining the dark passages for i am but a rude man and rustically brought up to arms and hunting  you have seen shakspeare yourself sir said the young lady  silly wench replied the knight he died when i was a mere childthou hast heard me say so twenty times but thou wouldst lead the old man away from the tender subject well though i am not blind i can shut my eyes and follow ben jonson i knew and could tell thee many a tale of our meetings at the mermaid where if there was much wine there was much wit also we did not sit blowing tobacco in each others faces and turning up the whites of our eyes as we turned up the bottom of the winepot old ben adopted me as one of his sons in the muses i have shown you have i not the verses to my much beloved son the worshipful sir henry lee of ditchley knight and baronet  i do not remember them at present sir replied alice  i fear ye lie wench said her father but no matterthou canst not get any more fooling out of me just now the evil spirit hath left saul for the present we are now to think what is to be done about leaving woodstockor defending it  my dearest father said alice can you still nourish a moments hope of making good the place  i know not wench replied sir henry i would fain have a parting blow with them tis certainand who knows where a blessing may alight but then my poor knaves that must take part with me in so hopeless a quarrelthat thought hampers me i confess  oh let it do so sir replied alice there are soldiers in the town and there are three regiments at oxford  ah poor oxford exclaimed sir henry whose vacillating state of mind was turned by a word to any new subject that was suggestedseat of learning and loyalty these rude soldiers are unfit inmates for thy learned halls and poetical bowers but thy pure and brilliant lamp shall defy the foul breath of a thousand churls were they to blow at it like boreas the burning bush shall not be consumed even by the heat of this persecution  true sir said alice and it may not be useless to recollect that any stirring of the royalists at this unpropitious moment will make them deal yet more harshly with the university which they consider as being at the bottom of every thing which moves for the king in these parts  it is true wench replied the knight and small cause would make the villains sequestrate the poor remains which the civil wars have left to the colleges that and the risk of my poor fellowswell thou hast disarmed me girl i will be as patient and calm as a martyr  pray god you keep your word sir replied his daughter but you are ever so much moved at the sight of any of these men that  would you make a child of me alice said sir henry why know you not that i can look upon a viper or a toad or a bunch of engendering adders without any worse feeling than a little disgust and though a roundhead and especially a redcoat are in my opinion more poisonous than vipers more loathsome than toads more hateful than knotted adders yet can i overcome my nature so far that should one of them appear at this moment thyself should see how civilly i would entreat him  as he spoke the military preacher abandoned his leafy screen and stalking forward stood unexpectedly before the old cavalier who stared at him as if he had thought his expressions had actually raised a devil  who art thou at length said sir henry in a raised and angry voice while his daughter clung to his arm in terror little confident that her fathers pacific resolutions would abide the shock of this unwelcome apparition  i am one replied the soldier who neither fear nor shame to call myself a poor daylabourer in the great work of englandumphay a simple and sincere upholder of the good old cause  and what the devil do you seek here said the old knight fiercely  the welcome due to the steward of the lords commissioners answered the soldier  welcome art thou as salt would be to sore eyes said the cavalier but who be your commissioners man  the soldier with little courtesy held out a scroll which sir henry took from him betwixt his finger and thumb as if it were a letter from a pesthouse and held it at as much distance from his eyes as his purpose of reading it would permit he then read aloud and as he named the parties one by one he added a short commentary on each name addressed indeed to alice but in such a tone that showed he cared not for its being heard by the soldier  desboroughthe ploughman desboroughas grovelling a clown as is in englanda fellow that would be best at home like an ancient scythian under the tilt of a waggondn him harrisona bloodyminded ranting enthusiast who read the bible to such purpose that he never lacked a text to justify a murderdn him too bletsona trueblue commonwealths man one of harrisons rota club with his noddle full of new fangled notions about government the clearest object of which is to establish the tail upon the head a fellow who leaves you the statutes and law of old england to prate of rome and greecesees the areopagus in westminsterhall and takes old noll for a roman consuladad he is like to prove a dictator amongst them instead never minddn bletson too  friend said the soldier i would willingly be civil but it consists not with my duty to hear these godly men in whose service i am spoken of after this irreverent and unbecoming fashion and albeit i know that you malignants think you have a right to make free with that damnation which you seem to use as your own portion yet it is superfluous to invoke it against others who have better hopes in their thoughts and better words in their mouths  thou art but a canting varlet replied the knight and yet thou art right in some sensefor it is superfluous to curse men who already are damned as black as the smoke of hell itself  i prithee forbear continued the soldier for manners sake if not for consciencegrisly oaths suit ill with grey beards  nay that is truth if the devil spoke it said the knight and i thank heaven i can follow good counsel though old nick gives it and so friend touching these same commissioners bear them this message that sir henry lee is keeper of woodstock park with right of waif and stray vert and venison as complete as any of them have to their estatethat is if they possess any estate but what they have gained by plundering honest men nevertheless he will give place to those who have made their might their right and will not expose the lives of good and true men where the odds are so much against them and he protests that he makes this surrender neither as acknowledging of these so termed commissioners nor as for his own individual part fearing their force but purely to avoid the loss of english blood of which so much hath been spilt in these late times  it is well spoken said the steward of the commissioners and therefore i pray you let us walk together into the house that thou mayst deliver up unto me the vessels and gold and silver ornaments belonging unto the egyptian pharaoh who committed them to thy keeping  what vessels exclaimed the fiery old knight and belonging to whom unbaptized dog speak civil of the martyr in my presence or i will do a deed misbecoming of me on that caitiff corpse of thineand shaking his daughter from his right arm the old man laid his hand on his rapier  his antagonist on the contrary kept his temper completely and waving his hand to add impression to his speech he said with a calmness which aggravated sir henrys wrath nay good friend i prithee be still and brawl notit becomes not grey hairs and feeble arms to rail and rant like drunkards put me not to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence but listen to the voice of reason seest thou not that the lord hath decided this great controversy in favour of us and ours against thee and thine wherefore render up thy stewardship peacefully and deliver up to me the chattels of the man charles stewart  patience is a good nag but she will bolt said the knight unable longer to rein in his wrath he plucked his sheathed rapier from his side struck the soldier a severe blow with it and instantly drawing it and throwing the scabbard over the trees placed himself in a posture of defence with his swords point within half a yard of the stewards body the latter stepped back with activity threw his long cloak from his shoulders and drawing his long tuck stood upon his guard the swords clashed smartly together while alice in her terror screamed wildly for assistance but the combat was of short duration the old cavalier had attacked a man as cunning of fence as he himself or a little more so and possessing all the strength and activity of which time had deprived sir henry and the calmness which the other had lost in his passion they had scarce exchanged three passes ere the sword of the knight flew up in the air as if it had gone in search of the scabbard and burning with shame and anger sir henry stood disarmed at the mercy of his antagonist the republican showed no purpose of abusing his victory nor did he either during the combat or after the victory was won in any respect alter the sour and grave composure which reigned upon his countenancea combat of life and death seemed to him a thing as familiar and as little to be feared as an ordinary bout with foils  thou art delivered into my hands he said and by the law of arms i might smite thee under the fifth rib even as asahel was struck dead by abner the son of ner as he followed the chase on the hill of ammah that lieth before giah in the way of the wilderness of gibeon but far be it from me to spill thy remaining drops of blood true it is thou art the captive of my sword and of my spear nevertheless seeing that there may be a turning from thy evil ways and a returning to those which are good if the lord enlarge thy date for repentance and amendment wherefore should it be shortened by a poor sinful mortal who is speaking truly but thy fellowworm  sir henry lee remained still confused and unable to answer when there arrived a fourth person whom the cries of alice had summoned to the spot this was joceline joliffe one of the underkeepers of the walk who seeing how matters stood brandished his quarterstaff a weapon from which he never parted and having made it describe the figure of eight in a flourish through the air would have brought it down with a vengeance upon the head of the steward had not sir henry interposed  we must trail bats now jocelineour time of shouldering them is past it skills not striving against the streamthe devil rules the roast and makes our slaves our tutors  at this moment another auxiliary rushed out of the thicket to the knights assistance it was a large wolfdog in strength a mastiff in form and almost in fleetness a greyhound bevis was the noblest of the kind which ever pulled down a stag tawny coloured like a lion with a black muzzle and black feet just edged with a line of white round the toes he was as tractable as he was strong and bold just as he was about to rush upon the soldier the words peace bevis from sir henry converted the lion into a lamb and instead of pulling the soldier down he walked round and round and snuffed as if using all his sagacity to discover who the stranger could be towards whom though of so questionable an appearance he was enjoined forbearance apparently he was satisfied for he laid aside his doubtful and threatening demonstrations lowered his ears smoothed down his bristles and wagged his tail  sir henry who had great respect for the sagacity of his favourite said in a low voice to alice bevis is of thy opinion and counsels submission there is the finger of heaven in this to punish the pride ever the fault of our housefriend he continued addressing the soldier thou hast given the finishing touch to a lesson which ten years of constant misfortune have been unable fully to teach me thou hast distinctly shown me the folly of thinking that a good cause can strengthen a weak arm god forgive me for the thought but i could almost turn infidel and believe that heavens blessing goes ever with the longest sword but it will not be always thus god knows his timereach me my toledo joceline yonder it lies and the scabbard see where it hangs on the treedo not pull at my cloak alice and look so miserably frightened i shall be in no hurry to betake me to bright steel again i promise theefor thee good fellow i thank thee and will make way for thy masters without farther dispute or ceremony joceline joliffe is nearer thy degree than i am and will make surrender to thee of the lodge and household stuff withhold nothing joliffelet them have all for me i will never cross the threshold againbut where to rest for a night i would trouble no one in woodstockhumayit shall be so alice and i joceline will go down to thy hut by rosamonds well we will borrow the shelter of thy roof for one night at least thou wilt give us welcome wilt thou nothow nowa clouded brow  joceline certainly looked embarrassed directed a first glance to alice then looked to heaven then to earth and last to the four quarters of the horizon and then murmured out certainlywithout questionmight he but run down to put the house in order  order enoughorder enough for those that may soon be glad of clean straw in a barn said the knight but if thou hast an illwill to harbour any obnoxious or malignant persons as the phrase goes never shame to speak it out man tis true i took thee up when thou wert but a ragged robin as the keepers followers in the new forest are called in popular language made a keeper of thee and so forth what of that sailors think no longer of the wind than when it forwards them on the voyagethy betters turn with the tide why should not such a poor knave as thou  god pardon your honour for your harsh judgment said joliffe the hut is yours such as it is and should be were it a kings palace as i wish it were even for your honours sake and mistress alicesonly i could wish your honour would condescend to let me step down before in case any neighbour be thereororjust to put matters something into order for mistress alice and your honourjust to make things something seemly and shapely  not a whit necessary said the knight while alice had much trouble in concealing her agitation if thy matters are unseemly they are fitter for a defeated knightif they are unshapely why the liker to the rest of a world which is all unshaped go thou with that manwhat is thy name friend  joseph tomkins is my name in the flesh said the steward men call me honest joe and trusty tomkins  if thou hast deserved such names considering what trade thou hast driven thou art a jewel indeed said the knight yet if thou hast not never blush for the matter joseph for if thou art not in truth honest thou hast all the better chance to keep the fame of itthe title and the thing itself have long walked separate ways farewell to theeand farewell to fair woodstock  so saying the old knight turned round and pulling his daughters arm through his own they walked onward into the forest in the same manner in which they were introduced to the reader                                       chapter the third     now ye wild blades that make loose inns your stage   to vapour forth the acts of this sad age   stout edgehill fight the newberries and the west   and northern clashes where you still fought best   your strange escapes your dangers void of fear   when bullets flew between the head and ear   whether you fought by damme or the spirit   of you i speak    legend of captain jones  joseph tomkins and joliffe the keeper remained for some time in silence as they stood together looking along the path in which the figures of the knight of ditchley and pretty mistress alice had disappeared behind the trees they then gazed on each other in doubt as men who scarce knew whether they stood on hostile or on friendly terms together and were at a loss how to open a conversation they heard the knights whistle summon bevis but though the good hound turned his head and pricked his ears at the sound yet he did not obey the call but continued to snuff around joseph tomkinss cloak  thou art a rare one i fear me said the keeper looking to his new acquaintance i have heard of men who have charms to steal both dogs and deer  trouble not thyself about my qualities friend said joseph tomkins but bethink thee of doing thy masters bidding  joceline did not immediately answer but at length as if in sign of truce stuck the end of his quarterstaff upright in the ground and leant upon it as he said grufflyso my tough old knight and you were at drawn bilbo by way of afternoon service sir preacherwell for you i came not up till the blades were done jingling or i had rung evensong upon your pate  the independent smiled grimly as he replied nay friend it is well for thyself for never should sexton have been better paid for the knell he tolled nevertheless why should there be war betwixt us or my hand be against thine thou art but a poor knave doing thy masters order nor have i any desire that my own blood or thine should be shed touching this matterthou art i understand to give me peaceful possession of the palace of woodstock so calledthough there is now no palace in england no nor shall be in the days that come after until we shall enter the palace of the new jerusalem and the reign of the saints shall commence on earth  pretty well begun already friend tomkins said the keeper you are little short of being kings already upon the matter as it now stands and for your jerusalem i wot not but woodstock is a pretty nestegg to begin withwell will you shogwill you onwill you take sasine and liveryyou heard my orders  umphi know not said tomkins i must beware of ambuscades and i am alone here moreover it is the high thanksgiving appointed by parliament and owned to by the armyalso the old man and the young woman may want to recover some of their clothes and personal property and i would not that they were baulked on my account wherefore if thou wilt deliver me possession tomorrow morning it shall be done in personal presence of my own followers and of the presbyterian man the mayor so that the transfer may be made before witnesses whereas were there none with us but thou to deliver and i to take possession the men of belial might say go to trusty tomkins hath been an edomite honest joe hath been as an ishmaelite rising up early and dividing the spoil with them that served the manyea they that wore beards and green jerkins as in remembrance of the man and of his government  joceline fixed his keen dark eyes upon the soldier as he spoke as if in design to discover whether there was fair play in his mind or not he then applied his five fingers to scratch a large shock head of hair as if that operation was necessary to enable him to come to a conclusion this is all fair sounding brother said he but i tell you plainly there are some silver mugs and platters and flagons and so forth in yonder house which have survived the general sweep that sent all our plate to the smeltingpot to put our knights troop on horseback now if thou takest not these off my hand i may come to trouble since it may be thought i have minished their numberswhereas i being as honest a fellow  as ever stole venison said tomkinsnay i do owe thee an interruption  go to then replied the keeper if a stag may have come to mischance in my walk it was no way in the course of dishonesty but merely to keep my old dames pan from rusting but for silver porringers tankards and such like i would as soon have drunk the melted silver as stolen the vessel made out of it so that i would not wish blame or suspicion fell on me in this matter and therefore if you will have the things rendered even nowwhy soand if not hold me blameless  ay truly said tomkins and who is to hold me blameless if they should see cause to think any thing minished not the right worshipful commissioners to whom the property of the estate is as their own therefore as thou sayst we must walk warily in the matter to lock up the house and leave it were but the work of simple ones what sayst thou to spend the night there and then nothing can be touched without the knowledge of us both  why concerning that answered the keeper i should be at my hut to make matters somewhat conformable for the old knight and mistress alice for my old dame joan is something dunny and will scarce know how to manageand yetto speak the truth by the mass i would rather not see sir henry tonight since what has happened today hath roused his spleen and it is a peradventure he may have met something at the hut which will scarce tend to cool it  it is a pity said tomkins that being a gentleman of such grave and goodly presence he should be such a malignant cavalier and that he should like the rest of that generation of vipers have clothed himself with curses as with a garment  which is as much as to say the tough old knight hath a habit of swearing said the keeper grinning at a pun which has been repeated since his time but who can help it it comes of use and wont were you now in your bodily self to light suddenly on a maypole with all the blithe morrisdancers prancing around it to the merry pipe and tabor with bells jingling ribands fluttering lads frisking and laughing lasses leaping till you might see where the scarlet garter fastened the light blue hose i think some feeling resembling either natural sociality or old use and wont would get the better friend even of thy gravity and thou wouldst fling thy cuckoldy steeplehat one way and that bloodthirsty long sword another and trip like the noodles of hogsnorton when the pigs play on the organ  the independent turned fiercely round on the keeper and replied how now mr green jerkin what language is this to one whose hand is at the plough i advise thee to put curb on thy tongue lest thy ribs pay the forfeit  nay do not take the high tone with me brother answered joceline remember thou hast not the old knight of sixtyfive to deal with but a fellow as bitter and prompt as thyselfit may be a little more so younger at all eventsand prithee why shouldst thou take such umbrage at a maypole i would thou hadst known one phil hazeldine of these partshe was the best morrisdancer betwixt oxford and burford  the more shame to him answered the independent and i trust he has seen the error of his ways and made himself as if a man of action he easily might fit for better company than woodhunters deerstealers maid marions swashbucklers deboshed revellers bloody brawlers maskers and mummers lewd men and light women fools and fiddlers and carnal selfpleasers of every description  well replied the keeper you are out of breath in time for here we stand before the famous maypole of woodstock  they paused in an open space of meadowland beautifully skirted by large oaks and sycamores one of which as king of the forest stood a little detached from the rest as if scorning the vicinity of any rival it was scathed and gnarled in the branches but the immense trunk still showed to what gigantic size the monarch of the forest can attain in the groves of merry england  that is called the kings oak said joceline the oldest men of woodstock know not how old it is they say henry used to sit under it with fair rosamond and see the lasses dance and the lads of the village run races and wrestle for belts or bonnets  i nothing doubt it friend said tomkins a tyrant and a harlot were fitting patron and patroness for such vanities  thou mayst say thy say friend replied the keeper so thou lettest me say mine there stands the maypole as thou seest half a flightshot from the kings oak in the midst of the meadow the king gave ten shillings from the customs of woodstock to make a new one yearly besides a tree fitted for the purpose out of the forest now it is warped and withered and twisted like a wasted brierrod the green too used to be closeshaved and rolled till it was smooth as a velvet mantlenow it is rough and overgrown  well well friend joceline said the independent but where was the edification of all thiswhat use of doctrine could be derived from a pipe and tabor or was there ever aught like wisdom in a bagpipe  you may ask better scholars that said joceline but methinks men cannot be always grave and with the hat over their brow a young maiden will laugh as a tender flower will bloway and a lad will like her the better for it just as the same blithe spring that makes the young birds whistle bids the blithe fawns skip there have come worse days since the jolly old times have gone byi tell thee that in the holydays which you mr longsword have put down i have seen this greensward alive with merry maidens and manly fellows the good old rector himself thought it was no sin to come for a while and look on and his goodly cassock and scarf kept us all in good order and taught us to limit our mirth within the bounds of discretion we might it may be crack a broad jest or pledge a friendly cup a turn too often but it was in mirth and good neighbourhooday and if there was a bout at singlestick or a bellyful of boxing it was all for love and kindness and better a few dry blows in drink than the bloody doings we have had in sober earnest since the presbyters cap got above the bishops mitre and we exchanged our goodly rectors and learned doctors whose sermons were all bolstered up with as much greek and latin as might have confounded the devil himself for weavers and cobblers and such other pulpit volunteers asas we heard this morningit will out  well friend said the independent with patience scarcely to have been expected i quarrel not with thee for nauseating my doctrine if thine ear is so much tickled with tabor tunes and morris tripping truly it is not likely thou shouldst find pleasant savour in more wholesome and sober food but let us to the lodge that we may go about our business there before the sun sets  troth and that may be advisable for more reasons than one said the keeper for there have been tales about the lodge which have made men afeard to harbour there after nightfall  were not yon old knight and yonder damsel his daughter wont to dwell there said the independent my information said so  ay truly did they said joceline and while they kept a jolly household all went well enough for nothing banishes fear like good ale but after the best of our men went to the wars and were slain at naseby fight they who were left found the lodge more lonesome and the old knight has been much deserted of his servantsmarry it might be that he has lacked silver of late to pay groom and lackey  a potential reason for the diminution of a household said the soldier  right sir even so replied the keeper they spoke of steps in the great gallery heard by dead of the night and voices that whispered at noon in the matted chambers and the servants pretended that these things scared them away but in my poor judgment when martinmas and whitsuntide came round without a pennyfee the old bluebottles of servingmen began to think of creeping elsewhere before the frost chilled themno devil so frightful as that which dances in the pocket where there is no cross to keep him out  you were reduced then to a petty household said the independent  ay marry were we said joceline but we kept some halfscore together what with bluebottles in the lodge what with green caterpillars of the chase like him who is yours to command we stuck together till we found a call to take a mornings ride somewhere or other  to the town of worcester said the soldier where you were crushed like vermin and palmer worms as you are  you may say your pleasure replied the keeper ill never contradict a man who has got my head under his belt our backs are at the wall or you would not be here  nay friend said the independent thou riskest nothing by thy freedom and trust in me i can be bon camarado to a good soldier although i have striven with him even to the going down of the sunbut here we are in front of the lodge  they stood accordingly in front of the old gothic building irregularly constructed and at different times as the humour of the english monarchs led them to taste the pleasures of woodstock chase and to make such improvements for their own accommodation as the increasing luxury of each age required the oldest part of the structure had been named by tradition fair rosamonds tower it was a small turret of great height with narrow windows and walls of massive thickness the tower had no opening to the ground or means of descending a great part of the lower portion being solid masonwork it was traditionally said to have been accessible only by a sort of small drawbridge which might be dropped at pleasure from a little portal near the summit of the turret to the battlements of another tower of the same construction but twenty feet lower and containing only a winding staircase called in woodstock loves ladder because it is said that by ascending this staircase to the top of the tower and then making use of the drawbridge henry obtained access to the chamber of his paramour  this tradition had been keenly impugned by dr rochecliffe the former rector of woodstock who insisted that what was called rosamonds tower was merely an interior keep or citadel to which the lord or warden of the castle might retreat when other points of safety failed him and either protract his defence or at the worst stipulate for reasonable terms of surrender the people of woodstock jealous of their ancient traditions did not relish this new mode of explaining them away and it is even said that the mayor whom we have already introduced became presbyterian in revenge of the doubts cast by the rector upon this important subject rather choosing to give up the liturgy than his fixed belief in rosamonds tower and loves ladder  the rest of the lodge was of considerable extent and of different ages comprehending a nest of little courts surrounded by buildings which corresponded with each other sometimes withindoors sometimes by crossing the courts and frequently in both ways the different heights of the buildings announced that they could only be connected by the usual variety of staircases which exercised the limbs of our ancestors in the sixteenth and earlier centuries and seem sometimes to have been contrived for no other purpose  the varied and multiplied fronts of this irregular building were as dr rochecliffe was wont to say an absolute banquet to the architectural antiquary as they certainly contained specimens of every style which existed from the pure norman of henry of anjou down to the composite half gothic half classical architecture of elizabeth and her successor accordingly the rector was himself as much enamoured of woodstock as ever was henry of fair rosamond and as his intimacy with sir henry lee permitted him entrance at all times to the royal lodge he used to spend whole days in wandering about the antique apartments examining measuring studying and finding out excellent reasons for architectural peculiarities which probably only owed their existence to the freakish fancy of a gothic artist but the old antiquary had been expelled from his living by the intolerance and troubles of the times and his successor nehemiah holdenough would have considered an elaborate investigation of the profane sculpture and architecture of blinded and bloodthirsty papists together with the history of the dissolute amours of old norman monarchs as little better than a bowing down before the calves of bethel and a drinking of the cup of abominationswe return to the course of our story  there is said the independent tomkins after he had carefully perused the front of the building many a rare monument of olden wickedness about this miscalled royal lodge verily i shall rejoice much to see the same destroyed yea burned to ashes and the ashes thrown into the brook kedron or any other brook that the land may be cleansed from the memory thereof neither remember the iniquity with which their fathers have sinned  the keeper heard him with secret indignation and began to consider with himself whether as they stood but one to one and without chance of speedy interference he was not called upon by his official duty to castigate the rebel who used language so defamatory but he fortunately recollected that the strife must be a doubtful onethat the advantage of arms was against himand that in especial even if he should succeed in the combat it would be at the risk of severe retaliation it must be owned too that there was something about the independent so dark and mysterious so grim and grave that the more open spirit of the keeper felt oppressed and if not overawed at least kept in doubt concerning him and he thought it wisest as well as safest for his master and himself to avoid all subjects of dispute and know better with whom he was dealing before he made either friend or enemy of him  the great gate of the lodge was strongly bolted but the wicket opened on jocelines raising the latch there was a short passage of ten feet which had been formerly closed by a portcullis at the inner end while three loopholes opened on either side through which any daring intruder might be annoyed who having surprised the first gate must be thus exposed to a severe fire before he could force the second but the machinery of the portcullis was damaged and it now remained a fixture brandishing its jaw well furnished with iron fangs but incapable of dropping it across the path of invasion  the way therefore lay open to the great hall or outer vestibule of the lodge one end of this long and dusky apartment was entirely occupied by a gallery which had in ancient times served to accommodate the musicians and minstrels there was a clumsy staircase at either side of it composed of entire logs of a foot square and in each angle of the ascent was placed by way of sentinel the figure of a norman footsoldier having an open casque on his head which displayed features as stern as the painters genius could devise their arms were buffjackets or shirts of mail round bucklers with spikes in the centre and buskins which adorned and defended the feet and ankles but left the knees bare these wooden warders held great swords or maces in their hands like military guards on duty many an empty hook and brace along the walls of the gloomy apartment marked the spots from which arms long preserved as trophies had been in the pressure of the wars once more taken down to do service in the field like veterans whom extremity of danger recalls to battle on other rusty fastenings were still displayed the hunting trophies of the monarchs to whom the lodge belonged and of the silvan knights to whose care it had been from time to time confided  at the nether end of the hall a huge heavy stonewrought chimneypiece projected itself ten feet from the wall adorned with many a cipher and many a scutcheon of the royal house of england in its present state it yawned like the arched mouth of a funeral vault or perhaps might be compared to the crater of an extinguished volcano but the sable complexion of the massive stonework and all around it showed that the time had been when it sent its huge fires blazing up the huge chimney besides puffing many a volume of smoke over the heads of the jovial guests whose royalty or nobility did not render them sensitive enough to quarrel with such slight inconvenience on these occasions it was the tradition of the house that two cartloads of wood was the regular allowance for the fire between noon and curfew and the andirons or dogs as they were termed constructed for retaining the blazing firewood on the hearth were wrought in the shape of lions of such gigantic size as might well warrant the legend there were long seats of stone within the chimney where in despite of the tremendous heat monarchs were sometimes said to have taken their station and amused themselves with broiling the umbles or dowsels of the deer upon the glowing embers with their own royal hands when happy the courtier who was invited to taste the royal cookery tradition was here also ready with her record to show what merry gibes such as might be exchanged between prince and peer had flown about at the jolly banquet which followed the michaelmas hunt she could tell too exactly where king stephen sat when he darned his own princely hose and knew most of the odd tricks he had put upon little winkin the tailor of woodstock  most of this rude revelry belonged to the plantagenet times when the house of tudor ascended to the throne they were more chary of their royal presence and feasted in halls and chambers far within abandoning the outmost hall to the yeomen of the guard who mounted their watch there and passed away the night with wassail and mirth exchanged sometimes for frightful tales of apparitions and sorceries which made some of those grow pale in whose ears the trumpet of a french foeman would have sounded as jollily as a summons to the woodland chase  joceline pointed out the peculiarities of the place to his gloomy companion more briefly than we have detailed them to the reader the independent seemed to listen with some interest at first but flinging it suddenly aside he said in a solemn tone perish babylon as thy master nebuchadnezzar hath perished he is a wanderer and thou shalt be a waste placeyea and a wildernessyea a desert of salt in which there shall be thirst and famine  there is like to be enough of both tonight said joceline unless the good knights larder be somewhat fuller than it is wont  we must care for the creaturecomforts said the independent but in due season when our duties are done whither lead these entrances  that to the right replied the keeper leads to what are called the stateapartments not used since the year sixteen hundred and thirtynine when his blessed majesty  how sir interrupted the independent in a voice of thunder dost thou speak of charles stewart as blessing or blessedbeware the proclamation to that effect  i meant no harm answered the keeper suppressing his disposition to make a harsher reply my business is with bolts and bucks not with titles and state affairs but yet whatever may have happed since that poor king was followed with blessings enough from woodstock for he left a glove full of broad pieces for the poor of the place  peace friend said the independent i will think thee else one of those besotted and blinded papists who hold that bestowing of alms is an atonement and washing away of the wrongs and oppressions which have been wrought by the almsgiver thou sayest then these were the apartments of charles stewart  and of his father james before him and elizabeth before him and bluff king henry who builded that wing before them all  and there i suppose the knight and his daughter dwelt  no replied joceline sir henry lee had too much reverence forfor things which are now thought worth no reverence at allbesides the staterooms are unaired and in indifferent order since of late years the knight rangers apartment lies by that passage to the left  and whither goes yonder stair which seems both to lead upwards and downwards  upwards replied the keeper it leads to many apartments used for various purposes of sleeping and other accommodation downwards to the kitchen offices and vaults of the castle which at this time of the evening you cannot see without lights  we will to the apartments of your knight then said the independent is there fitting accommodation there  such as has served a person of condition whose lodging is now worse appointed answered the honest keeper his bile rising so fast that he added in a muttering and inaudible tone so it may well serve a cropeared knave like thee  he acted as the usher however and led on towards the rangers apartments  this suite opened by a short passage from the hall secured at time of need by two oaken doors which could be fastened by large bars of the same that were drawn out of the wall and entered into square holes contrived for their reception on the other side of the portal at the end of this passage a small anteroom received them into which opened the sitting apartment of the good knightwhich in the style of the time might have been termed a fair summer parlourlighted by two oriel windows so placed as to command each of them a separate avenue leading distant and deep into the forest the principal ornament of the apartment besides two or three family portraits of less interest was a tall fulllength picture that hung above the chimneypiece which like that in the hall was of heavy stonework ornamented with carved scutcheons emblazoned with various devices the portrait was that of a man about fifty years of age in complete plate armour and painted in the harsh and dry manner of holbeinprobably indeed the work of that artist as the dates corresponded the formal and marked angles points and projections of the armour were a good subject for the harsh pencil of that early school the face of the knight was from the fading of the colours pale and dim like that of some being from the other world yet the lines expressed forcibly pride and exultation  he pointed with his leadingstaff or truncheon to the background where in such perspective as the artist possessed were depicted the remains of a burning church or monastery and four or five soldiers in red cassocks bearing away in triumph what seemed a brazen font or laver above their heads might be traced in scroll lee victor sic voluit right opposite to the picture hung in a niche in the wall a complete set of tilting armour the black and gold colours and ornaments of which exactly corresponded with those exhibited in the portrait  the picture was one of those which from something marked in the features and expression attract the observation even of those who are ignorant of art the independent looked at it until a smile passed transiently over his clouded brow whether he smiled to see the grim old cavalier employed in desecrating a religious housean occupation much conforming to the practice of his own sectwhether he smiled in contempt of the old painters harsh and dry mode of workingor whether the sight of this remarkable portrait revived some other ideas the underkeeper could not decide  the smile passed away in an instant as the soldier looked to the oriel windows the recesses within them were raised a step or two from the wall in one was placed a walnuttree readingdesk and a huge stuffed armchair covered with spanish leather a little cabinet stood beside with some of its shuttles and drawers open displaying hawksbells dogwhistles instruments for trimming falcons feathers bridlebits of various constructions and other trifles connected with silvan sport  the other little recess was differently furnished there lay some articles of needlework on a small table besides a lute with a book having some airs written down in it and a frame for working embroidery some tapestry was displayed around the recess with more attention to ornament than was visible in the rest of the apartment the arrangement of a few bowpots with such flowers as the fading season afforded showed also the superintendence of female taste  tomkins cast an eye of careless regard upon these subjects of female occupation then stepped into the farther window and began to turn the leaves of a folio which lay open on the readingdesk apparently with some interest joceline who had determined to watch his motions without interfering with them was standing at some distance in dejected silence when a door behind the tapestry suddenly opened and a pretty village maid tripped out with a napkin in her hand as if she had been about some household duty  how now sir impudence she said to joceline in a smart tone what do you here prowling about the apartments when the master is not at home  but instead of the answer which perhaps she expected joceline joliffe cast a mournful glance towards the soldier in the oriel window as if to make what he said fully intelligible and replied with a dejected appearance and voice alack my pretty phoebe there come those here that have more right or might than any of us and will use little ceremony in coming when they will and staying while they please  he darted another glance at tomkins who still seemed busy with the book before him then sidled close to the astonished girl who had continued looking alternately at the keeper and at the stranger as if she had been unable to understand the words of the first or to comprehend the meaning of the second being present  go whispered joliffe approaching his mouth so near her cheek that his breath waved the curls of her hair go my dearest phoebe trip it as fast as a fawn down to my lodgei will soon be there and  your lodge indeed said phoebe you are very bold for a poor killbuck that never frightened any thing before save a dun deeryour lodge indeedi am like to go there i think hush hush phoebe here is no time for jesting down to my hut i say like a deer for the knight and mrs alice are both there and i fear will not return hither againalls naught girland our evil days are come at last with a vengeancewe are fairly at bay and fairly hunted down  can this be joceline said the poor girl turning to the keeper with an expression of fright in her countenance which she had hitherto averted in rural coquetry  as sure my dearest phoebe as  the rest of the asseveration was lost in phoebes ear so closely did the keepers lips approach it and if they approached so very near as to touch her cheek grief like impatience hath its privileges and poor phoebe had enough of serious alarm to prevent her from demurring upon such a trifle  but no trifle was the approach of jocelines lips to phoebes pretty though sunburnt cheek in the estimation of the independent who a little before the object of jocelines vigilance had been more lately in his turn the observer of the keepers demeanour so soon as the interview betwixt phoebe and him had become so interesting and when he remarked the closeness of jocelines argument he raised his voice to a pitch of harshness that would have rivalled that of an ungreased and rusty saw and which at once made joceline and phoebe spring six feet apart each in contrary directions and if cupid was of the party must have sent him out at the window like it wild duck flying from a culverin instantly throwing himself into the attitude of a preacher and a reprover of vice how now he exclaimed shameless and impudent as you arewhatchambering and wantoning in our very presencehow would you play your pranks before the steward of the commissioners of the high court of parliament as ye would in a booth at the fulsome fair or amidst the trappings and tracings of a profane dancingschool where the scoundrel minstrels make their ungodly weapons to squeak kiss and be kind the fiddlers blindbut here he said dealing a perilous thump upon the volumehere is the king and high priest of those vices and follieshere is he whom men of folly profanely call natures miraclehere is he whom princes chose for their cabinetkeeper and whom maids of honour take for their bedfellow here is the prime teacher of fine words foppery and follyhere dealing another thump upon the volumeand oh revered of the roxburghe it was the first foliobeloved of the bannatyne it was hemmings and condelit was the editio princepson thee he continuedon thee william shakspeare i charge whateer of such lawless idleness and immodest folly hath defiled the land since thy day  by the mass a heavy accusation said joceline the bold recklessness of whose temper could not be long overawed odds pitlikins is our masters old favourite will of stratford to answer for every buss that has been snatched since jamess timea perilous reckoning trulybut i wonder who is sponsible for what lads and lasses did before his day scoff not said the soldier lest i being called thereto by the voice within me do deal with thee as a scorner verily i say that since the devil fell from heaven he never lacked agents on earth yet nowhere hath he met with a wizard having such infinite power over mens souls as this pestilent fellow shakspeare seeks a wife a foul example for adultery here she shall find itwould a man know how to train his fellow to be a murderer here shall he find tutoringwould a lady marry a heathen negro she shall have chronicled example for itwould any one scorn at his

plunge in sensual pleasures he will soothe you to indulgence as with the lascivious sounds of a lute this i say this book is the wellhead and source of all those evils which have overrun the land like a torrent making men scoffers doubters deniers murderers makebates and lovers of the winepot haunting unclean places and sitting long at the eveningwine away with him away with him men of england to tophet with his wicked book and to the vale of hinnom with his accursed bones verily but that our march was hasty when we passed stratford in the year 1643 with sir william waller but that our march was hasty  because prince rupert was after you with his cavaliers muttered the incorrigible joceline  i say continued the zealous trooper raising his voice and extending his armbut that our march was by command hasty and that we turned not aside in our riding closing our ranks each one upon the other as becomes men of war i had torn on that day the bones of that preceptor of vice and debauchery from the grave and given them to the next dunghill i would have made his memory a scoff and a hissing  that is the bitterest thing he has said yet observed the keeper poor will would have liked the hissing worse than all the rest will the gentleman say any more enquired phoebe in a whisper lackaday he talks brave words if one knew but what they meant but it is a mercy our good knight did not see him ruffle the book at that ratemercy on us there would certainly have been bloodshedbut oh the fathersee how he is twisting his face aboutis he ill of the colic thinkst thou joceline or may i offer him a glass of strong waters  hark thee hither wench said the keeper he is but loading his blunderbuss for another volley and while he turns up his eyes and twists about his face and clenches his fist and shuffles and tramples with his feet in that fashion he is bound to take no notice of any thing i would be sworn to cut his purse if he had one from his side without his feeling it  la joceline said phoebe and if he abides here in this turn of times i dare say the gentleman will be easily served  care not thou about that said joliffe but tell me softly and hastily what is in the pantry  small housekeeping enough said phoebe a cold capon and some comfits and the great standing venison pasty with plenty of spicea manchet or two besides and that is all  well it will serve for a pinchwrap thy cloak round thy comely bodyget a basket and a brace of trenchers and towels they are heinously impoverished down yondercarry down the capon and the manchetsthe pasty must abide with this same soldier and me and the piecrust will serve us for bread  rarely said phoebe i made the paste myselfit is as thick as the walls of fair rosamonds tower  which two pairs of jaws would be long in gnawing through work hard as they might said the keeper but what liquor is there  only a bottle of alicant and one of sack with the stone jug of strong waters answered phoebe  put the wineflasks into thy basket said joceline the knight must not lack his evening draughtand down with thee to the hut like a lapwing there is enough for supper and tomorrow is a new dayha by heaven i thought yonder mans eye watched usnohe only rolled it round him in a brown studydeep enough doubtless as they all arebut dn him he must be bottomless if i cannot sound him before the nights outhie thee away phoebe  but phoebe was a rural coquette and aware that jocelines situation gave him no advantage of avenging the challenge in a fitting way she whispered in his ear do you think our knights friend shakspeare really found out all these naughty devices the gentleman spoke of  off she darted while she spoke while joliffe menaced future vengeance with his finger as he muttered go thy way phoebe mayflower the lightestfooted and lightesthearted wench that ever tripped the sod in woodstockparkafter her bevis and bring her safe to our master at the hut  the large greyhound arose like a human servitor who had received an order and followed phoebe through the hall first licking her hand to make her sensible of his presence and then putting himself to a slow trot so as best to accommodate himself to the light pace of her whom he convoyed whom joceline had not extolled for her activity without due reason while phoebe and her guardian thread the forest glades we return to the lodge  the independent now seemed to start as if from a reverie is the young woman gone said he  ay marry is she said the keeper and if your worship hath farther commands you must rest contented with male attendance  commandsumphi think the damsel might have tarried for another exhortation said the soldiertruly i profess my mind was much inclined toward her for her edification  oh sir replied joliffe she will be at church next sunday and if your military reverence is pleased again to hold forth amongst us she will have use of the doctrine with the rest but young maidens of these parts hear no private homiliesand what is now your pleasure will you look at the other rooms and at the few plate articles which have been left  umphno said the independentit wears late and gets darkthou hast the means of giving us beds friend  better you never slept in replied the keeper  and wood for a fire and a light and some small pittance of creaturecomforts for refreshment of the outward man continued the soldier  without doubt replied the keeper displaying a prudent anxiety to gratify this important personage  in a few minutes a great standing candlestick was placed on an oaken table the mighty venison pasty adorned with parsley was placed on the board on a clean napkin the stonebottle of strong waters with a blackjack full of ale formed comfortable appendages and to this meal sate down in social manner the soldier occupying a great elbowchair and the keeper at his invitation using the more lowly accommodation of a stool at the opposite side of the table thus agreeably employed our history leaves them for the present                                       chapter the fourth     yon path of greensward   winds round by sparry grot and gay pavilion   there is no flint to gall thy

commonwealth soldier sir henry lee with his daughter alice had departed to take refuge in the hut of the stout keeper joceline joliffe they walked slow as before for the old knight was at once oppressed by perceiving these last vestiges of royalty fall into the hands of republicans and by the recollection of his recent defeat at times he paused and with his arms folded on his bosom recalled all the circumstances attending his expulsion from a house so long his home it seemed to him that like the champions of romance of whom he had sometimes read he himself was retiring from the post which it was his duty to guard defeated by a paynim knight for whom the adventure had been reserved by fate alice had her own painful subjects of recollection nor had the tenor of her last conversation with her father been so pleasant as to make her anxious to renew it until his temper should be more composed for with an excellent disposition and much love to his daughter age and misfortunes which of late came thicker and thicker had given to the good knights passions a wayward irritability unknown to his better days his daughter and one or two attached servants who still followed his decayed fortunes soothed his frailty as much as possible and pitied him even while they suffered under its effects  it was a long time ere he spoke and then he referred to an incident already noticed it is strange he said that bevis should have followed joceline and that fellow rather than me  assure yourself sir replied alice that his sagacity saw in this man a stranger whom he thought himself obliged to watch circumspectly and therefore he remained with joceline  not so alice answered sir henry he leaves me because my fortunes have fled from me there is a feeling in nature affecting even the instinct as it is called of dumb animals which teaches them to fly from misfortune the very deer there will butt a sick or wounded buck from the herd hurt a dog and the whole kennel will fall on him and worry him fishes devour their own kind when they are wounded with a spear cut a crows wing or break its leg the others will buffet it to death  that may be true of the more irrational kinds of animals among each other said alice for their whole life is well nigh a warfare but the dog leaves his own race to attach himself to ours forsakes for his master the company food and pleasure of his own kind and surely the fidelity of such a devoted and voluntary servant as bevis hath been in particular ought not to be lightly suspected  i am not angry with the dog alice i am only sorry replied her father i have read in faithful chronicles that when richard ii and henry of bolingbroke were at berkeley castle a dog of the same kind deserted the king whom he had always attended upon and attached himself to henry whom he then saw for the first time richard foretold from the desertion of his favourite his approaching deposition the dog was afterwards kept at woodstock and bevis is said to be of his breed which was heedfully kept up what i might foretell of mischief from his desertion i cannot guess but my mind assures me it bodes no good  there was a distant rustling among the withered leaves a bouncing or galloping sound on the path and the favourite dog instantly joined his master  come into court old knave said alice cheerfully and defend thy character which is wellnigh endangered by this absence but the dog only paid her courtesy by gamboling around them and instantly plunged back again as fast as he could scamper  how now knave said the knight thou art too well trained surely to take up the chase without orders a minute more showed them phoebe mayflower approaching her light pace so little impeded by the burden which she bore that she joined her master and young mistress just as they arrived at the keepers hut which was the boundary of their journey bevis who had shot ahead to pay his compliments to sir henry his master had returned again to his immediate duty the escorting phoebe and her cargo of provisions the whole party stood presently assembled before the door of the keepers hut  in better times a substantial stone habitation fit for the yeomankeeper of a royal walk had adorned this place a fair spring gushed out near the spot and once traversed yards and courts attached to wellbuilt and convenient kennels and mews but in some of the skirmishes which were common during the civil wars this little silvan dwelling had been attacked and defended stormed and burnt a neighbouring squire of the parliament side of the question took advantage of sir henry lees absence who was then in charless camp and of the decay of the royal cause and had without scruple carried off the hewn stones and such building materials as the fire left unconsumed and repaired his own manorhouse with them the yeomankeeper therefore our friend joceline had constructed for his own accommodation and that of the old woman he called his dame a wattled hut such as his own labour with that of a neighbour or two had erected in the course of a few days the walls were plastered with clay whitewashed and covered with vines and other creeping plants the roof was neatly thatched and the whole though merely a hut had by the neathanded joliffe been so arranged as not to disgrace the condition of the dweller  the knight advanced to the entrance but the ingenuity of the architect for want of a better lock to the door which itself was but of wattles curiously twisted had contrived a mode of securing the latch on the inside with a pin which prevented it from rising and in this manner it was at present fastened conceiving that this was some precaution of joliffes old housekeeper of whose deafness they were all aware sir henry raised his voice to demand admittance but in vain irritated at this delay he pressed the door at once with foot and hand in a way which the frail barrier was unable to resist it gave way accordingly and the knight thus forcibly entered the kitchen or outward apartment of his servant in the midst of the floor and with a posture which indicated embarrassment stood a youthful stranger in a ridingsuit  this may be my last act of authority here said the knight seizing the stranger by the collar but i am still ranger of woodstock for this night at leastwho or what art thou  the stranger dropped the ridingmantle in which his face was muffled and at the same time fell on one knee  your poor kinsman markham everard he said who came hither for your sake although he fears you will scarce make him welcome for his own  sir henry started back but recovered himself in an instant as one who recollected that he had a part of dignity to perform he stood erect therefore and replied with considerable assumption of stately ceremony  fair kinsman it pleases me that you are come to woodstock upon the very first night that for many years which have passed is likely to promise you a worthy or a welcome reception  now god grant it be so that i rightly hear and duly understand you said the young man while alice though she was silent kept her looks fixed on her fathers face as if desirous to know whether his meaning was kind towards his nephew which her knowledge of his character inclined her greatly to doubt  the knight meanwhile darted a sardonic look first on his nephew then on his daughter and proceededi need not i presume inform mr markham everard that it cannot be our purpose to entertain him or even to offer him a seat in this poor hut  i will attend you most willingly to the lodge said the young gentleman i had indeed judged you were already there for the evening and feared to intrude upon you but if you would permit me my dearest uncle to escort my kinswoman and you back to the lodge believe me amongst all which you have so often done of good and kind you never conferred benefit that will be so dearly prized  you mistake me greatly mr markham everard replied the knight it is not our purpose to return to the lodge tonight nor by our lady tomorrow neither i meant but to intimate to you in all courtesy that at woodstock lodge you will find those for whom you are fitting society and who doubtless will afford you a willing welcome which i sir in this my present retreat do not presume to offer to a person of your consequence  for heavens sake said the young man turning to alice tell me how i am to understand language so misterious  alice to prevent his increasing the restrained anger of her father compelled herself to answer though it was with difficulty we are expelled from the lodge by soldiers  expelledby soldiers exclaimed everard in surprisethere is no legal warrant for this  none at all answered the knight in the same tone of cutting irony which he had all along used and yet as lawful a warrant as for aught that has been wrought in england this twelvemonth and more you are i think or were an innsofcourtmanmarry sir your enjoyment of your profession is like that lease which a prodigal wishes to have of a wealthy widow you have already survived the law which you studied and its expiry doubtless has not been without a legacysome decent pickings some merciful increases as the phrase goes you have deserved it two waysyou wore buff and bandalier as well as wielded pen and inki have not heard if you held forth too  think of me and speak of me as harshly as you will sir said everard submissively i have but in this evil time guided myself by my conscience and my fathers commands  o and you talk of conscience said the old knight i must have mine eye upon you as hamlet says never yet did puritan cheat so grossly as when he was appealing to his conscience and as for thy father  he was about to proceed in a tone of the same invective when the young man interrupted him by saying in a firm tone sir henry lee you have ever been thought noblesay of me what you will but speak not of my father what the ear of a son should not endure and which yet his arm cannot resent to do me such wrong is to insult an unarmed man or to beat a captive  sir henry paused as if struck by the remark thou hast spoken truth in that mark wert thou the blackest puritan whom hell ever vomited to distract an unhappy country  be that as you will to think it replied everard but let me not leave you to the shelter of this wretched hovel the night is drawing to stormlet me but conduct you to the lodge and expel those intruders who can as yet at least have no warrant for what they do i will not linger a moment behind them save just to deliver my fathers messagegrant me but this much for the love you once bore me  yes mark answered his uncle firmly but sorrowfully thou speakest truthi did love thee once the brighthaired boy whom i taught to ride to shoot to huntwhose hours of happiness were spent with me wherever those of graver labours were employedi did love that boyay and i am weak enough to love even the memory of what he wasbut he is gone markhe is gone and in his room i only behold an avowed and determined rebel to his religion and to his kinga rebel more detestable on account of his success the more infamous through the plundered wealth with which he hopes to gild his villanybut i am poor thou thinkst and should hold my peace lest men say speak sirrah when you shouldknow however that indigent and plundered as i am i feel myself dishonoured in holding even but this much talk with the tool of usurping rebelsgo to the lodge if thou wiltyonder lies the waybut think not that to regain my dwelling there or all the wealth i ever possessed in my wealthiest days i would accompany thee three steps on the greensward if i must be thy companion it shall be only when thy redcoats have tied my hands behind me and bound my legs beneath my horses belly thou mayst be my fellow traveller then i grant thee if thou wilt but not sooner  alice who suffered cruelly during this dialogue and was well aware that farther argument would only kindle the knights resentment still more highly ventured at last in her anxiety to make a sign to her cousin to break off the interview and to retire since her father commanded his absence in a manner so peremptory unhappily she was observed by sir henry who concluding that what he saw was evidence of a private understanding betwixt the cousins his wrath acquired new fuel and it required the utmost exertion of selfcommand and recollection of all that was due to his own dignity to enable him to veil his real fury under the same ironical manner which he had adopted at the beginning of this angry interview  if thou art afraid he said to trace our forest glades by night respected stranger to whom i am perhaps bound to do honour as my successor in the charge of these walks here seems to be a modest damsel who will be most willing to wait on thee and be thy bowbeareronly for her mothers sake let there pass some slight form of marriage between youye need no license or priest in these happy days but may be buckled like beggars in a ditch with a hedge for a churchroof and a tinker for a priest i crave pardon of you for making such an officious and simple requestperhaps you are a ranteror one of the family of love or hold marriage rites as unnecessary as knipperdoling or jack of leyden  for mercys sake forbear such dreadful jesting my father and do you markham begone in gods name and leave us to our fateyour presence makes my father rave  jesting said sir henry i was never more seriousravingi was never more composedi could never brook that falsehood should approach mei would no more bear by my side a dishonoured daughter than a dishonoured sword and this unhappy day hath shown that both can fail  sir henry said young everard load not your soul with a heavy crime which be assured you do in treating your daughter thus unjustly it is long now since you denied her to me when we were poor and you were powerful i acquiesced in your prohibition of all suit and intercourse god knoweth what i sufferedbut i acquiesced neither is it to renew my suit that i now come hither and have i do acknowledge sought speech of hernot for her own sake only but for yours also destruction hovers over you ready to close her pinions to stoop and her talons to clutchyes sir look contemptuous as you will such is the case and it is to protect both you and her that i am here  you refuse then my free gift said sir henry lee or perhaps you think it loaded with too hard conditions  shame shame on you sir henry said everard waxing warm in his turn have your political prejudices so utterly warped every feeling of a father that you can speak with bitter mockery and scorn of what concerns your own daughters honourhold up your head fair alice and tell your father he has forgotten nature in his fantastic spirit of loyaltyknow sir henry that though i would prefer your daughters hand to every blessing which heaven could bestow on me i would not accept itmy conscience would not permit me to do so when i knew it must withdraw her from her duty to you  your conscience is overscrupulous young mancarry it to some dissenting rabbi and he who takes all that comes to net will teach thee it is sinning against our mercies to refuse any good thing that is freely offered to us  when it is freely offered and kindly offerednot when the offer is made in irony and insultfare thee well aliceif aught could make me desire to profit by thy fathers wild wish to cast thee from him in a moment of unworthy suspicion it would be that while indulging in such sentiments sir henry lee is tyrannically oppressing the creature who of all others is most dependent on his kindnesswho of all others will most feel his severity and whom of all others he is most bound to cherish and support  do not fear for me mr everard exclaimed alice aroused from her timidity by a dread of the consequences not unlikely to ensue where civil war sets relations as well as fellowcitizens in opposition to each otheroh begone i conjure you begone nothing stands betwixt me and my fathers kindness but these unhappy family divisionsbut your illtimed presence herefor heavens sake leave us  so mistress answered the hot old cavalier you play lady paramount already and who but youyou would dictate to our train i warrant like goneril and regan but i tell thee no man shall leave my houseand humble as it is this is now my housewhile he has aught to say to me that is to be spoken as this young man now speaks with a bent brow and a lofty tonespeak out sir and say your worst  fear not my temper mrs alice said everard with equal firmness and placidity of manner and you sir henry do not think that if i speak firmly i mean therefore to speak in anger or officiously you have taxed me with much and were i guided by the wild spirit of romantic chivalry much which even from so near a relative i ought not as being by birth and in the worlds estimation a gentleman to pass over without reply is it your pleasure to give me patient hearing  if you stand on your defence answered the stout old knight god forbid that you should not challenge a patient hearingay though your pleading were two parts disloyalty and one blasphemyonly be brief this has already lasted but too long  i will sir henry replied the young man yet it is hard to crowd into a few sentences the defence of a life which though short has been a busy onetoo busy your indignant gesture would assert but i deny it i have drawn my sword neither hastily nor without due consideration for a people whose rights have been trampled on and whose consciences have been oppressedfrown not sirsuch is not your view of the contest but such is mine for my religious principles at which you have scoffed believe me that though they depend not on set forms they are no less sincere than your own and thus far purerexcuse the wordthat they are unmingled with the bloodthirsty dictates of a barbarous age which you and others have called the code of chivalrous honour not my own natural disposition but the better doctrine which my creed has taught enables me to bear your harsh revilings without answering in a similar tone of wrath and reproach you may carry insult to extremity against me at your pleasurenot on account of our relationship alone but because i am bound in charity to endure it this sir henry is much from one of our house but with forbearance far more than this requires i can refuse at your hands the gift which most of all things under heaven i should desire to obtain because duty calls upon her to sustain and comfort you and because it were sin to permit you in your blindness to spurn your comforter from your sidefarewell sirnot in anger but in pitywe may meet in a better time when your heart and your principles shall master the unhappy prejudices by which they are now overcloudedfarewell farewell alice  the last words were repeated twice and in a tone of feeling and passionate grief which differed utterly from the steady and almost severe tone in which he had addressed sir henry lee he turned and left the hut so soon as he had uttered these last words and as if ashamed of the tenderness which had mingled with his accents the young commonwealthsman turned and walked sternly and resolvedly forth into the moonlight which now was spreading its broad light and autumnal shadows over the woodland  so soon as he departed alice who had been during the whole scene in the utmost terror that her father might have been hurried by his natural heat of temper from violence of language into violence of action sunk down upon a settle twisted out of willow boughs like most of jocelines few moveables and endeavoured to conceal the tears which accompanied the thanks she rendered in broken accents to heaven that notwithstanding the near alliance and relationship of the parties some fatal deed had not closed an interview so perilous and so angry phoebe mayflower blubbered heartily for company though she understood but little of what had passed just indeed enough to enable her afterwards to report to some halfdozen particular friends that her old master sir henry had been perilous angry and almost fought with young master everard because he had wellnigh carried away her young mistressand what could he have done better said phoebe seeing the old man had nothing left either for mrs alice or himself and as for mr mark everard and our young lady oh they had spoken such loving things to each other as are not to be found in the history of argalus and parthenia who as the storybook tells were the truest pair of lovers in all arcadia and oxfordshire to boot  old goody jellycot had popped her scarlet hood into the kitchen more than once while the scene was proceeding but as the worthy dame was parcel blind and more than parcel deaf knowledge was excluded by two principal entrances and though she comprehended by a sort of general instinct that the gentlefolk were at high words yet why they chose jocelines hut for the scene of their dispute was as great a mystery as the subject of the quarrel  but what was the state of the old cavaliers mood thus contradicted as his most darling principles had been by the last words of his departing nephew the truth is that he was less thoroughly moved than his daughter expected and in all probability his nephews bold defence of his religious and political opinions rather pacified than aggravated his displeasure although sufficiently impatient of contradiction still evasion and subterfuge were more alien to the blunt old rangers nature than manly vindication and direct opposition and he was wont to say that he ever loved the buck best who stood boldest at bay he graced his nephews departure however with a quotation from shakspeare whom as many others do he was wont to quote from a sort of habit and respect as a favourite of his unfortunate master without having either much real taste for his works or great skill in applying the passages which he retained on his memory  mark he said mark this alicethe devil can quote scripture for his purpose why this young fanatic cousin of thine with no more beard than i have seen on a clown playing maid marion on mayday when the village barber had shaved him in too great a hurry shall match any bearded presbyterian or independent of them all in laying down his doctrines and his uses and bethumping us with his texts and his homilies i would worthy and learned doctor rochecliffe had been here with his battery readymounted from the vulgate and the septuagint and what nothe would have battered the presbyterian spirit out of him with a wanion however i am glad the young man is no sneaker for were a man of the devils opinion in religion and of old nolls in politics he were better open on it full cry than deceive you by hunting counter or running a false scent comewipe thine eyesthe fray is over and not like to be stirred again soon i trust  encouraged by these words alice rose and bewildered as she was endeavoured to superintend the arrangements for their meal and their repose in their new habitation but her tears fell so fast they marred her counterfeited diligence and it was well for her that phoebe though too ignorant and too simple to comprehend the extent of her distress could afford her material assistance in lack of mere sympathy  with great readiness and address the damsel set about every thing that was requisite for preparing the supper and the beds now screaming into dame jellycots ear now whispering into her mistresss and artfully managing as if she was merely the agent under alices orders when the cold viands were set forth sir henry lee kindly pressed his daughter to take refreshment as if to make up indirectly for his previous harshness towards her while he himself like an experienced campaigner showed that neither the mortifications nor brawls of the day nor the thoughts of what was to come tomorrow could diminish his appetite for supper which was his favourite meal he ate up twothirds of the capon and devoting the first bumper to the happy restoration of charles second of the name he finished a quart of wine for he belonged to a school accustomed to feed the flame of their loyalty with copious brimmers he even sang a verse of the king shall enjoy his own again in which phoebe halfsobbing and dame jellycot screaming against time and tune were contented to lend their aid to cover mistress alices silence  at length the jovial knight betook himself to his rest on the keepers straw pallet in a recess adjoining to the kitchen and unaffected by his change of dwelling slept fast and deep alice had less quiet rest in old goody jellycots wicker couch in the inner apartment while the dame and phoebe slept on a mattress stuffed with dry leaves in the same chamber soundly as those whose daily toil gains their daily bread and whom morning calls up only to renew the toils of yesterday                                       chapter the fifth     my tongue pads slowly under this new language   and starts and stumbles at these uncouth phrases   they may be great in worth and weight but hang   upon the native glibness of my language   like sauls platearmour on the shepherd boy   encumbering and not arming him                                       j b  as markham everard pursued his way towards the lodge through one of the long sweeping glades which traversed the forest varying in breadth till the trees were now so close that the boughs made darkness over his head then receding farther to let in glimpses of the moon and anon opening yet wider into little meadows or savannahs on which the moonbeams lay in silvery silence as he thus proceeded on his lonely course the various effects produced by that delicious light on the oaks whose dark leaves gnarled branches and massive trunks it gilded more or less partially might have drawn the attention of a poet or a painter  but if everard thought of anything saving the painful scene in which he had just played his part and of which the result seemed the destruction of all his hopes it was of the necessary guard to be observed in his nightwalk the times were dangerous and unsettled the roads full of disbanded soldiers and especially of royalists who made their political opinions a pretext for disturbing the country with marauding parties and robberies deerstealers also who are ever a desperate banditti had of late infested woodstock chase in short the dangers of the place and period were such that markham everard wore his loaded pistols at his belt and carried his drawn sword under his arm that he might be prepared for whatever peril should cross his path  he heard the bells of woodstock church ring curfew just as he was crossing one of the little meadows we have described and they ceased as he entered an overshadowed and twilight part of the path beyond it was there that he heard some one whistling and as the sound became clearer it was plain the person was advancing towards him this could hardly be a friend for the party to which he belonged rejected generally speaking all music unless psalmody if a man is merry let him sing psalms was a text which they were pleased to interpret as literally and to as little purpose as they did some others yet it was too continued a sound to be a signal amongst nightwalkers and too light and cheerful to argue any purpose of concealment on the part of the traveller who presently exchanged his whistling for singing and trolled forth the following stanza to a jolly tune with which the old cavaliers were wont to wake the night owl    hey for cavaliers ho for cavaliers   pray for cavaliers     rub a dubrub a dub     have at old beelzebub     oliver smokes for fear  i should know that voice said everard uncocking the pistol which he had drawn from his belt but continuing to hold it in his hand then came another fragment    hash themslash them   all to pieces dash them  so ho cried markham who goes there and for whom  for church and king answered a voice which presently added no dn mei mean against church and king and for the people that are uppermosti forget which they are  roger wildrake as i guess said everard  the samegentleman of squattleseamere in the moist county of lincoln  wildrake said markhamwildgoose you should be called you have been moistening your own throat to some purpose and using it to gabble tunes very suitable to the times to be sure  faith the tunes a pretty tune enough mark only out of fashion a littlethe mores the pity  what could i expect said everard but to meet some ranting drunken cavalier as desperate and dangerous as night and sack usually make them what if i had rewarded your melody by a ball in the gullet  why there would have been a piper paidthats all said wildrake but wherefore come you this way now i was about to seek you at the hut  i have been obliged to leave iti will tell you the cause hereafter replied markham  what the old playhunting cavalier was cross or chloe was unkind  jest not wildrakeit is all over with me said everard  the devil it is exclaimed wildrake and you take it thus quietly zounds let us back togetherill plead your cause for youi know how to tickle up an old knight and a pretty maidenlet me alone for putting you rectus in curia you canting roguedn me sir henry lee says i your nephew is a piece of a puritanit wont denybut ill uphold him a gentleman and a pretty fellow for all thatmadam says i you may think your cousin looks like a psalmsinging weaver in that bare felt and with that rascally brown cloak that band which looks like a babys clout and those loose boots which have a whole calfskin in each of thembut let him wear on the one side of his head a castor with a plume befitting his quality give him a good toledo by his side with a broidered belt and an inlaid hilt instead of the ton of iron contained in that baskethilted black andrew ferrara put a few smart words in his mouthand blood and wounds madam says i  prithee truce with this nonsense wildrake said everard and tell me if you are sober enough to hear a few words of sober reason  pshaw man i did but crack a brace of quarts with yonder puritanic roundheaded soldiers up yonder at the town and rat me but i passed myself for the best man of the party twanged my nose and turned up my eyes as i took my canpah the very wine tasted of hypocrisy i think the rogue corporal smoked something at lastas for the common fellows never stir but they asked me to say grace over another quart  this is just what i wished to speak with you about wildrake said markhamyou hold me i am sure for your friend  true as steelchums at college and at lincolns innwe have been nisus and euryalus theseus and pirithous orestes and pylades and to sum up the whole with a puritanic touch david and jonathan all in one breath not even politics the wedge that rends families and friendships asunder as iron rives oak have been able to split us  true answered markham and when you followed the king to nottingham and i enrolled under essex we swore at our parting that whichever side was victorious he of us who adhered to it should protect his less fortunate comrade  surely man surely and have you not protected me accordingly did you not save me from hanging and am i not indebted to you for the bread i eat  i have but done that which had the times been otherwise you my dear wildrake would i am sure have done for me but as i said that is just what i wished to speak to you about why render the task of protecting you more difficult than it must necessarily be at any rate why thrust thyself into the company of soldiers or such like where thou art sure to be warmed into betraying thyself why come hollowing and whooping out cavalier ditties like a drunken trooper of prince rupert or one of wilmots swaggering bodyguards  because i may have been both one and tother in my day for aught that you know replied wildrake but oddsfish is it necessary i should always be reminding you that our obligation of mutual protection our league of offensive and defensive as i may call it was to be carried into effect without reference to the politics or religion of the party protected or the least obligation on him to conform to those of his friend  true said everard but with this most necessary qualification that the party should submit to such outward conformity to the times as should make it more easy and safe for his friend to be of service to him now you are perpetually breaking forth to the hazard of your own safety and my credit  i tell you mark and i would tell your namesake the apostle that you are hard on me you have practised sobriety and hypocrisy from your hanging sleeves till your geneva cassockfrom the cradle to this dayand it is a thing of nature to you and you are surprised that a rough rattling honest fellow accustomed to

can retain his breath for ten minutes without inconvenience upbraid a poor devil for being like to burst in twenty seconds at the bottom of ten fathoms waterand after all considering the guise is so new to me i think i bear myself indifferently welltry me  are there any more news from worcester fight asked everard in a tone so serious that it imposed on his companion who replied in his genuine character  worsedn me worse an hundred times than reportedtotally broken noll hath certainly sold himself to the devil and his lease will have an end one daythat is all our present comfort  what and would this be your answer to the first redcoat who asked the question said everard methinks you would find a speedy passport to the next corps de garde  nay nay answered wildrake i thought you asked

going down of the sun  hear you aught of colonel thornhaughs wounds  he is dead answered wildrake thats one comfortthe roundheaded rascalnay hold it was but a trip of the tonguei meant the sweet godly youth  and hear you aught of the young man king of scotland as they call him said everard  nothing but that he is hunted like a partridge on the mountains may god deliver him and confound his enemieszoons mark everard i can fool it no longer do you not remember that at the lincolnsinn gambolsthough you did not mingle much in them i thinki used always to play as well as any of them when it came to the action but they could never get me to rehearse conformably its the same at this day i hear your voice and i answer to it in the true tone of my heart but when i am in the company of your snuffling friends you have seen me act my part indifferent well  but indifferent indeed replied everard however there is little call on you to do aught save to be modest and silent speak little and lay aside if you can your big oaths and swaggering looksset your hat even on your brows  ay that is the curse i have been always noted for the jaunty manner in which i wear my castorhard when a mans merits become his enemies  you must remember you are my clerk  secretary answered wildrake let it be secretary if you love me  it must be clerk and nothing elseplain clerkand remember to be civil and obedient replied everard  but you should not lay on your commands with so much ostentatious superiority master markham everard remember i am your senior of three years standing confound me if i know how to take it  was ever such a fantastic wrongheadfor my sake if not for thine own bend thy freakish folly to listen to reason think that i have incurred both risk and shame on thy account  nay thou art a right good fellow mark replied the cavalier and for thy sake i will do muchbut remember to cough and cry hem when thou seest me like to break bounds and now tell me whither we are bound for the night  to woodstock lodge to look after my uncles property answered markham everard i am informed that soldiers have taken possessionyet how could that be if thou foundest the party drinking in woodstock  there was a kind of commissary or steward or some such rogue had gone down to the lodge replied wildrake i had a peep at him  indeed replied everard  ay verily said wildrake to speak your own language why as i passed through the park in quest of you scarce half an hour since i saw a light in the lodgestep this way you will see it yourself  in the northwest angle returned everard it is from a window in what they call victor lees apartment  well resumed wildrake i had been long one of lundsfords lads and well used to patrolling dutyso rat me says i if i leave a light in my rear without knowing what it means besides mark thou hadst said so much to me of thy pretty cousin i thought i might as well have a peep if i could  thoughtless incorrigible man to what dangers do you expose yourself and your friends in mere wantonnessbut go on  by this fair moonshine i believe thou art jealous mark everard replied his gay companion there is no occasion for in any case i who was to see the lady was steeled by honour against the charms of my friends chloethen the lady was not to see me so could make no comparisons to thy disadvantage thou knowestlastly as it fell out neither of us saw the other at all  of that i am well aware mrs alice left the lodge long before sunset and never returned what didst thou see to introduce with such preface  nay no great matter replied wildrake only getting upon a sort of buttress for i can climb like any cat that ever mewed in any gutter and holding on by the vines and creepers which grew around i obtained a station where i could see into the inside of that same parlour thou spokest of just now  and what sawst thou there once more demanded everard  nay no great matter as i said before replied the cavalier for in these times it is no new thing to see churls carousing in royal or noble chambers i saw two rascallions engaged in emptying a solemn stoup of strong waters and dispatching a huge venison pasty which greasy mess for their convenience they had placed on a ladys worktableone of them was trying an air on a lute  the profane villains exclaimed everard it was alices  well said comradei am glad your phlegm can be moved i did but throw in these incidents of the lute and the table to try if it was possible to get a spark of human spirit out of you besanctified as you are  what like were the men said young everard  the one a slouchhatted longcloaked sourfaced fanatic like the rest of you whom i took to be the steward or commissary i heard spoken of in the town the other was a short sturdy fellow with a woodknife at his girdle and a long quarterstaff lying beside hima blackhaired knave with white teeth and a merry countenanceone of the underrangers or bowbearers of these walks i fancy  they must have been desboroughs favourite trusty tomkins said everard and joceline joliffe the keeper tomkins is desboroughs right handan independent and hath pourings forth as he calls them some think that his gifts have the better of his grace i have heard of his abusing opportunities  they were improving them when i saw them replied wildrake and made the bottle smoke for itwhen as the devil would have it a stone which had been dislodged from the crumbling buttress gave way under my weight a clumsy fellow like thee would have been so long thinking what was to be done that he must needs have followed it before he could make up his mind but i mark i hopped like a squirrel to an ivy twig and stood fastwas wellnigh shot though for the noise alarmed them both they looked to the oriel and saw me on the outside the fanatic fellow took out a pistolas they have always such texts in readiness hanging beside the little clasped bible thou knowstthe keeper seized his huntingpolei treated them both to a roar and a grinthou must know i can grimace like a babooni learned the trick from a french player who could twist his jaws into a pair of nutcrackersand therewithal i dropped myself sweetly on the grass and ran off so trippingly keeping the dark side of the wall as long as i could that i am wellnigh persuaded they thought i was their kinsman the devil come among them uncalled they were abominably startled  thou art most fearfully rash wildrake said his companion we are now bound for the housewhat if they should remember thee  why it is no treason is it no one has paid for peeping since tom of coventrys days and if he came in for a reckoning belike it was for a better treat than mine but trust me they will no more know me than a man who had only seen your friend noll at a conventicle of saints would know the same oliver on horseback and charging with his lobstertailed squadron or the same noll cracking a jest and a bottle with wicked waller the poet  hush not a word of oliver as thou dost value thyself and me it is ill jesting with the rock you may split onbut here is the gatewe will disturb these honest gentlemens recreations  as he spoke he applied the large and ponderous knocker to the halldoor rattattattoo said wildrake there is a fine alarm to you cuckolds and roundheads he then halfmimicked halfsung the march so called    cuckolds come dig cuckolds come dig   round about cuckolds come dance to my jig  by heaven this passes midsummer frenzy said everard turning angrily to him  not a bit not a bit replied wildrake it is but a slight expectoration just like what one makes before beginning a long speech i will be grave for an hour together now i have got that point of war out of my head  as he spoke steps were heard in the hall and the wicket of the great door was partly opened but secured with a chain in case of accidents the visage of tomkins and that of joceline beneath it appeared at the chink illuminated by the lamp which the latter held in his hand and tomkins demanded the meaning of this alarm  i demand instant admittance said everard joliffe you know me well  i do sir replied joceline and could admit you with all my heart but alas sir you see i am not keykeeperhere is the gentleman whose warrant i must walk bythe lord help me seeing times are such as they be  and when that gentleman who i think may be master desboroughs valet  his honours unworthy secretary an it please you interposed tomkins while wildrake whispered in everards ear i will be no longer secretary mark thou wert quite rightthe clerk must be the more gentlemanly calling  and if you are master desboroughs secretary i presume you know me and my condition well enough said everard addressing the independent not to hesitate to admit me and my attendant to a nights quarters in the lodge  surely not surely not said the independentthat is if your worship thinks you would be better accommodated here than up at the house of entertainment in the town which men unprofitably call saint georges inn there is but confined accommodation here your honourand we have been frayed out of our lives already by the visitation of satanalbeit his fiery dart is now quenched  this may be all well in its place sir secretary said everard and you may find a corner for it when you are next tempted to play the preacher but i will take it for no apology for keeping me here in the cold harvest wind and if not presently received and suitably too i will report you to your master for insolence in your office  the secretary of desborough did not dare offer farther opposition for it is well known that desborough himself only held his consequence as a kinsman of cromwell and the lordgeneral who was well nigh paramount already was known to be strongly favourable both to the elder and younger everard it is true they were presbyterians and he an independent and that though sharing those feelings of correct morality and more devoted religious feeling by which with few exceptions the parliamentarian party were distinguished the everards were not disposed to carry these attributes to the extreme of enthusiasm practised by so many others at the time yet it was well known that whatever might be cromwells own religious creed he was not uniformly bounded by it in the choice of his favourites but extended his countenance to those who could serve him even although according to the phrase of the time they came out of the darkness of egypt the character of the elder everard stood very high for wisdom and sagacity besides being of a good family and competent fortune his adherence would lend a dignity to any side he might espouse then his son had been a distinguished and successful soldier remarkable for the discipline he maintained among his men the bravery which he showed in the time of action and the humanity with which he was always ready to qualify the consequences of victory such men were not to be neglected when many signs combined to show that the parties in the state who had successfully accomplished the deposition and death of the king were speedily to quarrel among themselves about the division of the spoils the two everards were therefore much courted by cromwell and their influence with him was supposed to be so great that trusty master secretary tomkins cared not to expose himself to risk by contending with colonel everard for such a trifle as a nights lodging  joceline was active on his sidemore lights were obtainedmore wood thrown on the fireand the two newlyarrived strangers were introduced into victor lees parlour as it was called from the picture over the chimneypiece which we have already described it was several minutes ere colonel everard could recover his general stoicism of deportment so strongly was he impressed by finding himself in the apartment under whose roof he had passed so many of the happiest hours of his life there was the cabinet which he had seen opened with such feelings of delight when sir henry lee deigned to give him instructions in fishing and to exhibit hooks and lines together with all the materials for making the artificial fly then little known there hung the ancient family picture which from some odd mysterious expressions of his uncle relating to it had become to his boyhood nay his early youth a subject of curiosity and of fear he remembered how when left alone in the apartment the searching eye of the old warrior seemed always bent upon his in whatever part of the room he placed himself and how his childish imagination was perturbed at a phenomenon for which he could not account  with these came a thousand dearer and warmer recollections of his early attachment to his pretty cousin alice when he assisted her at her lessons brought water for her flowers or accompanied her while she sung and he remembered that while her father looked at them with a goodhumoured and careless smile he had once heard him mutter and if it should turn out sowhy it might be best for both and the theories of happiness he had reared on these words all these visions had been dispelled by the trumpet of war which called sir henry lee and himself to opposite sides and the transactions of this very day had shown that even everards success as a soldier and a statesman seemed absolutely to prohibit the chance of their being revived  he was waked out of this unpleasing reverie by the approach of joceline who being possibly a seasoned toper had made the additional arrangements with more expedition and accuracy than could have been expected from a person engaged as he had been since nightfall  he now wished to know the colonels directions for the night  would he eat anything  no  did his honour choose to accept sir henry lees bed which was ready prepared  yes  that of mistress alice lee should be prepared for the secretary  on pain of thine earsno replied everard  where then was the worthy secretary to be quartered  in the dogkennel if you list replied colonel everard but added he stepping to the sleeping apartment of alice which opened from the parlour locking it and taking out the key no one shall profane this chamber  had his honour any other commands for the night  none save to clear the apartment of yonder man my clerk will remain with mei have orders which must be written outyet staythou gavest my letter this morning to mistress alice  i did  tell me good joceline what she said when she received it  she seemed much concerned sir and indeed i think that she wept a littlebut indeed she seemed very much distressed  and what message did she send to me  none may it please your honourshe began to say tell my cousin everard that i will communicate my uncles kind purpose to my father if i can get fitting opportunitybut that i greatly fearand there checked herself as it were and said i will write to my cousin and as it may be late ere i have an opportunity of speaking with my father do thou come for my answer after serviceso i went to church myself to while away the time but when i returned to the chase i found this man had summoned my master to surrender and right or wrong i must put him in possession of the lodge i would fain have given your honour a hint that the old knight and my young mistress were like to take you on the form but i could not mend the matter  thou hast done well good fellow and i will remember theeand now my masters he said advancing to the brace of clerks or secretaries who had in the meanwhile sate quietly down beside the stone bottle and made up acquaintance over a glass of its contentslet me remind you that the night wears late  there is something cries tinkle tinkle in the bottle yet said wildrake in reply  hem hem hem coughed the colonel of the parliament service and if his lips did not curse his companions imprudence i will not answer for what arose in his heartwell he said observing that wildrake had filled his own glass and tomkinss take that parting glass and begone  would you not be pleased to hear first said wildrake how this honest gentleman saw the devil tonight look through a pane of yonder window and how he thinks he had a mighty strong resemblance to your worships humble slave and varlet scribbler would you but hear this sir and just sip a glass of this very recommendable strong waters  i will drink none sir said colonel everard sternly and i have to tell you that you have drunken a glass too much alreadymr tomkins sir i wish you good night  a word in season at parting said tomkins standing up behind the long leathern back of a chair hemming and snuffling as if preparing for an exhortation  excuse me sir replied markham everard sternly you are not now sufficiently yourself to guide the devotion of others  woe be to them that reject said the secretary of the commissioners stalking out of the roomthe rest was lost in shutting the door or suppressed for fear of offence  and now fool wildrake begone to thy bedyonder it lies pointing to the knights apartment  what thou hast secured the ladys for thyself i saw thee put the key in thy pocket  i would notindeed i could not sleep in that apartmenti can sleep nowherebut i will watch in this armchairi have made him place wood for repairing the firegood now go to bed thyself and sleep off thy liquor  liquori laugh thee to scorn markthou art a milksop and the son of a milksop and knowst not what a good fellow can do in the way of crushing an honest cup  the whole vices of his faction are in this poor fellow individually said the colonel to himself eyeing his protegé askance as the other retreated into the bedroom with no very steady pacehe is reckless intemperate dissoluteand if i cannot get him safely shipped for france he will certainly be both his own ruin and mineyet withal he is kind brave and generous and would have kept the faith with me which he now expects from me and in what consists the merit of our truth if we observe not our plighted word when we have promised to our hurt i will take the liberty however to secure myself against farther interruption on his part  so saying he locked the door of communication betwixt the sleepingroom to which the cavalier had retreated and the parlour and then after pacing the floor thoughtfully returned to his seat trimmed the lamp and drew out a number of lettersi will read these over once more he said that if possible the thought of public affairs may expel this keen sense of personal sorrow gracious providence where is this to end we have sacrificed the peace of our families the warmest wishes of our young hearts to right the country in which we were born and to free her from oppression yet it appears that every step we have made towards liberty has but brought us in view of new and more terrific perils as he who travels in a mountainous region is by every step which elevates him higher placed in a situation of more imminent hazard  he read long and attentively various tedious and embarrassed letters in which the writers placing before him the glory of god and the freedom and liberties of england as their supreme ends could not by all the ambagitory expressions they made use of prevent the shrewd eye of markham everard from seeing that selfinterest and views of ambition were the principal moving springs at the bottom of their plots                                       chapter the sixth     sleep steals on us even like his brother death   we know not when it comeswe know it must come   we may affect to scorn and to contemn it   for tis the highest pride of human misery   to say it knows not of an opiate   yet the reft parent the despairing lover   even the poor wretch who waits for execution   feels this oblivion against which he thought   his woes had armd his senses steal upon him   and through the fenceless citadelthe body   surprise that haughty garrisonthe mind                                             herbert  colonel everard experienced the truth contained in the verses of the quaint old bard whom we have quoted above amid private grief and anxiety for a country long a prey to civil war and not likely to fall soon under any fixed or wellestablished form of government everard and his father had like many others turned their eyes to general cromwell as the person whose valour had made him the darling of the army whose strong sagacity had hitherto predominated over the high talents by which he had been assailed in parliament as well as over his enemies in the field and who was alone in the situation to settle the nation as the phrase then went or in other words to dictate the mode of government the father and son were both reputed to stand high in the generals favour but markham everard was conscious of some particulars which induced him to doubt whether cromwell actually and at heart bore either to his father or to himself that goodwill which was generally believed he knew him for a profound politician who could veil for any length of time his real sentiments of men and things until they could be displayed without prejudice to his interest and he moreover knew that the general was not likely to forget the opposition which the presbyterian party had offered to what oliver called the great matterthe trial namely and execution of the king in this opposition his father and he had anxiously concurred nor had the arguments nor even the halfexpressed threats of cromwell induced them to flinch from that course far less to permit their names to be introduced into the commission nominated to sit in judgment on that memorable occasion  this hesitation had occasioned some temporary coldness between the general and the everards father and son but as the latter remained in the army and bore arms under cromwell both in scotland and finally at worcester his services very frequently called forth the approbation of his commander after the fight of worcester in particular he was among the number of those officers on whom oliver rather considering the actual and practical extent of his own power than the name under which he exercised it was with difficulty withheld from imposing the dignity of knightsbannerets at his own will and pleasure it therefore seemed that all recollection of former disagreement was obliterated and that the everards had regained their former stronghold in the generals affections there were indeed several who doubted this and who endeavoured to bring over this distinguished young officer to some other of the parties which divided the infant commonwealth but to these proposals he turned a deaf ear enough of blood he said had been spilledit was time that the nation should have repose under a firmlyestablished government of strength sufficient to protect property and of lenity enough to encourage the return of tranquillity this he thought could only be accomplished by means of cromwell and the greater part of england was of the same opinion it is true that in thus submitting to the domination of a successful soldier those who did so forgot the principles upon which they had drawn the sword against the late king but in revolutions stern and high principles are often obliged to give way to the current of existing circumstances and in many a case where wars have been waged for points of metaphysical right they have been at last gladly terminated upon the mere hope of obtaining general tranquillity as after many a long siege a garrison is often glad to submit on mere security for life and limb  colonel everard therefore felt that the support which he afforded cromwell was only under the idea that amid a choice of evils the least was likely to ensue from a man of the generals wisdom and valour being placed at the head of the state and he was sensible that oliver himself was likely to consider his attachment as lukewarm and imperfect and measure his gratitude for it upon the same limited scale  in the meanwhile however circumstances compelled him to make trial of the generals friendship the sequestration of woodstock and the warrant to the commissioners to dispose of it as national property had been long granted but the interest of the elder everard had for weeks and months deferred its execution the hour was now approaching when the blow could be no longer parried especially as sir henry lee on his side resisted every proposal of submitting himself to the existing government and was therefore now that his hour of grace was passed enrolled in the list of stubborn and irreclaimable malignants with whom the council of state was determined no longer to keep terms the only mode of protecting the old knight and his daughter was to interest if possible the general himself in the matter and revolving all the circumstances connected with their intercourse colonel everard felt that a request which would so immediately interfere with the interests of desborough the brotherinlaw of cromwell and one of the present commissioners was putting to a very severe trial the friendship of the latter yet no alternative remained  with this view and agreeably to a request from cromwell who at parting had been very urgent to have his written opinion upon public affairs colonel everard passed the earlier part of the night in arranging his ideas upon the state of the commonwealth in a plan which he thought likely to be acceptable to cromwell as it exhorted him under the aid of providence to become the saviour of the state by convoking a free parliament and by their aid placing himself at the head of some form of liberal and established government which might supersede the state of anarchy in which the nation was otherwise likely to be merged taking a general view of the totally broken condition of the royalists and of the various factions which now convulsed the state he showed how this might be done without bloodshed or violence from this topic he descended to the propriety of keeping up the becoming state of the executive government in whose hands soever it should be lodged and thus showed cromwell as the future stadtholder or consul or lieutenantgeneral of great britain and ireland a prospect of demesne and residence becoming his dignity then he naturally passed to the disparking and destroying of the royal residences of england made a woful picture of the demolition which impended over woodstock and interceded for the preservation of that beautiful seat as a matter of personal favour in which he found himself deeply interested  colonel everard when he had finished his letter did not find himself greatly risen in his own opinion in the course of his political conduct he had till this hour avoided mixing up personal motives with his public grounds of action and yet he now felt himself making such a composition but he comforted himself or at least silenced this unpleasing recollection with the consideration that the weal of britain studied under the aspect of the times absolutely required that cromwell should be at the head of the government and that the interest of sir henry lee or rather his safety and his existence no less emphatically demanded the preservation of woodstock and his residence there was it a fault of his that the same road should lead to both these ends or that his private interest and that of the country should happen to mix in the same letter he hardened himself therefore to the act made up and addressed his packet to the lordgeneral and then sealed it with his seal of arms this done he lay back in the chair and in spite of his expectations to the contrary fell asleep in the course of his reflections anxious and harassing as they were and did not awaken until the cold grey light of dawn was peeping through the eastern oriel  he started at first rousing himself with the sensation of one who awakes in a place unknown to him but the localities instantly forced themselves on his recollection the lamp burning dimly in the socket the wood fire almost extinguished in its own white embers the gloomy picture over the chimneypiece the sealed packet on the tableall reminded him of the events of yesterday and his deliberations of the succeeding night there is no help for it he said it must be cromwell or anarchy and probably the sense that his title as head of the executive government is derived merely from popular consent may check the too natural proneness of power to render itself arbitrary if he govern by parliaments and with regard to the privileges of the subject wherefore not oliver as well as charles but i must take measures for having this conveyed safely to the hands of this future sovereign prince it will be well to take the first word of influence with him since there must be many who will not hesitate to recommend counsels more violent and precipitate  he determined to intrust the important packet to the charge of wildrake whose rashness was never so distinguished as when by any chance he was left idle and unemployed besides even if his faith had not been otherwise unimpeachable the obligations which he owed to his friend everard must have rendered it such  these conclusions passed through colonel everards mind as collecting the remains of wood in the chimney he gathered them into a hearty blaze to remove the uncomfortable feeling of dullness which pervaded his limbs and by the time he was a little more warm again sunk into a slumber which was only dispelled by the beams of morning peeping into his apartment  he arose roused himself walked up and down the room and looked from the large oriel window on the nearest objects which were the untrimmed hedges and neglected walks of a certain wilderness as it is called in ancient treatises on gardening which kept of yore well ordered and in all the pride of the topiary art presented a succession of yewtrees cut into fantastic forms of close alleys and of open walks filling about two or three acres of ground on that side of the lodge and forming a boundary between its immediate precincts and the open park its enclosure was now broken down in many places and the hinds with their fawns fed free and unstartled up to the very windows of the silvan palace  this had been a favourite scene of markhams sports when a boy he could still distinguish though now grown out of shape the verdant battlements of a gothic castle all created by the gardeners shears at which he was accustomed to shoot his arrows or stalking before it like the knighterrants of whom he read was wont to blow his horn and bid defiance to the supposed giant or paynim knight by whom it was garrisoned he remembered how he used to train his cousin though several years younger than himself to bear a part in those revels of his boyish fancy and to play the character of an elfin page or a fairy or an enchanted princess he remembered too many particulars of their later acquaintance from which he had been almost necessarily led to the conclusion that from an early period their parents had entertained some idea that there might be a wellfitted match betwixt his fair cousin and himself a thousand visions formed in so bright a prospect had vanished along with it but now returned like shadows to remind him of all he had lostand for whatfor the sake of england his proud consciousness repliedof england in danger of becoming the prey at once of bigotry and tyranny and he strengthened himself with the recollection if i have sacrificed my private happiness it is that my country may enjoy liberty of conscience and personal freedom which under a weak prince and usurping statesman she was but too likely to have lost  but the busy fiend in his breast would not be repulsed by the bold answer has thy resistance it demanded availed thy country markham everard lies not england after so much bloodshed and so much misery as low beneath the sword of a fortunate soldier as formerly under the sceptre of an encroaching prince are parliament or what remains of them fitted to contend with a leader master of his soldiers hearts as bold and subtle as he is impenetrable in his designs this general who holds the army and by that the fate of the nation in his hand will he lay down his power because philosophy would pronounce it his duty to become a subject  he dared not answer that his knowledge of cromwell authorised him to expect any such act of selfdenial yet still he considered that in times of such infinite difficulty that must be the best government however little desirable in itself which should most speedily restore peace to the land and stop the wounds which the contending parties were daily inflicting on each other he imagined that cromwell was the only authority under which a steady government could be formed and therefore had attached himself to his fortune though not without considerable and recurring doubts how far serving the views of this impenetrable and mysterious general was consistent with the principles under which he had assumed arms  while these things passed in his mind everard looked upon the packet which lay on the table addressed to the lordgeneral and which he had made up before sleep he hesitated several times when he remembered its purport and in what degree he must stand committed with that personage and bound to support his plans of aggrandizement when once that communication was in oliver cromwells possession  yet it must be so he said at last with a deep sigh among the contending parties he is the strongestthe wisest and most moderate and ambitious though he be perhaps not the most dangerous some one must be trusted with power to preserve and enforce general order and who can possess or wield such power like him that is head of the victorious armies of england come what will in future peace and the restoration of law ought to be our first and most pressing object this remnant of a parliament cannot keep their ground against the army by mere appeal to the sanction of opinion if they design to reduce the soldiery it must be by actual warfare and the land has been too long steeped in blood but cromwell may and i trust will make a moderate accommodation with them on grounds by which peace may be preserved and it is to this which we must look and trust for a settlement of the kingdom alas and for the chance of protecting my obstinate kinsman from the consequences of his honest though absurd pertinacity  silencing some internal feelings of doubt and reluctance by such reasoning as this markham everard continued in his resolution to unite himself with cromwell in the struggle which was evidently approaching betwixt the civil and military authorities not as the course which if at perfect liberty he would have preferred adopting but as the best choice between two dangerous extremities to which the times had reduced him he could not help trembling however when he recollected that his father though hitherto the admirer of cromwell as the implement by whom so many marvels had been wrought in england might not be disposed to unite with his interest against that of the long parliament of which he had been till partly laid aside by continued indisposition an active and leading member this doubt also he was obliged to swallow or strangle as he might but consoled himself with the ready argument that it was impossible his father could see matters in another light than that in which they occurred to himself                                       chapter the seventh   determined at length to dispatch his packet to the general without delay colonel everard approached the door of the apartment in which as was evident from the heavy breathing within the prisoner wildrake enjoyed a deep slumber under the influence of liquor at once and of fatigue in turning the key the bolt which was rather rusty made a resistance so noisy as partly to attract the sleepers attention though not to awake him everard stood by his bedside as he heard him mutter is it morning already jailorwhy you dog an you had but a cast of humanity in you you would qualify your vile news with a cup of sackhanging is sorry work my mastersand sorrows dry  up wildrakeup thou illomened dreamer said his friend shaking him by the collar  hands off answered the sleeperi can climb a ladder without help i trowhe then sate up in the bed and

valuable on earth to your management your conduct and language are those of a mere bedlamite last night i made allowance for thy drunken fury but who can endure thy morning madnessit is unsafe for thyself and me wildrakeit is unkindi might say ungrateful  nay do not say that my friend said the cavalier with some show of feeling and do not judge of me with a severity that cannot apply to such as i am we who have lost our all in these sad jars who are compelled to shift for our living not from day to day but from meal to mealwe whose only hiding place is the jail whose prospect of final repose is the gallowswhat canst thou expect from us but to bear such a lot with a light heart since we should break down under it with a heavy one  this was spoken in a tone of feeling which found a responding string in everards bosom he took his friends hand and pressed it kindly  nay if i seemed harsh to thee wildrake i profess it was for thine own sake more than mine i know thou hast at the bottom of thy levity as deep a principle of honour and feeling as ever governed a human heart but thou art thoughtlessthou art rashand i protest to thee that wert thou to betray thyself in this matter in which i trust thee the evil consequences to myself would not afflict me more than the thought of putting thee into such danger  nay if you take it on that tone mark said the cavalier making an effort to laugh evidently that he might conceal a tendency to a different emotion thou wilt make children of us bothbabes and sucklings by the hilt of this bilbocome trust me i can be cautious when time requires itno man ever saw me drink when an alert was expectedand not one poor pint of wine will i taste until i have managed this matter for thee well i am thy secretaryclerki had forgotand carry thy dispatches to cromwell taking good heed not to be surprised or choused out of my lump of loyalty striking his finger on the packet and i am to deliver it to the most loyal hands to which it is most humbly addressedadzooks mark think of it a moment longer surely thou wilt not carry thy perverseness so far as to strike in with this bloodyminded rebelbid me give him three inches of my dudgeondagger and i will do it much more willingly than present him with thy packet  go to replied everard this is beyond our bargain if you will help me it is well if not let me lose no time in debating with thee since i think every moment an age till the packet is in the generals possession it is the only way left me to obtain some protection and a place of refuge for my uncle and his daughter  that being the case said the cavalier i will not spare the spur my nag up yonder at the town will be ready for the road in a trice and thou mayst reckon on my being with old nollthy general i meanin as short time as man and horse may consume betwixt woodstock and windsor where i think i shall for the present find thy friend keeping possession where he has slain  hush not a word of that since we parted last night i have shaped thee a path which will suit thee better than to assume the decency of language and of outward manner of which thou hast so little i have acquainted the general that thou hast been by bad example and bad education  which is to be interpreted by contraries i hope said wildrake for sure i have been as well born and bred up as any lad of leicestershire might desire  now i prithee hushthou hast i say by bad example become at one time a malignant and mixed in the party of the late king but seeing what things were wrought in the nation by the general thou hast come to a clearness touching his calling to be a great implement in the settlement of these distracted kingdoms this account of thee will not only lead him to pass over some of thy eccentricities should they break out in spite of thee but will also give thee an interest with him as being more especially attached to his own person  doubtless said wildrake as every fisher loves best the trouts that are of his own tickling  it is likely i think he will send thee hither with letters to me said the colonel enabling me to put a stop to the proceedings of these sequestrators and to give poor old sir henry lee permission to linger out his days among the oaks he loves to look upon i have made this my request to general cromwell and i think my fathers friendship and my own may stretch so far on his regard without risk of cracking especially standing matters as they now dothou dost understand  entirely well said the cavalier stretch quothai would rather stretch a rope than hold commerce with the old kingkilling ruffian but i have said i will be guided by thee markham and rat me but i will  be cautious then said everard mark well what he does and saysmore especially what he does for oliver is one of those whose mind is better known by his actions than by his words and stayi warrant thee thou wert setting off without a cross in thy purse  too true mark said wildrake the last noble melted last night among yonder blackguard troopers of yours  well roger replied the colonel that is easily mended so saying he slipped his purse into his friends hand but art thou not an inconsiderate weatherbrained fellow to set forth as thou wert about to do without any thing to bear thy charges what couldst thou have done  faith i never thought of that i must have cried stand i suppose to the first pursy townsman or greasy grazier that i met o the heathit is many a good fellows shift in these bad times  go to said everard be cautioususe none of your loose acquaintancerule your tonguebeware of the winepotfor there is little danger if thou couldst only but keep thyself soberbe moderate in speech and forbear oaths or vaunting  in short metamorphose myself into such a prig as thou art mark well said wildrake so far as outside will go i think i can make a hopeonhighbomby footnote a puritanic character in one of beaumont and fletchers plays as well as thou canst ah those were merry days when we saw mills present bomby at the fortune playhouse mark ere i had lost my laced cloak and the jewel in my ear or thou hadst gotten the wrinkle on thy brow and the puritanic twist of thy mustache  they were like most worldly pleasures wildrake replied everard sweet in the mouth and bitter in digestionbut away with thee and when thou bringst back my answer thou wilt find me either here or at saint georges inn at the little boroughgood luck to theebe but cautious how thou bearest thyself  the colonel remained in deep meditationi think he said i have not pledged myself too far to the general a breach between him and the parliament seems inevitable and would throw england back into civil war of which all men are wearied he may dislike my messengeryet that i do not greatly fear he knows i would choose such as i can myself depend on and hath dealt enough with the stricter sort to be aware that there are among them as well as elsewhere men who can hide two faces under one hood                                       chapter the eighth     for there in lofty air was seen to stand   the stern protector of the conquerd land   draw in that look with which he wept and swore   turnd out the members and made fast the door   ridding the house of every knave and drone   forcedthough it grieved his soulto rule alone      the frank courtshipcrabbe  leaving colonel everard to his meditations we follow the jolly cavalier his companion who before mounting at the george did not fail to treat himself to his morningdraught of eggs and muscadine to enable him to face the harvest wind  although he had suffered himself to be sunk in the extravagant license which was practised by the cavaliers as if to oppose their conduct in every point to the preciseness of their enemies yet wildrake wellborn and welleducated and endowed with good natural parts and a heart which even debauchery and the wild life of a roaring cavalier had not been able entirely to corrupt moved on his present embassy with a strange mixture of feelings such as perhaps he had never in his life before experienced  his feelings as a loyalist led him to detest cromwell whom in other circumstances he would scarce have wished to see except in a field of battle where he could have had the pleasure to exchange pistolshots with him but with this hatred there was mixed a certain degree of fear always victorious wherever he fought the remarkable person whom wildrake was now approaching had acquired that influence over the minds of his enemies which constant success is so apt to inspirethey dreaded while they hated himand joined to these feelings was a restless meddling curiosity which made a particular feature in wildrakes character who having long had little business of his own and caring nothing about that which he had was easily attracted by the desire of seeing whatever was curious or interesting around him  i should like to see the old rascal after all he said were it but to say that i had seen him  he reached windsor in the afternoon and felt on his arrival the strongest inclination to take up his residence at some of his old haunts when he had occasionally frequented that fair town in gayer days but resisting all temptations of this kind he went courageously to the principal inn from which its ancient emblem the garter had long disappeared the master too whom wildrake experienced in his knowledge of landlords and hostelries had remembered a dashing mine host of queen besss school had now sobered down to the temper of the times shook his head when he spoke of the parliament wielded his spigot with the gravity of a priest conducting a sacrifice wished england a happy issue out of all her difficulties and greatly lauded his excellency the lordgeneral wildrake also remarked that his wine was better than it was wont to be the puritans having an excellent gift at detecting every fallacy in that matter and that his measures were less and his charges largercircumstances which he was induced to attend to by mine host talking a good deal about his conscience  he was told by this important personage that the lordgeneral received frankly all sorts of persons and that he might obtain access to him next morning at eight oclock for the trouble of presenting himself at the castlegate and announcing himself as the bearer of despatches to his excellency  to the castle the disguised cavalier repaired at the hour appointed admittance was freely permitted to him by the redcoated soldier who with austere looks and his musket on his shoulder mounted guard at the external gate of that noble building wildrake passed through the underward or court gazing as he passed upon the beautiful chapel which had but lately received in darkness and silence the unhonoured remains of the slaughtered king of england rough as wildrake was the recollection of this circumstance affected him so strongly that he had nearly turned back in a sort of horror rather than face the dark and daring man to whom amongst all the actors in that melancholy affair its tragic conclusion was chiefly to be imputed but he felt the necessity of subduing all sentiments of this nature and compelled himself to proceed in a negotiation intrusted to his conduct by one to whom he was so much obliged as colonel everard at the ascent which passed by the round tower he looked to the ensignstaff from which the banner of england was wont to float it was gone with all its rich emblazonry its gorgeous quarterings and splendid embroidery and in its room waved that of the commonwealth the cross of saint george in its colours of blue and red not yet intersected by the diagonal cross of scotland which was soon after assumed as if in evidence of englands conquest over her ancient enemy this change of ensigns increased the train of his gloomy reflections in which although contrary to his wont he became so deeply wrapped that the first thing which recalled him to himself was the challenge from the sentinel accompanied with a stroke of the butt of his musket on the pavement with an emphasis which made wildrake start  whither away and who are you  the bearer of a packet answered wildrake to the worshipful the lordgeneral  stand till i call the officer of the guard  the corporal made his appearance distinguished above those of his command by a double quantity of band round his neck a double height of steeplecrowned hat a larger allowance of cloak and a treble proportion of sour gravity of aspect it might be read on his countenance that he was one of those resolute enthusiasts to whom oliver owed his conquests whose religious zeal made them even more than a match for the highspirited and highborn cavaliers who exhausted their valour in vain defence of their sovereigns person and crown he looked with grave solemnity at wildrake as if he was making in his own mind an inventory of his features and dress and having fully perused them he required to know his business  my business said wildrake as firmly as he couldfor the close investigation of this man had given him some unpleasant nervous sensationsmy business is with your general  with his excellency the lordgeneral thou wouldst say replied the corporal thy speech my friend savours too little of the reverence due to his excellency  dn his excellency was at the lips of the cavalier but prudence kept guard and permitted not the offensive words to escape the barrier he only bowed and was silent  follow me said the starched figure whom he addressed and wildrake followed him accordingly into the guardhouse which exhibited an interior characteristic of the times and very different from what such military stations present at the present day  by the fire sat two or three musketeers listening to one who was expounding some religious mystery to them he began half beneath his breath but in tones of great volubility which tones as he approached the conclusion became sharp and eager as challenging either instant answer or silent acquiescence the audience seemed to listen to the speaker with immovable features only answering him with clouds of tobaccosmoke which they rolled from under their thick mustaches on a bench lay a soldier on his face whether asleep or in a fit of contemplation it was impossible to decide in the midst of the floor stood an officer as he seemed by his embroidered shoulderbelt and scarf round his waist otherwise very plainly attired who was engaged in drilling a stout bumpkin lately enlisted to the manual as it was then used the motions and words of command were twenty at the very least and until they were regularly brought to an end the corporal did not permit wildrake either to sit down or move forward beyond the threshold of the guardhouse so he had to listen in succession topoise your musketrest your musketcock your muskethandle your primersand many other forgotten words of discipline until at length the words order your musket ended the drill for the time thy name friend said the officer to the recruit when the lesson was over  ephraim answered the fellow with an affected twang through the nose  and what besides ephraim  ephraim cobb from the goodly city of glocester where i have dwelt for seven years serving apprentice to a praiseworthy cordwainer  it is a goodly craft answered the officer but casting in thy lot with ours doubt not that thou shalt be set beyond thine awl and thy last to boot  a grim smile of the speaker accompanied this poor attempt at a pun and then turning round to the corporal who stood two paces off with the face of one who seemed desirous of speaking said how now corporal what tidings  here is one with a packet an please your excellency said the corporalsurely my spirit doth not rejoice in him seeing i esteem him as a wolf in sheeps clothing  by these words wildrake learned that he was in the actual presence of the remarkable person to whom he was commissioned and he paused to consider in what manner he ought to address him  the figure of oliver cromwell was as is generally known in no way prepossessing he was of middle stature strong and coarsely made with harsh and severe features indicative however of much natural sagacity and depth of thought his eyes were grey and piercing his nose too large in proportion to his other features and of a reddish hue  his manner of speaking when he had the purpose to make himself distinctly understood was energetic and forcible though neither graceful nor eloquent no man could on such occasion put his meaning into fewer and more decisive words but when as it often happened he had a mind to play the orator for the benefit of peoples ears without enlightening their understanding cromwell was wont to invest his meaning or that which seemed to be his meaning in such a mist of words surrounding it with so many exclusions and exceptions and fortifying it with such a labyrinth of parentheses that though one of the most shrewd men in england he was perhaps the most unintelligible speaker that ever perplexed an audience it has been long since said by the historian that a collection of the protectors speeches would make with a few exceptions the most nonsensical book in the world but he ought to have added that nothing could be more nervous concise and intelligible than what he really intended should be understood  it was also remarked of cromwell that though born of a good family both by father and mother and although he had the usual opportunities of education and breeding connected with such an advantage the fanatic democratic ruler could never acquire or else disdained to practise the courtesies usually exercised among the higher classes in their intercourse with each other his demeanour was so blunt as sometimes might be termed clownish yet there was in his language and manner a force and energy corresponding to his character which impressed awe if it did not impose respect and there were even times when that dark and subtle spirit expanded itself so as almost to conciliate affection the turn for humour which displayed itself by fits was broad and of a low and sometimes practical character something there was in his disposition congenial to that of his countrymen a contempt of folly a hatred of affectation and a dislike of ceremony which joined to the strong intrinsic qualities of sense and courage made him in many respects not an unfit representative of the democracy of england  his religion must always be a subject of much doubt and probably of doubt which he himself could hardly have cleared up unquestionably there was a time in his life when he was sincerely enthusiastic and when his natural temper slightly subject to hypochondria was strongly agitated by the same fanaticism which influenced so many persons of the time on the other hand there were periods during his political career when we certainly do him no injustice in charging him with a hypocritical affectation we shall probably judge him and others of the same age most truly if we suppose that their religious professions were partly influential in their own breasts partly assumed in compliance with their own interest and so ingenious is the human heart in deceiving itself as well as others that it is probable neither cromwell himself nor those making similar pretensions to distinguished piety could exactly have fixed the point at which their enthusiasm terminated and their hypocrisy commenced or rather it was a point not fixed in itself but fluctuating with the state of health of good or bad fortune of high or low spirits affecting the individual at the period  such was the celebrated person who turning round on wildrake and scanning his countenance closely seemed so little satisfied with what he beheld that he instinctively hitched forward his belt so as to bring the handle of his tucksword within his reach but yet folding his arms in his cloak as if upon second thoughts laying aside suspicion or thinking precaution beneath him he asked the cavalier what he was and whence he came  a poor gentleman sirthat is my lordanswered wildrake last from woodstock  and what may your tidings be sir gentleman said cromwell with an emphasis truly i have seen those most willing to take upon them that title bear themselves somewhat short of wise men and good men and true men with all their gentility yet gentleman was a good title in old england when men remembered what it was construed to mean  you say truly sir replied wildrake suppressing with difficulty some of his usual wild expletives formerly gentlemen were found in gentlemens places but now the world is so changed that you shall find the broidered belt has changed place with the under spurleather  sayst thou me said the general i profess thou art a bold companion that can bandy words so wantonlythou ringst somewhat too loud to be good metal methinks and once again what are thy tidings with me  this packet said wildrake commended to your hands by colonel markham everard  alas i must have mistaken thee answered cromwell mollified at the mention of a mans name whom he had great desire to make his own forgive us good friend for such we doubt not thou art sit thee down and commune with thyself as thou mayst until we have examined the contents of thy packet let him be looked to and have what he lacks so saying the general left the guardhouse where wildrake took his seat in the corner and awaited with patience the issue of his mission  the soldiers now thought themselves obliged to treat him with more consideration and offered him a pipe of trinidado and a black jack filled with october but the look of cromwell and the dangerous situation in which he might be placed by the least chance of detection induced wildrake to decline these hospitable offers and stretching back in his chair and affecting slumber he escaped notice or conversation until a sort of aidedecamp or military officer in attendance came to summon him to cromwells presence  by this person he was guided to a posterngate through which he entered the body of the castle and penetrating through many private passages and staircases he at length was introduced into a small cabinet or parlour in which was much rich furniture some bearing the royal cipher displayed but all confused and disarranged together with several paintings in massive frames having their faces turned towards the wall as if they had been taken down for the purpose of being removed  in this scene of disorder the victorious general of the commonwealth was seated in a large easychair covered with damask and deeply embroidered the splendour of which made a strong contrast with the plain and even homely character of his apparel although in look and action he seemed like one who felt that the seat which might have in former days held a prince was not too much distinguished for his own fortunes and ambition wildrake stood before him nor did he ask him to sit down  pearson said cromwell addressing himself to the officer in attendance wait in the gallery but be within call pearson bowed and was retiring who are in the gallery beside  worthy mr gordon the chaplain was holding forth but now to colonel overton and four captains of your excellencys regiment  we would have it so said the general we would not there were any corner in our dwelling where the hungry soul might not meet with manna was the good man carried onward in his discourse  mightily borne through said pearson and he was touching the rightful claims which the army and especially your excellency hath acquired by becoming the instruments in the great worknot instruments to be broken asunder and cast away when the day of their service is over but to be preserved and held precious and prized for their honourable and faithful labours for which they have fought and marched and fasted and prayed and suffered cold and sorrow while others who would now gladly see them disbanded and broken and cashiered eat of the fat and drink of the strong  ah good man said cromwell and did he touch upon this so feelingly i could say somethingbut not now begone pearson to the gallery let not our friends lay aside their swords but watch as well as pray  pearson retired and the general holding the letter of everard in his hand looked again for a long while fixedly at wildrake as if considering in what strain he should address him  when he did speak it was at first in one of those ambiguous discourses which we have already described and by which it was very difficult for any one to understand his meaning if indeed he knew himself we shall be as concise in our statement as our desire to give the very words of a man so extraordinary will permit  this letter he said you have brought us from your master or patron markham everard truly an excellent and honourable gentleman as ever bore a sword upon his thigh and one who hath ever distinguished himself in the great work of delivering these three poor unhappy nations answer me not i know what thou wouldst sayand this letter he hath sent to me by thee his clerk or secretary in whom he hath confidence and in whom he prays me to have trust that there may be a careful messenger between us and lastly he hath sent thee to medo not answeri know what thou wouldst sayto me who albeit i am of that small consideration that it would be too much honour for me even to bear a halberd in this great and victorious army of england am nevertheless exalted to the rank of holding the guidance and the leadingstaff thereofnay do not answer my friendi know what thou wouldst say now when communing thus together our discourse taketh in respect to what i have said a threefold argument or division first as it concerneth thy master secondly as it concerneth us and our office thirdly and lastly as it toucheth thyselfnow as concerning this good and worthy gentleman colonel markham everard truly he hath played the man from the beginning of these unhappy buffetings not turning to the right or to the left but holding ever in his eye the mark at which he aimed ay truly a faithful honourable gentleman and one who may well call me friend and truly i am pleased to think that he doth so nevertheless in this vale of tears we must be governed less by our private respects and partialities than by those higher principles and points of duty whereupon the good colonel markham everard hath ever framed his purposes as truly i have endeavoured to form mine that we may all act as becometh good englishmen and worthy patriots then as for woodstock it is a great thing which the good colonel asks that it should be taken from the spoil of the godly and left in keeping of the men of moab and especially of the malignant henry lee whose hand hath been ever against us when he might find room to raise it i say he hath asked a great thing both in respect of himself and me for we of this poor but godly army of england are holden by those of the parliament as men who should render in spoil for them but be no sharer of it ourselves even as the buck which the hounds pull to earth furnisheth no part of their own food but they are lashed off from the carcass with whips like those which require punishment for their forwardness not reward for their services yet i speak not this so much in respect of this grant of woodstock in regard that perhaps their lordships of the council and also the committeemen of this parliament may graciously think they have given me a portion in the matter in relation that my kinsman desborough hath an interest allowed him therein which interest as he hath well deserved it for his true and faithful service to these unhappy and devoted countries so it would ill become me to diminish the same to his prejudice unless it were upon great and public respects thus thou seest how it stands with me my honest friend and in what mind i stand touching thy masters request to me which yet i do not say that i can altogether or unconditionally grant or refuse but only tell my simple thoughts with regard thereto thou understandest me i doubt not  now roger wildrake with all the attention he had been able to pay to the lordgenerals speech had got so much confused among the various clauses of the harangue that his brain was bewildered like that of a country clown when he chances to get himself involved among a crowd of carriages and cannot stir a step to get out of the way of one of them without being in danger of being ridden over by the others  the general saw his look of perplexity and began a new oration to the same purpose as before spoke of his love for his kind friend the colonelhis regard for his pious and godly kinsman master desborough the great importance of the palace and park of woodstockthe determination of the parliament that it should be confiscated and the produce brought into the coffers of the statehis own deep veneration for the authority of parliament and his no less deep sense of the injustice done to the armyhow it was his wish and will that all matters should be settled in an amicable and friendly manner without selfseeking debate or strife betwixt those who had been the hands acting and such as had been the heads governing in that great national causehow he was willing truly willing to contribute to this work by laying down not his commission only but his life also if it were requested of him or could be granted with safety to the poor soldiers to whom silly poor men he was bound to be as a father seeing that they had followed him with the duty and affection of children  and here he arrived at another dead pause leaving wildrake as uncertain as before whether it was or was not his purpose to grant colonel everard the powers he had asked for the protection of woodstock against the parliamentary commissioners internally he began to entertain hopes that the justice of heaven or the effects of remorse had confounded the regicides understanding but nohe could see nothing but sagacity in that steady stern eye which while the tongue poured forth its periphrastic language in such profusion seemed to watch with severe accuracy the effect which his oratory produced on the listener  egad thought the cavalier to himself becoming a little familiar with the situation in which he was placed and rather impatient of a conversationwhich led to no visible conclusion or termination if noll were the devil himself as he is the devils darling i will not be thus noseled by him ill een brusque it a little if he goes on at this rate and try if i can bring him to a more intelligible mode of speaking  entertaining this bold purpose but half afraid to execute it wildrake lay by for an opportunity of making the attempt while cromwell was apparently unable to express his own meaning he was already beginning a third panegyric upon colonel everard with sundry varied expressions of his own wish to oblige him when wildrake took the opportunity to strike in on the generals making one of his oratorical pauses  so please you he said bluntly your worship has already spoken on two topics of your discourse your own worthiness and that of my master colonel everard but to enable me to do mine errand it would be necessary to bestow a few words on the third head  the third said cromwell  ay said wildrake which in your honours subdivision of your discourse touched on my unworthy self what am i to dowhat portion am i to have in this matter  oliver started at once from the tone of voice he had hitherto used and which somewhat resembled the purring of a domestic cat into the growl of the tiger when about to spring thy portion jailbird he exclaimed the gallowsthou shalt hang as high as haman if thou betray counselbut he added softening his voice keep it like a true man and my favour will be the making of thee come hitherthou art bold i see though somewhat saucy thou hast been a malignantso writes my worthy friend colonel everard but thou hast now given up that falling cause i tell thee friend not all that the parliament or the army could do would have pulled down the stewarts out of their high places saving that heaven had a controversy with them well it is a sweet and comely thing to buckle on ones armour in behalf of heavens cause otherwise truly for mine own part these men might have remained upon the throne even unto this day neither do i blame any for aiding them until these successive great judgments have overwhelmed them and their house i am not a bloody man having in me the feeling of human frailty but friend whosoever putteth his hand to the plough in the great actings which are now on foot in these nations had best beware that he do not look back for rely upon my simple word that if you fail me i will not spare on you one foots length of the gallows of haman let me therefore know at a word if the leaven of thy malignancy is altogether drubbed out of thee your honourable lordship said the cavalier shrugging up his shoulders has done that for most of us so far as cudgelling to some tune can perform it  sayst thou said the general with a grim smile on his lip which seemed to intimate that he was not quite inaccessible to flattery yea truly thou dost not lie in thatwe have been an instrument neither are we as i have already hinted so severely bent against those who have striven against us as malignants as others may be the parliamentmen best know their own interest and their own pleasure but to my poor thinking it is full time to close these jars and to allow men of all kinds the means of doing service to their country and we think it will be thy fault if thou art not employed to good purpose for the state and thyself on condition thou puttest away the old man entirely from thee and givest thy earnest attention to what i have to tell thee  your lordship need not doubt my attention said the cavalier and the republican general after another pause as one who gave his confidence not without hesitation proceeded to explain his views with a distinctness which he seldom used yet not without his being a little biassed now and then by his long habits of circumlocution which indeed he never laid entirely aside save in the field of battle  thou seest he said my friend how things stand with me the parliament i care not who knows it love me notstill less do the council of state by whom they manage the executive government of the kingdom i cannot tell why they nourish suspicion against me unless it is because i will not deliver this poor innocent army which has followed me in so many military actions to be now pulled asunder broken piecemeal and reduced so that they who have protected the state at the expense of their blood will not have perchance the means of feeding themselves by their labour which methinks were hard measure since it is taking from esau his birthright even without giving him a poor mess of pottage  esau is likely to help himself i think replied wildrake  truly thou sayst wisely replied the general it is ill starving an armed man if there is food to be had for takingnevertheless far be it from me to encourage rebellion or want of due subordination to these our rulers i would only petition in a due and becoming a sweet and harmonious manner that they would listen to our conditions and consider our necessities but sir looking on me and estimating me so little as they do you must think that it would be a provocation in me towards the council of state as well as the parliament if simply to gratify your worthy master i were to act contrary to their purposes or deny currency to the commission under their authority which is as yet the highest in the stateand long may it be so for meto carry on the sequestration which they intend and would it not also be said that i was lending myself to the malignant interest affording this den of the bloodthirsty and lascivious tyrants of yore to be in this our day a place of refuge to that old and inveterate amalekite sir henry lee to keep possession of the place in which he hath so long glorified himself truly it would be a perilous matter  am i then to report said wildrake an it please you that you cannot stead colonel everard in this matter  unconditionally aybut taken conditionally the answer may be otherwiseanswered cromwell i see thou art not able to fathom my purpose and therefore i will partly unfold it to theebut take notice that should thy tongue betray my counsel save in so far as carrying it to thy master by all the blood which has been shed in these wild times thou shalt die a thousand deaths in one  do not fear me sir said wildrake whose natural boldness and carelessness of character was for the present time borne down and quelled like that of falcons in the presence of the eagle  hear me then said cromwell and let no syllable escape thee knowest thou not the young lee whom they call albert a malignant like his father and one who went up with the young man to that last ruffle which we had with him at worcestermay we be grateful for the victory  i know there is such a young gentleman as albert lee said wildrake  and knowest thou noti speak not by way of prying into the good colonels secrets but only as it behoves me to know something of the matter that i may best judge how i am to serve himknowest thou not that thy master markham everard is a suitor after the sister of this same malignant a daughter of the old keeper called sir henry lee  all this i have heard said wildrake nor can i deny that i believe in it  well then go towhen the young man charles stewart fled from the field of worcester and was by sharp chase and pursuit compelled to separate himself from his followers i know by sure intelligence that this albert lee was one of the last who remained with him if not indeed the very last  it was devilish like him said the cavalier without sufficiently weighing his expressions considering in what presence they were to be utteredand ill uphold him with my rapier to be a true chip of the old block  ha swearest thou said the general is this thy reformation  i never swear so please you replied wildrake recollecting himself except there is some mention of malignants and cavaliers in my hearing and then the old habit returns and i swear like one of gorings troopers  out upon thee said the general what can it avail thee to practise a profanity so horrible to the ears of others and which brings no emolument to him who uses it  there are doubtless more profitable sins in the world than the barren and unprofitable vice of swearing was the answer which rose to the lips of the cavalier but that was exchanged for a profession of regret for having given offence the truth was the discourse began to take a turn which rendered it more interesting than ever to wildrake who therefore determined not to lose the opportunity for obtaining possession of the secret that seemed to be suspended on cromwells lips and that could only be through means of keeping guard upon his own  what sort of a house is woodstock said the general abruptly  an old mansion said wildrake in reply and so far as i could judge by a single nights lodgings having abundance of backstairs also subterranean passages and all the communications under ground which are common in old ravennests of the sort  and places for concealing priests unquestionably said cromwell it is seldom that such ancient houses lack secret stalls wherein to mew up these calves of bethel  your honours excellency said wildrake may swear to that  i swear not at all replied the general drilybut what thinkst thou good fellowi will ask thee a blunt questionwhere will those two worcester fugitives that thou wottest of be more likely to take shelterand that they must be sheltered somewhere i well knowthan in this same old palace with all the corners and concealment whereof young albert hath been acquainted ever since his earliest infancy  truly said wildrake making an effort to answer the question with seeming indifference while the possibility of such an event and its consequences flashed fearfully upon his mindtruly i should be of your honours opinion but that i think the company who by the commission of parliament have occupied woodstock are likely to fright them thence as a cat scares doves from a pigeonhouse the neighbourhood with reverence of generals desborough and harrison will suit ill with fugitives from worcester field  i thought as much and so indeed would i have it answered the general long may it be ere our names shall be aught but a terror to our enemies but in this matter if thou art an active plotter for thy masters interest thou mightst i should think work out something favourable to his present object  my brain is too poor to reach the depth of your honourable purpose said wildrake  listen then and let it be to profit answered cromwell assuredly the conquest at worcester was a great and crowning mercy yet might we seem to be but small in our thankfulness for the same did we not do what in us lies towards the ultimate improvement and final conclusion of the great work which has been thus prosperous in our hands professing in pure humility and singleness of heart that we do not in any way deserve our instrumentality to be remembered nay would rather pray and entreat that our name and fortunes were forgotten than that the great work were in itself incomplete nevertheless truly placed as we now are it concerns us more nearly than othersthat is if so poor creatures should at all speak of themselves as concerned whether more or less with these changes which have been wrought aroundnot i say by ourselves or our own power but by the destiny to which we were called fulfilling the same with all meekness and humilityi say it concerns us nearly that all things should be done in conformity with the great work which hath been wrought and is yet working in these lands such is my plain and simple meaning nevertheless it is much to be desired that this young man this king of scots as he called himselfthis charles stewartshould not escape forth from the nation where his arrival has wrought so much disturbance and bloodshed  i have no doubt said the cavalier looking down that your lordships wisdom hath directed all things as they may best lead towards such a consummation and i pray your pains may be paid as they deserve  i thank thee friend said cromwell with much humility doubtless we shall meet our reward being in the hands of a good paymaster who never passeth saturday night but understand me friendi desire no more than my own share in the good work i would heartily do what poor kindness i can to your worthy master and even to you in your degreefor such as i do not converse with ordinary men that our presence may be forgotten like an everydays occurrence we speak to men like thee for their reward or their punishment and i trust it will be the former which thou in thine office wilt merit at my hand  your honour said wildrake speaks like one accustomed to command  true mens minds are likened to those of my degree by fear and reverence said the generalbut enough of that desiring as i do no other dependency on my special person than is alike to us all upon that which is above us but i would desire to cast this golden ball into your masters lap he hath served against this charles stewart and his father but he is a kinsman near to the old knight lee and stands well affected towards his daughter thou also wilt keep a watch my friendthat ruffling look of thine will procure thee the confidence of every malignant and the prey cannot approach this cover as though to shelter like a coney in the rocks but thou wilt be sensible of his presence  i make a shift to comprehend your excellency said the cavalier and i thank you heartily for the good opinion you have put upon me and which i pray i may have some handsome opportunity of deserving that i may show my gratitude by the event but still with reverence your excellencys scheme seems unlikely while woodstock remains in possession of the sequestrators both the old knight and his son and far more such a fugitive as your honor hinted at will take special care not to approach it till they are removed  it is for that i have been dealing with thee thus long said the generali told thee that i was something unwilling upon slight occasion to dispossess the sequestrators by my own proper warrant although having perhaps sufficient authority in the state both to do so and to despise the murmurs of those who blame me in brief i would be both to tamper with my privileges and make experiments between their strength and the powers of the commission granted by others without pressing need or at least great prospect of advantage so if thy colonel will undertake for his love of the republic to find the means of preventing its worst and nearest danger which must needs occur from the escape of this young man and will do his endeavour to stay him in case his flight should lead him to woodstock which i hold very likely i will give thee an order to these sequestrators to evacuate the palace instantly and to the next troop of my regiment which lies at oxford to turn them out by the shoulders if they make any scruplesay even for examples sake if they drag desborough out foremost though he be wedded to my sister  so please you sir said wildrake and with your most powerful warrant i trust i might expel the commissioners even without the aid of your most warlike and devout troopers  that is what i am least anxious about replied the general i should like to see the best of them sit after i had nodded to them to begone always excepting the worshipful house in whose name our commissions run but who as some think will be done with politics ere it be time to renew them therefore what chiefly concerns me to know is whether thy master will embrace a traffic which hath such a fair promise of profit with it i am well convinced that with a scout like thee who hast been in the cavaliers quarters and canst i should guess resume thy drinking ruffianly healthquaffing manners whenever thou hast a mind he must discover where this stewart hath ensconced himself either the young lee will visit the old one in person or he will write to him or hold communication with him by letter at all events markham everard and thou must have an eye in every hair of your head while he spoke a flush passed over his brow he rose from his chair and paced the apartment in agitation woe to you if you suffer the young adventurer to escape meyou had better be in the deepest dungeon in europe than breathe the air of england should you but dream of playing me false i have spoken freely to thee fellowmore freely than is my wontthe time required it but to share my confidence is like keeping a watch over a powdermagazine the least and most insignificant spark blows thee to ashes tell your master what i saidbut not how i said itfie that i should have been betrayed into this distemperature of passion begone sirrah pearson shall bring thee sealed ordersyet staythou hast something to ask  i would know said wildrake to whom the visible anxiety of the general gave some confidence what is the figure of this young gallant in case i should find him  a tall rawboned swarthy lad they say he has shot up into here is his picture by a good hand some time since he turned round one of the portraits which stood with its face against the wall but it proved not to be that of charles the second but of his unhappy father  the first motion of cromwell indicated a purpose of hastily replacing the picture and it seemed as if an effort were necessary to repress his disinclination to look upon it but he did repress it and placing the picture against the wall withdrew slowly and sternly as if in defiance of his own feelings he was determined to gain a place from which to see it to advantage it was well for wildrake that his dangerous companion had not turned an eye on him for his blood also kindled when he saw the portrait of his master in the hands of the chief author of his death being a fierce and desperate man he commanded his passion with great difficulty and if on its first violence he had been provided with a suitable weapon it is possible cromwell would never have ascended higher in his bold ascent towards supreme power  but this natural and sudden flash of indignation which rushed through the veins of an ordinary man like wildrake was presently subdued when confronted with the strong yet stifled emotion displayed by so powerful a character as cromwell as the cavalier looked on his dark and bold countenance agitated by inward and indescribable feelings he found his own violence of spirit die away and lose itself in fear and wonder so true it is that as greater lights swallow up and extinguish the display of those which are less so men of great capacious and overruling minds bear aside and subdue in their climax of passion the more feeble wills and passions of others as when a river joins a brook the fiercer torrent shoulders aside the smaller stream  wildrake stood a silent inactive and almost a terrified spectator while cromwell assuming a firm sternness of eye and manner as one who compels himself to look on what some strong internal feeling renders painful and disgustful to him proceeded in brief and interrupted expressions but yet with a firm voice to comment on the portrait of the late king his words seemed less addressed to wildrake than to be the spontaneous unburdening of his own bosom swelling under recollection of the past and anticipation of the future  that flemish painter he saidthat antonio vandyckwhat a power he has steel may mutilate warriors may waste and destroystill the king stands uninjured by time and our grandchildren while they read his history may look on his image and compare the melancholy features with the woful taleit was a stern necessityit was an awful deed the calm pride of that eye might have ruled worlds of crouching frenchmen or supple italians or formal spaniards but its glances only roused the native courage of the stern englishmanlay not on poor sinful man whose breath is in his nostrils the blame that he falls when heaven never gave him strength of nerves to stand the weak rider is thrown by his unruly horse and trampled to deaththe strongest man the best cavalier springs to the empty saddle and uses bit and spur till the fiery steed knows its master who blames him who mounted aloft rides triumphantly amongst the people for having succeeded where the unskilful and feeble fell and died verily he hath his reward then what is that piece of painted canvas to me more than others no let him show to others the reproaches of that cold calm face that proud yet complaining eye those who have acted on higher respects have no cause to start at painted shadows not wealth nor power brought me from my obscurity the oppressed consciences the injured liberties of england were the banner that i followed  he raised his voice so high as if pleading in his own defence before some tribunal that pearson the officer in attendance looked into the apartment and observing his master with his eyes kindling his arm extended his foot advanced and his voice raised like a general in the act of commanding the advance of his army he instantly withdrew  it was other than selfish regards that drew me forth to action continued cromwell and i dare the worlday living or dead i challengeto assert that i armed for a private cause or as a means of enlarging my fortunes neither was there a trooper in the regiment who came there with less of personal ill will to yonder unhappy  at this moment the door of the apartment opened and a gentlewoman entered who from her resemblance to the general although her features were soft and feminine might be immediately recognised as his daughter she walked up to cromwell gently but firmly passed her arm through his and said to him in a persuasive tone father this is not wellyou have promised me this should not happen  the general hung down his head like one who was either ashamed of the passion to which he had given way or of the influence which was exercised over him he yielded however to the affectionate impulse and left the apartment without again turning his head towards the portrait which had so much affected him or looking towards wildrake who remained fixed in astonishment                                       chapter the ninth     doctorgo to go toyou have known what you should not    macbeth  wildrake was left in the cabinet as we have said astonished and alone it was often noised about that cromwell the deep and sagacious statesman the calm and intrepid commander he who had overcome such difficulties and ascended to such heights that he seemed already to bestride the land which he had conquered had like many other men of great genius a constitutional taint of melancholy which sometimes displayed itself both in words and actions and had been first observed in that sudden and striking change when abandoning entirely the dissolute freaks of his youth he embraced a very strict course of religious observances which upon some occasions he seemed to consider as bringing him into more near and close contact with the spiritual world this extraordinary man is said sometimes during that period of his life to have given way to spiritual delusions or as he himself conceived them prophetic inspirations of approaching grandeur and of strange deep and mysterious agencies in which he was in future to be engaged in the same manner as his younger years had been marked by fits of exuberant and excessive frolic and debaucheries something of this kind seemed to explain the ebullition of passion which he had now manifested  with wonder at what he had witnessed wildrake felt some anxiety on his own account though not the most reflecting of mortals he had sense enough to know that it is dangerous to be a witness of the infirmities of men high in power and he was left so long by himself as induced him to entertain some secret doubts whether the general might not be tempted to take means of confining or removing a witness who had seen him lowered as it seemed by the suggestions of his own conscience beneath that lofty flight which in general he affected to sustain above the rest of the sublunary world  in this however he wronged cromwell who was free either from an extreme degree of jealous suspicion or from any thing which approached towards bloodthirstiness pearson appeared after a lapse of about an hour and intimating to wildrake that he was to follow conducted him into a distant apartment in which he found the general seated on a couch his daughter was in the apartment but remained at some distance apparently busied with some female needlework and scarce turned her head as pearson and wildrake entered  at a sign from the lordgeneral wildrake approached him as before comrade he said your old friends the cavaliers look on me as their enemy and conduct themselves towards me as if they desired to make me such i profess they are labouring to their own prejudice for i regard and have ever regarded them as honest and honourable fools who were silly enough to run their necks into nooses and their heads against stonewalls that a man called stewart and no other should be king over them fools are there no words made of letters that would sound as well as charles stewart with that magic title beside them why the word king is like a lighted lamp that throws the same bright gilding upon any combination of the alphabet and yet you must shed your blood for a name but thou for thy part shalt have no wrong from me here is an order well warranted to clear the lodge at woodstock and abandon it to thy masters keeping or those whom he shall appoint he will have his uncle and pretty cousin with him doubtless fare thee wellthink on what i told thee they say beauty is a loadstone to yonder long lad thou dost wot of but i reckon he has other stars at present to direct his course than bright eyes and fair hair be it as it may thou knowst my purposepeer out peer out keep a constant and careful lookout on every ragged patch that wanders by hedgerow or lanethese are days when a beggars cloak may cover a kings ransom there are some broad portugal pieces for theesomething strange to thy pouch i weenonce more think on what thou hast heard and he added in a lower and more impressive tone of voice forget what thou hast seen my service to thy masterand yet once again rememberand forgetwildrake made his obeisance and returning to his inn left windsor with all possible speed  it was afternoon in the same day when the cavalier rejoined his roundhead friend who was anxiously expecting him at the inn in woodstock appointed for their rendezvous  where hast thou beenwhat hast thou seenwhat strange uncertainty is in thy looksand why dost thou not answer me  because said wildrake laying aside his riding cloak and rapier you ask so many questions at once a man has but one tongue to answer with and mine is wellnigh glued to the roof of my mouth  will drink unloosen it said the colonel though i dare say thou hast tried that spell at every alehouse on the road call for what thou wouldst have man only be quick  colonel everard answered wildrake i have not tasted so much as a cup of cold water this day  then thou art out of humour for that reason said the colonel salve thy sore with brandy if thou wilt but leave being so fantastic and unlike to thyself as thou showest in this silent mood  colonel everard replied the cavalier very gravely i am an altered man  i think thou dost alter said everard every day in the year and every hour of the day come good now tell me hast thou seen the general and got his warrant for clearing out the sequestrators from woodstock  i have seen the devil said wildrake and have as thou sayst got a warrant from him  give it me hastily said everard catching at the packet  forgive me mark said wildrake if thou knewest the purpose with which this deed is grantedif thou knewestwhat it is not my purpose to tell theewhat manner of hopes are founded on thy accepting it i have that opinion of thee mark everard that thou wouldst as soon take a redhot horseshoe from the anvil with thy bare hand as receive into it this slip of paper  come come said everard this comes of some of your exalted ideas of loyalty which excellent within certain bounds drive us mad when encouraged up to some heights do not think since i must needs speak plainly with thee that i see without sorrow the downfall of our ancient monarchy and the substitution of another form of government in its stead but ought my regret for the past to prevent my acquiescing and aiding in such measures as are likely to settle the future the royal cause is ruined hadst thou and every cavalier in england sworn the contrary ruined not to rise againfor many a day at least the parliament so often draughted and drained of those who were courageous enough to maintain their own freedom of opinion is now reduced to a handful of statesmen who have lost the respect of the people from the length of time during which they have held the supreme management of affairs they cannot stand long unless they were to reduce the army and the army late servants are now masters and will refuse to be reduced they know their strength and that they may be an army subsisting on pay and free quarters throughout england as long as they will i tell thee wildrake unless we look to the only man who can rule and manage them we may expect military law throughout the land and i for mine own part look for any preservation of our privileges that may be vouchsafed to us only through the wisdom and forbearance of cromwell now you have my secret you are aware that i am not doing the best i would but the best i can i wishnot so ardently as thou perhapsyet i do wish that the king could have been restored on good terms of composition safe for us and for himself and now good wildrake rebel as thou thinkest me make me no worse a rebel than an unwilling one god knows i never laid aside love and reverence to the king even in drawing my sword against his ill advisers  ah plague on you said wildrake that is the very cant of itthats what you all say all of you fought against the king in pure love and loyalty and not otherwise however i see your drift and i own that i like it better than i expected the army is your bear now and old noll is your bearward and you are like a country constable who makes interest with the bearward that he may prevent him from letting bruin loose well there may come a day when the sun will shine on our side of the fence and thereon shall you and all the good fairweather folks who love the stronger party come and make common cause with us  without much attending to what his friend said colonel everard carefully studied the warrant of cromwell it is bolder and more peremptory than i expected he said the general must feel himself strong when he opposes his own authority so directly to that of the council of state and the parliament  you will not hesitate to act upon it said wildrake  that i certainly will not answered everard but i must wait till i have the assistance of the mayor who i think will gladly see these fellows ejected from the lodge i must not go altogether upon military authority if possible then stepping to the door of the apartment he despatched a servant of the house in quest of the chief magistrate desiring he should be made acquainted that colonel everard desired to see him with as little loss of time as possible  you are sure he will come like a dog at a whistle said wildrake the word captain or colonel makes the fat citizen trot in these days when one sword is worth fifty corporation charters but there are dragoons yonder as well as the grimfaced knave whom i frightened the other evening when i showed my face in at the window thinkst thou the knaves will show no rough play  the generals warrant will weigh more with them than a dozen acts of parliament said everardbut it is time thou eatest if thou hast in truth ridden from windsor hither without baiting  i care not about it said wildrake i tell thee your general gave me a breakfast which i think will serve me one while if i am ever able to digest it by the mass it lay so heavy on my conscience that i carried it to church to see if i could digest it there with my other sins but not a whit  to churchto the door of the church thou meanest said everard i know thy waythou art ever wont to pull thy hat off reverently at the threshold but for crossing it that day seldom comes  well replied wildrake and if i do pull off my castor and kneel is it not seemly to show the same respects in a church which we offer in a palace it is a dainty matter is it not to see your anabaptists and brownists and the rest of you gather to a sermon with as little ceremony as hogs to a trough but here comes food and now for a grace if i can remember one  everard was too much interested about the fate of his uncle and his fair cousin and the prospect of restoring them to their quiet home under the protection of that formidable truncheon which was already regarded as the leadingstaff of england to remark that certainly a great alteration had taken place in the manners and outward behaviour at least of his companion his demeanour frequently evinced a sort of struggle betwixt old habits of indulgence and some newly formed resolutions of abstinence and it was almost ludicrous to see how often the hand of the neophyte directed itself naturally to a large black leathern jack which contained two double flagons of strong ale and how often diverted from its purpose by the better reflections of the reformed toper it seized instead upon a large ewer of salubrious and pure water  it was not difficult to see that the task of sobriety was not yet become easy and that if it had the recommendation of the intellectual portion of the party who had resolved upon it the outward man yielded a reluctant and restive compliance but honest wildrake had been dreadfully frightened at the course proposed to him by cromwell and with a feeling not peculiar to the catholic religion had formed a solemn resolution within his own mind that if he came off safe and with honour from this dangerous interview he would show his sense of heavens favour by renouncing some of the sins which most easily beset him and especially that of intemperance to which like many of his wild compeers he was too much addicted  this resolution or vow was partly prudential as well as religious for it occurred to him as very possible that some matters of a difficult and delicate nature might be thrown into his hands at the present emergency during the conduct of which it would be fitting for him to act by some better oracle than that of the bottle celebrated by rabelais in full compliance with this prudent determination he touched neither the ale nor the brandy which were placed before him and declined peremptorily the sack with which his friend would have garnished the board nevertheless just as the boy removed the trenchers and napkins together with the large blackjack which we have already mentioned and was one or two steps on his way to the door the sinewy arm of the cavalier which seemed to elongate itself on purpose as it extended far beyond the folds of the threadbare jacket arrested the progress of the retiring ganymede and seizing on the blackjack conveyed it to the lips which were gently breathing forth the aspiration dni mean heaven forgive mewe are poor creatures of clayone modest sip must be permitted to our frailty  so murmuring he glued the huge flagon to his lips and as the head was slowly and gradually inclined backwards in proportion as the right hand elevated the bottom of the pitcher everard had great doubts whether the drinker and the cup were likely to part until the whole contents of the latter had been transferred to the person of the former roger wildrake stinted however when by a moderate computation he had swallowed at one draught about a quart and a half  he then replaced it on the salver fetched a long breath to refresh his lungs bade the boy get him gone with the rest of the liquors in a tone which inferred some dread of his constancy and then turning to his friend everard he expatiated in praise of moderation observing that the mouthful which he had just taken had been of more service to him than if he had remained quaffing healths at table for four hours together  his friend made no reply but could not help being privately of opinion that wildrakes temperance had done as much execution on the tankard in his single draught as some more moderate topers might have effected if they had sat sipping for an evening but the subject was changed by the entrance of the landlord who came to announce to his honour colonel everard that the worshipful mayor of woodstock with the rev master holdenough were come to wait upon him                                         chapter the tenth                    here we have one head   upon two bodiesyour twoheaded bullock   is but an ass to such a prodigy    these two have but one meaning thought and counsel   and when the single noddle has spoke out   the four legs scrape assent to it                                             old play  in the goodly form of the honest mayor there was a bustling mixture of importance and embarrassment like the deportment of a man who was conscious that he had an important part to act if he could but exactly discover what that part was but both were mingled with much pleasure at seeing everard and he frequently repeated his welcomes and allhails before he could be brought to attend to what that gentleman said in reply  good worthy colonel you are indeed a desirable sight to woodstock at all times being as i may say almost our townsman as you have dwelt so much and so long at the palace truly the matter begins almost to pass my wit though i have transacted the affairs of this borough for many a long day and you are come to my assistance like like  tanquam deus ex machina as the ethnic poet hath it said master holdenough although i do not often quote from such booksindeed master markham everardor worthy colonel as i ought rather to sayyou are simply the most welcome man who has come to woodstock since the days of old king harry  i had some business with you my good friend said the colonel addressing the mayor i shall be glad if it should so happen at the same time that i may find occasion to pleasure you or your worthy pastor  no question you can do so good sir interposed master holdenough you have the heart sir and you have the hand and we are much in want of good counsel and that from a man of action i am aware worthy colonel that you and your worthy father have ever borne yourselves in these turmoils like men of a truly christian and moderate spirit striving to pour oil into the wounds of the land which some would rub with vitriol and pepper and we know you are faithful children of that church which we have reformed from its papistical and prelatical tenets  my good and reverend friend said everard i respect the piety and learning of many of your teachers but i am also for liberty of conscience to all men i neither side with sectaries nor do i desire to see them the object of suppression by violence  sir sir said the presbyterian hastily all this hath a fair sound but i would you should think what a fine country and church we are like to have of it amidst the errors blasphemies and schisms which are daily introduced into the church and kingdom of england so that worthy master edwards in his gangrena declareth that our native country is about to become the very sink and cesspool of all schisms heresies blasphemies and confusions as the army of hannibal was said to be the refuse of all nationscolluvies omnium gentiumbelieve me worthy colonel that they of the honourable house view all this over lightly and with the winking connivance of old eli these instructors the schismatics shoulder the orthodox ministers out of their pulpits thrust themselves into families and break up the peace thereof stealing away mens hearts from the established faith  my good master holdenough replied the colonel interrupting the zealous preacher there is ground of sorrow for all these unhappy discords and i hold with you that the fiery spirits of the present time have raised mens minds at once above soberminded and sincere religion and above decorum and common sense but there is no help save patience enthusiasm is a stream that may foam off in its own time whereas it is sure to bear down every barrier which is directly opposed to itbut what are these schismatical proceedings to our present purpose  why partly this sir said holdenough although perhaps you may make less of it than i should have thought before we meti was myselfi nehemiah holdenough he added consequentially was forcibly expelled from my own pulpit even as a man should have been thrust out of his own house by an alien and an intrudera wolf who was not at the trouble even to put on sheeps clothing but came in his native wolfish attire of buff and bandalier and held forth in my stead to the people who are to me as a flock to the lawful shepherd it is too true sirmaster mayor saw it and strove to take such order to prevent it as man might though turning to the mayor i think still you might have striven a little more  good now good master holdenough do not let us go back on that question said the mayor guy of warwick or bevis of hampton might do something with this generation but truly they are too many and too strong for the mayor of woodstock  i think master mayor speaks very good sense said the colonel if the independents are not allowed to preach i fear me they will not fightand then if you were to have another rising of cavaliers  there are worse folks may rise than cavaliers said holdenough  how sir replied colonel everard let me remind you master holdenough that is no safe language in the present state of the nation  i say said the presbyterian there are worse folk may rise than cavaliers and i will prove what i say the devil is worse than the worst cavalier that ever drank a health or swore an oathand the devil has arisen at woodstock lodge  ay truly hath he said the mayor bodily and visibly in figure and forman awful time we live in  gentlemen i really know not how i am to understand you said everard  why it was even about the devil we came to speak with you said the mayor but the worthy minister is always so hot upon the sectaries  which are the devils brats and nearly akin to him said master holdenough but true it is that the growth of these sects has brought up the evil one even upon the face of the earth to look after his own interest where he finds it most thriving  master holdenough said the colonel if you speak figuratively i have already told you that i have neither the means nor the skill sufficient to temper these religious heats but if you design to say that there has been an actual apparition of the devil i presume to think that you with your doctrine and your learning would be a fitter match for him than a soldier like me  true sir and i have that confidence in the commission which i hold that i would take the field against the foul fiend without a moments delay said holdenough but the place in which he hath of late appeared being woodstock is filled with those dangerous and impious persons of whom i have been but now complaining and though confident in my own resources i dare venture in disputation with their great master himself yet without your protection most worthy colonel i see not that i may with prudence trust myself with the tossing and goring ox desborough or the bloody and devouring bear harrison or the cold and poisonous snake bletsonall of whom are now at the lodge doing license and taking spoil as they think meet and as all men say the devil hath come to make a fourth with them  in good truth worthy and noble sir said the mayor it is even as master holdenough saysour privileges are declared void our cattle seized in the very pastures they talk of cutting down and disparking the fair chase which has been so long the pleasure of so many kings and making woodstock of as little note as any paltry village i assure you we heard of your arrival with joy and wondered at your keeping yourself so close in your lodgings we know no one save your father or you that are like to stand the poor burgesses friend in this extremity since almost all the gentry around are malignants and under sequestration we trust therefore you will make strong intercession in our behalf  certainly master mayor said the colonel who saw himself with pleasure anticipated it was my very purpose to have interfered in this matter and i did but keep myself alone until i should be furnished with some authority from the lordgeneral  powers from the lordgeneral said the mayor thrusting the clergyman with his elbowdost thou hear thatwhat cock will fight that cock we shall carry it now over their necks and woodstock shall be brave woodstock still  keep thine elbow from my side friend said holdenough annoyed by the action which the mayor had suited to his words and may the lord send that cromwell prove not as sharp to the people of england as thy bones against my person yet i approve that we should use his authority to stop the course of these mens proceedings  let us set out then said colonel everard and i trust we shall find the gentlemen reasonable and obedient  the functionaries laic and clerical assented with much joy and the colonel required and received wildrakes assistance in putting on his cloak and rapier as if he had been the dependent whose part he acted the cavalier contrived however while doing him these menial offices to give his friend a shrewd pinch in order to maintain the footing of secret equality betwixt them  the colonel was saluted as they passed through the streets by many of the anxious inhabitants who seemed to consider his intervention as affording the only chance of saving their fine park and the rights of the corporation as well as of individuals from ruin and confiscation  as they entered the park the colonel asked his companions what is this you say of apparitions being seen amongst them  why colonel said the clergyman you know yourself that woodstock was always haunted  i have lived therein many a day said the colonel and i know i never saw the least sign of it although idle people spoke of the house as they do of all old mansions and gave the apartments ghosts and spectres to fill up the places of as many of the deceased great as had ever dwelt there  nay but good colonel said the clergyman i trust you have not reached the prevailing sin of the times and become indifferent to the testimony in favour of apparitions which appears so conclusive to all but atheists and advocates for witches  i would not absolutely disbelieve what is so generally affirmed said the colonel but my reason leads me to doubt most of the stories which i have heard of this sort and my own experience never went to confirm any of them  ay but trust me said holdenough there was always a demon of one or the other species about this woodstock not a man or woman in the town but has heard stories of apparitions in the forest or about the old castle sometimes it is a pack of hounds that sweep along and the whoops and halloos of the huntsmen and the winding of horns and the galloping of horse which is heard as if first more distant and then close around youand then anon it is a solitary huntsman who asks if you can tell him which way the stag has gone he is always dressed in green but the fashion of his clothes is some five hundred years old this is what we call demon meridianumthe noonday spectre  my worthy and reverend sir said the colonel i have lived at woodstock many seasons and have traversed the chase at all hours trust me what you hear from the villagers is the growth of their idle folly and superstition  colonel replied holdenough a negative proves nothing what signifies craving your pardon that you have not seen anything be it earthly or be it of the other world to detract from the evidence of a score of people who haveand besides there is the demon nocturnum the being that walketh by night he has been among these independents and schismatics last night ay colonel you may stare but it is even sothey may try whether he will mend their gifts as they profanely call them of exposition and prayer no sir i trow to master the foul fiend there goeth some competent knowledge of theology and an acquaintance of the humane letters ay and a regular clerical education and clerical calling  i do not in the least doubt said the colonel the efficacy of your qualifications to lay the devil but still i think some odd mistake has occasioned this confusion amongst them if there has any such in reality existed desborough is a blockhead to be sure and harrison is fanatic enough to believe anything but there is bletson on the other hand who believes nothingwhat do you know of this matter good master mayor  in sooth and it was master bletson who gave the first alarm replied the magistrate or at least the first distinct one you see sir i was in bed with my wife and no one else and i was as fast asleep as a man can desire to be at two hours after midnight when behold you they came knocking at my bedroom door to tell me there was an alarm in woodstock and that the bell of the lodge was ringing at that dead hour of the night as hard as ever it rung when it called the court to dinner  well but the cause of this alarm said the colonel  you shall hear worthy colonel you shall hear answered the mayor waving his hand with dignity for he was one of those persons who will not be hurried out of their own pace so mrs mayor would have persuaded me in her love and affection poor wretch that to rise at such an hour out of my own warm bed was like to bring on my old complaint the lumbago and that i should send the people to alderman duttonalderman devil mrs mayor said ii beg your reverences pardon for using such a phrasedo you think i am going to lie abed when the town is on fire and the cavaliers up and the devil to payi beg pardon again parsonbut here we are before the gate of the palace will it not please you to enter  i would first hear the end of your story said the colonel that is master mayor if it happens to have an end  every thing hath an end said the mayor and that which we call a pudding hath twoyour worship will forgive me for being facetious where was ioh i jumped out of bed and put on my red plush breeches with the blue nether stocks for i always make a point of being dressed suitably to my dignity night and day summer or winter colonel everard and i took the constable along with me in case the alarm should be raised by nightwalkers or thieves and called up worthy master holdenough out of his bed in case it should turn out to be the devil and so i thought i was provided for the worst and so away we came and by and by the soldiers who came to the town with master tomkins who had been called to arms came marching down to woodstock as fast as their feet would carry them so i gave our people the sign to let them pass us and outmarch us as it were and this for a twofold reason  i will be satisfied interrupted the colonel with one good reason you desired the redcoats should have the first of the fray  true sir very trueand also that they should have the last of it in respect that fighting is their especial business however we came on at a slow pace as men who are determined to do their duty without fear or favour when suddenly we saw something white haste away up the avenue towards the town when six of our constables and assistants fled at once as conceiving it to be an apparition called the white woman of woodstock  look you there colonel said master holdenough i told you there were demons of more kinds than one which haunt the ancient scenes of royal debauchery and cruelty  i hope you stood your own ground master mayor said the colonel  iyesmost assuredlythat is i did not strictly speaking keep my ground but the townclerk and i retreatedretreated colonel and without confusion or dishonour and took post behind worthy master holdenough who with the spirit of a lion threw himself in the way of the supposed spectre and attacked it with such a siserary of latin as might have scared the devil himself and thereby plainly discovered that it was no devil at all nor white woman neither woman of any colour but worshipful master bletson a member of the house of commons and one of the commissioners sent hither upon this unhappy sequestration of the wood chase and lodge of woodstock  and this was all you saw of the demon said the colonel  truly yes answered the mayor and i had no wish to see more however we conveyed master bletson as in duty bound back to the lodge and he was ever maundering by the way how that he met a party of scarlet devils incarnate marching down to the lodge but to my poor thinking it must have been the independent dragoons who had just passed us  and more incarnate devils i would never wish to see said wildrake who could remain silent no longer his voice so suddenly heard showed how much the mayors nerves were still alarmed far he started and jumped aside with an alacrity of which no one would at first sight suppose a man of his portly dignity to have been capable everard imposed silence on his intrusive attendant and desirous to hear the conclusion of this strange story requested the mayor to tell him how the matter ended and whether they stopped the supposed spectre  truly worthy sir said the mayor master holdenough was quite venturous upon confronting as it were the devil and compelling him to appear under the real form of master joshua bletson member of parliament for the borough of littlefaith  in sooth master mayor said the divine i were strangely ignorant of my own commission and its immunities if i were to value opposing myself to satan or any independent in his likeness all of whom in the name of him i serve i do defy spit at and trample under my feet and because master mayor is something tedious i will briefly inform your honour that we saw little of the enemy that night save what master bletson said in the first feeling of his terrors and save what we might collect from the disordered appearance of the honourable colonel desborough and majorgeneral harrison  and what plight were they in i pray you demanded the colonel  why worthy sir every one might see with half an eye that they had been engaged in a fight wherein they had not been honoured with perfect victory seeing that general harrison was stalking up and down the parlour with his drawn sword in his hand talking to himself his doublet unbuttoned his points untrussed his garters loose and like to throw him down as he now and then trode on them and gaping and grinning like a mad player and yonder sate desborough with a dry pottle of sack before him which he had just emptied and which though the element in which he trusted had not restored him sense enough to speak or courage enough to look over his shoulder he had a bible in his hand forsooth as if it would of itself make battle against the evil one but i peered over his shoulder and alas the good gentleman held the bottom of the page uppermost it was as if one of your musketeers noble and valued sir were to present the butt of his piece at the enemy instead of the muzzleha ha ha it was a sight to judge of schismatics by both in point of head and in point of heart in point of skill and in point of courage oh colonel then was the time to see the true character of an authorised pastor of souls over those unhappy men who leap into the fold without due and legal authority and will forsooth preach teach and exhort and blasphemously term the doctrine of the church saltless porridge and dry chips  i have no doubt you were ready to meet the danger reverend sir but i would fain know of what nature it was and from whence it was to be apprehended  was it for me to make such inquiry said the clergyman triumphantly is it for a brave soldier to number his enemies or inquire from what quarter they are to come no sir i was there with match lighted bullet in my mouth and my harquebuss shouldered to encounter as many devils as hell could pour in were they countless as motes in the sunbeam and although they came from all points of the compass the papists talk of the temptation of st anthonypshaw let them double all the myriads which the brain of a crazy dutch painter hath invented and you will find a poor presbyterian divinei will answer for one at leastwho not in his own strength but his masters will receive the assault in such sort that far from returning against him as against yonder poor hound day after day and night after night he will at once pack them off as with a vengeance to the uttermost parts of assyria  still said the colonel i pray to know whether you saw anything upon which to exercise your pious learning  saw answered the divine no truly i saw nothing nor did i look for anything thieves will not attack wellarmed travellers nor will devils or evil spirits come against one who bears in his bosom the word of truth in the very language in which it was first dictated no sir they shun a divine who can understand the holy text as a crow is said to keep wide of a gun loaded with hailshot  they had walked a little way back upon their road to give time for this conversation and the colonel perceiving it was about to lead to no satisfactory explanation of the real cause of alarm on the preceding night turned round and observing it was time they should go to the lodge began to move in that direction with his three companions  it had now become dark and the towers of woodstock arose high above the umbrageous shroud which the forest spread around the ancient and venerable mansion from one of the highest turrets which could still be distinguished as it rose against the clear blue sky there gleamed a light like that of a candle within the building the mayor stopt short and catching fast hold of the divine and then of colonel everard exclaimed in a trembling and hasty but suppressed tone  do you see yonder light  ay marry do i said colonel everard and what does that mattera light in a garretroom of such an old mansion as woodstock is no subject of wonder i trow  but a light from rosamonds tower is surely so said the mayor  true said the colonel something surprised when after a careful examination he satisfied himself that the worthy magistrates conjecture was right that is indeed rosamonds tower and as the drawbridge by which it was accessible has been destroyed for centuries it is hard to say what chance could have lighted a lamp in such an inaccessible place  that light burns with no earthly fuel said the mayor neither from whale nor olive oil nor beeswax nor muttonsuet either i dealt in these commodities colonel before i went into my present line and i can assure you i could distinguish the sort of light they give one from another at a greater distance than yonder turretlook you that is no earthly flamesee you not something blue and reddish upon the edges that bodes full well where it comes fromcolonel in my opinion we had better go back to sup at the town and leave the devil and the redcoats to settle their matters together for tonight and then when we come back the next morning we will have a pull with the party that chances to keep afield  you will do as you please master mayor said everard but my duty requires me that i should see the commissioners tonight  and mine requires me to see the foul fiend said master holdenough if he dare make himself visible to me i wonder not that knowing who is approaching he betakes himself to the very citadel the inner and the last defences of this ancient and haunted mansion he is dainty i warrant you and must dwell where is a relish of luxury and murder about the walls of his chamber in yonder turret sinned rosamond and in yonder turret she suffered and there she sits or more likely the enemy in her shape as i have heard true men of woodstock tell i wait on you good colonelmaster mayor will do as he pleases the strong man hath fortified himself in his dwellinghouse but lo there cometh another stronger than he  for me said the mayor who am as unlearned as i am unwarlike i will not engage eitherwith the powers of the earth or the prince of the powers of the air and i would we were again at woodstockand hark ye good fellow slapping wildrake on the shoulder i will bestow on thee a shilling wet and a shilling dry if thou wilt go back with me  gadzookers master mayor said wildrake neither flattered by the magistrates familiarity of address nor captivated by his munificence i wonder who the devil made you and me fellows and besides do you think i would go back to woodstock with your worshipful codshead when by good management i may get a peep of fair rosamond and see whether she was that choice and incomparable piece of ware which the world has been told of by rhymers and balladmakers  speak less lightly and wantonly friend said the divine we are to resist the devil that he may flee from us and not to tamper with him or enter into his counsels or traffic with the merchandise of his great vanity fair  mind what the good man says wildrake said the colonel and take heed another time how thou dost suffer thy wit to outrun discretion  i am beholden to the reverend gentleman for his advice answered wildrake upon whose tongue it was difficult to impose any curb whatever even when his own safety rendered it most desirable but gadzookers let him have had what experience he will in fighting with the devil he never saw one so black as i had a tussle withnot a hundred years ago  how friend said the clergyman who understood every thing literally when apparitions were mentioned have you had so late a visitation of satan believe me then that i wonder why thou darest to entertain his name so often and so lightly as i see thou dost use it in thy ordinary discourse but when and where didst thou see the evil one  everard hastily interposed lest by something yet more strongly alluding to cromwell his imprudent squire should in mere wantonness betray his interview with the general the young man raves he said of a dream which he had the other night when he and i slept together in victor lees chamber belonging to the rangers apartments at the lodge  thanks for help at a pinch good patron said wildrake whispering into everards ear who in vain endeavoured to shake him offa fib never failed a fanatic  you also spoke something too lightly of these matters considering the work which we have in hand worthy colonel said the presbyterian divine believe me the young man thy servant was more likely to see visions than to dream merely idle dreams in that apartment for i have always heard that next to rosamonds tower in which as i said she played the wanton and was afterwards poisoned by queen eleanor victor lees chamber was the place in the lodge of woodstock more peculiarly the haunt of evil spiritsi pray you young man tell me this dream or vision of yours  with all my heart sir said wildrakethen addressing his patron who began to interfere he said tush sir you have had the discourse for an hour and why should not i hold forth in my turn by this darkness if you keep me silent any longer i will turn independent preacher and stand up in your despite for the freedom of private judgmentand so reverend sir i was dreaming of a carnal divertisement called a bullbaiting and methought they were venturing dogs at head as merrily as eer i saw them at tutbury bullrunning and methought i heard some one say there was the devil come to have a sight of the bullring well i thought that gadswoons i would have a peep at his infernal majesty so i looked and there was a butcher in greasy woollen with his steel by his side but he was none of the devil and there was a drunken cavalier with his mouth full of oaths and his stomach full of emptiness and a goldlaced waistcoat in a very dilapidated condition and a ragged hatwith a piece of a feather in it and he was none of the devil neither and here was a miller his hands dusty with meal and every atom of it stolen and there was a vintner his green apron stained with wine and every drop of it sophisticated but neither was the old gentleman i looked for to be detected among these artisans of iniquity at length sir i saw a grave person with cropped hair a pair of longish and projecting ears a band as broad as a slobbering bib under his chin a brown coat surmounted by a geneva cloak and i had old nicholas at once in his genuine paraphernalia by  shame shame said colonel everard what behave thus to an old gentleman and a divine  nay let him proceed said the minister with perfect equanimity if thy friend or secretary is gibing i must have less patience than becomes my profession if i could not bear an idle jest and forgive him who makes it or if on the other hand the enemy has really presented himself to the young man in such a guise as he intimates wherefore should we be surprised that he who can take upon him the form of an angel of light should be able to assume that of a frail and peaceable mortal whose spiritual calling and profession ought indeed to induce him to make his life an example to others but whose conduct nevertheless such is the imperfection of our unassisted nature sometimes rather presents us with a warning of what we should shun  now by the mass honest dominei mean reverend siri crave you a thousand pardons said wildrake penetrated by the quietness and patience of the presbyters rebuke by st george if quiet patience will do it thou art fit to play a game at foils with the devil himself and i would be contented to hold stakes  as he concluded an apology which was certainly not uncalled for and seemed to be received in perfectly good part they approached so close to the exterior door of the lodge that they were challenged with the emphatic stand by a sentinel who mounted guard there colonel everard replied a friend and the sentinel repeating his command stand friend proceeded to call the corporal of the guard the corporal came forth and at the same time turned out his guard colonel everard gave his name and designation as well as those of his companions on which the corporal said he doubted not there would be orders for his instant admission but in the first place master tomkins must be consulted that he might learn their honours mind  how sir said the colonel do you knowing who i am presume to keep me on the outside of your post  not if your honour pleases to enter said the corporal and undertakes to be my warranty but such are the orders of my post  nay then do your duty said the colonel but are the cavaliers up or what is the matter that you keep so close and strict a watch  the fellow gave no distinct answer but muttered between his mustaches something about the enemy and the roaring lion who goeth about seeking whom he may devour presently afterwards tomkins appeared followed by two servants bearing lights in great standing brass candlesticks they marched before colonel everard and his party keeping as close to each other as two cloves of the same orange and starting from time to time and shuddering as they passed through sundry intricate passages they led up a large and ample wooden staircase the banisters rail and lining of which were executed in black oak and finally into a long saloon or parlour where there was a prodigious fire and about twelve candles of the largest size distributed in sconces against the wall there were seated the commissioners who now held in their power the ancient mansion and royal domain of woodstock                                         chapter the eleventh     the bloody bear an independent beast   unlickd to forms in groans his hate expressd    next him the buffoon ape as atheists use   mimickd all sects and had his own to choose   hind and panther  the strong light in the parlour which we have described served to enable everard easily to recognise his acquaintances desborough harrison and bletson who had assembled round an oak table of large dimensions placed near the blazing chimney on which were arranged wine and ale and materials for smoking then the general indulgence of the time there was a species of movable cupboard set betwixt the table and the door calculated originally for a display of plate upon grand occasions but at present only used as a screen which purpose it served so effectually that ere he had coasted around it everard heard the following fragment of what desborough was saying in his strong coarse voicesent him to share with us ise warrant yeit was always his excellency my brotherinlaws wayif he made a treat for five friends he would invite more than the table could holdi have known him ask three men to eat two eggs  hush hush said bletson and the servants making their appearance from behind the tall cupboard announced colonel everard it may not be uninteresting to the reader to have a description of the party into which he now entered  desborough was a stout bullnecked man of middlesize with heavy vulgar features grizzled bushy eyebrows and walleyes the flourish of his powerful relatives fortunes had burst forth in the finery of his dress which was much more ornamented than was usual among the roundheads there was embroidery on his cloak and lace upon his band his hat displayed a feather with a golden clasp and all his habiliments were those of a cavalier or follower of the court rather than the plain dress of a parliamentarian officer but heaven knows there was little of courtlike grace or dignity in the person or demeanour of the individual who became his fine suit as the hog on the signpost does his gilded armour it was not that he was positively deformed or misshaped for taken in detail the figure was well enough but his limbs seemed to act upon different and contradictory principles they were not as the play says in a concatenation accordinglythe right hand moved as if it were upon bad terms with the left and the legs showed an inclination to foot it in different and opposite directions in short to use an extravagant comparison the members of colonel desborough seemed rather to resemble the disputatious representatives of a federative congress than the wellordered union of the orders of the state in a firm and wellcompacted monarchy where each holds his own place and all obey the dictates of a common head  general harrison the second of the commissioners was a tall thin middleaged man who had risen into his high situation in the army and his intimacy with cromwell by his dauntless courage in the field and the popularity he had acquired by his exalted enthusiasm amongst the military saints sectaries and independents who composed the strength of the existing army harrison was of mean extraction and bred up to his fathers employment of a butcher nevertheless his appearance though coarse was not vulgar like that of desborough who had so much the advantage of him in birth and education he had a masculine height and strength of figure was well made and in his manner announced a rough military character which might be feared but could not easily become the object of contempt or ridicule his aquiline nose and dark black eyes set off to some advantage a countenance otherwise irregular and the wild enthusiasm that sometimes sparkled in them as he dilated on his opinions to others and often seemed to slumber under his long dark eyelashes as he mused upon them himself gave something strikingly wild and even noble to his aspect he was one of the chief leaders of those who were called fifthmonarchy men who going even beyond the general fanaticism of the age presumptuously interpreted the book of the revelations after their own fancies considered that the second advent of the messiah and the millenium or reign of the saints upon earth was close at hand and that they themselves illuminated as they believed with the power of foreseeing these approaching events were the chosen instruments for the establishment of the new reign or fifth monarchy as it was called and were fated also to win its honours whether celestial or terrestrial  when this spirit of enthusiasm which operated like a partial insanity was not immediately affecting harrisons mind he was a shrewd worldly man and a good soldier one who missed no opportunity of mending his fortune and who in expecting the exaltation of the fifth monarchy was in the meanwhile a ready instrument for the establishment of the lordgenerals supremacy whether it was owing to his early occupation and habits of indifference to pain or bloodshed acquired in the shambles to natural disposition and want of feeling or finally to the awakened character of his enthusiasm which made him look upon those who opposed him as opposing the divine will and therefore meriting no favour or mercy is not easy to say but all agreed that after a victory or the successful storm of a town harrison was one of the most cruel and pitiless men in cromwells army always urging some misapplied text to authorize the continued execution of the fugitives and sometimes even putting to death those who had surrendered themselves prisoners it was said that at times the recollection of some of those cruelties troubled his conscience and disturbed the dreams of beatification in which his imagination indulged  when everard entered the apartment this true representative of the fanatic soldiers of the day who filled those ranks and regiments which cromwell had politically kept on foot while he procured the reduction of those in which the presbyterian interest predominated was seated a little apart from the others his legs crossed and stretched out at length towards the fire his head resting on his elbow and turned upwards as if studying with the most profound gravity the halfseen carving of the gothic roof  bletson remains to be mentioned who in person and figure was diametrically different from the other two there was neither foppery nor slovenliness in his exterior nor had he any marks of military service or rank about his person a small walking rapier seemed merely worn as a badge of his rank as a gentleman without his hand having the least purpose of becoming acquainted with the hilt or his eye with the blade his countenance was thin and acute marked with lines which thought rather than age had traced upon it and a habitual sneer on his countenance even when he least wished to express contempt on his features seemed to assure the individual addressed that in bletson he conversed with a person of intellect far superior to his own this was a triumph of intellect only however for on all occasions of difference respecting speculative opinions and indeed on all controversies whatsoever bletson avoided the ultimate ratio of blows and knocks  yet this peaceful gentleman had found himself obliged to serve personally in the parliamentary army at the commencement of the civil war till happening unluckily to come in contact with the fiery prince rupert his retreat was judged so precipitate that it required all the shelter that his friends could afford to keep him free of an impeachment or a courtmartial but as bletson spoke well and with great effect in the house of commons which was his natural sphere and was on that account high in the estimation of his party his behaviour at edgehill was passed over and he continued to take an active share in all the political events of that bustling period though he faced not again the actual front of war  bletsons theoretical politics had long inclined him to espouse the opinions of harrington and others who adopted the visionary idea of establishing a pure democratical republic in so extensive a country as britain this was a rash theory where there is such an infinite difference betwixt ranks habits education and moralswhere there is such an immense disproportion betwixt the wealth of individualsand where a large portion of the inhabitants consist of the inferior classes of the large towns and manufacturing districtsmen unfitted to bear that share in the direction of a state which must be exercised by the members of a republic in the proper sense of the word accordingly as soon as the experiment was made it became obvious that no such form of government could be adopted with the smallest chance of stability and the question came only to be whether the remnant or as it was vulgarly called the rump of the long parliament now reduced by the seclusion of so many of the members to a few scores of persons should continue in spite of their unpopularity to rule the affairs of britain whether they should cast all loose by dissolving themselves and issuing writs to convoke a new parliament the composition of which no one could answer for any more than for the measures they might take when assembled or lastly whether cromwell as actually happened was not to throw the sword into the balance and boldly possess himself of that power which the remnant of the parliament were unable to hold and yet afraid to resign  such being the state of parties the council of state in distributing the good things in their gift endeavoured to soothe and gratify the army as a beggar flings crusts to a growling mastiff in this view desborough had been created a commissioner in the woodstock matter to gratify cromwell harrison to soothe the fierce fifthmonarchy men and bletson as a sincere republican and one of their own leaven  but if they supposed bletson had the least intention of becoming a martyr to his republicanism or submitting to any serious loss on account of it they much mistook the man he entertained their principles sincerely and not the less that they were found impracticable for the miscarriage of his experiment no more converts the political speculator than the explosion of a retort undeceives an alchymist but bletson was quite prepared to submit to cromwell or any one else who might be possessed of the actual authority he was a ready subject in practice to the powers existing and made little difference betwixt various kinds of government holding in theory all to be nearly equal in imperfection so soon as they diverged from the model of harringtons oceana cromwell had already been tampering with him like wax between his finger and thumb and which he was ready shortly to seal with smiling at the same time to himself when he beheld the council of state giving rewards to bletson as their faithful adherent while he himself was secure of his allegiance how soon soever the expected change of government should take place  but bletson was still more attached to his metaphysical than his political creed and carried his doctrines of the perfectibility of mankind as far as he did those respecting the conceivable perfection of a model of government and as in the one case he declared against all power which did not emanate from the people themselves so in his moral speculations he was unwilling to refer any of the phenomena of nature to a final cause when pushed indeed very hard bletson was compelled to mutter some inarticulate and unintelligible doctrines concerning an animus mundi or creative power in the works of nature by which she originally called into existence and still continues to preserve her works to this power he said some of the purest metaphysicians rendered a certain degree of homage nor was he himself inclined absolutely to censure those who by the institution of holydays choral dances songs and harmless feasts and libations might be disposed to celebrate the great goddess nature at least dancing singing feasting and sporting being conformable things to both young and old they might as well sport dance and feast in honour of such appointed holydays as under any other pretext but then this moderate show of religion was to be practised under such exceptions as are admitted by the highgate oath and no one was to be compelled to dance drink sing or feast whose taste did not happen to incline them to such divertisements nor was any one to be obliged to worship the creative power whether under the name of the animus mundi or any other whatsoever the interference of the deity in the affairs of mankind he entirely disowned having proved to his own satisfaction that the idea originated entirely in priestcraft in short with the shadowy metaphysical exception aforesaid mr joshua bletson of darlington member for littlefaith came as near the predicament of an atheist as it is perhaps possible for a man to do but we say this with the necessary salvo for we have known many like bletson whose curtains have been shrewdly shaken by superstition though their fears were unsanctioned by any religious faith the devils we are assured believe and tremble but on earth there are many who in worse plight than even the natural children of perdition tremble without believing and fear even while they blaspheme  it follows of course that nothing could be treated with more scorn by mr bletson than the debates about prelacy and presbytery about presbytery and independency about quakers and anabaptists muggletonians and brownists and all the various sects with which the civil war had commenced and by which its dissensions were still continued it was he said as if beasts of burden should quarrel amongst themselves about the fashion of their halters and packsaddles instead of embracing a favourable opportunity of throwing them aside other witty and pithy remarks he used to make when time and place suited for instance at the club called the rota frequented by st john and established by harrington for the free discussion of political and religious subjects  but when bletson was out of this academy or stronghold of philosophy he was very cautious how he carried his contempt of the general prejudice in favour of religion and christianity further than an implied objection or a sneer if he had an opportunity of talking in private with an ingenuous and intelligent youth he sometimes attempted to make a proselyte and showed much address in bribing the vanity of inexperience by suggesting that a mind like his ought to spurn the prejudices impressed upon it in childhood and when assuming the latus clavus of reason assuring him that such as he laying aside the bulla of juvenile incapacity as bletson called it should proceed to examine and decide for himself it frequently happened that the youth was induced to adopt the doctrines in whole or in part of the sage who had seen his natural genius and who had urged him to exert it in examining detecting and declaring for himself and thus flattery gave proselytes to infidelity which could not have been gained by all the powerful eloquence or artful sophistry of the infidel  these attempts to extend the influence of what was called freethinking and philosophy were carried on as we have hinted with a caution dictated by the timidity of the philosophers disposition he was conscious his doctrines were suspected and his proceedings watched by the two principal sects of prelatists and presbyterians who however inimical to each other were still more hostile to one who was an opponent not only to a church establishment of any kind but to every denomination of christianity he found it more easy to shroud himself among the independents whose demands were for a general liberty of conscience or an unlimited toleration and whose faith differing in all respects and particulars was by some pushed into such wild errors as to get totally beyond the bounds of every species of christianity and approach very near to infidelity itself as extremes of each kind are said to approach each other bletson mixed a good deal among those sectaries and such was his confidence in his own logic and address that he is supposed to have entertained hopes of bringing to his opinions in time the enthusiastic vane as well as the no less enthusiastic harrison provided he could but get them to resign their visions of a fifth monarchy and induce them to be contented with a reign of philosophers in england for the natural period of their lives instead of the reign of the saints during the millenium  such was the singular group into which everard was now introduced showing in their various opinions upon how many devious coasts human nature may make shipwreck when she has once let go her hold on the anchor which religion has given her to lean upon the acute selfconceit and worldly learning of bletsonthe rash and ignorant conclusions of the fierce and underbred harrison leading them into the opposite extremes of enthusiasm and infidelity while desborough constitutionally stupid thought nothing about religion at all and while the others were active in making sail on different but equally erroneous courses he might be said to perish like a vessel which springs a leak and founders in the roadstead it was wonderful to behold what a strange variety of mistakes and errors on the part of the king and his ministers on the part of the parliament and their leaders on the part of the allied kingdoms of scotland and england towards each other had combined to rear up men of such dangerous opinions and interested characters among the arbiters of the destiny of britain  those who argue for partys sake will see all the faults on the one side without deigning to look at those on the other those who study history for instruction will perceive that nothing but the want of concession on either side and the deadly height to which the animosity of the kings and parliaments parties had arisen could have so totally overthrown the wellpoised balance of the english constitution but we hasten to quit political reflections the rather that ours we believe will please neither whig nor tory                                         chapter the twelfth     three form a collegean you give us four   let him bring his share with him   braumont and fletcher  mr bletson arose and paid his respects to colonel everard with the ease and courtesy of a gentleman of the time though on every account grieved at his intrusion as a religious man who held his freethinking principles in detestation and would effectually prevent his conversion of harrison and even of desborough if any thing could be moulded out of such a clod to the worship of the animus mundi moreover bletson knew everard to be a man of steady probity and by no means disposed to close with a scheme on which he had successfully sounded the other two and which was calculated to assure the commissioners of some little private indemnification for the trouble they were to give themselves in the public business the philosopher was yet less pleased when he saw the magistrate the pastor who had met him in his flight of the preceding evening when he had been seen parma non bene relicta with cloak and doublet left behind him  the presence of colonel everard was as unpleasing to desborough as to bletson but the former having no philosophy in him nor an idea that it was possible for any man to resist helping himself out of untold money was chiefly embarrassed by the thought that the plunder which they might be able to achieve out of their trust might by this unwelcome addition to their number be divided into four parts instead of three and this reflection added to the natural awkwardness with which he grumbled forth a sort of welcome addressed to everard  as for harrison he remained like one on higher thoughts intent his posture unmoved his eyes fixed on the ceiling as before and in no way indicating the least consciousness that the company had been more than doubled around him  meantime everard took his place at the table as a man who assumed his own right and pointed to his companions to sit down nearer the foot of the board wildrake so far misunderstood his signals as to sit down above the mayor but rallying his recollection at a look from his patron he rose and took his place lower whistling however as he went a sound at which the company stared as at a freedom highly unbecoming to complete his indecorum he seized upon a pipe and filling it from a large tobaccobox was soon immersed in a cloud of his own raising from which a hand shortly after emerged seized on the blackjack of ale withdrew it within the vapoury sanctuary and after a potential draught replaced it upon the table its owner beginning to renew the cloud which his intermitted exercise of the tube had almost allowed to subside  nobody made any observation on his conduct out of respect probably to colonel everard who bit his lip but continued silent aware that censure might extract some escapade more unequivocally characteristic of a cavalier from his refractory companion as silence seemed awkward and the others made no advances to break it beyond the ordinary salutation colonel everard at length said i presume gentlemen that you are somewhat surprised at my arrival here and thus intruding myself into your meeting  why the dickens should we be surprised colonel said desborough we know his excellency my brotherinlaw nollsi mean my lord cromwells way of overquartering his men in the towns he marches through thou hast obtained a share in our commission  and in that said bletson smiling and bowing the lordgeneral has given us the most acceptable colleague that could have been added to our number no doubt your authority for joining with us must be under warrant of the council of state  of that gentlemen said the colonel i will presently advise youhe took out his warrant accordingly and was about to communicate the contents but observing that there were three or four halfempty flasks upon the table that desborough looked more stupid than usual and that the philosophers eyes were reeling in his head notwithstanding the temperance of bletsons usual habits he concluded that they had been fortifying themselves against the horrors of the haunted mansion by laying in a store of what is called dutch courage and therefore prudently resolved to postpone his more important business with them till the cooler hour of morning he therefore instead of presenting the generals warrant superseding their commission contented himself with replyingmy business has of course some reference to your proceedings here but here isexcuse my curiositya reverend gentleman pointing to holdenough who has told me that you are so strangely embarrassed here as to require both the civil and spiritual authority to enable you to keep possession of woodstock  before we go into that matter said bletson blushing up to the eyes at the recollection of his own fears so manifestly displayed yet so inconsistent with his principles i should like to know who this other stranger is who has come with the worthy magistrate and the no less worthy presbyterian  meaning me said wildrake laying his pipe aside gadzooks the time hath been that i could have answered the question with a better title but at present i am only his honours poor clerk or secretary whichever is the current phrase  fore george my lively blade thou art a frank fellow of thy tattle said desborough there is my secretary tomkins whom men sillily enough call fibbet and the honourable lieutenantgeneral harrisons secretary bibbet who are now at supper below stairs that durst not for their ears speak a phrase above their breath in the presence of their betters unless to answer a question  yes colonel everard said the philosopher with his quiet smile glad apparently to divert the conversation from the topic of last nights alarm and recollections which humbled his selflove and selfsatisfactionyes and when master fibbet and master bibbet do speak their affirmations are as much in a common mould of mutual attestation as their names would accord in the verses of a poet if master fibbet happens to tell a fiction master bibbet swears it as truth if master bibbet chances to have gotten drunk in the fear of the lord master fibbet swears he is sober i have called my own secretary gibbet though his name chances to be only gibeon a worthy israelite at your service but as pure a youth as ever picked a lambbone at paschal but i call him gibbet merely to make up the holy trefoil with another rhyme this squire of thine colonel everard looks as if he might be worthy to be coupled with the rest of the fraternity  not i truly said the cavalier ill be coupled with no jew that was ever whelped and no jewess neither  scorn not for that young man said the philosopher the jews are in point of religion the elder brethren you know  the jews older than the christians said desborough fore george they will have thee before the general assembly bletson if thou venturest to say so  wildrake laughed without ceremony at the gross ignorance of desborough and was joined by a sniggling response from behind the cupboard which when inquired into proved to be produced by the servingmen these worthies timorous as their betters when they were supposed to have left the room had only withdrawn to their present place of concealment  how now ye rogues said bletson angrily do you not know your duty better  we beg your worthy honours pardon said one of the men but we dared not go down stairs without a light  a light ye cowardly poltroons said the philosopher whatto show which of you looks palest when a rat squeaksbut take a candlestick and begone you cowardly villains the devils you are so much afraid of must be but paltry kites if they hawk at such bats as you are  the servants without replying took up one of the candlesticks and prepared to retreat trusty tomkins at the head of the troop when suddenly as they arrived at the door of the parlour which had been left half open it was shut violently the three terrified domestics tumbled back into the middle of the room as if a shot had been discharged in their face and all who were at the table started to their feet  colonel everard was incapable of a moments fear even if any thing frightful had been seen but he remained stationary to see what his companions would do and to get at the bottom if possible of the cause of their alarm upon an occasion so trifling the philosopher seemed to think that he was the person chiefly concerned to show manhood on the occasion  he walked to the door accordingly murmuring at the cowardice of the servants but at such a snails pace that it seemed he would most willingly have been anticipated by any one whom his reproaches had roused to exertion cowardly blockheads he said at last seizing hold of the handle of the door but without turning it effectually round dare you not open a doorstill fumbling with the lockdare you not go down a staircase without a light here bring me the candle you cowardly villainsby heaven something sighs on the outside  as he spoke he let go the handle of the parlour door and stepped back a pace or two into the apartment with cheeks as pale as the band he wore  deus adjutor meus said the presbyterian clergyman rising from his seat give place sir addressing bletson it would seem i know more of this matter than thou and i bless heaven i am armed for the conflict  bold as a grenadier about to mount a breach yet with the same belief in the existence of a great danger to be encountered as well as the same reliance in the goodness of his cause the worthy man stepped before the philosophical bletson and taking a light from a sconce in one hand quietly opened the door with the other and standing in the threshold said here is nothing  and who expected to see any thing said bletson excepting those terrified oafs who take fright at every puff of wind that whistles through the passages of this old dungeon  mark you master tomkins said one of the waitingmen in a whisper to the stewardsee how boldly the minister pressed forward before all of them ah master tomkins our parson is the real commissioned officer of the churchyour laypreachers are no better than a parcel of clubmen and volunteers  follow me those who list said master holdenough or go before me those who choose i will walk through the habitable places of this house before i leave it and satisfy myself whether satan hath really mingled himself among these dreary dens of ancient wickedness or whether like the wicked of whom holy david speaketh we are afraid and flee when no one pursueth  harrison who had heard these words sprung from his seat and drawing his sword exclaimed were there as many fiends in the house as there are hairs on my head upon this cause i will charge them up to their very trenches  so saying he brandished his weapon and pressed to the head of the column where he moved side by side with the minister the mayor of woodstock next joined the body thinking himself safer perhaps in the company of his pastor and the whole train moved forward in close order accompanied by the servants bearing lights to search the lodge for some cause of that panic with which they seemed to be suddenly seized  nay take me with you my friends said colonel everard who had looked on in surprise and was now about to follow the party when bletson laid hold on his cloak and begged him to remain  you see my good colonel he said affecting a courage which his shaking voice belied here are only you and i and honest desborough left behind in garrison while all the others are absent on a sally we must not hazard the whole troops in one sortiethat were unmilitaryha ha ha  in the name of heaven what means all this said everard i heard a foolish tale about apparitions as i came this way and now i find you all half mad with fear and cannot get a word of sense among so many of you fie colonel desboroughfie master bletsontry to compose yourselves and let me know in heavens name the cause of all this disturbance one would be apt to think your brains were turned  and so mine well may said desborough ay and overturned too since my bed last night was turned upside down and i was placed for ten minutes heels uppermost and head downmost like a bullock going to be shod  what means this nonsense master bletsondesborough must have had the nightmare  no faith colonel the goblins or whatever else they were had been favourable to honest desborough for they reposed the whole of his person on that part of his body whichhark did you not hear somethingis the central point of gravity namely his head  did you see any thing to alarm you said the colonel  nothing said bletson but we heard hellish noises as all our people did and i believing little of ghosts and apparitions concluded the cavaliers were taking us at advantage so remembering rainsboroughs fate i een jumped the window and ran to woodstock to call the soldiers to the rescue of harrison and desborough  and did you not first go to see what the danger was  ah my good friend you forget that i laid down my commission at the time of the selfdenying ordinance it would have been quite inconsistent with my duty as a parliamentman to be brawling amidst a set of ruffians without any military authority nowhen the parliament commanded me to sheath my sword colonel i have too much veneration for their authority to be found again with it drawn in my hand  but the parliament said desborough hastily did not command you to use your heels when your hands could have saved a man from choking odds dickens you might have stopped when you saw my bed canted heels uppermost and me half stifled in the bedclothesyou might i say have stopped and lent a hand to put it to rights instead of jumping out of the window like a newshorn sheep so soon as you had run across my room  nay worshipful master desborough said bletson winking at everard to show that he was playing on his thicksculled colleague how could i tell your particular mode of reposingthere are many tastesi have known men who slept by choice on a slope or angle of fortyfive  yes but did ever a man sleep standing on his head except by miracle said desborough  now as to miraclessaid the philosopher confident in the presence of everard besides that an opportunity of scoffing at religion really in some degree diverted his feari leave these out of the question seeing that the evidence on such subjects seems as little qualified to carry conviction as a horsehair to land a leviathan  a loud clap of thunder or a noise as formidable rang through the lodge as the scoffer had ended which struck him pale and motionless and made desborough throw himself on his knees and repeat exclamations and prayers in much admired confusion  there must be contrivance here exclaimed everard and snatching one of the candles from a sconce he rushed out of the apartment little heeding the entreaties of the philosopher who in the extremity of his distress conjured him by the animus mundi to remain to the assistance of a distressed philosopher endangered by witches and a parliamentman assaulted by ruffians as for desborough he only gaped like a clown in a pantomime and doubtful whether to follow or stop his natural indolence prevailed and he sat still  when on the landingplace of the stairs everard paused a moment to consider which was the best course to take he heard the voices of men talking fast and loud like people who wish to drown their fears in the lower story and aware that nothing could be discovered by those whose inquiries were conducted in a manner so noisy he resolved to proceed in a different direction and examine the second floor which he had now gained  he had known every corner both of the inhabited and uninhabited part of the mansion and availed himself of the candle to traverse two or three intricate passages which he was afraid he might not remember with sufficient accuracy this movement conveyed him to a sort of oeildeboeuf an octagon vestibule or small hall from which various rooms opened amongst these doors everard selected that which led to a very long narrow and dilapidated gallery built in the time of henry viii and which running along the whole southwest side of the building communicated at different points with the rest of the mansion this he thought was likely to be the post occupied by those who proposed to act the sprites upon the occasion especially as its length and shape gave him some idea that it was a spot where the bold thunder might in many ways be imitated  determined to ascertain the truth if possible he placed his light on a table in the vestibule and applied himself to open the door into the gallery at this point he found himself strongly opposed either by a bolt drawn or as he rather conceived by somebody from within resisting his attempt he was induced to believe the latter because the resistance slackened and was renewed like that of human strength instead of presenting the permanent opposition of an inanimate obstacle though everard was a strong and active young man he exhausted his strength in the vain attempt to open the door and having paused to take breath was about to renew his efforts with foot and shoulder and to call at the same time for assistance when to his surprise on again attempting the door more gently in order to ascertain if possible where the strength of the opposing obstacle was situated he found it gave way to a very slight impulse some impediment fell broken to the ground and the door flew wide open the gust of wind occasioned by the sudden opening of the door blew out the candle and everard was left in darkness save where the moonshine which the long siderow of latticed windows dimmed could imperfectly force its way into the gallery which lay in ghostly length before him  the melancholy and doubtful twilight was increased by a quantity of creeping plants on the outside which since all had been neglected in these ancient halls now completely overgrown had in some instances greatly diminished and in others almost quite choked up the space of the lattices extending between the heavy stone shaftwork which divided the windows both lengthways and across on the other side there were no windows at all and the gallery had been once hung round with paintings chiefly portraits by which that side of the apartment had been adorned most of the pictures had been removed yet the empty frames of some and the tattered remnants of others were still visible along the extent of the waste gallery the look of which was so desolate and it appeared so well adapted for mischief supposing there were enemies near him that everard could not help pausing at the entrance and recommending himself to god ere drawing his sword he advanced into the apartment treading as lightly as possible and keeping in the shadow as much as he could  markham everard was by no means superstitious but he had the usual credulity of the times and though he did not yield easily to tales of supernatural visitations yet he could not help thinking he was in the very situation where if such things were ever permitted they might be expected to take place while his own stealthy and illassured pace his drawn weapon and extended arms being the very attitude and action of doubt and suspicion tended to increase in his mind the gloomy feelings of which they are the usual indications and with which they are constantly associated under such unpleasant impressions and conscious of the neighbourhood of something unfriendly colonel everard had already advanced about half along the gallery when he heard some one sigh very near him and a low soft voice pronounce his name  here i am he replied while his heart beat thick and short who calls on markham everard  another sigh was the only answer  speak said the colonel whoever or whatsoever you are and tell with what intent and purpose you are lurking in these apartments  with a better intent than yours returned the soft voice  than mine answered everard in great surprise who are you that dare judge of my intents  what or who are you markham everard who wander by moonlight through these deserted halls of royalty where none should be but those who mourn their downfall or are sworn to avenge it  it isand yet it cannot be said everard yet it is and must be alice lee the devil or you speaks answer me i conjure youspeak openlyon what dangerous scheme are you engaged where is your father why are you herewherefore do you run so deadly a venturespeak i conjure you alice lee  she whom you call on is at the distance of miles from this spot what if her genius speaks when she is absentwhat if the soul of an ancestress of hers and yours were now addressing youwhat if  nay answered everard but what if the dearest of human beings has caught a touch of her fathers enthusiasmwhat if she is exposing her person to danger her reputation to scandal by traversing in disguise and darkness a house filled with armed men speak to me my fair cousin in your own person i am furnished with powers to protect my uncle sir henryto protect you too dearest alice even against the consequences of this visionary and wild attempt speaki see where you are and with all my respect i cannot submit to be thus practised upon trust metrust your cousin markham with your hand and believe that he will die or place you in honourable safety  as he spoke he exercised his eyes as keenly as possible to detect where the speaker stood and it seemed to him that about three yards from him there was a shadowy form of which he could not discern even the outline placed as it was within the deep and prolonged shadow thrown by a space of wall intervening betwixt two windows upon that side of the room from which the light was admitted he endeavoured to calculate as well as he could the distance betwixt himself and the object which he watched under the impression that if by even using a slight degree of compulsion he could detach his beloved alice from the confederacy into which he supposed her fathers zeal for the cause of royalty had engaged her he would be rendering them both the most essential favour he could not indeed but conclude that however successfully the plot which he conceived to be in agitation had proceeded against the timid bletson the stupid desborough and the crazy harrison there was little doubt that at length their artifices must necessarily bring shame and danger on those engaged in it  it must also be remembered that everards affection to his cousin although of the most respectful and devoted character partook less of the distant veneration which a lover of those days entertained for the lady whom he worshipped with humble diffidence than of the fond and familiar feelings which a brother entertains towards a younger sister whom he thinks himself entitled to guide advise and even in some degree to control so kindly and intimate had been their intercourse that he had little more hesitation in endeavouring to arrest her progress in the dangerous course in which she seemed to be engaged even at the risk of giving her momentary offence than he would have had in snatching her from a torrent or conflagration at the chance of hurting her by the violence of his grasp all this passed through his mind in the course of a single minute and he resolved at all events to detain her on the spot and compel if possible an explanation from her  with this purpose everard again conjured his cousin in the name of heaven to give up this idle and dangerous mummery and lending an accurate ear to her answer endeavoured from the sound to calculate as nearly as possible the distance between them  i am not she for whom you take me said the voice and dearer regards than aught connected with her life or death bid me warn you to keep aloof and leave this place  not till i have convinced you of your childish folly said the colonel springing forward and endeavouring to catch hold of her who spoke to him but no female form was within his grasp on the contrary he was met by a shock which could come from no womans arm and which was rude enough to stretch him on his back on the floor at the same time he felt the point of a sword at his throat and his hands so completely mastered that not the slightest defence remained to him  a cry for assistance said a voice near him but not that which he had hitherto heard will be stifled in your bloodno harm is meant yoube wise and be silent  the fear of death which everard had often braved in the field of battle became more intense as he felt himself in the hands of unknown assassins and totally devoid of all means of defence the sharp point of the sword pricked his bare throat and the foot of him who held it was upon his breast he felt as if a single thrust would put an end to life and all the feverish joys and sorrows which agitate us so strangely and from which we are yet so reluctant to part large drops of perspiration stood upon his foreheadhis heart throbbed as if it would burst from its confinement in the bosomhe experienced the agony which fear imposes on the brave man acute in proportion to that which pain inflicts when it subdues the robust and healthy  cousin alicehe attempted to speak and the swords point pressed his throat yet more closelycousin let me not be murdered in a manner so fearful  i tell you replied the voice that you speak to one who is not here but your life is not aimed at provided you swear on your faith as a christian and your honour as a gentleman that you will conceal what has happened whether from the people below or from any other person on this condition you may rise and if you seek her you will find alice lee at jocelines cottage in the forest  since i may not help myself otherwise said everard i swear as i have a sense of religion and honour i will say nothing of this violence nor make any search after those who are concerned in it  for that we care nothing said the voice thou hast an example how well thou mayst catch mischief on thy own part but we are in case to defy thee rise and begone  the foot the swordspoint were withdrawn and everard was about to start up hastily when the voice in the same softness of tone which distinguished it at first said no hastecold and bare steel is yet around thee nownownowthe words dying away as at a distance thou art free be secret and be safe  markham everard arose and in rising embarrassed his feet with his own sword which he had dropped when springing forward as he supposed to lay hold of his fair cousin he snatched it up in haste and as his hand clasped the hilt his courage which had given way under the apprehension of instant death began to return he considered with almost his usual composure what was to be done next deeply affronted at the disgrace which he had sustained he questioned for an instant whether he ought to keep his extorted promise or should not rather summon assistance and make haste to discover and seize those who had been recently engaged in such violence on his person but these persons be they who they would had had his life in their powerhe had pledged his word in ransom of itand what was more he could not divest himself of the idea that his beloved alice was a confidant at least if not an actor in the confederacy which had thus baffled him this prepossession determined his conduct for though angry at supposing she must have been accessory to his personal illtreatment he could not in any event think of an instant search through the mansion which might have compromised her safety or that of his uncle but i will to the hut he saidi will instantly to the hut ascertain her share in this wild and dangerous confederacy and snatch her from ruin if it be possible  as under the influence of the resolution which he had formed everard groped his way through the gallery and regained the vestibule he heard his name called by the wellknown voice of wildrake whatho holloacolonel everardmark everardit is dark as the devils mouthspeakwhere are youthe witches are keeping their hellish sabbath here as i thinkwhere are you  here here answered everard cease your bawling turn to the left and you will meet me  guided by his voice wildrake soon appeared with a light in one hand and his drawn sword in the other where have you been he saidwhat has detained youhere are bletson and the brute desborough terrified out of their lives and harrison raving mad because the devil will not be civil enough to rise to fight him in single duello  saw or heard you nothing as you came along said everard  nothing said his friend excepting that when i first entered this cursed ruinous labyrinth the light was struck out of my hand as if by a switch which obliged me to return for another  i must come by a horse instantly wildrake and another for thyself if it be possible  we can take two of those belonging to the troopers answered wildrake but for what purpose should we run away like rats at this time in the eveningis the house falling  i cannot answer you said the colonel pushing forward into a room where there were some remains of furniture  here the cavalier took a more strict view of his person and exclaimed in wonder what the devil have you been fighting with markham that has bedizened you after this sorry fashion  fighting exclaimed everard  yes replied his trusty attendant i say fighting look at yourself in the mirror  he did and saw he was covered with dust and blood the latter proceeded from a scratch which he had received in the throat as he struggled to extricate himself with unaffected alarm wildrake undid his friends collar and with eager haste proceeded to examine the wound his hands trembling and his eyes glistening with apprehension for his benefactors life when in spite of everards opposition he had examined the hurt and found it trifling he resumed the natural wildness of his character perhaps the more readily that he had felt shame in departing from it into one which expressed more of feeling than he would be thought to possess  if that be the devils work mark said he the foul fiends claws are not nigh so formidable as they are represented but no one shall say that your blood has been shed unrevenged while roger wildrake was by your side where left you this same imp i will back to the field of fight confront him with my rapier and were his nails tenpenny nails and his teeth as long as those of a harrow he shall render me reason for the injury he has done you  madnessmadness exclaimed everard i had this trifling hurt by a falla basin and towel will wipe it away meanwhile if you will ever do me kindness get the troophorsescommand them for the service of the public in the name of his excellency the general i will but wash and join you in an instant before the gate  well i will serve you everard as a mute serves the grand signior without knowing why or wherefore but will you go without seeing these people below  without seeing any one said everard lose no time for gods sake  he found out the noncommissioned officer and demanded the horses in a tone of authority to which the corporal yielded undisputed obedience as one well aware of colonel everards military rank and consequence so all was in a minute or two ready for the expedition                                         chapter the thirteenth                 she kneeled and saintlike   cast her eyes to heaven and prayd devoutly                                king henry viii  colonel everards departure at the late hour for so it was then thought of seven in the evening excited much speculation there was a gathering of menials and dependents in the outer chamber or hall for no one doubted that his sudden departure was owing to his having as they expressed it seen something and all desired to know how a man of such acknowledged courage as everard looked under the awe of a recent apparition but he gave them no time to make comments for striding through the hall wrapt in his riding suit he threw himself on horseback and rode furiously through the chase towards the hut of the keeper joliffe  it was the disposition of markham everard to be hot keen earnest impatient and decisive to a degree of precipitation the acquired habits which education had taught and which the strong moral and religious discipline of his sect had greatly strengthened were such as to enable him to conceal as well as to check this constitutional violence and to place him upon his guard against indulging it but when in the high tide of violent excitation the natural impetuosity of the young soldiers temper was sometimes apt to overcome these artificial obstacles and then like a torrent foaming over a wear it became more furious as if in revenge for the constrained calm which it had been for some time obliged to assume in these instances he was accustomed to see only that point to which his thoughts were bent and to move straight towards it whether a moral object or the storming of a breach without either calculating or even appearing to see the difficulties which were before him  at present his ruling and impelling motive was to detach his beloved cousin if possible from the dangerous and discreditable machinations in which he suspected her to have engaged or on the other hand to discover that she really had no concern with these stratagems he should know how to judge of that in some measure he thought by finding her present or absent at the hut towards which he was now galloping he had read indeed in some ballad or minstrels tale of a singular deception practised on a jealous old man by means of a subterranean communication between his house and that of a neighbour which the lady in question made use of to present herself in the two places alternately with such speed and so much address that after repeated experiments the dotard was deceived into the opinion that his wife and the lady who was so very like her and to whom his neighbour paid so much attention were two different persons but in the present case there was no room for such a deception the distance was too great and as he took by much the nearest way from the castle and rode full speed it would be impossible he knew for his cousin who was a timorous horsewoman even by daylight to have got home before him  her father might indeed be displeased at his interference but what title had he to be sowas not alice lee the near relation of his blood the dearest object of his heart and would he now abstain from an effort to save her from the consequences of a silly and wild conspiracy because the old knights spleen might be awakened by everards making his appearance at their present dwelling contrary to his commands no he would endure the old mans harsh language as he endured the blast of the autumn wind which was howling around him and swinging the crashing branches of the trees under which he passed but could not oppose or even retard his journey  if he found not alice as he had reason to believe she would be absent to sir henry lee himself he would explain what he had witnessed however she might have become accessory to the juggling tricks performed at woodstock he could not but think it was without her fathers knowledge so severe a judge was the old knight of female propriety and so strict an assertor of female decorum he would take the same opportunity he thought of stating to him the wellgrounded hopes he entertained that his dwelling at the lodge might be prolonged and the sequestrators removed from the royal mansion and domains by other means than those of the absurd species of intimidation which seemed to be resorted to to scare them from thence  all this seemed to be so much within the line of his duty as a relative that it was not until he halted at the door of the rangers hut and threw his bridle into wildrakes hand that everard recollected the fiery high and unbending character of sir henry lee and felt even when his fingers were on the latch a reluctance to intrude himself upon the presence of the irritable old knight  but there was no time for hesitation bevis who had already bayed more than once from within the lodge was growing impatient and everard had but just time to bid wildrake hold the horses until he should send joceline to his assistance when old joan unpinned the door to demand who was without at that time of the night to have attempted anything like an explanation with poor dame joan would have been quite hopeless the colonel therefore put her gently aside and shaking himself loose from the hold she had laid on his cloak entered the kitchen of jocelines dwelling bevis who had advanced to support joan in her opposition humbled his lionport with that wonderful instinct which makes his race remember so long those with whom they have been familiar and acknowledged his masters relative by doing homage in his fashion with his head and tail  colonel everard more uncertain in his purpose every moment as the necessity of its execution drew near stole over the floor like one who treads in a sick chamber and opening the door of the interior apartment with a slow and trembling hand as he would have withdrawn the curtains of a dying friend he saw within the scene which we are about to describe  sir henry lee sat in a wicker armchair by the fire he was wrapped in a cloak and his limbs extended on a stool as if he were suffering from gout or indisposition his long white beard flowing over the darkcoloured garment gave him more the appearance of a hermit than of an aged soldier or man of quality and that character was increased by the deep and devout attention with which he listened to a respectable old man whose dilapidated dress showed still something of the clerical habit and who with a low but full and deep voice was reading the evening service according to the church of england alice lee kneeled at the feet of her father and made the responses with a voice that might have suited the choir of angels and a modest and serious devotion which suited the melody of her tone the face of the officiating clergyman would have been goodlooking had it not been disfigured with a black patch which covered the left eye and a part of his face and had not the features which were visible been marked with the traces of care and suffering  when colonel everard entered the clergyman raised his finger as cautioning him to forbear disturbing the divine service of the evening and pointed to a seat to which struck deeply with the scene he had witnessed the intruder stole with as light a step as possible and knelt devoutly down as one of the little congregation  everard had been bred by his father what was called a puritan a member of a sect who in the primitive sense of the word were persons that did not except against the doctrines of the church of england or even in all respects against its hierarchy but chiefly dissented from it on the subject of certain ceremonies habits and forms of ritual which were insisted upon by the celebrated and unfortunate laud with illtimed tenacity but even if from the habits of his fathers house everards opinions had been diametrically opposed to the doctrines of the english church he must have been reconciled to them by the regularity with which the service was performed in his uncles family at woodstock who during the blossom of his fortunes generally had a chaplain residing in the lodge for that special purpose  yet deep as was the habitual veneration with which he heard the impressive service of the church everards eyes could not help straying towards alice and his thoughts wandering to the purpose of his presence there she seemed to have recognised him at once for there was a deeper glow than usual upon her cheek her fingers trembled as they turned the leaves of her prayerbook and her voice lately as firm as it was melodious faltered when she repeated the responses it appeared to everard as far as he could collect by the stolen glances which he directed towards her that the character of her beauty as well as of her outward appearance had changed with her fortunes  the beautiful and highborn young lady had now approached as nearly as possible to the brown stuff dress of an ordinary village maiden but what she had lost in gaiety of appearance she had gained as it seemed in dignity her beautiful lightbrown tresses now folded around her head and only curled where nature had so arranged them gave her an air of simplicity which did not exist when her headdress showed the skill of a curious tirewoman a light joyous air with something of a humorous expression which seemed to be looking for amusement had vanished before the touch of affliction and a calm melancholy supplied its place which seemed on the watch to administer comfort to others perhaps the former arch though innocent expression of countenance was uppermost in her lovers recollection when he concluded that alice had acted a part in the disturbances which had taken place at the lodge it is certain that when he now looked upon her it was with shame for having nourished such a suspicion and the resolution to believe rather that the devil had imitated her voice than that a creature who seemed so much above the feelings of this world and so nearly allied to the purity of the next should have had the indelicacy to mingle in such manoeuvres as he himself and others had been subjected to  these thoughts shot through his mind in spite of the impropriety of indulging them at such a moment the service now approached the close and a good deal to colonel everards surprise as well as confusion the officiating priest in firm and audible tone and with every attribute of dignity prayed to the almighty to bless and preserve our sovereign lord king charles the lawful and undoubted king of these realms the petition in those days most dangerous was pronounced with a full raised and distinct articulation as if the priest challenged all who heard him to dissent if they dared if the republican officer did not assent to the petition he thought at least it was no time to protest against it  the service was concluded in the usual manner and the little congregation arose it now included wildrake who had entered during the latter prayer and was the first of the party to speak running up to the priest and shaking him by the hand most heartily swearing at the same time that he truly rejoiced to see him the good clergyman returned the pressure with a smile observing he should have believed his asseveration without an oath in the meanwhile colonel everard approaching his uncles seat made a deep inclination of respect first to sir henry lee and then to alice whose colour now spread from her cheek to her brow and bosom  i have to crave your excuse said the colonel with hesitation for having chosen for my visit which i dare not hope would be very agreeable at any time a season most peculiarly unsuitable  so far from it nephew answered sir henry with much more mildness of manner than everard had dared to expect that your visits at other times would be much more welcome had we the fortune to see you often at our hours of worship  i hope the time will soon come sir when englishmen of all sects and denominations replied everard will be free in conscience to worship in common the great father whom they all after their manner call by that affectionate name  i hope so too nephew said the old man in the same unaltered tone and we will not at present dispute whether you would have the church of england coalesce with the conventicle or the conventicle conform to the church it was i ween not to settle jarring creeds that you have honoured our poor dwelling where to say the truth we dared scarce have expected to see you again so coarse was our last welcome  i should be happy to believe said colonel everard hesitating thatthatin short my presence was not now so unwelcome here as on that occasion  nephew said sir henry i will be frank with you when you were last here i thought you had stolen from me a precious pearl which at one time it would have been my pride and happiness to have bestowed on you but which being such as you have been of late i would bury in the depths of the earth rather than give to your keeping this somewhat chafed as honest will says the rash humour which my mother gave me i thought i was robbed and i thought i saw the robber before me i am mistakeni am not robbed and the attempt without the deed i can pardon  i would not willingly seek offence in your words sir said colonel everard when their general purport sounds kind but i can protest before heaven that my views and wishes towards you and your family are as void of selfish hopes and selfish ends as they are fraught with love to you and to yours  let us hear them man we are not much accustomed to good wishes nowadays and their very rarity will make them welcome  i would willingly sir henry since you might not choose me to give you a more affectionate name convert those wishes into something effectual for your comfort your fate as the world now stands is bad and i fear like to be worse  worse than i expect it cannot be nephew i do not shrink before my changes of fortune i shall wear coarser clothesi shall feed on more ordinary foodmen will not doff their cap to me as they were wont when i was the great and the wealthy what of that old harry lee loved his honour better than his title his faith better than his land and lordship have i not seen the 30th of january i am neither philomath nor astrologer but old will teaches me that when green leaves fall winter is at hand and that darkness will come when the sun sets  bethink you sir said colonel everard if without any submission asked any oath taken any engagement imposed express or tacit excepting that you are not to excite disturbances in the public peace you can be restored to your residence in the lodge and your usual fortunes and perquisities therei have great reason to hope this may be permitted if not expressly at least on sufferance  yes i understand you i am to be treated like the royal coin marked with the ensign of the rump to make it pass current although i am too old to have the royal insignia grinded off from me kinsman i will have none of this i have lived at the lodge too long and let me tell you i had left it in scorn long since but for the orders of one whom i may yet live to do service to i will take nothing from the usurpers be their name rump or cromwellbe they one devil or legioni will not take from them an old cap to cover my grey hairsa cast cloak to protect my frail limbs from the cold they shall not say they have by their unwilling bounty made abraham richi will live as i will die the loyal lee  may i hope you will think of it sir and that you will perhaps considering what slight submission is asked give me a better answer  sir if i retract my opinion which is not my wont you shall hear of itand now cousin have you more to say we keep that worthy clergyman in the outer room  something i had to saysomething touching my cousin alice said everard with embarrassment but i fear that the prejudices of both are so strong against me  sir i dare turn my daughter loose to youi will go join the good doctor in dame joans apartment i am not unwilling that you should know that the girl hath in all reasonable sort the exercise of her free will  he withdrew and left the cousins together  colonel everard advanced to alice and was about to take her hand she drew back took the seat which her father had occupied and pointed out to him one at some distance  are we then so much estranged my dearest alice he said  we will speak of that presently she replied in the first place let me ask the cause of your visit here at so late an hour  you heard said everard what i stated to your father  i did but that seems to have been only part of your errandsomething there seemed to be which applied particularly to me  it was a fancya strange mistake answered everard may i ask if you have been abroad this evening  certainly not she replied i have small temptation to wander from my present home poor as it is and whilst here i have important duties to discharge but why does colonel everard ask so strange a question  tell me in turn why your cousin markham has lost the name of friendship and kindred and even of some nearer feeling and then i will answer you alice  it is soon answered she said when you drew your sword against my fathers causealmost against his personi studied more than i should have done to find excuse for you i knew that is i thought i knew your high feelings of public dutyi knew the opinions in which you had been bred up and i said i will not even for this cast him offhe opposes his king because he is loyal to his country you endeavoured to avert the great and concluding tragedy of the 30th of january and it confirmed me in my opinion that markham everard might be misled but could not be base or selfish  and what has changed your opinion alice or who dare said everard reddening attach such epithets to the name of markham everard  i am no subject she said for exercising your valour colonel everard nor do i mean to offend but you will find enough of others who will avow that colonel everard is truckling to the usurper cromwell and that all his fair pretexts of forwarding his countrys liberties are but a screen for driving a bargain with the successful encroacher and obtaining the best terms he can for himself and his family  for myselfnever  but for your family you haveyes i am well assured that you have pointed out to the military tyrant the way in which he and his satraps may master the government do you think my father or i would accept an asylum purchased at the price of englands liberty and your honour  gracious heaven alice what is this you accuse me of pursuing the very course which so lately had your approbation  when you spoke with authority of your father and recommended our submission to the existing government such as it was i own i thoughtthat my fathers grey head might without dishonour have remained under the roof where it had so long been sheltered but did your father sanction your becoming the adviser of yonder ambitious soldier to a new course of innovation and his abettor in the establishment of a new species of tyrannyit is one thing to submit to oppression another to be the agent of tyrantsand o markhamtheir bloodhound  how bloodhoundwhat mean youi own it is true i could see with content the wounds of this bleeding country stanched even at the expense of beholding cromwell after his matchless rise take a yet farther step to powerbut to be his bloodhound what is your meaning  it is false theni thought i could swear it had been false  what in the name of god is it you ask  it is false that you are engaged to betray the young king of scotland  betray him i betray him or any fugitive never i would he were well out of englandi would lend him my aid to escape were he in the house at this instant and think in acting so i did his enemies good service by preventing their soiling themselves with his bloodbut betray him never  i knew iti was sure it was impossible oh be yet more honest disengage yourself from yonder gloomy and ambitious soldier shun him and his schemes which are formed in injustice and can only be realized in yet more blood  believe me replied everard that i choose the line of policy best befitting the times  choose that she said which best befits duty markhamwhich best befits truth and honour do your duty and let providence decide the restfarewell we tempt my fathers patience too faryou know his temperfarewell markham  she extended her hand which he pressed to his lips and left the apartment a silent bow to his uncle and a sign to wildrake whom he found in the kitchen of the cabin were the only tokens of recognition exhibited and leaving the hut he was soon mounted and with his companion advanced on his return to the lodge                                         chapter the fourteenth     deeds are done on earth   which have their punishment ere the earth closes   upon the perpetrators be it the working   of the remorsestirrd fancy or the vision   distinct and real of unearthly being   all ages witness that beside the couch   of the fell homicide oft stalks the ghost   of him he slew and shows the shadowy wound     old play  everard had come to jocelines hut as fast as horse could bear him and with the same impetuosity of purpose as of speed he saw no choice in the course to be pursued and felt in his own imagination the strongest right to direct and even reprove his cousin beloved as she was on account of the dangerous machinations with which she appeared to have connected herself he returned slowly and in a very different mood  not only had alice prudent as beautiful appeared completely free from the weakness of conduct which seemed to give him some authority over her but her views of policy if less practicable were so much more direct and noble than his own as led him to question whether he had not compromised himself too rashly with cromwell even although the state of the country was so greatly divided and torn by faction that the promotion of the general to the possession of the executive government seemed the only chance of escaping a renewal of the civil war the more exalted and purer sentiments of alice lowered him in his own eyes and though unshaken in his opinion that it were better the vessel should be steered by a pilot having no good title to the office than that she should run upon the breakers he felt that he was not espousing the most direct manly and disinterested side of the question  as he rode on immersed in these unpleasant contemplations and considerably lessened in his own esteem by what had happened wildrake who rode by his side and was no friend to long silence began to enter into conversation i have been thinking mark said he that if you and i had been called to the baras by the by has been in danger of happening to me in more senses than onei say had we become barristers i would have had the better oiled tongue of the twothe fairer art of persuasion  perhaps so replied everard though i never heard thee use any save to induce an usurer to lend thee money or a taverner to abate a reckoning  and yet this day or rather night i could have as i think made a conquest which baffled you  indeed said the colonel becoming attentive  why look you said wildrake it was a main object with you to induce mistress alice leeby heaven she is an exquisite creaturei approve of your taste marki say you desire to persuade her and the stout old trojan her father to consent to return to the lodge and live there quietly and under connivance like gentlefolk instead of lodging in a hut hardly fit to harbour a tom of bedlam  thou art right such indeed was a great part of my object in this visit answered everard  but perhaps you also expected to visit there yourself and so keep watch over pretty mistress leeeh  i never entertained so selfish a thought said everard and if this nocturnal disturbance at the mansion were explained and ended i would instantly take my departure  your friend noll would expect something more from you said wildrake he would expect in case the knights reputation for loyalty should draw any of our poor exiles and wanderers about the lodge that you should be on the watch and ready to snap them in a word as far as i can understand his longwinded speeches he would have woodstock a trap your uncle and his pretty daughter the bait of toastedcheesecraving your chloes pardon for the comparisonyou the springfall which should bar their escape his lordship himself being the great grimalkin to whom they are to be given over to be devoured  dared cromwell mention this to thee in express terms said everard pulling up his horse and stopping in the midst of the road  nay not in express terms which i do not believe he ever used in his life you might as well expect a drunken man to go straight forward but he insinuated as much to me and indicated that you might deserve well of himgadzo the damnable proposal sticks in my throatby betraying our noble and rightful king here he pulled off his hat whom god grant in health and wealth long to reign as the worthy clergyman says though i fear just now his majesty is both sick and sorry and never a penny in his pouch to boot  this tallies with what alice hinted said everard but how could she know it didst thou give her any hint of such a thing  i replied the cavalier i who never saw mistress alice in my life till tonight and then only for an instantzooks man how is that possible  true replied everard and seemed lost in thought at length he spokei should call cromwell to account for his bad opinion of me for even though not seriously expressed but as i am convinced it was with the sole view of proving you and perhaps myself it was nevertheless a misconstruction to be resented  ill carry a cartel for you with all my heart and soul said wildrake and turn out with his godlinesss second with as good will as i ever drank a glass of sack  pshaw replied everard those in his high place fight no single combats but tell me roger wildrake didst thou thyself think me capable of the falsehood and treachery implied in such a message  i exclaimed wildrake markham everard you have been my early friend my constant benefactor when colchester was reduced you saved me from the gallows and since that thou hast twenty times saved me from starving but by heaven if i thought you capable of such villany as your general recommendedby yonder blue sky and all the works of creation which it bends over i would stab you with my own hand  death replied everard i should indeed deserve but not from you perhaps but fortunately i cannot if i would be guilty of the treachery you would punish know that i had this day secret notice and from cromwell himself that the young man has escaped by sea from bristol  now god almighty be blessed who protected him through so many dangers exclaimed wildrake huzzaup hearts cavaliershey for cavaliersgod bless king charlesmoon and stars catch my hatand he threw it up as high as he could into the air the celestial bodies which he invoked did not receive the present dispatched to them but as in the case of sir henry lees scabbard an old gnarled oak became a second time the receptacle of a waif and stray of loyal enthusiasm wildrake looked rather foolish at the circumstance and his friend took the opportunity of admonishing him  art thou not ashamed to bear thee so like a schoolboy  why said wildrake i have but sent a puritans hat upon a loyal errand i laugh to think how many of the schoolboys thou talkst of will be cheated into climbing the pollard next year expecting to find the nest of some unknown bird in yonder unmeasured margin of felt  hush now for gods sake and let us speak calmly said everard charles has escaped and i am glad of it i would willingly have seen him on his fathers throne by composition but not by the force of the scottish army and the incensed and vengeful royalists  master markham everard began the cavalier interrupting himnay hush dear wildrake said everard let us not dispute a point on which we cannot agree and give me leave to go oni say since the young man has escaped cromwells offensive and injurious stipulation falls to the ground and i see not why my uncle and his family should not again enter their own house under the same terms of connivance as many other royalists what may be incumbent on me is different nor can i determine my course until i have an interview with the general which as i think will end in his confessing that he threw in this offensive proposal to sound us both it is much in his manner for he is blunt and never sees or feels the punctilious honour which the gallants of the day stretch to such delicacy  ill acquit him of having any punctilio about him said wildrake either touching honour or honesty now to come back to where we started supposing you were not to reside in person at the lodge and to forbear even visiting there unless on invitation when such a thing can be brought about i tell you frankly i think your uncle and his daughter might be induced to come back to the lodge and reside there as usual at least the clergyman that worthy old cock gave me to hope as much  he had been hasty in bestowing his confidence said everard  true replied wildrake he confided in me at once for he instantly saw my regard for the church i thank heaven i never passed a clergyman in his canonicals without pulling my hat offand thou knowest the most desperate duel i ever fought was with young grayless of the inner temple for taking the wall of the reverend dr bunceah i can gain a chaplains ear instantly gadzooks they know whom they have to trust to in such a one as i  dost thou think then said colonel everard or rather does this clergyman think that if they were secure of intrusion from me the family would return to the lodge supposing the intruding commissioners gone and this nocturnal disturbance explained and ended  the old knight answered wildrake may be wrought upon by the doctor to return if he is secure against intrusion as for disturbances the stout old boy so far as i can learn in two minutes conversation laughs at all this turmoil as the work of mere imagination the consequence of the remorse of their own evil consciences and says that goblin or devil was never heard of at woodstock until it became the residence of such men as they who have now usurped the possession  there is more than imagination in it said everard i have personal reason to know there is some conspiracy carrying on to render the house untenable by the commissioners i acquit my uncle of accession to such a silly trick but i must see it ended ere i can agree to his and my cousins residing where such a confederacy exists for they are likely to be considered as the contrivers of such pranks be the actual agent who he may  with reference to your better acquaintance with the gentleman everard i should rather suspect the old father of puritans i beg your pardon again has something to do with the business and if so lucifer will never look near the true old knights beard nor abide a glance of yonder maidens innocent blue eyes i will uphold them as safe as pure gold in a misers chest  sawest thou aught thyself which makes thee think thus  not a quill of the devils pinion saw i replied wildrake he supposes himself too secure of an old cavalier who must steal hang or drown in the long run so he gives himself no trouble to look after the assured booty but i heard the servingfellows prate of what they had seen and heard and though their tales were confused enough yet if there was any truth among them at all i should say the devil must have been in the dancebut holla here comes some one upon usstand friendwho art thou  a poor daylabourer in the great work of englandjoseph tomkins by namesecretary to a godly and wellendowed leader in this poor christian army of england called general harrison  what news master tomkins said everard and why are you on the road at this late hour  i speak to the worthy colonel everard as i judge said tomkins and truly i am glad of meeting your honour heaven knows i need such assistance as yoursoh worthy master everardhere has been a sounding of trumpets and a breaking of vials and a pouring forth and  prithee tell me in brief what is the matterwhere is thy masterand in a word what has happened  my master is close by parading it in the little meadow beside the hugeous oak which is called by the name of the late man ride but two steps forward and you may see him walking swiftly to and fro advancing all the while the naked weapon  upon proceeding as directed but with as little noise as possible they descried a man whom of course they concluded must be harrison walking to and fro beneath the kings oak as a sentinel under arms but with more wildness of demeanour the tramp of the horses did not escape his ear and they heard him call out as if at the head of the brigade lower pikes against cavalryhere comes prince rupertstand fast and you shall turn them aside as a bull would toss a curdog lower your pikes still my hearts the end secured against your footdown on your right knee front rankspare not for the spoiling of your blue apronshazerobabelay that is the word  in the name of heaven about whom or what is he talking said everard wherefore does he go about with his weapon drawn  truly sir when aught disturbs my master general harrison he is something rapt in the spirit and conceives that he is commanding a reserve of pikes at the great battle of armageddonand for his weapon alack worthy sir wherefore should he keep sheffield steel in calves leather when there are fiends to be combatedincarnate fiends on earth and raging infernal fiends under the earth  this is intolerable said everard listen to me tomkins thou art not now in the pulpit and i desire none of thy preaching language i know thou canst speak intelligibly when thou art so minded remember i may serve or harm thee and as you hope or fear any thing on my part answer straightforwardwhat has happened to drive out thy master to the wild wood at this time of night  forsooth worthy and honoured sir i will speak with the precision i may true it is and of verity that the breath of man which is in his nostrils goeth forth and returneth  hark you sir said colonel everard take care where you ramble in your correspondence with me you have heard how at the great battle of dunbar in scotland the general himself held a pistol to the head of lieutenant hewcreed threatening to shoot him through the brain if he did not give up holding forth and put his squadron in line to the front take care sir  verily the lieutenant then charged with an even and unbroken order said tomkins and bore a thousand plaids and bonnets over the beach before him into the sea neither shall i pretermit or postpone your honours commands but speedily obey them and that without delay  go to fellow thou knowest what i would have said everard speak at once i know thou canst if thou wilt trusty tomkins is better known than he thinks for  worthy sir said tomkins in a much less periphrastic style i will obey your worship as far as the spirit will permit truly it was not an hour since when my worshipful master being at table with master bibbet and myself not to mention the worshipful master bletson and colonel desborough and behold there was a violent knocking at the gate as of one in haste now of a certainty so much had our household been harassed with witches and spirits and other objects of sound and sight that the sentinels could not be brought to abide upon their posts without doors and it was only by a provision of beef and strong liquors that we were able to maintain a guard of three men in the hall who nevertheless ventured not to open the door lest they should be surprised with some of the goblins wherewith their imaginations were overwhelmed and they heard the knocking which increased until it seemed that the door was wellnigh about to be beaten down worthy master bibbet was a little overcome with liquor as is his fashion good man about this time of the evening not that he is in the least given to ebriety but simply that since the scottish campaign he hath had a perpetual ague which obliges him so to nourish his frame against the damps of the night wherefore as it is well known to your honour that i discharge the office of a faithful servant as well to majorgeneral harrison and the other commissioners as to my just and lawful master colonel desborough  i know all thatand now that thou art trusted by both i pray to heaven thou mayest merit the trust said colonel everard  and devoutly do i pray said tomkins that your worshipful prayers may be answered with favour for certainly to be and to be called and entitled honest joe and trusty tomkins is to me more than ever would be an earls title were such things to be granted anew in this regenerated government  well go ongo onor if thou dalliest much longer i will make bold to dispute the article of your honesty i like short tales sir and doubt what is told with a long unnecessary train of words  well good sir be not hasty as i said before the doors rattled till you would have thought the knocking was reiterated in every room of the palace the bell rung out for company though we could not find that any one tolled the clapper and the guards let off their firelocks merely because they knew not what better to do so master bibbet being as i said unsusceptible of his duty i went down with my poor rapier to the door and demanded who was there and i was answered in a voice which i must say was much like another voice that it was one wanting majorgeneral harrison so as it was then late i answered mildly that general harrison was betaking himself to his rest and that any who wished to speak to him must return on the morrow morning for that after nightfall the door of the palace being in the room of a garrison would be opened to no one so the voice replied and bid me open directly without which he would blow the folding leaves of the door into the middle of the hall and therewithal the noise recommenced that we thought the house would have fallen and i was in some measure constrained to open the door even like a besieged garrison which can hold out no longer  by my honour and it was stoutly done of you i must say said wildrakewho had been listening with much interest i am a bold daredevil enough yet when i had two inches of oak plank between the actual fiend and me hang him that would demolish the barrier between us say ii would as soon when aboard bore a hole in the ship and let in the waves for you know we always compare the devil to the deep sea  prithee peace wildrake said everard and let him go on with his historywell and what sawst thou when the door was openedthe great devil with his horns and claws thou wilt say no doubt  no sir i will say nothing but what is true when i undid the door one man stood there and he to seeming a man of no extraordinary appearance he was wrapped in a taffeta cloak of a scarlet colour and with a red lining he seemed as if he might have been in his time a very handsome man but there was something of paleness and sorrow in his facea long lovelock and long hair he wore even after the abomination of the cavaliers and the unloveliness as learned master prynne well termed it of lovelocksa jewel in his eara blue scarf over his shoulder like a military commander for the king and a hat with a white plume bearing a peculiar hatband  some unhappy officer of cavaliers of whom so many are in hiding and seeking shelter through the country briefly replied everard  true worthy sirright as a judicious exposition but there was something about this man if he was a man whom i for one could not look upon without trembling nor the musketeerswho were in the hall without betraying much alarm and swallowing as they will themselves aver the very bulletswhich they had in their mouths for loading their carabines and muskets nay the wolf and deerdogs that are the fiercest of their kind fled from this visitor and crept into holes and corners moaning and wailing in a low and broken tone he came into the middle of the hall and still he seemed no more than an ordinary man only somewhat fantastically dressed in a doublet of black velvet pinked upon scarlet satin under his cloak a jewel in his ear with large roses in his shoes and a kerchief in his hand which he sometimes pressed against his left side  gracious heavens said wildrake coming close up to everard and whispering in his ear with accents which terror rendered tremulous a mood of mind most unusual to the daring man who seemed now overcome by itit must have been poor dick robison the player in the very dress in which i have seen him play philasteray and drunk a jolly bottle with him after it at the mermaid i remember how many frolics we had together and all his little fantastic fashions he served for his old master charles in mohuns troop and was murdered by this butchers dog as i have heard after surrender at the battle of nasebyfield  hush i have heard of the deed said everard for gods sake hear the man to an enddid this visitor speak to thee my friend  yes sir in a pleasing tone of voice but somewhat fanciful in the articulation and like one who is speaking to an audience as from a bar or a pulpit more than in the voice of ordinary men on ordinary matters he desired to see majorgeneral harrison  he didand you said everard infected by the spirit of the time which as is well known leaned to credulity upon all matters of supernatural agencywhat did you do  i went up to the parlour and related that such a person enquired for him he started when i told him and eagerly desired to know the mans dress but no sooner did i mention his dress and the jewel in his ear than he said begone tell him i will not admit him to speech of me say that i defy him and will make my defiance good at the great battle in the valley of armageddon when the voice of the angel shall call all fowls which fly under the face of heaven to feed on the flesh of the captain and the soldier the warhorse and his rider say to the evil one i have power to appeal our conflict even till that day and that in the front of that fearful day he will again meet with harrison i went back with this answer to the stranger and his face was writhed into such a deadly frown as a mere human brow hath seldom worn return to him he said and say it is my hour and that if he come not instantly down to speak with me i will mount the stairs to him say that i command him to descend by the token that on the field of naseby he did not the work negligently  i have heard whispered wildrakewho felt more and more strongly the contagion of superstitionthat these words were blasphemously used by harrison when he shot my poor friend dick  what happened next said everard see that thou speakest the truth  as gospel unexpounded by a steepleman said the independent yet truly it is but little i have to say i saw my master come down with a blank yet resolved air and when he entered the hall and saw the stranger he made a pause the other waved on him as if to follow and walked out at the portal my worthy patron seemed as if he were about to follow yet again paused when this visitant be he man or fiend reentered and said obey thy doom    by pathless march by greenwood tree   it is thy weird to follow me   to follow me through the ghastly moonlight   to follow me through the shadows of night   to follow me comrade still art thou bound   i conjure thee by the unstaunchd wound   i conjure thee by the last words i spoke   when the body slept and the spirit awoke   in the very last pangs of the deadly stroke  so saying he stalked out and my master followed him into the woodi followed also at a distance but when i came up my master was alone and bearing himself as you now behold him  thou hast had a wonderful memory friend said the colonel coldly to remember these rhymes in a single recitationthere seems something of practice in all this  a single recitation my honoured sir exclaimed the independent alack the rhyme is seldom out of my poor masters mouth when as sometimes haps he is less triumphant in his wrestles with satan but it was the first time i ever heard it uttered by another and to say truth he ever seems to repeat it unwillingly as a child after his pedagogue and as it was not indited by his own head as the psalmist saith  it is singular said everardi have heard and read that the spirits of the slaughtered have strange power over the slayer but i am astonished to have it insisted upon that there may be truth in such tales roger wildrakewhat art thou afraid of manwhy dost thou shift thy place thus  fear it is not fearit is hate deadly hatei see the murderer of poor dick before me andsee he throws himself into a posture of fencesasasayst thou brood of a butchers mastiff thou shalt not want an antagonist  ere any one could stop him wildrake threw aside his cloak drew his sword and almost with a single bound cleared the distance betwixt him and harrison and crossed swords with the latter as he stood brandishing his weapon as if in immediate expectation of an assailant accordingly the republican general was not for an instant taken at unawares but the moment the swords clashed he shouted ha i feel thee now thou hast come in body at lastwelcome welcomethe sword of the lord and of gideon  part them part them cried everard as he and tomkins at first astonished at the suddenness of the affray hastened to interfere everard seizing on the cavalier drew him forcibly backwards and tomkins contrived with risk and difficulty to master harrisons sword while the general exclaimed ha two to onetwo to onethus fight demons wildrake on his side swore a dreadful oath and added markham you have cancelled every obligation i owed youthey are all out of sightgone dn me  you have indeed acquitted these obligations rarely said everard who knows how this affair shall be explained and answered  i will answer it with my life said wildrake  good now be silent said tomkins and let me manage it shall be so ordered that the good general shall never know that he hath encountered with a mortal man only let that man of moab put his sword into the scabbards rest and be still  wildrake let me entreat thee to sheathe thy sword said everard else on my life thou must turn it against me  no fore george not so mad as that neither but ill have another day with him  thou another day exclaimed harrison whose eye had still remained fixed on the spot where he found such palpable resistance yes i know thee well day by day week by week thou makest the same idle request for thou knowest that my heart quivers at thy voice but my hand trembles not when opposed to thinethe spirit is willing to the combat if the flesh be weak when opposed to that which is not of the flesh  now peace all for heavens sakesaid the steward tomkins then added addressing his master there is no one here if it please your excellency but tomkins and the worthy colonel everard  general harrison as sometimes happens in cases of partial insanity that is supposing his to have been a case of mental delusion though firmly and entirely persuaded of the truth of his own visions yet was not willing to speak on the subject to those who he knew would regard them as imaginary upon this occasion he assumed the appearance of perfect ease and composure after the violent agitation he had just manifested in a manner which showed how anxious he was to disguise his real feelings from everard whom he considered so unlikely to participate in them  he saluted the colonel with profound ceremony and talked of the fineness of the evening which had summoned him forth of the lodge to take a turn in the park and enjoy the favourable weather he then took everard by the arm and walked back with him towards the lodge wildrake and tomkins following close behind and leading the horses everard desirous to gain some light on these mysterious incidents endeavoured to come on the subject more than once by a mode of interrogation which harrison for madmen are very often unwilling to enter on the subject of their mental delusion parried with some skill or addressed himself for aid to his steward tomkins who was in the habit of being voucher for his master upon all occasions which led to desboroughs ingenious nickname of fibbet  and wherefore had you your sword drawn my worthy general said everard when you were only on an evening walk of pleasure  truly excellent colonel these are times when men must watch with their loins girded and their lights burning and their weapons drawn the day draweth nigh believe me or not as you will that men must watch lest they be found naked and unarmed when the seven trumpets shall sound boot and saddle and the pipes of jezer shall strike up horse and away  true good general but methought i saw you making passes even now as if you were fighting said everard  i am of a strange fantasy friend everard answered harrison and when i walk alone and happen as but now to have my weapon drawn i sometimes for exercise sake will practise a thrust against such a tree as that it is a silly pride men have in the use of weapons i have been accounted a master of fence and have fought for prizes when i was unregenerated and before i was called to do my part in the great work entering as a trooper into our victorious generals first regiment of horse  but methought said everard i heard a weapon clash with yours  how a weapon clash with my swordhow could that be tomkins  truly sir said tomkins it must have been a bough of the tree they have them of all kinds here and your honour may have pushed against one of them which the brazilians call ironwood a block of which being struck with a hammer saith purchas in his pilgrimage ringeth like an anvil  truly it may be so said harrison for those rulers who are gone assembled in this their abode of pleasure many strange trees and plants though they gathered not of the fruit of that tree which beareth twelve manner of fruits or of those leaves which are for the healing of the nations  everard pursued his investigation for he was struck with the manner in which harrison evaded his questions and the dexterity with which he threw his transcendental and fanatical notions like a sort of veil over the darker visions excited by remorse and conscious guilt  but said he if i may trust my eyes and ears i cannot but still think that you had a real antagonistnay i am sure i saw a fellow in a darkcoloured jerkin retreat through the wood  did you said harrison with a tone of surprise while his voice faltered in spite of himwho could he betomkins did you see the fellow colonel everard talks of with the napkin in his handthe bloody napkin which he always pressed to his side  this last expression in which harrison gave a mark different from that which everard had assigned but corresponding to tomkinss original description of the supposed spectre had more effect on everard in confirming the stewards story than anything he had witnessed or heard the voucher answered the draft upon him as promptly as usual that he had seen such a fellow glide past them into the thicketthat he dared to say he was some deerstealer for he had heard they were become very audacious  look ye there now master everard said harrison hurrying from the subjectis it not time now that we should lay aside our controversies and join hand in hand to repairing the breaches of our zion happy and contented were i my excellent friend to be a treader of mortar or a bearer of a hod upon this occasion under our great leader with whom providence has gone forth in this great national controversy and truly so devoutly do i hold by our excellent and victorious general oliver whom heaven long preservethat were he to command me i should not scruple to pluck forth of his high place the man whom they call speaker even as i lent a poor hand to pluck down the man whom they called kingwherefore as i know your judgment holdeth with mine on this matter let me urge unto you lovingly that we may act as brethren and build up the breaches and reestablish the bulwarks of our english zion whereby we shall be doubtless chosen as pillars and buttresses under our excellent lordgeneral for supporting and sustaining the same and endowed with proper revenues and incomes both spiritual and temporal to serve as a pedestal on which we may stand seeing that otherwise our foundation will be on the loose sandnevertheless continued he his mind again diverging from his views of temporal ambition into his visions of the fifth monarchy these things are but vanity in respect of the opening of the book which is sealed for all things approach speedily towards lightning and thundering and unloosing of the great dragon from the bottomless pit wherein he is chained  with this mingled strain of earthly politics and fanatical prediction harrison so overpowered colonel everard as to leave him no time to urge him farther on the particular circumstances of his nocturnal skirmish concerning which it is plain he had no desire to be interrogated they now reached the lodge of woodstock                                         chapter the fifteenth     now the wasted brands do glow   while the screechowl sounding loud   puts the wretch that lies in woe   in remembrance of a shroud   now it is the time of night   that the graves all gaping wide   every one lets out its sprite   in the churchway paths to glide     midsummer nights dream  before the gate of the palace the guards were now doubled everard demanded the reason of this from the corporal whom he found in the hall with his soldiers sitting or sleeping around a great fire maintained at the expense of the carved chairs and benches with fragments of which it was furnished  why verily answered the man the corpsdegarde as your worship says will be harassed to pieces by such duty nevertheless fear hath gone abroad among us and no man will mount guard alone we have drawn in however one or two of our outposts from banbury and elsewhere and we are to have a relief from oxford tomorrow  everard continued minute enquiries concerning the sentinels that were posted within as well as without the lodge and found that as they had been stationed under the eye of harrison himself the rules of prudent discipline had been exactly observed in the distribution of the posts there remained nothing therefore for colonel everard to do but remembering his own adventure of the evening to recommend that an additional sentinel should be placed with a companion if judged indispensable in that vestibule or anteroom from which the long gallery where he had met with the rencontre and other suites of apartments diverged the corporal respectfully promised all obedience to his orders the servingmen being called appeared also in double force everard demanded to know whether the commissioners had gone to bed or whether he could get speech with them they are in their bedroom forsooth replied one of the fellows but i think they be not yet undressed  what said everard are colonel desborough and master bletson both in the same sleeping apartment  their honours have so chosen it said the man and their honours secretaries remain upon guard all night  it is the fashion to double guards all over the house said wildrake had i a glimpse of a tolerably goodlooking housemaid now i should know how to fall into the fashion  peace fool said everardand where are the mayor and master holdenough  the mayor is returned to the borough on horseback behind the trooper who goes to oxford for the reinforcement and the man of the steeplehouse hath quartered himself in the chamber which colonel desborough had last night being that in which he is most likely to meet theyour honour understands the lord pity us we are a harassed family  and where be general harrisons knaves said tomkins that they do not marshal him to his apartment  hereherehere master tomkins said three fellows pressing forward with the same consternation on their faces which seemed to pervade the whole inhabitants of woodstock  away with you then said tomkinsspeak not to his worshipyou see he is not in the humour  indeed observed colonel everard he looks singularly wanhis features seem writhen as by a palsy stroke and though he was talking so fast while we came along he hath not opened his mouth since we came to the light  it is his manner after such visitations said tomkinsgive his honour your arms zedekiah and jonathan to lead him offi will follow instantlyyou nicodemus tarry to wait upon meit is not well walking alone in this mansion  master tomkins said everard i have heard of you often as a sharp intelligent mantell me fairly are you in earnest afraid of any thing supernatural haunting this house  i would be loth to run the chance sir said tomkins very gravely by looking on my worshipful master you may form a guess how the living look after they have spoken with the dead he bowed low and took his leave everard proceeded to the chamber which the two remaining commissioners had for comforts sake chosen to inhabit in company they were preparing for bed as he went into their apartment both started as the door openedboth rejoiced when they saw it was only everard who entered  hark ye hither said bletson pulling him aside sawest thou ever ass equal to desboroughthe fellow is as big as an ox and as timorous as a sheep he has insisted on my sleeping here to protect him shall we have a merry night ont ha we will if thou wilt take the third bed which was prepared for harrison but he is gone out like a mooncalf to look for the valley of armageddon in the park of woodstock  general harrison has returned with me but now said everard  nay but as i shall live he comes not into our apartment said desborough overhearing his answer no man that has been supping for aught i know with the devil has a right to sleep among christian folk  he does not propose so said everard he sleeps as i understand apartand alone  not quite alone i dare say said desborough for harrison hath a sort of attraction for goblinsthey fly round him like moths about a candlebut i prithee good everard do thou stay with us i know not how it is but although thou hast not thy religion always in thy mouth nor speakest many hard words about it like harrisonnor makest long preachments like a certain most honourable relation of mine who shall be nameless yet somehow i feel myself safer in thy company than with any of them as for this bletson he is such a mere blasphemer that i fear the devil will carry him away ere morning  did you ever hear such a paltry coward said bletson apart to everard do tarry however mine honoured coloneli know your zeal to assist the distressed and you see desborough is in that predicament that he will require near him more than one example to prevent him thinking of ghosts and fiends  i am sorry i cannot oblige you gentlemen said everard but i have settled my mind to sleep in victor lees apartment so i wish you good night and if you would repose without disturbance i would advise that you commend yourselves during the watches of the night to him unto whom night is even as midday i had intended to have spoke with you this evening on the subject of my being here but i will defer the conference till tomorrow when i think i will be able to show you excellent reasons for leaving woodstock  we have seen plenty such already said desborough for one i came here to serve the estate with some moderate advantage to myself for my trouble but if i am set upon my head again tonight as i was the night before i would not stay longer to gain a kings crown for i am sure my neck would be unfitted to bear the weight of it  good night exclaimed everard and was about to go when bletson again pressed close and whispered to him hark thee colonelyou know my friendship for theei do implore thee to leave the door of thy apartment open that if thou meetest with any disturbance i may hear thee call and be with thee upon the very instant do this dear everard my fears for thee will keep me awake else for i know that notwithstanding your excellent sense you entertain some of those superstitious ideas which we suck in with our mothers milk and which constitute the ground of our fears in situations like the present therefore leave thy door open if you love me that you may have ready assistance from me in case of need  my master said wildrake trusts first in his bible sir and then in his good sword he has no idea that the devil can be baffled by the charm of two men lying in one room still less that the foul fiend can be argued out of existence by the nullifidians of the rota  everard seized his imprudent friend by the collar and dragged him off as he was speaking keeping fast hold of him till they were both in the chamber of victor lee where they had slept on a former occasion even then he continued to hold wildrake until the servant had arranged the lights and was dismissed from the room then letting him go addressed him with the upbraiding question art thou not a prudent and sagacious person who in times like these seekst every opportunity to argue yourself into a broil or embroil yourself in an argument out on you  ay out on me indeed said the cavalier out on me for a poor tamespirited creature that submits to be bandied about in this manner by a man who is neither better born nor better bred than myself i tell thee mark you make an unfair use of your advantages over me why will you not let me go from you and live and die after my own fashion  because before we had been a week separate i should hear of your dying after the fashion of a dog come my good friend what madness was it in thee to fall foul on harrison and then to enter into useless argument with bletson  why we are in the devils house i think and i would willingly give the landlord his due wherever i travel to have sent him harrison or bletson now just as a lunch to stop his appetite till crom  hush stone walls have ears said everard looking around him here stands thy nightdrink look to thy arms for we must be as careful as if the avenger of blood were behind us yonder is thy bedand i as thou seest have one prepared in the parlour the door only divides us  which i will leave open in case thou shouldst holla for assistance as yonder nullifidian hath itbut how hast thou got all this so well put in order good patron  i gave the steward tomkins notice of my purpose to sleep here  a strange fellow that said wildrake and as i judge has taken measure of every ones footall seems to pass through his hands  he is i have understood replied everard one of the men formed by the timeshas a ready gift of preaching and expounding which keeps him in high terms with the independents and recommends himself to the more moderate people by his intelligence and activity  has his sincerity ever been doubted said wildrake  never that i heard of said the colonel on the contrary he has been familiarly called honest joe and trusty tomkins for my part i believe his sincerity has always kept pace with his interestbut come finish thy cup and to bedwhat all emptied at one draught  adszookers yesmy vow forbids me to make two ont but never fearthe nightcap will only warm my brain not clog it so man or devil give me notice if you are disturbed and rely on me in a twinkling so saying the cavalier retreated into his separate apartment and colonel everard taking off the most cumbrous part of his dress lay down in his hose and doublet and composed himself to rest  he was awakened from sleep by a slow and solemn strain of music which died away as at a distance he started up and felt for his arms which he found close beside him his temporary bed being without curtains he could look around him without difficulty but as there remained in the chimney only a few red embers of the fire which he had arranged before he went to sleep it was impossible he could discern any thing he felt therefore in spite of his natural courage that undefined and thrilling species of tremor which attends a sense that danger is near and an uncertainty concerning its cause and character reluctant as he was to yield belief to supernatural occurrences we have already said he was not absolutely incredulous as perhaps even in this more sceptical age there are many fewer complete and absolute infidels on this particular than give themselves out for such uncertain whether he had not dreamed of these sounds which seemed yet in his ears he was unwilling to risk the raillery of his friend by summoning him to his assistance he sat up therefore in his bed not without experiencing that nervous agitation to which brave men as well as cowards are subject with this difference that the one sinks under it like the vine under the hailstorm and the other collects his energies to shake it off as the cedar of lebanon is said to elevate its boughs to disperse the snow which accumulates upon them  the story of harrison in his own absolute despite and notwithstanding a secret suspicion which he had of trick or connivance returned on his mind at this dead and solitary hour harrison he remembered had described the vision by a circumstance of its appearance different from that which his own remark had been calculated to suggest to the mind of the visionarythat bloody napkin always pressed to the side was then a circumstance present either to his bodily eye or to that of his agitated imagination did then the murdered revisit the living haunts of those who had forced them from the stage with all their sins unaccounted for and if they did might not the same permission authorise other visitations of a similar nature to warnto instruct to punish rash are they was his conclusion and credulous who receive as truth every tale of the kind but no less rash may it be to limit the power of the creator over the works which he has made and to suppose that by the permission of the author of nature the laws of nature may not in peculiar cases and for high purposes be temporarily suspended  while these thoughts passed through everards mind feelings unknown to him even when he stood first on the rough and perilous edge of battle gained ground upon him he feared he knew not what and where an open and discernible peril would have drawn out his courage the absolute uncertainty of his situation increased his sense of the danger he felt an almost irresistible desire to spring from his bed and heap fuel on the dying embers expecting by the blaze to see some strange sight in his chamber he was also strongly tempted to awaken wildrake but shame stronger than fear itself checked these impulses what should it be thought that markham everard held one of the best soldiers who had drawn a sword in this sad warmarkham everard who had obtained such distinguished rank in the army of the parliament though so young in years was afraid of remaining by himself in a twilightroom at midnight it never should be said  this was however no charm for his unpleasant current of thought there rushed on his mind the various traditions of victor lees chamber which though he had often despised them as vague unauthenticated and inconsistent rumours engendered by ancient superstition and transmitted from generation to generation by loquacious credulity had something in them which did not tend to allay the present unpleasant state of his nerves then when he recollected the events of that very afternoon the weapon pressed against his throat and the strong arm which threw him backward on the floorif the remembrance served to contradict the idea of flitting phantoms and unreal daggers it certainly induced him to believe that there was in some part of this extensive mansion a party of cavaliers or malignants harboured who might arise in the night overpower the guards and execute upon them all but on harrison in particular as one of the regicide judges that vengeance which was so eagerly thirsted for by the attached followers of the slaughtered monarch  he endeavoured to console himself on this subject by the number and position of the guards yet still was dissatisfied with himself for not having taken yet more exact precautions and for keeping an extorted promise of silence which might consign so many of his party to the danger of assassination these thoughts connected with his military duties awakened another train of reflections he bethought himself that all he could now do was to visit the sentries and ascertain that they were awake alert on the watch and so situated that in time of need they might be ready to support each otherthis better befits me he thought than to be here like a child frightening myself with the old womans legend which i have laughed at when a boy what although old victor lee was a sacrilegious man as common report goes and brewed ale in the font which he brought from the ancient palace of holyrood while church and building were in flames and what although his eldest son was when a child scalded to death in the same vessel how many churches have been demolished since his time how many fonts desecrated so many indeed that were the vengeance of heaven to visit such aggressions in a supernatural manner no corner in england no not the most petty parish church but would have its apparitiontush these are idle fancies unworthy especially to be entertained by those educated to believe that sanctity resides in the intention and the act not in the buildings or fonts or the form of worship  as thus he called together the articles of his calvinistic creed the bell of the great clock a token seldom silent in such narratives tolled three and was immediately followed by the hoarse call of the sentinels through vault and gallery up stairs and beneath challenging and answering each other with the usual watchword alls well their voices mingled with the deep boom of the bell yet ceased before that was silent and when they had died away the tingling echo of the prolonged knell was scarcely audible ere yet that last distant tingling had finally subsided into silence it seemed as if it again was awakened and everard could hardly judge at first whether a new echo had taken up the falling cadence or whether some other and separate sound was disturbing anew the silence to which the deep knell had as its voice ceased consigned the ancient mansion and the woods around it  but the doubt was soon cleared up the musical tones which had mingled with the dying echoes of the knell seemed at first to prolong and afterwards to survive them a wild strain of melody beginning at a distance and growing louder as it advanced seemed to pass from room to room from cabinet to gallery from hall to bower through the deserted and dishonoured ruins of the ancient residence of so many sovereigns and as it approached no soldier gave alarm nor did any of the numerous guests of various degrees who spent an unpleasant and terrified night in that ancient mansion seem to dare to announce to each other the inexplicable cause of apprehension  everards excited state of mind did not permit him to be so passive the sounds approached so nigh that it seemed they were performing in the very next apartment a solemn service for the dead when he gave the alarm by calling loudly to his trusty attendant and friend wildrake who slumbered in the next chamber with only a door betwixt them and even that ajar wildrakewildrakeupup dost thou not hear the alarm there was no answer from wildrake though the musical sounds which now rung through the apartment as if the performers had actually been within its precincts would have been sufficient to awaken a sleeping person even without the shout of his comrade and patron  alarmroger wildrakealarm again called everard getting out of bed and grasping his weaponsget a light and cry alarm there was no answer his voice died away as the sound of the music seemed also to die and the same soft sweet voice which still to his thinking resembled that of alice lee was heard in his apartment and as he thought at no distance from him  your comrade will not answer said the low soft voice those only hear the alarm whose consciences feel the call  again this mummery said everard i am better armed than i was of late and but for the sound of that voice the speaker had bought his trifling dear  it was singular we may observe in passing that the instant the distinct sounds of the human voice were heard by everard all idea of supernatural interference was at an end and the charm by which he had been formerly fettered appeared to be broken so much is the influence of imaginary or superstitious terror dependent so far as respects strong judgments at least upon what is vague or ambiguous and so readily do distinct tones and express ideas bring such judgments back to the current of ordinary life the voice returned answer as addressing his thoughts as well as his words  we laugh at the weapons thou thinkest should terrify usover the guardians of woodstock they have no power fire if thou wilt and try the effect of thy weapons but know it is not our purpose to harm theethou art of a falcon breed and noble in thy disposition though unreclaimed and illnurtured thou hauntest with kites and carrion crows wing thy flight from hence on the morrow for if thou tarriest with the bats owls vultures and ravens which have thought to nestle here thou wilt inevitably share their fate away then that these halls may be swept and garnished for the reception of those who have a better right to inhabit them  everard answered in a raised voiceonce more i warn you think not to defy me in vain i am no child to be frightened by goblins tales and no coward armed as i am to be alarmed at the threats of banditti if i give you a moments indulgence it is for the sake of dear and misguided friends who may be concerned with this dangerous gambol know i can bring a troop of soldiers round the castle who will search its most inward recesses for the author of this audacious frolic and if that search should fail it will cost but a few barrels of gunpowder to make the mansion a heap of ruins and bury under them the authors of such an illjudged pastime  you speak proudly sir colonel said another voice similar to that harsher and stronger tone by which he had been addressed in the gallery try your courage in this direction  you should not dare me twice said colonel everard had i a glimpse of light to take aim by  as he spoke a sudden gleam of light was thrown with a brilliancy which almost dazzled the speaker showing distinctly a form somewhat resembling that of victor lee as represented in his picture holding in one hand a lady completely veiled and in the other his leadingstaff or truncheon both figures were animated and as it appeared standing within six feet of him  were it not for the woman said everard i would not be thus mortally dared  spare not for the female form but do your worst replied the same voice i defy you  repeat your defiance when i have counted thrice said everard and take the punishment of your insolence oncei have cocked my pistol twicei never missed my aimby all that is sacred i fire if you do not withdraw when i pronounce the next number i will shoot you dead where you stand i am yet unwilling to shed bloodi give you another chance of flightoncetwicethrice  everard aimed at the bosom and discharged his pistol the figure waved its arm in an attitude of scorn and a loud laugh arose during which the light as gradually growing weaker danced and glimmered upon the apparition of the aged knight and then disappeared everards lifeblood ran cold to his hearthad he been of human mould he thought the bullet must have pierced himbut i have neither will nor power to fight with supernatural beings  the feeling of oppression was now so strong as to be actually sickening he groped his way however to the fireside and flung on the embers which were yet gleaming a handful of dry fuel it presently blazed and afforded him light to see the room in every direction he looked cautiously almost timidly around and half expected some horrible phantom to become visible but he saw nothing save the old furniture the reading desk and other articles which had been left in the same state as when sir henry lee departed he felt an uncontrollable desire mingled with much repugnance to look at the portrait of the ancient knight which the form he had seen so strongly resembled he hesitated betwixt the opposing feelings but at length snatched with desperate resolution the taper which he had extinguished and relighted it ere the blaze of the fuel had again died away he held it up to the ancient portrait of victor lee and gazed on it with eager curiosity not unmingled with fear almost the childish terrors of his earlier days returned and he thought the severe pale eye of the ancient warrior followed his and menaced him with its displeasure and although he quickly argued himself out of such an absurd belief yet the mixed feelings of his mind were expressed in words that seemed half addressed to the ancient portrait  soul of my mothers ancestor he said be it for weal or for woe by designing men or by supernatural beings that these ancient halls are disturbed i am resolved to leave them on the morrow  i rejoice to hear it with all my soul said a voice behind him  he turned saw a tall figure in white with a sort of turban upon its head and dropping the candle in the exertion instantly grappled with it  thou at least art palpable he said  palpable answered he whom he grasped so stronglysdeath methinks you might know thatwithout the risk of choking me and if you loose me not ill show you that two can play at the game of wrestling  roger wildrake said everard letting the cavalier loose and stepping back  roger wildrake ay truly did you take me for roger bacon come to help you raise the devilfor the place smells of sulphur consumedly  it is the pistol i fireddid you not hear it  why yes it was the first thing waked mefor that nightcap which i pulled on made me sleep like a dormousepshaw i feel my brains giddy with it yet  and wherefore came you not on the instanti never needed help more  i came as fast as i could answered wildrake but it was some time ere i got my senses collected for i was dreaming of that cursed field at nasebyand then the door of my room was shut and hard to open till i played the locksmith with my foot  how it was open when i went to bed said everard  it was locked when i came out of bed though said wildrake and i marvel you heard me not when i forced it open  my mind was occupied otherwise said everard  well said wildrake but what has happenedhere am i bolt upright and ready to fight if this yawning fit will give me leavemother redcaps mightiest is weaker than i drank last night by a bushel to a barleycorni have quaffed the very elixir of malthayaw  and some opiate besides i should think said everard  very likevery likeless than the pistolshot would not waken me even me who with but an ordinary gracecup sleep as lightly as a maiden on the first of may when she watches for the earliest beam to go to gather dew but what are you about to do next  nothing answered everard  nothing said wildrake in surprise  i speak it said colonel everard less for your information than for that of others who may hear me that i will leave the lodge this morning and if it is possible remove the commissioners  hark said wildrake do you not hear some noise like the distant sound of the applause of a theatre the goblins of the place rejoice in your departure  i shall leave woodstock said everard to the occupation of my uncle sir henry lee and his family if they choose to resume it not that i am frightened into this as a concession to the series of artifices which have been played off on this occasion but solely because such was my intention from the beginning but let me warn he added raising his voicelet me warn the parties concerned in this combination that though it may pass off successfully on a fool like desborough a visionary like harrison a coward like bletson  here a voice distinctly spoke as standing near themor a wise moderate and resolute person like colonel everard  by heaven the voice came from the picture said wildrake drawing his sword i will pink his plated armour for him  offer no violence said everard startled at the interruption but resuming with firmness what he was sayinglet those engaged be aware that however this string of artifices may be immediately successful it must when closely looked into be attended with the punishment of all concernedthe total demolition of woodstock and the irremediable downfall of the family of lee let all concerned think of this and desist in time  he paused and almost expected a reply but none such came  it is a very odd thing said wildrake butyawhamy brain cannot compass it just now it whirls round like a toast in a bowl of muscadine i must sit downhawyawand discuss it at leisure gramercy good elbowchair  so saying he threw himself or rather sank gradually down on a large easychair which had been often pressed by the weight of stout sir henry lee and in an instant was sound asleep everard was far from feeling the same inclination for slumber yet his mind was relieved of the apprehension of any farther visitation that night for he considered his treaty to evacuate woodstock as made known to and accepted in all probability by those whom the intrusion of the commissioners had induced to take such singular measures for expelling them his opinion which had for a time bent towards a belief in something supernatural in the disturbances had now returned to the more rational mode of accounting for them by dexterous combination for which such a mansion as woodstock afforded so many facilities  he heaped the hearth with fuel lighted the candle and examining poor wildrakes situation adjusted him as easily in the chair as he could the cavalier stirring his limbs no more than an infant his situation went far in his patrons opinion to infer trick and confederacy for ghosts have no occasion to drug mens possets he threw himself on the bed and while he thought these strange circumstances over a sweet and low strain of music stole through the chamber the words good nightgood nightgood night thrice repeated each time in a softer and more distant tone seeming to assure him that the goblins and he were at truce if not at peace and that he had no more disturbance to expect that night he had scarcely the courage to call out a good night for after all his conviction of the existence of a trick it was so well performed as to bring with it a feeling of fear just like what an audience experience during the performance of a tragic scene which they know to be unreal and which yet affects their passions by its near approach to nature sleep overtook him at last and left him not till broad daylight on the ensuing morning                                         chapter the sixteenth     and yonder shines auroras harbinger   at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there   troop home to churchyard    midsummer nights dream  with the fresh air and the rising of morning every feeling of the preceding night had passed away from colonel everards mind excepting wonder how the effects which he had witnessed could be produced he examined the whole room sounding bolt floor and wainscot with his knuckles and cane but was unable to discern any secret passages while the door secured by a strong crossbolt and the lock besides remained as firm as when he had fastened it on the preceding evening the apparition resembling victor lee next called his attention ridiculous stories had been often circulated of this figure or one exactly resembling it having been met with by night among the waste apartments and corridors of the old palace and markham everard had often heard such in his childhood he was angry to recollect his own deficiency of courage and the thrill which he felt on the preceding night when by confederacy doubtless such an object was placed before his eyes  surely he said this fit of childish folly could not make me miss my aimmore likely that the bullet had been withdrawn clandestinely from the pistol  he examined that which was undischargedhe found the bullet in it he investigated the apartment opposite to the point at which he had fired and at five feet from the floor in a direct line between the bedside and the place where the appearance had been seen a pistolball had recently buried itself in the wainscot he had little doubt therefore that he had fired in a just direction and indeed to have arrived at the place where it was lodged the bullet must have passed through the appearance at which he aimed and proceeded point blank to the wall beyond this was mysterious and induced him to doubt whether the art of witchcraft or conjuration had not been called in to assist the machinations of those daring conspirators who being themselves mortal might nevertheless according to the universal creed of the times have invoked and obtained assistance from the inhabitants of another world  his next investigation respected the picture of victor lee itself he examined it minutely as he stood on the floor before it and compared its pale shadowy faintlytraced outlines its faded colours the stern repose of the eye and deathlike pallidness of the countenance with its different aspect on the preceding night when illuminated by the artificial light which fell full upon it while it left every other part of the room in comparative darkness the features seemed then to have an unnatural glow while the rising and falling of the flame in the chimney gave the head and limbs something which resembled the appearance of actual motion now seen by day it was a mere picture of the hard and ancient school of holbein last night it seemed for the moment something more determined to get to the bottom of this contrivance if possible everard by the assistance of a table and chair examined the portrait still more closely and endeavoured to ascertain the existence of any private spring by which it might be slipt asidea contrivance not unfrequent in ancient buildings which usually abounded with means of access and escape communicated to none but the lords of the castle or their immediate confidants but the panel on which victor lee was painted was firmly fixed in the wainscoting of the apartment of which it made a part and the colonel satisfied himself that it could not have been used for the purpose which he had suspected  he next aroused his faithful squire wildrake who notwithstanding his deep share of the blessedness of sleep had scarce even yet got rid of the effects of the gracecup of the preceding evening it was the reward according to his own view of the matter of his temperance one single draught having made him sleep more late and more sound than a matter of halfadozen or from thence to a dozen pulls would have done when he was guilty of the enormity of reresuppers footnote reresuppers quasi arriere belonged to a species of luxury introduced in the jolly days of king jamess extravagance and continued through the subsequent reign the supper took place at an early hour six or seven oclock at latestthe reresupper was a postliminary banquet a hors doeuvre which made its appearance at ten or eleven and served as an apology for prolonging the entertainment till midnight and of drinking deep after them  had your temperate draught said everard been but a thought more strongly seasoned wildrake thou hadst slept so sound that the last trump only could have waked thee  and then answered wildrake i should have waked with a headache mark for i see my modest sip has not exempted me from that epilogue but let us go forth and see how the night which we have passed so strangely has been spent by the rest of them i suspect they are all right willing to evacuate woodstock unless they have either rested better than we or at least been more lucky in lodgings  in that case i will dispatch thee down to jocelines hut to negotiate the reentrance of sir henry lee and his family into their old apartments where my interest with the general being joined with the indifferent repute of the place itself i think they have little chance of being disturbed either by the present or by any new commissioners  but how are they to defend themselves against the fiends my gallant colonel said wildrake methinks had i an interest in yonder pretty girl such as thou dost boast i should be loth to expose her to the terrors of a residence at woodstock where these devilsi beg their pardon for i suppose they hear every word we saythese merry goblinsmake such gay work from twilight till morning  my dear wildrake said the colonel i as well as you believe it possible that our speech may be overheard but i care not and will speak my mind plainly i trust sir henry and alice are not engaged in this silly plot i cannot reconcile it with the pride of the one the modesty of the other nor the good sense of both that any motive could engage them in so strange a conjunction but the fiends are all of your own political persuasion wildrake all trueblue cavaliers and i am convinced that sir henry and alice lee though they be unconnected with them have not the slightest cause to be apprehensive of their goblin machinations besides sir henry and joceline must know every corner about the place it will be far more difficult to play off any ghostly machinery upon him than upon strangers but let us to our toilet and when water and brush have done their work we will enquirewhat is next to be done  nay that wretched puritans garb of mine is hardly worth brushing said wildrake and but for this hundredweight of rusty iron with which thou hast bedizened me i look more like a bankrupt quaker than anything else but ill make you as spruce as ever was a canting rogue of your party  so saying and humming at the same time the cavalier tune    though for a time we see whitehall   with cobwebs hung around the wall   yet heaven shall make amends for all     when the king shall enjoy his own again  thou forgettest who are without said colonel everard  noi remember who are within replied his friend i only sing to my merry goblins who will like me all the better for it tush man the devils are my bonos socios and when i see them i will warrant they prove such roaring boys as i knew when i served under lunford and goring fellows with long nails that nothing escaped bottomless stomachs that nothing filledmad for pillaging ranting drinking and fightingsleeping rough on the trenches and dying stubbornly in their boots ah those merry days are gone well it is the fashion to make a grave face ont among cavaliers and specially the parsons that have lost their tithepigs but i was fitted for the element of the time and never did or can desire merrier days than i had during that same barbarous bloody and unnatural rebellion  thou wert ever a wild seabird roger even according to your name liking the gale better than the calm the boisterous ocean better than the smooth lake and your rough wild struggle against the wind than daily food ease and quiet  pshaw a fig for your smooth lake and your old woman to feed me with brewers grains and the poor drake obliged to come swattering whenever she whistles everard i like to feel the wind rustle against my pinionsnow diving now on the crest of the wave now in ocean now in skythat is the wilddrakes joy my grave one and in the civil war so it went with usdown in one county up in another beaten today victorious tomorrownow starving in some barren leaguernow revelling in a presbyterians pantryhis cellars his platechest his old judicial thumbring his pretty servingwench all at command  hush friend said everard remember i hold that persuasion more the pity mark more the pity said wildrake but as you say it is needless talking of it let us een go and see how your presbyterian pastor mr holdenough has fared and whether he has proved more able to foil the foul fiend than have you his disciple and auditor  they left the apartment accordingly and were overwhelmed with the various incoherent accounts of sentinels and others all of whom had seen or heard something extraordinary in the course of the night it is needless to describe particularly the various rumours which each contributed to the common stock with the greater alacrity that in such cases there seems always to be a sort of disgrace in not having seen or suffered as much as others  the most moderate of the narrators only talked of sounds like the mewing of a cat or the growling of a dog especially the squeaking of a pig they heard also as if it had been nails driven and saws used and the clashing of fetters and the rustling of silk gowns and the notes of music and in short all sorts of sounds which have nothing to do with each other others swore they had smelt savours of various kinds chiefly bituminous indicating a satanic derivation others did not indeed swear but protested to visions of men in armour horses without heads asses with horns and cows with six legs not to mention black figures whose cloven hoofs gave plain information what realm they belonged to  but these stronglyattested cases of nocturnal disturbances among the sentinels had been so general as to prevent alarm and succour on any particular point so that those who were on duty called in vain on the corpsdegarde who were trembling on their own post and an alert enemy might have done complete execution on the whole garrison but amid this general alerte no violence appeared to be meant and annoyance not injury seemed to have been the goblins object excepting in the case of one poor fellow a trooper who had followed harrison in half his battles and now was sentinel in that very vestibule upon which everard had recommended them to mount a guard he had presented his carabine at something which came suddenly upon him when it was wrested out of his hands and he himself knocked down with the buttend of it his broken head and the drenched bedding of desborough upon whom a tub of ditchwater had been emptied during his sleep were the only pieces of real evidence to attest the disturbances of the night  the reports from harrisons apartment were as delivered by the grave master tomkins that truly the general had passed the night undisturbed though there was still upon him a deep sleep and a folding of the hands to slumber from which everard argued that the machinators had esteemed harrisons part of the reckoning sufficiently paid off on the preceding evening  he then proceeded to the apartment doubly garrisoned by the worshipful desborough and the philosophical bletson they were both up and dressing themselves the former openmouthed in his feeling of fear and suffering indeed no sooner had everard entered than the ducked and dismayed colonel made a dismal complaint of the way he had spent the night and murmured not a little against his worshipful kinsman for imposing a task upon him which inferred so much annoyance  could not his excellency my kinsman noll he said have given his poor relative and brotherinlaw a sop somewhere else than out of this woodstock which seems to be the devils own porridgepot i cannot sup broth with the devil i have no long spoonnot i could he not have quartered me in some quiet corner and given this haunted place to some of his preachers and prayers who know the bible as well as the musterroll whereas i know the four hoofs of a cleangoing nag or the points of a team of oxen better than all the books of moses but i will give it over at once and for ever hopes of earthly gain shall never make me run the risk of being carried away bodily by the devil besides being set upon my head one whole night and soused with ditchwater the nextno no i am too wise for that  master bletson had a different part to act he complained of no personal annoyances on the contrary he declared he should have slept as well as ever he did in his life but for the abominable disturbances around him of men calling to arms every half hour when so much as a cat trotted by one of their postshe would rather he said have slept among a whole sabaoth of witches if such creatures could be found  then you think there are no such things as apparitions master bletson said everard i used to be sceptical on the subject but on my life tonight has been a strange one  dreams dreams dreams my simple colonel said bletson though his pale face and shaking limbs belied the assumed courage with which he spoke old chaucer sir hath told us the real moral onthe was an old frequenter of the forest of woodstock here  chaser said desborough some huntsman belike by his name does he walk like hearne at windsor  chaucer said bletson my dear desborough is one of those wonderful fellows as colonel everard knows who live many a hundred years after they are buried and whose words haunt our ears after their bones are long mouldered in the dust  ay ay well answered desborough to whom this description of the old poet was unintelligiblei for one desire his room rather than his company one of your conjurors i warrant him but what says he to the matter  only a slight spell which i will take the freedom to repeat to colonel everard said bletson but which would be as bad as greek to thee desborough old geoffrey lays the whole blame of our nocturnal disturbance on superfluity of humours    which causen folk to dred in their dreams   of arrowes and of fire with red gleams   right as the humour of melancholy   causeth many a man in sleep to cry   for fear of great bulls and bears black   and others that black devils will them take  while he was thus declaiming everard observed a book sticking out from beneath the pillow of the bed lately occupied by the honourable member  is that chaucer he said making to the volume i would like to look at the passage  chaucer said bletson hastening to interfere nothat is lucretius my darling lucretius i cannot let you see it i have some private marks  but by this time everard had the book in his hand lucretius he said no master bletson this is not lucretius but a fitter comforter in dread or in dangerwhy should you be ashamed of it only bletson instead of resting your head if you can but anchor your heart upon this volume it may serve you in better stead than lucretius or chaucer either  why what book is it said bletson his pale cheek colouring with the shame of detection oh the bible throwing it down contemptuously some book of my fellow gibeons these jews have been always superstitiousever since juvenals time thou knowest    qualiacunque voles judaei somnia vendunt  he left me the old book for a spell i warrant you for tis a wellmeaning fool  he would scarce have left the new testament as well as the old said everard come my dear bletson do not be ashamed of the wisest thing you ever did in your life supposing you took your bible in an hour of apprehension with a view to profit by the contents  bletsons vanity was so much galled that it overcame his constitutional cowardice his little thin fingers quivered for eagerness his neck and cheeks were as red as scarlet and his articulation was as thick and vehement asin short as if he had been no philosopher  master everard he said you are a man of the sword sir and sir you seem to suppose yourself entitled to say whatever comes into your mind with respect to civilians sir but i would have you remember sir that there are bounds beyond which human patience may be urged sirand jests which no man of honour will endure sirand therefore i expect an apology for your present language colonel everard and this unmannerly jesting siror you may chance to hear from me in a way that will not please you  everard could not help smiling at this explosion of valour engendered by irritated selflove  look you master bletson he said i have been a soldier that is true but i was never a bloodyminded one and as a christian i am unwilling to enlarge the kingdom of darkness by sending a new vassal thither before his time if heaven gives you time to repent i see no reason why my hand should deprive you of it which were we to have a rencontre would be your fate in the thrust of a sword or the pulling of a triggeri therefore prefer to apologise and i call desborough if he has recovered his wits to bear evidence that i do apologise for having suspected you who are completely the slave of your own vanity of any tendency however slight towards grace or good sense and i farther apologise for the time that i have wasted in endeavouring to wash an ethiopian white or in recommending rational enquiry to a selfwilled atheist  bletson overjoyed at the turn the matter had takenfor the defiance was scarce out of his mouth ere he began to tremble for the consequencesanswered with great eagerness and servility of mannernay dearest colonel say no more of itan apology is all that is necessary among men of honourit neither leaves dishonour with him who asks it nor infers degradation on him who makes it  not such an apology as i have made i trust said the colonel  no nonot in the least answered bletsonone apology serves me just as well as another and desborough will bear witness you have made one and that is all there can be said on the subject  master desborough and you rejoined the colonel will take care how the matter is reported i dare say and i only recommend to both that if mentioned at all it may be told correctly  nay nay we will not mention it at all said bletson we will forget it from this moment only never suppose me capable of superstitious weakness had i been afraid of an apparent and real dangerwhy such fear is natural to manand i will not deny that the mood of mind may have happened to me as well as to others but to be thought capable of resorting to spells and sleeping with books under my pillow to secure myself against ghostson my word it was enough to provoke one to quarrel for the moment with his very best friendand now colonel what is to be done and how is our duty to be executed at this accursed place if i should get such a wetting as desboroughs why i should die of catarrh though you see it hurts him no more than a bucket of water thrown over a posthorse you are i presume a brother in our commissionhow are you of opinion we should proceed  why in good time here comes harrison said everard and i will lay my commission from the lordgeneral before you all which as you see colonel desborough commands you to desist from acting on your present authority and intimates his pleasure accordingly that you withdraw from this place  desborough took the paper and examined the signatureit is nolls signature sure enough said he dropping his under jaw only every time of late he has made the oliver as large as a giant while the cromwell creeps after like a dwarf as if the surname were like to disappear one of these days altogether but is his excellency our kinsman noll cromwell since he has the surname yet so unreasonable as to think his relations and friends are to be set upon their heads till they have the crick in their neckdrenched as if they had been plunged in a horsepondfrightened day and night by all sort of devils witches and fairies and get not a penny of smartmoney adzooks forgive me for swearing if thats the case i had better home to my farm and mind team and herd than dangle after such a thankless person though i have wived his sister she was poor enough when i took her for as high as noll holds his head now  it is not my purpose said bletson to stir debate in this honourable meeting and no one will doubt the veneration and attachment which i bear to our noble general whom the current of events and his own matchless qualities of courage and constancy have raised so high in these deplorable daysif i were to term him a direct and immediate emanation of the animus mundi itselfsomething which nature had produced in her proudest hour while exerting herself as is her law for the preservation of the creatures to whom she has given existence should scarce exhaust the ideas which i entertain of him always protesting that i am by no means to be held as admitting but merely as granting for the sake of argument the possible existence of that species of emanation or exhalation from the animus mundi of which i have made mention i appeal to you colonel desborough who are his excellencys relationto you colonel everard who hold the dearer title of his friend whether i have overrated my zeal in his behalf  everard bowed at this pause but desborough gave a more complete authentication nay i can bear witness to that i have seen when you were willing to tie his points or brush his cloak or the likeand to be treated thus ungratefullyand gudgeoned of the opportunities which had been given you  it is not for that said bletson waving his hand gracefully you do me wrong master desboroughyou do indeed kind siralthough i know you meant it notno sirno partial consideration of private interest prevailed on me to undertake this charge it was conferred on me by the parliament of england in whose name this war commenced and by the council of state who are the conservators of englands liberty and the chance and serene hope of serving the country the confidence that iand you master desboroughand you worthy general harrison superior as i am to all selfish considerationsto which i am sure you also good colonel everard would be superior had you been named in this commission as i would to heaven you hadi say the hope of serving the country with the aid of such respectable associates one and all of themas well as you colonel everard supposing you to have been of the number induced me to accept of this opportunity whereby i might gratuitously with your assistance render so much advantage to our dear mother the commonwealth of englandsuch was my hopemy trustmy confidence and now comes my lordgenerals warrant to dissolve the authority by which we are entitled to act gentlemen i ask this honourable meeting with all respect to his excellency whether his commission be paramount to that from which he himself directly holds his commission no one will say so i ask whether he has climbed into the seat from which the late man descended or hath a great seal or means to proceed by prerogative in such a case i cannot see reason to believe it and therefore i must resist such doctrine i am in your judgment my brave and honourable colleagues but touching my own poor opinion i feel myself under the unhappy necessity of proceeding in our commission as if the interruption had not taken place with this addition that the board of sequestrators should sit by day at this same lodge of woodstock but that to reconcile the minds of weak brethren who may be afflicted by superstitious rumours as well as to avoid any practice on our persons by the malignants who i am convinced are busy in this neighbourhood we should remove our sittings after sunset to the george inn in the neighbouring borough  good master bletson replied colonel everard it is not for me to reply to you but you may know in what characters this army of england and their general write their authority i fear me the annotation on this precept of the general will be expressed by the march of a troop of horse from oxford to see it executed i believe there are orders out for that effect and you know by late experience that the soldier will obey his general equally against king and parliament  that obedience is conditional said harrison starting fiercely up knowst thou not markham everard that i have followed the man cromwell as close as the bulldog follows his masterand so i will yetbut i am no spaniel either to be beaten or to have the food i have earned snatched from me as if i were a vile cur whose wages are a whipping and free leave to wear my own skin i looked amongst the three of us that we might honestly and piously and with advantage to the commonwealth have gained out of this commission three or it may be five thousand pounds and does cromwell imagine i will part with it for a rough word no man goeth a warfare on his own charges he that serves the altar must live by the altarand the saints must have means to provide them with good harness and fresh horses against the unsealing and the pouring forth does cromwell think i am so much of a tame tiger as to permit him to rend from me at pleasure the miserable dole he hath thrown me of a surety i will resist and the men who are here being chiefly of my own regimentmen who wait and who expect with lamps burning and loins girded and each one his weapon bound upon his thigh will aid me to make this house good against every assaultay even against cromwell himself until the latter comingselah selah  and i said desborough will levy troops and protect your outquarters not choosing at present to close myself up in garrison  and i said bletson will do my part and hie me to town and lay the matter before parliament arising in my place for that effect  everard was little moved by all these threats the only formidable one indeed was that of harrison whose enthusiasm joined with his courage and obstinacy and character among the fanatics of his own principles made him a dangerous enemy before trying any arguments with the refractory majorgeneral everard endeavoured to moderate his feelings and threw something in about the late disturbances  talk not to me of supernatural disturbances young mantalk not to me of enemies in the body or out of the body am i not the champion chosen and commissioned to encounter and to conquer the great dragon and the beast which cometh out of the sea am i not to command the left wing and two regiments of the centre when the saints shall encounter with the countless legions of grog and magog i tell thee that my name is written on the sea of glass mingled with fire and that i will keep this place of woodstock against all mortal men and against all devils whether in field or chamber in the forest or in the meadow even till the saints reign in the fulness of their glory  everard saw it was then time to produce two or three lines under cromwells hand which he had received from the general subsequently to the communication through wildrake the information they contained was calculated to allay the disappointment of the commissioners this document assigned as the reason of superseding the woodstock commission that he should probably propose to the parliament to require the assistance of general harrison colonel desborough and master bletson the honourable member for littlefaith in a much greater matter namely the disposing of the royal property and disparking of the kings forest at windsor so soon as this idea was started all parties pricked up their ears and their drooping and gloomy and vindictive looks began to give place to courteous smiles and to a cheerfulness which laughed in their eyes and turned their mustaches upwards  colonel desborough acquitted his right honourable and excellent cousin and kinsman of all species of unkindness master bletson discovered that the interest of the state was trebly concerned in the good administration of windsor more than in that of woodstock as for harrison he exclaimed without disguise or hesitation that the gleaning of the grapes of windsor was better than the vintage of woodstock thus speaking the glance of his dark eye expressed as much triumph in the proposed earthly advantage as if it had not been according to his vain persuasion to be shortly exchanged for his share in the general reign of the millennium his delight in short resembled the joy of an eagle who preys upon a lamb in the evening with not the less relish because she descries in the distant landscape an hundred thousand men about to join battle with daybreak and to give her an endless feast on the hearts and lifeblood of the valiant yet though all agreed that they would be obedient to the generals pleasure in this matter bletson proposed as a precautionary measure in which all agreed that they should take up their abode for some time in the town of woodstock to wait for their new commissions respecting windsor and this upon the prudential consideration that it was best not to slip one knot until another was first tied  each commissioner therefore wrote to oliver individually stating in his own way the depth and height length and breadth of his attachment to him each expressed himself resolved to obey the generals injunctions to the uttermost but with the same scrupulous devotion to the parliament each found himself at a loss how to lay down the commission intrusted to them by that body and therefore felt bound in conscience to take up his residence at the borough of woodstock that he might not seem to abandon the charge committed to them until they should be called to administrate the weightier matter of windsor to which they expressed their willingness instantly to devote themselves according to his excellencys pleasure  this was the general style of their letters varied by the characteristic flourishes of the writers desborough for example said something about the religious duty of providing for ones own household only he blundered the text bletson wrote long and big words about the political obligation incumbent on every member of the community on every person to sacrifice his time and talents to the service of his country while harrison talked of the littleness of present affairs in comparison of the approaching tremendous change of all things beneath the sun but although the garnishing of the various epistles was different the result came to the same that they were determined at least to keep sight of woodstock until they were well assured of some better and more profitable commission  everard also wrote a letter in the most grateful terms to cromwell which would probably have been less warm had he known more distinctly than his follower chose to tell him the expectation under which the wily general had granted his request he acquainted his excellency with his purpose of continuing at woodstock partly to assure himself of the motions of the three commissioners and to watch whether they did not again enter upon the execution of the trust which they had for the present renouncedand partly to see that some extraordinary circumstances which had taken place in the lodge and which would doubtless transpire were not followed by any explosion to the disturbance of the public peace he knew as he expressed himself that his excellency was so much the friend of order that he would rather disturbances or insurrections were prevented than punished and he conjured the general to repose confidence in his exertions for the public service by every mode within his power not aware it will be observed in what peculiar sense his general pledge might be interpreted  these letters being made up into a packet were forwarded to windsor by a trooper detached on that errand                                         chapter the seventeenth     we do that in our zeal   our calmer moments are afraid to answer   anonymous  while the commissioners were preparing to remove themselves from the lodge to the inn at the borough of woodstock with all that state and bustle which attend the movements of great persons and especially of such to whom greatness is not entirely familiar everard held some colloquy with the presbyterian clergyman master holdenough who had issued from the apartment which he had occupied as it were in defiance of the spirits by whom the mansion was supposed to be disturbed and whose pale cheek and pensive brow gave token that he had not passed the night more comfortably than the other inmates of the lodge of woodstock colonel everard having offered to procure the reverend gentleman some refreshment received this replythis day shall i not taste food saving that which we are assured of as sufficient for our sustenance where it is promised that our bread shall be given us and our water shall be sure not that i fast in the papistical opinion that it adds to those merits which are but an accumulation of filthy rags but because i hold it needful that no grosser sustenance should this day cloud my understanding or render less pure and vivid the thanks i owe to heaven for a most wonderful preservation  master holdenough said everard you are i know both a good man and a bold one and i saw you last night courageously go upon your sacred duty when soldiers and tried ones seemed considerably alarmed  too courageoustoo venturous was master holdenoughs reply the boldness of whose aspect seemed completely to have died away we are frail creatures master everard and frailest when we think ourselves strongest oh colonel everard he added after a pause and as if the confidence was partly involuntary i have seen that which i shall never survive  you surprise me reverend sir said everardmay i request you will speak more plainly i have heard some stories of this wild night nay have witnessed strange things myself but methinks i would be much interested in knowing the nature of your disturbance  sir said the clergyman you are a discreet gentleman and though i would not willingly that these heretics schismatics brownists muggletonians anabaptists and so forth had such an opportunity of triumph as my defeat in this matter would have afforded them yet with you who have been ever a faithful follower of our church and are pledged to the good cause by the great national league and covenant surely i would be more open sit we down therefore and let me call for a glass of pure water for as yet i feel some bodily faltering though i thank heaven i am in mind resolute and composed as a merely mortal man may after such a visionthey say worthy colonel that looking on such things foretells or causes speedy deathi know not if it be true but if so i only depart like the tired sentinel when his officer releases him from his post and glad shall i be to close these wearied eyes against the sight and shut these harassed ears against the croaking as of frogs of antinomians and pelagians and socinians and arminians and arians and nullifidians which have come up into our england like those filthy reptiles into the house of pharaoh  here one of the servants who had been summoned entered with a cup of water gazing at the same time in the face of the clergyman as if his stupid grey eyes were endeavouring to read what tragic tale was written on his brow and shaking his empty skull as he left the room with the air of one who was proud of having discovered that all was not exactly right though he could not so well guess what was wrong  colonel everard invited the good man to take some refreshment more genial than the pure element but he declined i am in some sort a champion he said and though i have been foiled in the late controversy with the enemy still i have my trumpet to give the alarm and my sharp sword to smite withal therefore like the nazarites of old i will eat nothing that cometh of the vine neither drink wine nor strong drink until these my days of combat shall have passed away  kindly and respectfully the colonel anew pressed master holdenough to communicate the events that had befallen him on the preceding night and the good clergyman proceeded as follows with that little characteristic touch of vanity in his narrative which naturally arose out of the part he had played in the world and the influence which he had exercised over the minds of others i was a young man at the university of cambridge he said when i was particularly bound in friendship to a fellowstudent perhaps because we were esteemed though it is vain to mention it the most hopeful scholars at our college and so equally advanced that it was difficult perhaps to say which was the greater proficient in his studies only our tutor master purefoy used to say that if my comrade had the advantage of me in gifts i had the better of him in grace for he was attached to the profane learning of the classics always unprofitable often impious and impure and i had light enough to turn my studies into the sacred tongues also we differed in our opinions touching the church of england for he held arminian opinions with laud and those who would connect our ecclesiastical establishment with the civil and make the church dependent on the breath of an earthly man in fine he favoured prelacy both in essentials and ceremonial and although we parted with tears and embraces it was to follow very different courses he obtained a living and became a great controversial writer in behalf of the bishops and of the court i also as is well known to you to the best of my poor abilities sharpened my pen in the cause of the poor oppressed people whose tender consciences rejected the rites and ceremonies more befitting a papistical than a reformed church and which according to the blinded policy of the court were enforced by pains and penalties then came the civil war and icalled thereunto by my conscience and nothing fearing or suspecting what miserable consequences have chanced through the rise of these independentsconsented to lend my countenance and labour to the great work by becoming chaplain to colonel harrisons regiment not that i mingled with carnal weapons in the fieldwhich heaven forbid that a minister of the altar shouldbut i preached exhorted and in time of need was a surgeon as well to the wounds of the body as of the soul now it fell towards the end of the war that a party of malignants had seized on a strong house in the shire of shrewsbury situated on a small island advanced into a lake and accessible only by a small and narrow causeway from thence they made excursions and vexed the country and high time it was to suppress them so that a part of our regiment went to reduce them and i was requested to go for they were few in number to take in so strong a place and the colonel judged that my exhortations would make them do valiantly and so contrary to my wont i went forth with them even to the field where there was valiant fighting on both sides nevertheless the malignants shooting their wallpieces at us had so much the advantage that after bursting their gates with a salvo of our cannon colonel harrison ordered his men to advance on the causeway and try to carry the place by storm nonetheless although our men did valiantly advancing in good order yet being galled on every side by the fire they at length fell into disorder and were retreating with much loss harrison himself valiantly bringing up the rear and defending them as he could against the enemy who sallied forth in pursuit of them to smite them hip and thigh now colonel everard i am a man of a quick and vehement temper by nature though better teaching than the old law hath made me mild and patient as you now see me i could not bear to see our israelites flying before the philistines so i rushed upon the causeway with the bible in one hand and a halberd which i had caught up in the other and turned back the foremost fugitives by threatening to strike them down pointing out to them at the same time a priest in his cassock as they call it who was among the malignants and asking them whether they would not do as much for a true servant of heaven as the uncircumcised would for a priest of baal my words and strokes prevailed they turned at once and shouting out down with baal and his worshippers they charged the malignants so unexpectedly home that they not only drove them back into their house of garrison but entered it with them as the phrase is pellmell i also was there partly hurried on by the crowd partly to prevail on our enraged soldiers to give quarter for it grieved my heart to see christians and englishmen hashed down with swords and gunstocks like curs in the street when there is an alarm of maddogs in this way the soldiers fighting and slaughtering and i calling to them to stay their hand we gained the very roof of the building which was in part leaded and to which as a last tower of refuge those of the cavaliers who yet escaped had retired i was myself i may say forced up the narrow winding staircase by our soldiers who rushed on like dogs of chase upon their prey and when extricated from the passage i found myself in the midst of a horrid scene the scattered defenders were some resisting with the fury of despair some on their knees imploring for compassion in words and tones to break a mans heart when he thinks on them some were calling on god for mercy and it was time for man had none they were stricken down thrust through flung from the battlements into the lake and the wild cries of the victors mingled with the groans shrieks and clamours of the vanquished made a sound so horrible that only death can erase it from my memory and the men who butchered their fellowcreatures thus were neither pagans from distant savage lands nor ruffians the refuse and offscourings of our own people they were in calm blood reasonable nay religious men maintaining a fair repute both heavenward and earthward oh master everard your trade of war should be feared and avoided since it converts such men into wolves towards their fellow creatures  it is a stern necessity said everard looking down and as such alone is justifiable but proceed reverend sir i see not how this storm an incident but een too frequent on both sides during the late war connects with the affair of last night  you shall hear anon said mr holdenough then paused as one who makes an effort to compose himself before continuing a relation the tenor of which agitated him with much violence in this infernal tumult he resumedfor surely nothing on earth could so much resemble hell as when men go thus loose in mortal malice on their fellowcreaturesi saw the same priest whom i had distinguished on the causeway with one or two other malignants pressed into a corner by the assailants and defending themselves to the last as those who had no hopei saw himi knew himoh colonel everard  he grasped everards hand with his own left

of baal slay mattan slay him were he between the altarsforced over the battlements but struggling for life i could see him cling to one of those projections which were formed to carry the water from the leads but they hacked at his arms and hands i heard the heavy fall into the bottomless abyss below excuse mei cannot go on  he may have escaped  oh no no nothe tower was four stories in height even those who threw themselves into the lake from the lower windows to escape by swimming had no safety for mounted troopers on the shore caught the same bloodthirsty humour which had seized the storming party galloped around the margin of the lake and shot those who were struggling for life in the water or cut them down as they strove to get to land they were all cut off and destroyedoh may the blood shed on that day remain silentoh that the earth may receive it in her recessesoh that it may be mingled for ever with the dark waters of that lake so that it may never cry for vengeance against those whose anger was fierce and who slaughtered in their wrathand oh may the erring man be forgiven who came into their assembly and lent his voice to encourage their crueltyoh albany my brother my brother i have lamented for thee even as david for jonathan   footnote michael hudson the plaindealing chaplain of king charles i resembled in his loyalty to that unfortunate monarch the fictitious character of dr rochecliffe and the circumstances of his death were copied in the narrative of the presbyterians account of the slaughter of his schoolfellowhe was chosen by charles i along with john ashburnham as his guide and attendant when he adopted the illadvised resolution of surrendering his person to the scots army  he was taken prisoner by the parliament remained long in their custody and was treated with great severity he made his escape for about a year in 1647 was retaken and again escaped in 1648 and heading an insurrection of cavaliers seized on a strong moated house in lincolnshire called woodford house he gained the place without resistance and there are among pecks desiderata curiosa several accounts of his death among which we shall transcribe that of bishop kenneth as the most correct and concisei have been on the spot saith his lordship and made all possible enquiries and find that the relation given by mr wood may be a little rectified and supplied  mr hudson and his party did not fly to woodford but had quietly taken possession of it and held it for a garrison with a good party of horse who made a stout defence and frequent sallies against a party of the parliament at stamford till the colonel commanding them sent a stronger detachment under a captain his own kinsman who was shot from the house upon which the colonel himself came up to renew the attack and to demand surrender and brought them to capitulate upon terms of safe quarter but the colonel in base revenge commanded that they should not spare that rogue hudson upon which hudson fought his way up to the leads and when he saw they were pushing in upon him threw himself over the battlements another account says he caught hold of a spout or outstone and hung by the hands as intending to fall into the moat beneath till they cut off his wrists and let him drop and then ran down to hunt him in the water where they found him paddling with his stumps and barbarously knocked him on the headpecks desiderata curiosa book ix  other accounts mention he was refused the poor charity of coming to die on land by one egborough servant to mr spinks the intruder into the parsonage a man called walker a chandler or grocer cut out the tongue of the unfortunate divine and showed it as a trophy through the country but it was remarked with vindictive satisfaction that egborough was killed by the bursting of his own gun and that walker obliged to abandon his trade through poverty became a scorned mendicant  for some time a grave was not vouchsafed to the remains of this brave and loyal divine till one of the other party said since he is dead let him be buried   the good man sobbed aloud and so much did colonel everard sympathize with his emotions that he forebore to press him upon the subject of his own curiosity until the full tide of remorseful passion had for the time abated it was however fierce and agitating the more so perhaps that indulgence in strong mental feeling of any kind was foreign to the severe and ascetic character of the man and was therefore the more overpowering when it had at once surmounted all restraints large tears flowed down the trembling features of his thin and usually stern or at least austere countenance he eagerly returned the compression of everards hand as if thankful for the sympathy which the caress implied  presently after master holdenough wiped his eyes withdrew his hand gently from that of everard shaking it kindly as they parted and proceeded with more composure forgive me this burst of passionate feeling worthy colonel i am conscious it little becomes a man of my cloth who should be the bearer of consolation to others to give way in mine own person to an extremity of grief weak at least if indeed it is not sinful for what are we that we should weep and murmur touching that which is permitted but albany was to me as a brother the happiest days of my life ere my call to mingle myself in the strife of the land had awakened me to my duties were spent in his company ibut i will make the rest of my story shorthere he drew his chair close to that of everard and spoke in a solemn and mysterious tone of voice almost lowered to a whisperi saw him last night  saw himsaw whom said everard can you mean the person whom  whom i saw so ruthlessly slaughtered said the clergymanmy ancient college friendjoseph albany  master holdenough your cloth and your character alike must prevent your jesting on such a subject as this  jesting answered holdenough i would as soon jest on my deathbedas soon jest upon the bible  but you must have been deceived answered everard hastily this tragical story necessarily often returns to your mind and in moments when the imagination overcomes the evidence of the outward senses your fancy must have presented to you an unreal appearance nothing more likely when the mind is on the stretch after something supernatural than that the imagination should supply the place with a chimera while the overexcited feelings render it difficult to dispel the delusion  colonel everard replied holdenough with austerity in discharge of my duty i must not fear the face of man and therefore i tell you plainly as i have done before with more observance that when you bring your carnal learning and judgment as it is but too much your nature to do to investigate the hidden things of another world you might as well measure with the palm of your hand the waters of the isis indeed good sir you err in this and give men too much pretence to confound your honourable name with witchadvocates freethinkers and atheists even with such as this man bletson who if the discipline of the church had its hand strengthened as it was in the beginning of the great conflict would have been long ere now cast out of the pale and delivered over to the punishment of the flesh that his spirit might if possible be yet saved  you mistake master holdenough said colonel everard i do not deny the existence of such preternatural visitations because i cannot and dare not raise the voice of my own opinion against the testimony of ages supported by such learned men as yourself nevertheless though i grant the possibility of such things i have scarce yet heard of an instance in my days so well fortified by evidence that i could at once and distinctly say this must have happened by supernatural agency and not otherwise  hear then what i have to tell said the divine on the faith of a man a christian and what is more a servant of our holy church and therefore though unworthy an elder and a teacher among christians i had taken my post yester evening in the halffurnished apartment wherein hangs a huge mirror which might have served goliath of gath to have admired himself in when clothed from head to foot in his brazen armour i the rather chose this place because they informed me it was the nearest habitable room to the gallery in which they say you had been yourself assailed that evening by the evil onewas it so i pray you  by some one with no good intentions i was assailed in that apartment so far said colonel everard you were correctly informed  well i chose my post as well as i might even as a resolved general approaches his camp and casts up his mound as nearly as he can to the besieged city and of a truth colonel everard if i felt some sensation of bodily fearfor even elias and the prophets who commanded the elements had a portion in our frail nature much more such a poor sinful being as myselfyet was my hope and my courage high and i thought of the texts which i might use not in the wicked sense of periapts or spells as the blinded papists employ them together with the sign of the cross and other fruitless forms but as nourishing and supporting that true trust and confidence in the blessed promises being the true shield of faith wherewith the fiery darts of satan may be withstood and quenched and thus armed and prepared i sate me down to read at the same time to write that i might compel my mind to attend to those subjects which became the situation in which i was placed as preventing any unlicensed excursions of the fancy and leaving no room for my imagination to brood over idle fears so i methodised and wrote down what i thought meet for the time and peradventure some hungry souls may yet profit by the food which i then prepared  it was wisely and worthily done good and reverend sir replied colonel everard i pray you to proceed  while i was thus employed sir and had been upon the matter for about three hours not yielding to weariness a strange thrilling came over my senses and the large and oldfashioned apartment seemed to wax larger more gloomy and more cavernous while the air of the night grew more cold and chill i know not if it was that the fire began to decay or whether there cometh before such things as were then about to happen a breath and atmosphere as it were of terror as job saith in a wellknown passage fear came upon me and trembling which made my bones to shake and there was a tingling noise in my ears and a dizziness in my brain so that i felt like those who call for aid when there is no danger and was even prompted to flee when i saw no one to pursue it was then that something seemed to pass behind me casting a reflection on the great mirror before which i had placed my writingtable and which i saw by assistance of the large standing light which was then in front of the glass and i looked up and i saw in the glass distinctly the appearance of a manas sure as these words issue from my mouth it was no other than the same joseph albanythe companion of my youthhe whom i had seen precipitated down the battlements of clidesbrough castle into the deep lake below  what did you do  it suddenly rushed on my mind said the divine that the stoical philosopher athenodorus had eluded the horrors of such a vision by patiently pursuing his studies and it shot at the same time across my mind that i a christian divine and a steward of the mysteries had less reason to fear evil and better matter on which to employ my thoughts than was possessed by a heathen who was blinded even by his own wisdom so instead of betraying any alarm or even turning my head around i pursued my writing but with a beating heart i admit and with a throbbing hand  if you could write at all said the colonel with such an impression on your mind you may take the head of the english army for dauntless resolution  our courage is not our own colonel said the divine and not as ours should it be vaunted of and again when you speak of this strange vision as an impression on my fancy and not a reality obvious to my senses let me tell you once more your worldly wisdom is but foolishness touching the things that are not worldly  did you not look again upon the mirror said the colonel  i did when i had copied out the comfortable text thou shalt tread down satan under thy feet  and what did you then see  the reflection of the same joseph albany said holdenough passing slowly as from behind my chairthe same in member and lineament that i had known him in his youth excepting that his cheek had the marks of the more advanced age at which he died and was very pale  what did you then  i turned from the glass and plainly saw the figure which had made the reflection in the mirror retreating towards the door not fast nor slow but with a gliding steady pace it turned again when near the door and again showed me its pale ghastly countenance before it disappeared but how it left the room whether by the door or otherwise my spirits were too much hurried to remark exactly nor have i been able by any effort of recollection distinctly to remember  this is a strange and as coming from you a most excellently wellattested apparition answered everard and yet master holdenough if the other world has been actually displayed as you apprehend and i will not dispute the possibility assure yourself there are also wicked men concerned in these machinations i myself have undergone some rencontres with visitants who possessed bodily strength and wore i am sure earthly weapons  oh doubtless doubtless replied master holdenough beelzebub loves to charge with horse and foot mingled as was the fashion of the old scottish general davie leslie he has his devils in the body as well as his devils disembodied and uses the one to support and back the other  it may be as you say reverend sir answered the colonelbut what do you advise in this case  for that i must consult with my brethren said the divine and if there be but left in our borders five ministers of the true kirk we will charge satan in full body and you shall see whether we have not power over him to resist till he shall flee from us but failing that ghostly armament against these strange and unearthly enemies truly i would recommend that as a house of witchcraft and abomination this polluted den of ancient tyranny and prostitution should be totally consumed by fire lest satan establishing his headquarters so much to his mind should find a garrison and a fastness from which he might sally forth to infest the whole neighbourhood certain it is that i would recommend to no christian soul to inhabit the mansion and if deserted it would become a place for wizards to play their pranks and witches to establish their sabbath and those who like demas go about after the wealth of this world seeking for gold and silver to practise spells and charms to the prejudice of the souls of the covetous trust me therefore it were better that it were spoiled and broken down not leaving one stone upon another  i say nay to that my good friend said the colonel for the lordgeneral hath permitted by his license my mothers brother sir henry lee and his family to return into the house of his fathers being indeed the only roof under which he hath any chance of obtaining shelter for his grey hairs  and was this done by your advice markham everard said the divine austerely  certainly it was returned the coloneland wherefore should i not exert mine influence to obtain a place of refuge for the brother of my mother  now as sure as thy soul liveth answered the presbyter i had believed this from no tongue but thine own tell me was it not this very sir henry lee who by the force of his buffcoats and his greenjerkins enforced the papist laies order to remove the altar to the eastern end of the church at woodstockand did not he swear by his beard that he would hang in the very street of woodstock whoever should deny to drink the kings healthand is not his hand red with the blood of the saintsand hath there been a ruffler in the field for prelacy and high prerogative more unmitigable or fiercer  all this may have been as you say good master holdenough answered the colonel but my uncle is now old and feeble and hath scarce a single follower remaining and his daughter is a being whom to look upon would make the sternest weep for pity a being who  who is dearer to everard said holdenough than his good name his faith to his friends his duty to his religionthis is no time to speak with sugared lips the paths in which you tread are dangerous you are striving to raise the papistical candlestick which heaven in its justice removed out of its placeto bring back to this hall of sorceries those very sinners who are bewitched with them i will not permit the land to be abused by their witchcraftsthey shall not come hither  he spoke this with vehemence and striking his stick against the ground and the colonel very much dissatisfied began to express himself haughtily in return you had better consider your power to accomplish your threats master holdenough he said before you urge them so peremptorily  and have i not the power to bind and to loose said the clergyman  it is a power little available save over those of your own church said everard with a tone something contemptuous  take heedtake heed said the divine who though an excellent was as we have elsewhere seen an irritable mando not insult me but think honourably of the messenger for the sake of him whose commission he carriesdo not i say defy mei am bound to discharge my duty were it to the displeasing of my twin brother  i can see nought your office has to do in the matter said colonel everard and i on my side give you warning not to attempt to meddle beyond your commission  rightyou hold me already to be as submissive as one of your grenadiers replied the clergyman his acute features trembling with a sense of indignity so as even to agitate his grey hair but beware sir i am not so powerless as you suppose i will invoke every true christian in woodstock to gird up his loins and resist the restoration of prelacy oppression and malignancy within our borders i will stir up the wrath of the righteous against the oppressorthe ishmaelitethe edomiteand against his race and against those who support him and encourage him to rear up his horn i will call aloud and spare not and arouse the many whose love hath waxed cold and the multitude who care for none of these things there shall be a remnant to listen to me and i will take the stick of joseph which was in the hand of ephraim and go down to cleanse this place of witches and sorcerers and of enchantments and will cry and exhort sayingwill you plead for baalwill you serve him nay take the prophets of baallet not a man escape  master holdenough master holdenough said colonel everard with much impatience by the tale yourself told me you have exhorted upon that text once too often already  the old man struck his palm forcibly against his forehead and fell back into a chair as these words were uttered as suddenly and as much without power of resistance as if the colonel had fired a pistol through his head instantly regretting the reproach which he had suffered to escape him in his impatience everard hastened to apologise and to offer every conciliatory excuse however inconsistent which occurred to him on the moment but the old man was too deeply affectedhe rejected his hand lent no ear to what he said and finally started up saying sternly you have abused my confidence sirabused it vilely to turn it into my own reproach had i been a man of the sword you dared notbut enjoy your triumph sir over an old man and your fathers friendstrike at the wound his imprudent confidence showed you  nay my worthy and excellent friend said the colonel  friend answered the old man starting upwe are foes sirfoes now and for ever  so saying and starting from the seat into which he had rather fallen than thrown himself he ran out of the room with a precipitation of step which he was apt to use upon occasions of irritable feeling and which was certainly more eager than dignified especially as he muttered while he ran and seemed as if he were keeping up his own passion by recounting over and over the offence which he had received  so said colonel everard and there was not strife enough between mine uncle and the people of woodstock already but i must needs increase it by chafing this irritable and quicktempered old man eager as i knew him to be in his ideas of churchgovernment and stiff in his prejudices respecting all who dissent from him the mob of woodstock will rise for though he would not get a score of them to stand by him in any honest or intelligible purpose yet let him cry havoc and destruction and i will warrant he has followers enow and my uncle is equally wild and unpersuadable for the value of all the estate he ever had he would not allow a score of troopers to be quartered in the house for defence and if he be alone or has but joceline to stand by him he will be as sure to fire upon those who come to attack the lodge as if he had a hundred men in garrison and then what can chance but danger and bloodshed  this progress of melancholy anticipation was interrupted by the return of master holdenough who hurrying into the room with the same precipitate pace at which he had left it ran straight up to the colonel and said take my hand markhamtake my hand hastily for the old adam is whispering at my heart that it is a disgrace to hold it extended so long  most heartily do i receive your hand my venerable friend said everard and i trust in sign of renewed amity  surely surelysaid the divine shaking his hand kindly thou hast it is true spoken bitterly but thou hast spoken truth in good time and i thinkthough your words were severewith a good and kindly purpose verily and of a truth it were sinful in me again to be hasty in provoking violence remembering that which you have upbraided me with  forgive me good master holdenough said colonel everard it was a hasty word i meant not in serious earnest to upbraid  peace i pray you peace said the divine i say the allusion to that which you have most justly upbraided me withthough the charge aroused the gall of the old man within me the inward tempter being ever on the watch to bring us to his lureought instead of being resented to have been acknowledged by me as a favour for so are the wounds of a friend termed faithful and surely i who have by one unhappy exhortation to battle and strife sent the living to the deadand i fear brought back even the dead among the livingshould now study peace and good will and reconciliation of difference leaving punishment to the great being whose laws are broken and vengeance to him who hath said i will repay it  the old mans mortified features lighted up with a humble confidence as he made this acknowledgment and colonel everard who knew the constitutional infirmities and the early prejudices of professional consequence and exclusive party opinion which he must have subdued ere arriving at such a tone of candour hastened to express his admiration of his christian charity mingled with reproaches on himself for having so deeply injured his feelings  think not of itthink not of it excellent young man said holdenough we have both erredi in suffering my zeal to outrun my charity you perhaps in pressing hard on an old and peevish man who had so lately poured out his sufferings into your friendly bosom be it all forgotten let your friends if they are not deterred by what has happened at this manor of woodstock resume their habitation as soon as they will if they can protect themselves against the powers of the air believe me that if i can prevent it by aught in my power they shall have no annoyance from earthly neighbours and assure yourself good sir that my voice is still worth something with the worthy mayor and the good aldermen and the better sort of housekeepers up yonder in the town although the lower classes are blown about with every wind of doctrine and yet farther be assured colonel that should your mothers brother or any of his family learn that they have taken up a rash bargain in returning to this unhappy and unhallowed house or should they find any qualms in their own hearts and consciences which require a ghostly comforter nehemiah holdenough will be as much at their command by night or day as if they had been bred up within the holy pale of the church in which he is an unworthy minister and neither the awe of what is fearful to be seen within these walls nor his knowledge of their blinded and carnal state as bred up under a prelatic dispensation shall prevent him doing what lies in his poor abilities for their protection and edification  i feel all the force of your kindness reverend sir said colonel everard but i do not think it likely that my uncle will give you trouble on either score he is a man much accustomed to be his own protector in temporal danger and in spiritual doubts to trust to his own prayers and those of his church  i trust i have not been superfluous in offering mine assistance said the old man something jealous that his proffered spiritual aid had been held rather intrusive i ask pardon if that is the case i humbly ask pardoni would not willingly be superfluous  the colonel hastened to appease this new alarm of the watchful jealousy of his consequence which joined with a natural heat of temper which he could not always subdue were the good mans only faults  they had regained their former friendly footing when roger wildrake returned from the hut of joceline and whispered his master that his embassy had been successful the colonel then addressed the divine and informed him that as the commissioners had already given up woodstock and as his uncle sir henry lee proposed to return to the lodge about noon he would if his reverence pleased attend him up to the borough  will you not tarry said the reverend man with something like inquisitive apprehension in his voice to welcome your relatives upon their return to this their house  no my good friend said colonel everard the part which i have taken in these unhappy broils perhaps also the mode of worship in which i have been educated have so prejudiced me in mine uncles opinion that i must be for some time a stranger to his house and family  indeed i rejoice to hear it with all my heart and soul said the divine excuse my franknessi do indeed rejoice i had thoughtno matter what i had thought i would not again give offence but truly though the maiden hath a pleasant feature and he as all men say is in human things unexceptionable yetbut i give you painin sooth i will say no more unless you ask my sincere and unprejudiced advice which you shall command but which i will not press on you superfluously wend we to the borough togetherthe pleasant solitude of the forest may dispose us to open our hearts to each other  they did walk up to the little town in company and somewhat to master holdenoughs surprise the colonel though they talked on various subjects did not request of him any ghostly advice on the subject of his love to his fair cousin while greatly beyond the expectation of the soldier the clergyman kept his word and in his own phrase was not so superfluous as to offer upon so delicate a point his unasked counsel                                         chapter the eighteenth     then are the harpies goneyet ere we perch   where such foul birds have roosted let us cleanse   the foul obscenity theyve left behind them    agamemnon  the embassy of wildrake had been successful chiefly through the mediation of the episcopal divine whom we formerly found acting in the character of a chaplain to the family and whose voice had great influence on many accounts with its master  a little before high noon sir henry lee with his small household were again in unchallenged possession of their old apartments at the lodge of woodstock and the combined exertions of joceline joliffe of phoebe and of old joan were employed in putting to rights what the late intruders had left in great disorder  sir henry lee had like all persons of quality of that period a love of order amounting to precision and felt like a fine lady whose dress has been disordered in a crowd insulted and humiliated by the rude confusion into which his household goods had been thrown and impatient till his mansion was purified from all marks of intrusion in his anger he uttered more orders than the limited number of his domestics were likely to find time or hands to execute the villains have left such sulphureous steams behind them too said the old knight as if old davie leslie and the whole scottish army had quartered among them  it may be near as bad said joceline for men say for certain it was the devil came down bodily among them and made them troop off  then said the knight is the prince of darkness a gentleman as old will shakspeare says he never interferes with those of his own coat for the lees have been here father and son these five hundred years without disquiet and no sooner came these misbegotten churls than he plays his own part among them  well one thing he and they have left us said joliffe which we may thank them for and that is such a wellfilled larder and buttery as has been seldom seen in woodstock lodge this many a day carcasses of mutton large rounds of beef barrels of confectioners ware pipes and runlets of sack muscadine ale and what not we shall have a royal time ont through half the winter and joan must get to salting and pickling presently  out villain said the knight are we to feed on the fragments of such scum of the earth as these cast them forth instantly nay checking himself that were a sin but give them to the poor or see them sent to the owners and hark ye i will none of their strong liquors i would rather drink like a hermit all my life than seem to pledge such scoundrels as these in their leavings like a miserable drawer who drains off the ends of the bottles after the guests have paid their reckoning and gone off and hark ye i will taste no water from the cistern out of which these slaves have been serving themselvesfetch me down a pitcher from rosamonds spring  alice heard this injunction and well guessing there was enough for the other members of the family to do she quietly took a small pitcher and flinging a cloak around her walked out in person to procure sir henry the water which he desired meantime joceline said with some hesitation that a man still remained belonging to the party of these strangers who was directing about the removal of some trunks and mails which belonged to the commissioners and who could receive his honours commands about the provisions  let him come hither the dialogue was held in the hall why do you hesitate and drumble in that manner  only sir said joceline only perhaps your honour might not wish to see him being the same who not long since  he paused  sent my rapier ahawking through the firmament thou wouldst say why when did i take spleen at a man for standing his ground against me roundhead as he is man i like him the better of that not the worse i hunger and thirst to have another turn with him i have thought on his passado ever since and i believe were it to try again i know a feat would control it fetch him directly  trusty tomkins was presently ushered in bearing himself with an iron gravity which neither the terrors of the preceding night nor the dignified demeanour of the highborn personage before whom he stood were able for an instant to overcome  how now good fellow said sir henry i would fain see something more of thy fence which baffled me the other evening but truly i think the light was somewhat too faint for my old eyes take a foil mani walk here in the hall as hamlet says and tis the breathingtime of day with me take a foil then in thy hand  since it is your worships desire said the steward letting fall his long cloak and taking the foil in his hand  now said the knight if your fitness speaks mine is ready methinks the very stepping on this same old pavement hath charmed away the gout which threatened me sasai tread as firm as a gamecock  they began the play with great spirit and whether the old knight really fought more coolly with the blunt than with the sharp weapon or whether the steward gave him some grains of advantage in this merely sportive encounter it is certain sir henry had the better in the assault his success put him into excellent humour  there said he i found your tricknay you cheat me not twice the same way there was a very palpable hit why had i had but light enough the other nightbut it skills not speaking of ithere we leave off i must not fight as we unwise cavaliers did with you roundhead rascals beating you so often that we taught you to beat us at last and good now tell me why you are leaving your larder so full here do you think i or my family can use broken victuals what have you no better employment for your rounds of sequestrated beef than to leave them behind you when you shift your quarters  so please your honour said tomkins it may be that you desire not the flesh of beeves of rams or of goats nevertheless when you know that the provisions were provided and paid for out of your own rents and stock at ditchley sequestrated to the use of the state more than a year since it may be you will have less scruple to use them for your own behoof  rest assured that i shall said sir henry and glad you have helped me to a share of mine own certainly i was an ass to suspect your masters of subsisting save at honest mens expense  and as for the rumps of beeves continued tomkins with the same solemnity there is a rump at westminster which will stand us of the army much hacking and hewing yet ere it is discussed to our mind  sir henry paused as if to consider what was the meaning of this innuendo for he was not a person of very quick apprehension but having at length caught the meaning of it he burst into an explosion of louder laughter than joceline had seen him indulge in for a long while  right knave he said i taste thy jestit is the very moral of the puppetshow faustus raised the devil as the parliament raised the army and then as the devil flies away with faustus so will the army fly away with the parliament or the rump as thou callst it or sitting part of the socalled parliament and then look you friend the very devil of all hath my willing consent to fly away with the army in its turn from the highest general down to the lowest drumboy nay never look fierce for the matter remember there is daylight enough now for a game at sharps  trusty tomkins appeared to think it best to suppress his displeasure and observing that the wains were ready to transport the commissioners property to the borough took a grave leave of sir henry lee  meantime the old man continued to pace his recovered hall rubbing his hands and evincing greater signs of glee than he had shown since the fatal 30th of january  here we are again in the old frank joliffe well victualled too how the knave solved my point of consciencethe dullest of them is a special casuist where the question concerns profit look out if there are not some of our own ragged regiment lurking about to whom a bellyful would be a godsend joceline then his fence joceline though the fellow foins well very sufficient well but thou sawst how i dealt with him when i had fitting light joceline  ay and so your honour did said joceline you taught him to know the duke of norfolk from saunders gardner ill warrant him he will not wish to come under your honours thumb again  why i am waxing old said sir henry but skill will not rust through age though sinews must stiffen but my age is like a lusty winter as old will says frosty but kindly and what if old as we are we live to see better days yet i promise thee joceline i love this jarring betwixt the rogues of the board and the rogues of the sword when thieves quarrel true men have a chance of coming by their own  thus triumphed the old cavalier in the treble glory of having recovered his dwellingregained as he thought his character as a man of fence and finally discovered some prospect of a change of times in which he was not without hopes that something might turn up for the royal interest  meanwhile alice with a prouder and a lighter heart than had danced in her bosom for several days went forth with a gaiety to which she of late had been a stranger to contribute her assistance to the regulation and supply of the household by bringing the fresh water wanted from fair rosamonds well  perhaps she remembered that when she was but a girl her cousin markham used among others to make her perform that duty as presenting the character of some captive trojan princess condemned by her situation to draw the waters from some grecian spring for the use of the proud victor at any rate she certainly joyed to see her father reinstated in his ancient habitation and the joy was not the less sincere that she knew their return to woodstock had been procured by means of her cousin and that even in her fathers prejudiced eyes everard had been in some degree exculpated of the accusations the old knight had brought against him and that if a reconciliation had not yet taken place the preliminaries had been established on which such a desirable conclusion might easily be founded it was like the commencement of a bridge when the foundation is securely laid and the piers raised above the influence of the torrent the throwing of the arches may be accomplished in a subsequent season  the doubtful fate of her only brother might have clouded even this momentary gleam of sunshine but alice had been bred up during the close and frequent contest of civil war and had acquired the habit of hoping in behalf of those dear to her until hope was lost in the present case all reports seemed to assure her of her brothers safety  besides these causes for gaiety alice lee had the pleasing feeling that she was restored to the habitation and the haunts of her childhood from which she had not departed without much pain the more felt perhaps because suppressed in order to avoid irritating her fathers sense of his misfortune finally she enjoyed for the instant the gleam of selfsatisfaction by which we see the young and welldisposed so often animated when they can be in common phrase helpful to those whom they love and perform at the moment of need some of those little domestic tasks which age receives with so much pleasure from the dutiful hands of youth so that altogether as she hasted through the remains and vestiges of a wilderness already mentioned and from thence about a bowshot into the park to bring a pitcher of water from rosamonds spring alice lee her features enlivened and her complexion a little raised by the exercise had for the moment regained the gay and brilliant vivacity of expression which had been the characteristic of her beauty in her earlier and happier days  this fountain of old memory had been once adorned with architectural ornaments in the style of the sixteenth century chiefly relating to ancient mythology all these were now wasted and overthrown and existed only as mosscovered ruins while the living spring continued to furnish its daily treasures unrivalled in purity though the quantity was small gushing out amid disjointed stones and bubbling through fragments of ancient sculpture  with a light step and laughing brow the young lady of lee was approaching the fountain usually so solitary when she paused on beholding some one seated beside it she proceeded however with confidence though with a step something less gay when she observed that the person was a female some menial perhaps from the town whom a fanciful mistress occasionally dispatched for the water of a spring supposed to be peculiarly pure or some aged woman who made a little trade by carrying it to the better sort of families and selling it for a trifle there was no cause therefore for apprehension  yet the terrors of the times were so great that alice did not see a stranger even of her own sex without some apprehension denaturalized women had as usual followed the camps of both armies during the civil war who on the one side with open profligacy and profanity on the other with the fraudful tone of fanaticism or hypocrisy exercised nearly in like degree their talents for murder or plunder but it was broad daylight the distance from the lodge was but trifling and though a little alarmed at seeing a stranger where she expected deep solitude the daughter of the haughty old knight had too much of the lion about her to fear without some determined and decided cause  alice walked therefore gravely on toward the fount and composed her looks as she took a hasty glance of the female who was seated there and addressed herself to her task of filling her pitcher  the woman whose presence had surprised and somewhat startled alice lee was a person of the lower rank whose red cloak russet kirtle handkerchief trimmed with coventry blue and a coarse steeple hat could not indicate at best any thing higher than the wife of a small farmer or perhaps the helpmate of a bailiff or hind it was well if she proved nothing worse her clothes indeed were of good materials but what the female eye discerns with half a glance they were indifferently adjusted and put on this looked as if they did not belong to the person by whom they were worn but were articles of which she had become the mistress by some accident if not by some successful robbery her size too as did not escape alice even in the short perusal she afforded the stranger was unusual her features swarthy and singularly harsh and her manner altogether unpropitious the young lady almost wished as she stooped to fill her pitcher that she had rather turned back and sent joceline on the errand but repentance was too late now and she had only to disguise as well as she could her unpleasant feelings  the blessings of this bright day to one as bright as it is said the stranger with no unfriendly though a harsh voice  i thank you said alice in reply and continued to fill her pitcher busily by assistance of an iron bowl which remained still chained to one of the stones beside the fountain  perhaps my pretty maiden if you would accept my help your work would be sooner done said the stranger  i thank you said alice but had i needed assistance i could have brought those with me who had rendered it  i do not doubt of that my pretty maiden answered the female there are too many lads in woodstock with eyes in their headsno doubt you could have brought with you any one of them who looked on you if you had listed  alice replied not a syllable for she did not like the freedom used by the speaker and was desirous to break off the conversation  are you offended my pretty mistress said the stranger that was far from my purposei will put my question otherwiseare the good dames of woodstock so careless of their pretty daughters as to let the flower of them all wander about the wild chase without a mother or a somebody to prevent the fox from running away with the lambthat carelessness methinks shows small kindness  content yourself good woman i am not far from protection and assistance said alice who liked less and less the effrontery of her new acquaintance  alas my pretty maiden said the stranger patting with her large and hard hand the head which alice had kept bended down towards the water which she was laving it would be difficult to hear such a pipe as yours at the town of woodstock scream as loud as you would  alice shook the womans hand angrily off took up her pitcher though not above half full and as she saw the stranger rise at the same time said not without fear doubtless but with a natural feeling of resentment and dignity i have no reason to make my cries heard as far as woodstock were there occasion for my crying for help at all it is nearer at hand  she spoke not without a warrant for at the moment broke through the bushes and stood by her side the noble hound bevis fixing on the stranger his eyes that glanced fire raising every hair on his gallant mane as upright as the bristles of a wild boar when hard pressed grinning till a case of teeth which would have matched those of any wolf in russia were displayed in full array and without either barking or springing seeming by his low determined growl to await but the signal for dashing at the female whom he plainly considered as a suspicious person  but the stranger was undaunted my pretty maiden she said you have indeed a formidable guardian there where cockneys or bumpkins are concerned but we who have been at the wars know spells for taming such furious dragons and therefore let not your fourfooted protector go loose on me for he is a noble animal and nothing but selfdefence would induce me to do him injury so saying she drew a pistol from her bosom and cocked itpointing it towards the dog as if apprehensive that he would spring upon her  hold woman hold said alice lee the dog will not do you harmdown bevis couch downand ere you attempt to hurt him know he is the favourite hound of sir henry lee of ditchley the keeper of woodstock park who would severely revenge any injury offered to him  and you pretty one are the old knights housekeeper doubtless i have often heard the lees have good taste  i am his daughter good woman  his daughteri was blindbut yet it is true nothing less perfect could answer the description which all the world has given of mistress alice lee i trust that my folly has given my young mistress no offence and that she will allow me in token of reconciliation to fill her pitcher and carry it as far as she will permit  as you will good mother but i am about to return instantly to the lodge to which in these times i cannot admit strangers you can follow me no farther than the verge of the wilderness and i am already too long from home i will send some one to meet and relieve you of the pitcher so saying she turned her back with a feeling of terror which she could hardly account for and began to walk quickly towards the lodge thinking thus to get rid of her troublesome acquaintance  but she reckoned without her host for in a moment her new companion was by her side not running indeed but walking with prodigious long unwomanly strides which soon brought her up with the hurried and timid steps of the frightened maiden but her manner was more respectful than formerly though her voice sounded remarkably harsh and disagreeable and her whole appearance suggested an undefined yet irresistible feeling of apprehension  pardon a stranger lovely mistress alice said her persecutor that was not capable of distinguishing between a lady of your high quality and a peasant wench and who spoke to you with a degree of freedom illbefitting your rank certainly and condition and which i fear has given you offence  no offence whatever replied alice but good woman i am near home and can excuse your farther companyyou are unknown to me  but it follows not said the stranger that your fortunes may not be known to me fair mistress alice look on my swarthy browengland breeds none suchand in the lands from which i come the sun which blackens our complexion pours to make amends rays of knowledge into our brains which are denied to those of your lukewarm climate let me look upon your pretty handattempting to possess herself of itand i promise you you shall hear what will please you  i hear what does not please me said alice with dignity you must carry your tricks of fortunetelling and palmistry to the women of the villagewe of the gentry hold them to be either imposture or unlawful knowledge  yet you would fain hear of a certain colonel i warrant you whom certain unhappy circumstances have separated from his family you would give better than silver if i could assure you that you would see him in a day or twoay perhaps sooner  i know nothing of what you speak good woman if you want alms there is a piece of silverit is all i have in my purse  it were pity that i should take it said the female and yet give it mefor the princess in the fairy tale must ever deserve by her generosity the bounty of the benevolent fairy before she is rewarded by her protection  take ittake itgive me my pitcher said alice and begoneyonder comes one of my fathers servantswhat hojocelinejoceline  the old fortuneteller hastily dropped something into the pitcher as she restored it to alice lee and plying her long limbs disappeared speedily under cover of the wood  bevis turned and barked and showed some inclination to harass the retreat of this suspicious person yet as if uncertain ran towards joliffe and fawned on him as to demand his advice and encouragement joceline pacified the animal and coming up to his young lady asked her with surprise what was the matter and whether she had been frightened alice made light of her alarm for which indeed she could not have assigned any very competent reason for the manners of the woman though bold and intrusive were not menacing she only said she had met a fortuneteller by rosamonds well and had had some difficulty in shaking her off  ah the gipsy thief said joceline how well she scented there was food in the pantrythey have noses like ravens these strollers look you mistress alice you shall not see a raven or a carrioncrow in all the blue sky for a mile round you but let a sheep drop suddenly down on the greensward and before the poor creatures dead you shall see a dozen of such guests croaking as if inviting each other to the banquetjust so it is with these sturdy beggars you will see few enough of them when theres nothing to give but when houghs in the pot they will have share ont  you are so proud of your fresh supply of provender said alice that you suspect all of a design ont i do not think this woman will venture near your kitchen joceline  it will be best for her health said joceline lest i give her a ducking for digestionbut give me the pitcher mistress alicemeeter i bear it than youhow now what jingles at the bottom have you lifted the pebbles as well as the water  i think the woman dropped something into the pitcher said alice  nay we must look to that for it is like to be a charm and we have enough of the devils ware about woodstock alreadywe will not spare for the wateri can run back and fill the pitcher he poured out the water upon the grass and at the bottom of the pitcher was found a gold ring in which was set a ruby apparently of some value  nay if this be not enchantment i know not what is said joceline truly mistress alice i think you had better throw away this gimcrack such gifts from such hands are a kind of pressmoney which the devil uses for enlisting his regiment of witches and if they take but so much as a bean from him they become his bondslaves for lifeay you look at the gewgaw but tomorrow you will find a lead ring and a common pebble in its stead  nay joceline i think it will be better to find out that darkcomplexioned woman and return to her what seems of some value so cause enquiry to be made and be sure you return her ring it seems too valuable to be destroyed  umph that is always the way with women murmured joceline you will never get the best of them but she is willing to save a bit of finerywell mistress alice i trust that you are too young and too pretty to be enlisted in a regiment of witches  i shall not be afraid of it till you turn conjuror said alice so hasten to the well where you are like still to find the woman and let her know that alice lee desires none of her gifts any more than she did of her society  so saying the young lady pursued her way to the lodge while joceline went down to rosamonds well to execute her commission but the fortuneteller or whoever she might be was nowhere to be found neither finding that to be the case did joceline give himself much trouble in tracking her farther  if this ring which i dare say the jade stole somewhere said the underkeeper to himself be worth a few nobles it is better in honest hands than in that of vagabonds my master has a right to all waifs and strays and certainly such a ring in possession of a gipsy must be a waif so i shall confiscate it without scruple and apply the produce to the support of sir henrys household which is like to be poor enough thank heaven my military experience has taught me how to carry hooks at my fingerendsthat is troopers law yet hang it after all i had best take it to mark everard and ask his advicei hold him now to be your learned counsellor in law where mistress alices affairs are concerned and my learned doctor who shall be nameless for such as concern church and state and sir henry leeand ill give them leave to give mine umbles to the kites and ravens if they find me conferring my confidence where it is not safe                                         chapter the nineteenth     being skilless in these parts which to a stranger   unguided and unfriended often prove   rough and inhospitable    twelfth night  there was a little attempt at preparation now that the dinner hour was arrived which showed that in the opinion of his few but faithful domestics the good knight had returned in triumph to his home  the great tankard exhibiting in basrelief the figure of michael subduing the archenemy was placed on the table and joceline and phoebe dutifully attended the one behind the chair of sir henry the other to wait upon her young mistress and both to make out by formal and regular observance the want of a more numerous train  a health to king charles said the old knight handing the massive tankard to his daughter drink it my love though it be rebel ale which they have left us i will pledge thee for the toast will excuse the liquor had noll himself brewed it  the young lady touched the goblet with her lip and returned it to her father who took a copious draught  i will not say blessing on their hearts said he though i must own they drank good ale  no wonder sir they come lightly by the malt and need not spare it said joceline  sayst thou said the knight thou shalt finish the tankard thyself for that very jests sake  nor was his follower slow in doing reason to the royal pledge he bowed and replaced the tankard saying after a triumphant glance at the sculpture i had a gibe with that same redcoat about the saint michael just now  redcoatha what redcoat said the hasty old man do any of these knaves still lurk about woodstockquoit him down stairs instantly jocelineknow we not galloway nags  so please you he is in some charge here and will speedily be goneit is hehe who had a rencontre with your honour in the wood  ay but i paid him off for it in the hall as you yourself sawi was never in better fence in my life joceline that same steward fellow is not so utterly blackhearted a rogue as the most of them joceline he fences wellexcellent well i will have thee try a bout in the hall with him tomorrow though i think he will be too hard for thee i know thy strength to an inch  he might say this with some truth for it was jocelines fashion when called on as sometimes happened to fence with his patron just to put forth as much of his strength and skill as obliged the knight to contend hard for the victory which in the long run he always contrived to yield up to him like a discreet servingman  and what said this roundheaded steward of our great saint michaels standing cup  marry he scoffed at our good saint and said he was little better than one of the golden calves of bethel but i told him he should not talk so until one of their own roundheaded saints had given the devil as complete a crossbuttock as saint michael had given him as tis carved upon the cup there i trow that made him silent enough and then he would know whether your honour and mistress alice not to mention old joan and myself since it is your honours pleasure i should take my bed here were not afraid to sleep in a house that had been so much disturbed but i told him we feared no fiends or goblins having the prayers of the church read every evening  joceline said alice interrupting him wert thou mad you know at what risk to ourselves and the good doctor the performance of that duty takes place  oh mistress alice said joceline a little abashed you may be sure i spoke not a word of the doctorno noi did not let him into the secret that we had such a reverend chaplaini think i know the length of this mans foot we have had a jollification or so together he is hand and glove with me for as great a fanatic as he is  trust him not too far said the knight nay i fear thou hast been imprudent already and that it will be unsafe for the good man to come here after nightfall as is proposed these independents have noses like bloodhounds and can smell out a loyalist under any disguise  if your honour thinks so said joceline ill watch for the doctor with good will and bring him into the lodge by the old condemned postern and so up to this apartment and sure this man tomkins would never presume to come hither and the doctor may have a bed in woodstock lodge and he never the wiser or if your honour does not think that safe i can cut his throat for you and i would not mind it a pin  god forbid said the knight he is under our roof and a guest though not an invited onego joceline it shall be thy penance for having given thy tongue too much license to watch for the good doctor and to take care of his safety while he continues with us an october night or two in the forest would finish the good man  hes more like to finish our october than our october is to finish him said the keeper and withdrew under the encouraging smile of his patron  he whistled bevis along with him to share in his watch and having received exact information where the clergyman was most likely to be found assured his master that he would give the most pointed attention to his safety when the attendants had withdrawn having previously removed the remains of the meal the old knight leaning back in his chair encouraged pleasanter visions than had of late passed through his imagination until by degrees he was surprised by actual slumber while his daughter not venturing to move but on tiptoe took some needlework and bringing it close by the old mans side employed her fingers on this task bending her eyes from time to time on her parent with the affectionate zeal if not the effective power of a guardian angel at length as the light faded away and night came on she was about to order candles to be brought but remembering how indifferent a couch jocelines cottage had afforded she could not think of interrupting the first sound and refreshing sleep which her father had enjoyed in all probability for the last two nights and days  she herself had no other amusement as she sat facing one of the great oriel windows the same by which wildrake had on a former occasion looked in upon tomkins and joceline while at their compotations than watching the clouds which a lazy wind sometimes chased from the broad disk of the harvestmoon sometimes permitted to accumulate and exclude her brightness there is i know not why something peculiarly pleasing to the imagination in contemplating the queen of night when she is wading as the expression is among the vapours which she has not power to dispel and which on their side are unable entirely to quench her lustre it is the striking image of patient virtue calmly pursuing her path through good report and bad report having that excellence in herself which ought to command all admiration but bedimmed in the eyes of the world by suffering by misfortune by calumny  as some such reflections perhaps were passing through alices imagination she became sensible to her surprise and alarm that some one had clambered up upon the window and was looking into the room the idea of supernatural fear did not in the slightest degree agitate alice she was too much accustomed to the place and situation for folk do not see spectres in the scenes with which they have been familiar from infancy but danger from maurauders in a disturbed country was a more formidable subject of apprehension and the thought armed alice who was naturally high spirited with such desperate courage that she snatched a pistol from the wall on which some firearms hung and while she screamed to her father to awake had the presence of mind to present it at the intruder she did so the more readily because she imagined she recognised in the visage which she partially saw the features of the woman whom she had met with at rosamonds well and which had appeared to her peculiarly harsh and suspicious her father at the same time seized his sword and came forward while the person at the window alarmed at these demonstrations and endeavouring to descend missed footing as had cavaliero wildrake before and went down to the earth with no small noise nor was the reception on the bosom of our common mother either soft or safe for by a most terrific bark and growl they heard that bevis had come up and seized on the party ere he or she could gain their feet  hold fast but worry not said the old knightalice thou art the queen of wenches stand fast here till i run down and secure the rascal  for gods sake no my dearest father alice exclaimed joceline will be up immediatelyharki hear him  there was indeed a bustle below and more than one light danced to and fro in confusion while those who bore them called to each other yet suppressing their voices as they spoke as men who would only be heard by those they addressed the individual who had fallen under the power of bevis was most impatient in his situation and called with least precautionhere leeforestertake the dog off else i must shoot him  if thou dost said sir henry from the window i blow thy brains out on the spot thieves joceline thieves come up and secure this ruffianbevis hold on  back bevis down sir cried joceline i am coming i am coming sir henrysaint michael i shall go distracted  a terrible thought suddenly occurred to alice could joceline have become unfaithful that he was calling bevis off the villain instead of encouraging the trusty dog to secure him her father meantime moved perhaps by some suspicion of the same kind hastily stepped aside out of the moonlight and pulled alice close to him so as to be invisible from without yet so placed as to hear what should pass the scuffle between bevis and his prisoner seemed to be ended by jocelines interference and there was close whispering for an instant as of people in consultation  all is quiet now said one voice i will up and prepare the way for you and immediately a form presented itself on the outside of the window pushed open the lattice and sprung into the parlour but almost ere his step was upon the floor certainly before he had obtained any secure footing the old knight who stood ready with his rapier drawn made a desperate pass which bore the intruder to the ground joceline who clambered up next with a dark lantern in his hand uttered a dreadful exclamation when he saw what had happened crying out lord in heaven he has slain his own son  no noi tell you no said the fallen young man who was indeed young albert lee the only son of the old knight i am not hurt no noise on your lives get lights instantly at the same time he started from the floor as quickly as he could under the embarrassment of a cloak and doublet skewered as it were together by the rapier of the old knight whose pass most fortunately had been diverted from the body of albert by the interruption of his cloak the blade passing right across his back piercing the clothes while the hilt coming against his side with the whole force of the lunge had borne him to the ground  joceline all the while enjoined silence to every one under the strictest conjurations silence as you would long live on earthsilence as ye would have a place in heaven be but silent for a few minutesall our lives depend on it  meantime he procured lights with inexpressible dispatch and they then beheld that sir henry on hearing the fatal words had sunk back on one of the large chairs without either motion colour or sign of life  oh brother how could you come in this manner said alice  ask no questionsgood god for what am i reserved he gazed on his father as he spoke who with claycold features rigidly fixed and his arms extended in the most absolute helplessness looked rather the image of death upon a monument than a being in whom existence was only suspended was my life spared said albert raising his hands with a wild gesture to heaven only to witness such a sight as this  we suffer what heaven permits young man we endure our lives while heaven continues them let me approach the same clergyman who had read the prayers at jocelines hut now came forward get water he said instantly and the helpful hand and light foot of alice with the readywitted tenderness which never stagnates in vain lamentations while there is any room for hope provided with incredible celerity all that the clergyman called for  it is but a swoon he said on feeling sir henrys palm a swoon produced from the instant and unexpected shock rouse thee up albert i promise thee it will be nothing save a syncopea cup my dearest alice and a ribbon or a bandage i must take some bloodsome aromatics too if they can be had my good alice  but while alice procured the cup and bandage stripped her fathers sleeve and seemed by intuition even to anticipate every direction of the reverend doctor her brother hearing no word and seeing no sign of comfort stood with both hands clasped and elevated into the air a monument of speechless despair every feature in his face seemed to express the thought here lies my fathers corpse and it is i whose rashness has slain him  but when a few drops of blood began to follow the lancetat first falling singly and then trickling in a freer streamwhen in consequence of the application of cold water to the temples and aromatics to the nostrils the old man sighed feebly and made an effort to move his limbs albert lee changed his posture at once to throw himself at the feet of the clergyman and kiss if he would have permitted him his shoes and the hem of his raiment  rise foolish youth said the good man with a reproving tone must it be always thus with you kneel to heaven not to the feeblest of its agents you have been saved once again from great danger would you deserve heavens bounty remember you have been preserved for other purposes than you now think on begone you and jocelineyou have a duty to discharge and be assured it will go better with your fathers recovery that he see you not for a few minutes downdown to the wilderness and bring in your attendant  thanks thanks a thousand thanks answered albert lee and springing through the lattice he disappeared as unexpectedly as he had entered at the same time joceline followed him and by the same road  alice whose fears for her father were now something abated upon this new movement among the persons of the scene could not resist appealing to her venerable assistant good doctor answer me but one question was my brother albert here just now or have i dreamed all that has happened for these ten minutes past methinks but for your presence i could suppose the whole had passed in my sleep that horrible thrustthat deathlike corpselike old manthat soldier in mute despair i must indeed have dreamed  if you have dreamed my sweet alice said the doctor i wish every sicknurse had your property since you have been attending to our patient better during your sleep than most of these old dormice can do when they are most awake but your dream came through the gate of horn my pretty darling which you must remind me to explain to you at leisure albert has really been here and will be here again  albert repeated sir henry who names my son  it is i my kind patron said the doctor permit me to bind up your arm  my woundwith all my heart doctor said sir henry raising himself and gathering his recollection by degrees i knew of old thou wert bodycurer as well as soulcurer and served my regiment for surgeon as well as chaplainbut where is the rascal i killedi never made a fairer stramaçon in my life the shell of my rapier struck against his ribs so dead he must be or my right hand has forgot its cunning  nobody was slain said the doctor we must thank god for that since there were none but friends to slay here is a good cloak and doublet though wounded in a fashion which will require some skill in tailorcraft to cure but i was your last antagonist and took a little blood from you merely to prepare you for the pleasure and surprise of seeing your son who though hunted pretty close as you may believe hath made his way from worcester hither where with jocelines assistance we will care well enough for his safety it was even for this reason that i pressed you to accept of your nephews proposal to return to the old lodge where a hundred men might be concealed though a thousand were making search to discover them never such a place for hideandseek as i shall make good when i can find means to publish my wonders of woodstock  but my sonmy dear son said the knight shall i not then instantly see him and wherefore did you not forewarn me of this joyful event  because i was uncertain of his motions said the doctor and rather thought he was bound for the seaside and that it would be best to tell you of his fate when he was safe on board and in full sail for france we had appointed to let you know all when i came hither tonight to join you but there is a redcoat in the house whom we care not to trust farther than we could not help we dared not therefore venture in by the hall and so prowling round the building albert informed us that an old prank of his when a boy consisted of entering by this window a lad who was with us would needs make the experiment as there seemed to be no light in the chamber and the moonlight without made us liable to be detected his foot slipped and our friend bevis came upon us  in good truth you acted simply said sir henry to attack a garrison without a summons but all this is nothing to my son albertwhere is helet me see him  but sir henry wait said the doctor till your restored strength  a plague of my restored strength man answered the knight as his old spirit began to awaken within himdost not remember that i lay on edgehillfield all night bleeding like a bullock from five several wounds and wore my armour within six weeks and you talk to me of the few drops of blood that follow such a scratch as a cats claw might have made  nay if you feel so courageous said the doctor i will fetch your sonhe is not far distant  so saying he left the apartment making a sign to alice to remain in case any symptoms of her fathers weakness should return  it was fortunate perhaps that sir henry never seemed to recollect the precise nature of the alarm which had at once and effectually as the shock of the thunderbolt for the moment suspended his faculties something he said more than once of being certain he had done mischief with that stramaçon as he called it but his mind did not recur to that danger as having been incurred by his son alice glad to see that her father appeared to have forgotten a circumstance so fearful as men often forget the blow or other sudden cause which has thrown them into a swoon readily excused herself from throwing much light on the matter by pleading the general confusion and in a few minutes albert cut off all farther enquiry by entering the room followed by the doctor and throwing himself alternately into the arms of his father and of his sister                                         chapter the twentieth     the boy ishark ye sirrahwhats your name   oh jacobay i recollectthe same    crabbe  the affectionate relatives were united as those who meeting under great adversity feel still the happiness of sharing it in common they embraced again and again and gave way to those expansions of the heart which at once express and relieve the pressure of mental agitation at length the tide of emotion began to subside and sir henry still holding his recovered son by the hand resumed the command of his feelings which he usually practised  so you have seen the last of our battles albert he said and the kings colours have fallen for ever before the rebels  it is but even so said the young manthe last cast of the die was thrown and alas lost at worcester and cromwells fortune carried it there as it has wherever he has shown himself  wellit can but be for a timeit can but be for a time answered his father the devil is potent they say in raising and gratifying favourites but he can grant but short leasesand the kingthe king albertthe kingin my earclose close  our last news were confident that he had escaped from bristol  thank god for thatthank god for that said the knight where didst thou leave him  our men were almost all cut to pieces at the bridge albert replied but i followed his majesty with about five hundred other officers and gentlemen who were resolved to die around him until as our numbers and appearance drew the whole pursuit after us it pleased his majesty to dismiss us with many thanks and words of comfort to us in general and some kind expressions to most of us in especial he sent his royal greeting to you sir in particular and said more than becomes me to repeat  nay i will hear it every word boy said sir henry is not the certainty that thou hast discharged thy duty and that king charles owns it enough to console me for all we have lost and suffered and wouldst thou stint me of it from a false shamefacednessi will have it out of thee were it drawn from thee with cords  it shall need no such compulsion said the young manit was his majestys pleasure to bid me tell sir henry lee in his name that if his son could not go before his father in the race of loyalty he was at least following him closely and would soon move side by side  said he so answered the knightold victor lee will look down with pride on thee albertbut i forgetyou must be weary and hungry  even so said albert but these are things which of late i have been in the habit of enduring for safetys sake  jocelinewhat ho joceline  the underkeeper entered and received orders to get supper prepared directly  my son and dr rochecliffe are half starving said the knight and there is a lad too below said joceline a page he says of colonel alberts whose belly rings cupboard too and that to no common tune for i think he could eat a horse as the yorkshireman says behind the saddle he had better eat at the sideboard for he has devoured a whole loaf of bread and butter as fast as phoebe could cut it and it has not staid his stomach for a minuteand truly i think you had better keep him under your own eyes for the steward beneath might ask him troublesome questions if he went belowand then he is impatient as all your gentlemen pages are and is saucy among the women  whom is it he talks ofwhat page hast thou got albert that bears himself so ill said sir henry  the son of a dear friend a noble lord of scotland who followed the great montroses bannerafterwards joined the king in scotland and came with him as far as worcester he was wounded the day before the battle and conjured me to take this youth under my charge which i did something unwillingly but i could not refuse a father perhaps on his deathbed pleading for the safety of an only son  thou hadst deserved an halter hadst thou hesitated said sir henry the smallest tree can always give some shelterand it pleases me to think the old stock of lee is not so totally prostrate but it may yet be a refuge for the distressed fetch the youth inhe is of noble blood and these are no times of ceremonyhe shall sit with us at the same table page though he be and if you have not schooled him handsomely in his manners he may not be the worse of some lessons from me  you will excuse his national drawling accent sir said albert though i know you like it not  i have small cause albert answered the knightsmall causewho stirred up these disunionsthe scots who strengthened the hands of parliament when their cause was well nigh ruinedthe scots again who delivered up the king their countryman who had flung himself upon their protectionthe scots again but this lads father you say has fought on the part of the noble montrose and such a man as the great marquis may make amends for the degeneracy of a whole nation  nay father said albert and i must add that though this lad is uncouth and wayward and as you will see something wilful yet the king has not a more zealous friend in england and when occasion offered he fought stoutly too in his defencei marvel he comes not  he hath taken the bath said joceline and nothing less would serve than that he should have it immediatelythe supper he said might be got ready in the meantime and he commands all about him as if he were in his fathers old castle where he might have called long enough i warrant without any one to hear him  indeed said sir henry this must be a forward chick of the game to crow so earlywhat is his name  his nameit escapes me every hour it is so hard a one said albertkerneguy is his namelouis kerneguy his father was lord killstewers of kincardineshire  kerneguy and killstewers and kinwhat dye call ittruly said the knight these northern mens names and titles smack of their originthey sound like a northwest wind rumbling and roaring among heather and rocks  it is but the asperities of the celtic and saxon dialects said dr rochecliffe which according to verstegan still linger in those northern parts of the islandbut peacehere comes supper and master louis kerneguy  supper entered accordingly borne in by joceline and phoebe and after it leaning on a huge knotty stick and having his nose in the air like a questing houndfor his attention was apparently more fixed on the good provisions that went before him than any thing elsecame master kerneguy and seated himself without much ceremony at the lower end of the table  he was a tall rawboned lad with a shock head of hair fiery red like many of his country while the harshness of his national features was increased by the contrast of his complexion turned almost black by the exposure to all sorts of weather which in that skulking and rambling mode of life the fugitive royalists had been obliged to encounter his address was by no means prepossessing being a mixture of awkwardness and forwardness and showing in a remarkable degree how a want of easy address may be consistent with an admirable stock of assurance his face intimated having received some recent scratches and the care of dr rochecliffe had decorated it with a number of patches which even enhanced its natural plainness yet the eyes were brilliant and expressive and amid his uglinessfor it amounted to that degree of irregularitythe face was not deficient in some lines which expressed both sagacity and resolution  the dress of albert himself was far beneath his quality as the son of sir henry lee and commander of a regiment in the royal service but that of his page was still more dilapidated a disastrous green jerkin which had been changed to a hundred hues by sun and rain so that the original could scarce be discovered huge clouterly shoes leathern breechessuch as were worn by hedgerscoarse grey worsted stockings were the attire of the honourable youth whose limping gait while it added to the ungainliness of his manner showed at the same time the extent of his sufferings his appearance bordered so much upon what is vulgarly called the queer that even with alice it would have excited some sense of ridicule had not compassion been predominant  the grace was said and the young squire of ditchley as well as dr rochecliffe made an excellent figure at a meal the like of which in quality and abundance did not seem to have lately fallen to their share but their feats were childsplay to those of the scottish youth far from betraying any symptoms of the bread and butter with which he had attempted to close the orifice of his stomach his appetite appeared to have been sharpened by a ninedays fast and the knight was disposed to think that the very genius of famine himself come forth from his native regions of the north was in the act of honouring him with a visit while as if afraid of losing a moments exertion master kerneguy never looked either to right or left or spoke a single word to any at table  i am glad to see that you have brought a good appetite for our country fare young gentleman said sir henry  bread of gude sir said the page an yell find flesh ise find appetite conforming ony day o the year but the truth is sir that the appeteezement has been coming on for three days or four and the meat in this southland of yours has been scarce and hard to come by so sir im making up for lost time as the piper of sligo said when he eat a hail side o mutton  you have been countrybred young man said the knight who like others of his time held the reins of discipline rather tight over the rising generation at least to judge from the youths of scotland whom i have seen at his late majestys court in former days they had less appetite and moremoreas he sought the qualifying phrase which might supply the place of good manners his guest closed the sentence in his own wayand more meat it may bethe better luck theirs  sir henry stared and was silent his son seemed to think it time to interposemy dear father he said think how many years have run since the thirtyeight when the scottish troubles first began and i am sure that you will not wonder that while the barons of scotland have been for one cause or other perpetually in the field the education of their children at home must have been much neglected and that young men of my friends age know better how to use a broadsword or to toss a pike than the decent ceremonials of society  the reason is a sufficient one said the knight and since thou sayest thy follower kernigo can fight well not let him lack victuals a gods namesee he looks angrily still at yonder cold loin of muttonfor gods sake put it all on his plate  i can bide the bit and the buffet said the honourable master kerneguya hungry tike neer minds a blaud with a rough bane  now god hae mercy albert but if this be the son of a scots peer said sir henry to his son in a low tone of voice i would not be the english ploughman who would change manners with him for his ancient blood and his nobility and his estate to boot an he has onehe has eaten as i am a christian near four pounds of solid butchers meat and with the grace of a wolf tugging at the carcass of a dead horse oh he is about to drink at lastsohhe wipes his mouth thoughand dips his fingers in the ewerand dries them i profess with the napkinthere is some grace in him after all  here is wussing all your vera gude healths said the youth of quality and took a draught in proportion to the solids which he had sent before he then flung his knife and fork awkwardly on the trencher which he pushed back towards the centre of the table extended his feet beneath it till they rested on their heels folded his arms on his wellreplenished stomach and lolling back in his chair looked much as if he was about to whistle himself asleep  soh said the knightthe honourable master kernigo hath laid down his armswithdraw these things and give us our glassesfill them around joceline and if the devil or the whole parliament were within hearing let them hear henry lee of ditchley drink a health to king charles and confusion to his enemies  amen said a voice from behind the door  all the company looked at each other in astonishment at a response so little expected it was followed by a solemn and peculiar tap such as a kind of freemasonry had introduced among royalists and by which they were accustomed to make themselves and their principles known to each other when they met by accident  there is no danger said albert knowing the signit is a friendyet i wish he had been at a greater distance just now  and why my son should you wish the absence of one true man who may perhaps wish to share our abundance on one of those rare occasions when we have superfluity at our disposalgo joceline see who knocksand if a safe man admit him  and if otherwise said joceline methinks i shall be able to prevent his troubling the good company  no violence joceline on your life said albert lee and alice echoed for gods sake no violence  no unnecessary violence at least said the good knight for if the time demands it i will have it seen that i am master of my own house joceline joliffe nodded assent to all parties and went on tiptoe to exchange one or two other mysterious symbols and knocks ere he opened the door it may be here remarked that this species of secret association with its signals of union existed among the more dissolute and desperate class of cavaliers men habituated to the dissipated life which they had been accustomed to in an illdisciplined army where everything like order and regularity was too apt to be accounted a badge of puritanism these were the roaring boys who met in hedge alehouses and when they had by any chance obtained a little money or a little credit determined to create a counterrevolution by declaring their sittings permanent and proclaimed in the words of one of their choicest ditties    well drink till we bring   in triumph back the king  the leaders and gentry of a higher description and more regular morals did not indeed partake such excesses but they still kept their eye upon a class of persons who from courage and desperation were capable of serving on an advantageous occasion the fallen cause of royalty and recorded the lodges and blind taverns at which they met as wholesale merchants know the houses of call of the mechanics whom they may have occasion to employ and can tell where they may find them when need requires it it is scarce necessary to add that among the lower class and sometimes even among the higher there were men found capable of betraying the projects and conspiracies of their associates whether well or indifferently combined to the governors of the state cromwell in particular had gained some correspondents of this kind of the highest rank and of the most undoubted character among the royalists who if they made scruple of impeaching or betraying individuals who confided in them had no hesitation in giving the government such general information as served to enable him to disappoint the purposes of any plot or conspiracy  to return to our story in much shorter time than we have spent in reminding the reader of these historical particulars joliffe had made his mystic communication and being duly answered as by one of the initiated he undid the door and there entered our old friend roger wildrake roundhead in dress as his safety and dependence on colonel everard compelled him to be but that dress worn in a most cavalierlike manner and forming a stronger contrast than usual with the demeanour and language of the wearer to which it was never very congenial  his puritanic hat the emblem of that of ralpho in the prints to hudibras or as he called it his felt umbrella was set most knowingly on one side of the head as if it had been a spanish hat and feather his straight squarecaped sadcoloured cloak was flung gaily upon one shoulder as if it had been of threeplied taffeta lined with crimson silk and he paraded his huge calfskin boots as if they had been silken hose and spanish leather shoes with roses on the instep in short the airs which he gave himself of a most thoroughpaced wild gallant and cavalier joined to a glistening of selfsatisfaction in his eye and an inimitable swagger in his gait which completely announced his thoughtless conceited and reckless character formed a most ridiculous contrast to his gravity of attire  it could not on the other hand be denied that in spite of the touch of ridicule which attached to his character and the loose morality which he had learned in the dissipation of town pleasures and afterwards in the disorderly life of a soldier wildrake had points about him both to make him feared and respected he was handsome even in spite of his air of debauched effrontery a man of the most decided courage though his vaunting rendered it sometimes doubtful and entertained a sincere sense of his political principles such as they were though he was often so imprudent in asserting and boasting of them as joined with his dependence on colonel everard induced prudent men to doubt his sincerity  such as he was however he entered the parlour of victor lee where his presence was any thing but desirable to the parties present with a jaunty step and a consciousness of deserving the best possible reception this assurance was greatly aided by circumstances which rendered it obvious that if the jocund cavalier had limited himself to one draught of liquor that evening in terms of his vow of temperance it must have been a very deep and long one  save ye gentlemen save yesave you good sir henry lee though i have scarce the honour to be known to yousave you worthy doctor and a speedy resurrection to the fallen church of england  you are welcome sir said sir henry lee whose feelings of hospitality and of the fraternal reception due to a royalist sufferer induced him to tolerate this intrusion more than he might have done otherwise if you have fought or suffered for the king sir it is an excuse for joining us and commanding our services in any thing in our poweralthough at present we are a familypartybut i think i saw you in waiting upon master markham everard who calls himself colonel everardif your message is from him you may wish to see me in private  not at all sir henry not at allit is true as my ill hap will have it that being on the stormy side of the hedgelike all honest menyou understand me sir henryi am glad as it were to gain something from my old friend and comrades countenancenot by truckling or disowning my principles siri defy such practisesbut in short by doing him any kindness in my power when he is pleased to call on me so i came down here with a message from him to the old roundheaded son of a  i beg the young ladys pardon from the crown of her head down to the very toes of her slipperand so sir chancing as i was stumbling out in the dark i heard you give a toast sir which warmed my heart sir and ever will sir till death chills itand so i made bold to let you know there was an honest man within hearing  such was the selfintroduction of master wildrake to which the knight replied by asking him to sit down and take a glass of sack to his majestys glorious restoration wildrake at this hint squeezed in without ceremony beside the young scotsman and not only pledged his landlords toast but seconded its import by volunteering a verse or two of his favourite loyal dittythe king shall enjoy his own again the heartiness which he threw into his song opened still farther the heart of the old knight though albert and alice looked at each other with looks resentful of the intrusion and desirous to put an end to it the honourable master kerneguy either possessed that happy indifference of temper which does not deign to notice such circumstances or he was able to assume the appearance of it to perfection as he sat sipping sack and cracking walnuts without testifying the least sense that an addition had been made to the party wildrake who liked the liquor and the company showed no unwillingness to repay his landlord by being at the expense of the conversation  you talk of fighting and suffering sir henry lee lord help us we have all had our share all the world knows what sir henry lee has done from edgefield downwards wherever a loyal sword was drawn or a loyal flag fluttered ah god help us i have done something too my name is roger wildrake of squattleseamere lincoln not that you are ever like to have heard it before but i was captain in lunsfords lighthorse and afterwards with goring i was a childeater sira babebolter  i have heard of your regiments exploits sir and perhaps you may find i have seen some of them if we should spend ten minutes together and i think i have heard of your name too i beg to drink your health captain wildrake of squattleseamere lincolnshire  sir henry i drink yours in this pint bumper and upon my knee and i would do as much for that young gentlemanlooking at albertand the squire of the green cassock too holding it for green as the colours are not to my eyes altogether clear and distinguishable  it was a remarkable part of what is called by theatrical folk the byplay of this scene that albert was conversing apart with dr rochecliffe in whispers even more than the divine seemed desirous of encouraging yet to whatever their private conversation referred it did not deprive the young colonel of the power of listening to what was going forward in the party at large and interfering from time to time like a watchdog who can distinguish the slightest alarm even when employed in the engrossing process of taking his food  captain wildrake said albert we have no objectioni mean my friend and ito be communicative on proper occasions but you sir who are so old a sufferer must needs know that at such casual meetings as this men do not mention their names unless they are specially wanted it is a point of conscience sir to be able to say if your principal captain everard or colonel everard if he be a colonel should examine you upon oath i did not know who the persons were whom i heard drink such and such toasts  faith i have a better way of it worthy sir answered wildrake i never can for the life of me remember that there were any such and such toasts drunk at all its a strange gift of forgetfulness i have  well sir replied the younger lee but we who have unhappily more tenacious memories would willingly abide by the more general rule  oh sir answered wildrake with all my heart i intrude on no mans confidence dn meand i only spoke for civilitys sake having the purpose of drinking your health in a good fashionthen he broke forth into melody    then let the health go round around around around   then let the health go round   for though your stocking be of silk   your knee shall kiss the ground aground aground aground   your knee shall kiss the ground  urge it no farther said sir henry addressing his son master wildrake is one of the old schoolone of the tantivy boys and we must bear a little for if they drink hard they fought well i will never forget how a party came up and rescued us clerks of oxford as they called the regiment i belonged to out of a cursed embroglio during the attack on brentford i tell you we were enclosed with the cockneys pikes both front and rear and we should have come off but ill had not lunfords lighthorse the babeeaters as they called them charged up to the pikes point and brought us off  i am glad you thought on that sir henry said wildrake and do you remember what the officer of lunsfords said  i think i do said sir henry smiling  well then did not he call out when the women were coming down howling like sirens as they werehave none of you a plump child that you could give us to break our fast upon  truth itself said the knight and a great fat woman stepped forward with a baby and offered it to the supposed cannibal  all at the table master kerneguy excepted who seemed to think that good food of any kind required no apology held up their hands in token of amazement  ay said wildrake theahemi crave the ladys pardon again from tip of topknot to hem of farthingalebut the cursed creature proved to be a parish nurse who had been paid for the child half a year in advance gad i took the babe out of the bitchwolfs hand and i have contrived though god knows i have lived in a skeldering sort of way myself to breed up bold breakfast as i call him ever since it was paying dear for a jest though  sir i honour you for your humanity said the old knightsir i thank you for your couragesir i am glad to see you here said the good knight his eyes watering almost to overflowing so you were the wild officer who cut us out of the toils oh sir had you but stopped when i called on you and allowed us to clear the streets of brentford with our musketeers we would have been at london stone that day but your good will was the same  ay truly was it said wildrake who now sat triumphant and glorious in his easychair and here is to all the brave hearts sir that fought and fell in that same storm of brentford we drove all before us like chaff till the shops where they sold strong waters and other temptations brought us up gad sir we the babeeaters had too many acquaintances in brentford and our stout prince rupert was ever better at making way than drawing off gad sir for my own poor share i did but go into the house of a poor widow lady who maintained a charge of daughters and whom i had known of old to get my horse fed a morsel of meat and so forth when these cockneypikes of the artillery ground as you very well call them rallied and came in with their armed heads as boldly as so many cotswold rams i sprang down stairs got to my horsebut egad i fancy all my troop had widows and orphan maidens to comfort as well as i for only five of us got together we cut our way through successfully and gad gentlemen i carried my little breakfast on the pommel before me and there was such a hollowing and screeching as if the whole town thought i was to kill roast and eat the poor child so soon as i got to quarters but devil a cockney charged up to my bonny bay poor lass to rescue little cakebread they only cried haro and out upon me  alas alas said the knight we made ourselves seem worse than we were and we were too bad to deserve gods blessing even in a good cause but it is needless to look back we did not deserve victories when god gave them for we never improved them like good soldiers or like christian men and so we gave these canting scoundrels the advantage of us for they assumed out of mere hypocrisy the discipline and orderly behaviour which we who drew our swords in a better cause ought to have practised out of true principle but here is my hand captain i have often wished to see the honest fellow who charged up so smartly in our behalf and i reverence you for the care you took of the poor child i am glad this dilapidated place has still some hospitality to offer you although we cannot treat you to roasted babes or stewed sucklingseh captain  truth sir henry the scandal was sore against us on that score i remember lacy who was an old playactor and a lieutenant in ours made drollery on it in a play which was sometimes acted at oxford when our hearts were something up called i think the old troop  so saying and feeling more familiar as his merits were known he hitched his chair up against that of the scottish lad who was seated next him and who in shifting his place was awkward enough to disturb in his turn alice lee who sate opposite and a little offended or at least embarrassed drew her chair away from the table  i crave pardon said the honourable master kerneguy but sir to master wildrake ye hae een garrd me hurt the young ladys shank  i crave your pardon sir and much more that of the fair lady as is reasonable though rat me sir if it was i set your chair atrundling in that way zooks sir i have brought with me no plague nor pestilence nor other infectious disorder that ye should have started away as if i had been a leper and discomposed the lady which i would have prevented with my life sir sir if ye be northern born as your tongue bespeaks egad it was i ran the risk in drawing near you so there was small reason for you to bolt  master wildrake said albert interfering this young gentleman is a stranger as well as you under protection of sir henrys hospitality and it cannot be agreeable for my father to see disputes arise among his guests you may mistake the young gentlemans quality from his present appearancethis is the honourable master louis kerneguy sir son of my lord killstewers of kincardineshire one who has fought for the king young as he is  no dispute shall rise through me sirnone through me said wildrake your exposition sufficeth sirmaster louis girnigo son of my lord kilsteer in gringardenshire i am your humble slave sir and drink your health in token that i honour you and all true scots who draw their andrew ferraras on the right side sir  ise beholden to you and thank you sir said the young man with some haughtiness of manner which hardly corresponded with his rusticity and i wuss your health in a ceevil way  most judicious persons would have here dropped the conversation but it was one of wildrakes marked peculiarities that he could never let matters stand when they were well he continued to plague the shy proud and awkward lad with his observations you speak your national dialect pretty strongly master girnigo said he but i think not quite the language of the gallants that i have known among the scottish cavaliersi knew for example some of the gordons and others of good repute who always put an f for wh as faat for what fan for when and the like  albert lee here interposed and said that the provinces of scotland like those of england had their different modes of pronunciation  you are very right sir said wildrake i reckon myself now a pretty good speaker of their cursed jargonno offence young gentleman and yet when i took a turn with some of montroses folk in the south highlands as they call their beastly wildernesses no offence again i chanced to be by myself and to lose my way when i said to a shepherdfellow making my mouth as wide and my voice as broad as i could whore am i ganging tillconfound me if the fellow could answer me unless indeed he was sulky as the bumpkins will be now and then to the gentlemen of the sword  this was familiarly spoken and though partly addressed to albert was still more directed to his immediate neighbour the young scotsman who seemed from bashfulness or some other reason rather shy of his intimacy to one or two personal touches from wildrakes elbow administered during his last speech by way of a practical appeal to him in particular he only answered misunderstandings were to be expected when men converse in national deealects  wildrake now considerably drunker than he ought to have been in civil company caught up the phrase and repeated itmisunderstanding sirmisunderstanding siri do not know how i am to construe that sir but to judge from the information of these scratches on your honourable visnomy i should augur that you had been of late at misunderstanding with the cat sir  you are mistaken then friend for it was with the dowg answered the scotsman dryly and cast a look towards albert  we had some trouble with the watchdogs in entering so late in the evening said albert in explanation and this youth had a fall among some rubbish by which he came by these scratches  and now dear sir henry said dr rochecliffe allow us to remind you of your gout and our long journey i do it the rather that my good friend your son has been during the whole time of supper putting questions to me aside which had much better be reserved till tomorrowmay we therefore ask permission to retire to our nights rest  these private committees in a merry meeting said wildrake are a solecism in breeding they always put me in mind of the cursed committees at westminsterbut shall we roost before we rouse the nightowl with a catch  aha canst thou quote shakspeare said sir henry pleased at discovering a new good quality in his acquaintance whose military services were otherwise but just able to counterbalance the intrusive freedom of his conversation in the name of merry will he continuedwhom i never saw though i have seen many of his comrades as alleyn hemmings and so onwe will have a single catch and one rouse about and then to bed  after the usual discussion about the choice of the song and the parts which each was to bear they united their voices in trolling a loyal glee which was popular among the party at the time and in fact believed to be composed by no less a person than dr rochecliffe himself  glee for king charles  bring the bowl which you boast   fill it up to the brim tis to him we love most   and to all who love him brave gallants stand up   and avauant ye base carles were there death in the cup   heres a health to king charles  though he wanders through dangers   unaided unknown dependent on strangers   estranged from his own though tis under our breath   amidst forfeits and perils heres to honour and faith   and a health to king charles  let such honours abound   as the time can afford the knee on the ground   and the hand on the sword but the time shall come round   when mid lords dukes and earls the loud trumpets shall sound   heres a health to king charles  after this display of loyalty and a final libation the party took leave of each other for the night sir henry offered his old acquaintance wildrake a bed for the evening who weighed the matter somewhat in this fashion why to speak truth my patron will expect me at the boroughbut then he is used to my staying out of doors anights then theres the devil that they say haunts woodstock but with the blessing of this reverend doctor i defy him and all his worksi saw him not when i slept here twice before and i am sure if he was absent then he has not come back with sir henry lee and his family so i accept your courtesy sir henry and i thank you as a cavalier of lunsford should thank one of the fighting clerks of oxon god bless the king i care not who hears it and confusion to noll and his red nose off he went accordingly with a bottleswagger guided by joceline to whom albert in the meantime had whispered to be sure to quarter him far enough from the rest of the family  young lee then saluted his sister and with the formality of those times asked and received his fathers blessing with an affectionate embrace his page seemed desirous to imitate one part of his example but was repelled by alice who only replied to his offered salute with a curtsy he next bowed his head in an awkward fashion to her father who wished him a good night i am glad to see young man he said that you have at least learned the reverence due to age it should always be paid sir because in doing so you render that honour to others which you will expect yourself to receive when you approach the close of your life more will i speak with you at leisure on your duties as a page which office in former days used to be the very school of chivalry whereas of late by the disorderly times it has become little better than a school of wild and disordered license which made rare ben jonson exclaim  nay father said albert interposing you must consider this days fatigue and the poor lad is almost asleep on his legstomorrow he will listen with more profit to your kind admonitionsand you louis remember at least one part of your dutytake the candles and light ushere joceline comes to show us the way once more good night good dr rochecliffegood night all                                         chapter the twentyfirst     groom hail noble prince   king richard thanks noble peer   the cheapest of us is a groat too dear     richard ii  albert and his page were ushered by joceline to what was called the spanish chamber a huge old scrambling bedroom rather in a dilapidated condition but furnished with a large standingbed for the master and a trucklebed for the domestic as was common at a much later period in old english houses where the gentleman often required the assistance of a groom of the chambers to help him to bed if the hospitality had been exuberant the walls were covered with hangings of cordovan leather stamped with gold and representing fights between the spaniards and moriscoes bullfeasts and other sports peculiar to the peninsula from which it took its name of the spanish chamber these hangings were in some places entirely torn down in others defaced and hanging in tatters but albert stopped not to make observations anxious it seemed to get joceline out of the room which he achieved by hastily answering his offers of fresh fuel and more liquor in the negative and returning with equal conciseness the underkeepers good wishes for the evening he at length retired somewhat unwillingly and as if he thought that his young master might have bestowed a few more words upon a faithful old retainer after so long absence  joliffe was no sooner gone than before a single word was spoken between albert lee and his page the former hastened to the door examined lock latch and bolt and made them fast with the most scrupulous attention he superadded to these precautions that of a long screwbolt which he brought out of his pocket and which he screwed on to the staple in such a manner as to render it impossible to withdraw it or open the door unless by breaking it down the page held a light to him during the operation which his master went through with much exactness and dexterity but when albert arose from his knee on which he had rested during the accomplishment of this task the manner of the companions was on the sudden entirely changed towards each other the honourable master kerneguy from a cubbish lout of a raw scotsman seemed to have acquired at once all the grace and ease of motion and manner which could be given by an acquaintance of the earliest and most familiar kind with the best company of the time  he gave the light he held to albert with the easy indifference of a superior who rather graces than troubles his dependent by giving him some slight service to perform albert with the greatest appearance of deference assumed in his turn the character of torchbearer and lighted his page across the chamber without turning his back upon him as he did so he then set the light on the table by the bedside and approaching the young man with deep reverence received from him the soiled green jacket with the same profound respect as if he had been a first lord of the bedchamber or other officer of the household of the highest distinction disrobing his sovereign of the mantle of the garter the person to whom this ceremony was addressed endured it for a minute or two with profound gravity and then bursting out alaughing exclaimed to albert what a devil means all this formalitythou complimentest with these miserable rags as if they were silks and sables and with poor louis kerneguy as if he were the king of great britain  and if your majestys commands and the circumstances of the time have made me for a moment seem to forget that you are my sovereign surely i may be permitted to render my homage as such while you are in your own royal palace of woodstock  truly replied the disguised monarch the sovereign and the palace are not ill matchedthese tattered hangings and my ragged jerkin suit each other admirablythis woodstockthis the bower where the royal norman revelled with the fair rosamond cliffordwhy it is a place of assignation for owls then suddenly recollecting himself with his natural courtesy he added as if fearing he might have hurt alberts feelingsbut the more obscure and retired it is the fitter for our purpose lee and if it does seem to be a roost for owls as there is no denying why we know it has nevertheless brought up eagles  he threw himself as he spoke upon a chair and indolently but gracefully received the kind offices of albert who undid the coarse buttonings of the leathern gamashes which defended his legs and spoke to him the whilstwhat a fine specimen of the olden time is your father sir henry it is strange i should not have seen him beforebut i heard my father often speak of him as being among the flower of our real old english gentry by the mode in which he began to school me i can guess you had a tight taskmaster of him alberti warrant you never wore hat in his presence eh  i never cocked it at least in his presence please your majesty as i have seen some youngsters do answered albert indeed if i had it must have been a stout beaver to have saved me from a broken head  oh i doubt it not replied the king a fine old gentlemanbut with that methinks in his countenance that assures you he would not hate the child in sparing the rodhark ye albertsuppose the same glorious restoration come roundwhich if drinking to its arrival can hasten it should not be far distantfor in that particular our adherents never neglect their duty suppose it come therefore and that thy father as must be of course becomes an earl and one of the privy council oddsfish man i shall be as much afraid of him as ever was my grandfather henri quatre of old sullyimagine there were such a trinket now about the court as the fair rosamond or la belle gabrielle what a work there would be of pages and grooms of the chamber to get the pretty rogue clandestinely shuffled out by the backstairs like a prohibited commodity when the step of the earl of woodstock was heard in the antechamber  i am glad to see your majesty somerry after your fatiguing journey  the fatigue was nothing man said charles a kind welcome and a good meal made amends for all that but they must have suspected thee of bringing a wolf from the braes of badenoch along with you instead of a twolegged being with no more than the usual allowance of mortal stowage for provisions i was really ashamed of my appetite but thou knowest i had eat nothing for twentyfour hours save the raw egg you stole for me from the old womans henroosti tell thee i blushed to show myself so ravenous before that highbred and respectable old gentleman your father and the very pretty girl your sisteror cousin is she  she is my sister said albert lee dryly and added in the same breath your majestys appetite suited well enough with the character of a raw northern ladwould your majesty now please to retire to rest  not for a minute or two said the king retaining his seat why man i have scarce had my tongue unchained today and to talk with that northern twang and besides the fatigue of being obliged to speak every word in charactergad its like walking as the galleyslaves do on the continent with a twentyfour pound shot chained to their legsthey may drag it along but they cannot move with comfort and by the way thou art slack in paying me my welldeserved tribute of compliment on my counterfeitingdid i not play louis kerneguy as round as a ring  if your majesty asks my serious opinion perhaps i may be forgiven if i say your dialect was somewhat too coarse for a scottish youth of high birth and your behaviour perhaps a little too churlish i thought toothough i pretend not to be skilfulthat some of your scottish sounded as if it were not genuine  not genuinethere is no pleasing thee albertwhy who should speak genuine scottish but myselfwas i not their king for a matter of ten months and if i did not get knowledge of their language i wonder what else i got by it did not east country and south country and west country and highlands caw croak and shriek about me as the deep guttural the broad drawl and the high sharp yelp predominated by turnsoddsfish man have i not been speeched at by their orators addressed by their senators rebuked by their kirkmen have i not sate on the cuttystool mon again assuming the northern dialect and thought it grace of worthy mrs john gillespie that i was permitted to do penance in my own privy chamber instead of the face of the congregation and wilt thou tell me after all that i cannot speak scotch enough to baffle an oxon knight and his family  may it please your majestyi begun by saying i was no judge of the scottish language  pshawit is mere envy just so you said at nortons that i was too courteous and civil for a young pagenow you think me too rude  and there is a medium if one could find it said albert defending his opinion in the same tone in which the king attacked him so this morning when you were in the womans dress you raised your petticoats rather unbecomingly high as you waded through the first little stream and when i told you of it to mend the matter you draggled through the next without raising them at all  o the devil take the womans dress said charles i hope i shall never be driven to that disguise again why my ugly face was enough to put gowns caps and kirtles out of fashion for everthe very dogs fled from mehad i passed any hamlet that had but five huts in it i could not have escaped the cuckingstooli was a libel on womankind these leathern conveniences are none of the gayest but they are propria quae maribus and right glad am i to be repossessed of them i can tell you too my friend i shall resume all my masculine privileges with my proper habiliments and as you say i have been too coarse tonight i will behave myself like a courtier to mistress alice tomorrow i made a sort of acquaintance with her already when i seemed to be of the same sex with herself and found out there are other colonels in the wind besides you colonel albert lee  may it please your majesty said albertand then stopped short from the difficulty of finding words to express the unpleasant nature of his feelings they could not escape charles but he proceeded without scruple i pique myself on seeing as far into the hearts of young ladies as most folk though god knows they are sometimes too deep for the wisest of us but i mentioned to your sister in my character of fortunetellerthinking poor simple man that a country girl must have no one but her brother to dream aboutthat she was anxious about a certain colonel i had hit the theme but not the person for i alluded to you albert and i presume the blush was too deep ever to be given to a brother so up she got and away she flew from me like a lapwing i can excuse herfor looking at myself in the well i think if i had met such a creature as i seemed i should have called fire and fagot against itnow what think you albertwho can this colonel be that more than rivals you in your sisters affection  albert who well knew that the kings mode of thinking where the fair sex was concerned was far more gay than delicate endeavoured to put a stop to the present topic by a grave answer  his sister he said had been in some measure educated with the son of her maternal uncle markham everard but as his father and he himself had adopted the cause of the roundheads the families had in consequence been at variance and any projects which might have been formerly entertained were of course long since dismissed on all sides  you are wrong albert you are wrong said the king pitilessly pursuing his jest you colonels whether you wear blue or orange sashes are too pretty fellows to be dismissed so easily when once you have acquired an interest but mistress alice so pretty and who wishes the restoration of the king with such a look and accent as if she were an angel whose prayers must needs bring it down must not be allowed to retain any thoughts of a canting roundheadwhat say youwill you give me leave to take her to task about itafter all i am the party most concerned in maintaining true allegiance among my subjects and if i gain the pretty maidens good will that of the sweethearts will soon follow this was jolly king edwards wayedward the fourth you know the kingmaking earl of warwickthe cromwell of his daydethroned him more than once but he had the hearts of the merry dames of london and the purses and veins of the cockneys bled freely till they brought him home again how say youshall i shake off my northern slough and speak with alice in my own character showing what education and manners have done for me to make the best amends they can for an ugly face  may it please your majesty said albert in an altered and embarrassed tone i did not expect  here he stopped not able to find words adequate at the same time to express his sentiments and respectful enough to the king while in his fathers house and under his own protection  and what is it that master lee does not expect said charles with marked gravity on his part  again albert attempted a reply but advanced no farther than i would hope if it please your majestywhen he again stopped short his deep and hereditary respect for his sovereign and his sense of the hospitality due to his misfortunes preventing his giving utterance to his irritated feelings  and what does colonel albert lee hope said charles in the same dry and cold manner in which he had before spokenno answernow i hope that colonel lee does not see in a silly jest anything offensive to the honour of his family since methinks that were an indifferent compliment to his sister his father and himself not to mention charles stewart whom he calls his king and i expect that i shall not be so hardly construed as to be supposed capable of forgetting that mistress alice lee is the daughter of my faithful subject and host and the sister of my guide and preservercome come albert he added changing at once to his naturally frank and unceremonious manner you forget how long i have been abroad where men women and children talk gallantry morning noon and night with no more serious thought than just to pass away the time and i forget too that you are of the oldfashioned english school a son after sir henrys own heart and dont understand raillery upon such subjectsbut i ask your pardon albert sincerely if i have really hurt you  so saying he extended his hand to colonel lee who feeling he had been rather too hasty in construing the kings jest in an unpleasant sense kissed it with reverence and attempted an apology  not a wordnot a word said the goodnatured prince raising his penitent adherent as he attempted to kneel we understand each other you are somewhat afraid of the gay reputation which i acquired in scotland but i assure you i will be as stupid as you or your cousin colonel could desire in presence of mistress alice lee and only bestow my gallantry should i have any to throw away upon the pretty little waitingmaid who attended at supperunless you should have monopolized her ear for your own benefit colonel albert  it is monopolized sure enough though not by me if it please your majesty but by joceline joliffe the underkeeper whom we must not disoblige as we have trusted him so far already and may have occasion to repose even entire confidence in him i half think he suspects who louis kerneguy may in reality be  you are an engrossing set you wooers of woodstock said the king laughing now if i had a fancy as a frenchman would not fail to have in such a case to make pretty speeches to the deaf old woman i saw in the kitchen as a pisaller i dare say i should be told that her ear was engrossed for dr rochecliffes sole use  i marvel at your majestys good spirits said albert that after a day of danger fatigue and accidents you should feel the power of amusing yourself thus  that is to say the groom of the chambers wishes his majesty would go to sleepwell one word or two on more serious business and i have donei have been completely directed by you and rochecliffei have changed my disguise from female to male upon the instant and altered my destination from hampshire to take shelter heredo you still hold it the wiser course  i have great confidence in dr rochecliffe replied albert whose acquaintance with the scattered royalists enables him to gain the most accurate intelligence his pride in the extent of his correspondence and the complication of his plots and schemes for your majestys service is indeed the very food he lives upon but his sagacity is equal to his vanity i repose besides the utmost faith in joliffe of my father and sister i would say nothing yet i would not without reason extend the knowledge of your majestys person farther than it is indispensably necessary  is it handsome in me said charles pausing to withhold my full confidence from sir henry lee  your majesty heard of his almost deathswoon of last nightwhat would agitate him most deeply must not be hastily communicated  true but are we safe from a visit of the redcoatsthey have them in woodstock as well as in oxford said charles  dr rochecliffe says not unwisely answered lee that it is best sitting near the fire when the chimney smokes and that woodstock so lately in possession of the sequestrators and still in the vicinity of the soldiers will be less suspected and more carelessly searched than more distant corners which might seem to promise more safety besides he added rochecliffe is in possession of curious and important news concerning the state of matters at woodstock highly favourable to your majestys being concealed in the palace for two or three days till shipping is provided the parliament or usurping council of state had sent down sequestrators whom their own evil conscience assisted perhaps by the tricks of some daring cavaliers had frightened out of the lodge without much desire to come back again then the more formidable usurper cromwell had granted a warrant of possession to colonel everard who had only used it for the purpose of repossessing his uncle in the lodge and who kept watch in person at the little borough to see that sir henry was not disturbed  what mistress alices colonel said the kingthat sounds alarmingfor grant that he keeps the other fellows at bay think you not master albert he will have an hundred errands aday to bring him here in person  dr rochecliffe says answered lee the treaty between sir henry and his nephew binds the latter not to approach the lodge unless invitedindeed it was not without great difficulty and strongly arguing the good consequences it might produce to your majestys cause that my father could be prevailed on to occupy woodstock at all but be assured he will be in no hurry to send an invitation to the colonel  and be you assured that the colonel will come without waiting for one said charles folk cannot judge rightly where sisters are concernedthey are too familiar with the magnet to judge of its powers of attractioneverard will be here as if drawn by cartropes fetters not to talk of promises will not hold himand then methinks we are in some danger  i hope not said albert in the first place i know markham is a slave to his word besides were any chance to bring him here i think i could pass your majesty upon him without difficulty as louis kerneguy then although my cousin and i have not been on good terms for these some years i believe him incapable of betraying your majesty and lastly if i saw the least danger of it i would were he ten times the son of my mothers sister run my sword through his body ere he had time to execute his purpose  there is but another question said charles and i will release you albertyou seem to think yourself secure from search it may be so but in any other country this tale of goblins which is flying about would bring down priests and ministers of justice to examine the reality of the story and mobs of idle people to satisfy their curiosity  respecting the first sir we hope and understand that colonel everards influence will prevent any immediate enquiry for the sake of preserving undisturbed the peace of his uncles family and as for any one coming without some sort of authority the whole neighbours have so much love and fear of my father and are besides so horribly alarmed about the goblins of woodstock that fear will silence curiosity  on the whole then said charles the chances of safety seem to be in favour of the plan we have adopted which is all i can hope for in a condition where absolute safety is out of the question the bishop recommended dr rochecliffe as one of the most ingenious boldest and most loyal sons of the church of england you albert lee have marked your fidelity by a hundred proofs to you and your local knowledge i submit myselfand now prepare our armsalive i will not be taken yet i will not believe that a son of the king of england and heir of her throne could be destined to danger in his own palace and under the guard of the loyal lees  albert lee laid pistols and swords in readiness by the kings bed and his own and charles after some slight apology took his place in the larger and better bed with a sigh of pleasure as from one who had not lately enjoyed such an indulgence he bid good night to his faithful attendant who deposited himself on his truckle and both monarch and subject were soon fast asleep                                         chapter the twentysecond     give sir nicholas threlkeld praise   hear it good man old in days   thou tree of succour and of rest    to this young bird that was distressd   beneath thy branches he did stay   and he was free to sport and play   when falcons were abroad for prey     wordsworth  the fugitive prince slept in spite of danger with the profound repose which youth and fatigue inspire but the young cavalier his guide and guard spent a more restless night starting from time to time and listening anxious notwithstanding dr rochecliffes assurances to procure yet more particular knowledge concerning the state of things around them than he had been yet able to collect  he rose early after daybreak but although he moved with as little noise as was possible the slumbers of the hunted prince were easily disturbed he started up in his bed and asked if there was any alarm  none please your majesty replied lee only thinking on the questions your majesty was asking last night and the various chances there are of your majestys safety being endangered from unforeseen accidents i thought of going thus early both to communicate with dr rochecliffe and to keep such a lookout as befits the place where are lodged for the time the fortunes of england i fear i must request of your majesty for your own gracious security that you have the goodness to condescend to secure the door with your own hand after i go out  oh talk not to majesty for heavens sake dear albert answered the poor king endeavouring in vain to put on a part of his clothes in order to traverse the roomwhen a kings doublet and hose are so ragged that he can no more find his way into them than he could have travelled through the forest of deane without a guide good faith there should be an end of majesty until it chances to be better accommodated besides there is the chance of these big words bolting out at unawares when there are ears to hear them whom we might think dangerous  your commands shall be obeyed said lee who had now succeeded in opening the door from which he took his departure leaving the king who had hustled along the floor for that purpose with his dress wofully ill arranged to make it fast again behind him and begging him in no case to open to any one unless he or rochecliffe were of the party who summoned him  albert then set out in quest of dr rochecliffes apartment which was only known to himself and the faithful joliffe and had at different times accommodated that steady churchman with a place of concealment when from his bold and busy temper which led him into the most extensive and hazardous machinations on the kings behalf he had been strictly sought after by the opposite party of late the inquest after him had died entirely away as he had prudently withdrawn himself from the scene of his intrigues since the loss of the battle of worcester he had been afloat again and more active than ever and had by friends and correspondents and especially the bishop of  been the means of directing the kings flight towards woodstock although it was not until the very day of his arrival that he could promise him a safe reception at that ancient mansion  albert lee though he revered both the undaunted spirit and ready resources of the bustling and intriguing churchman felt he had not been enabled by him to answer some of charless questions yesternight in a way so distinct as one trusted with the kings safety ought to have done and it was now his object to make himself personally acquainted if possible with the various bearings of so weighty a matter as became a man on whom so much of the responsibility was likely to descend  even his local knowledge was scarce adequate to find the doctors secret apartment had he not traced his way after a genial flavour of roasted game through divers blind passages and up and down certain very useless stairs through cupboards and hatchways and so forth to a species of sanctum sanctorum where joceline joliffe was ministering to the good doctor a solemn breakfast of wildfowl with a cup of small beer stirred with a sprig of rosemary which dr rochecliffe preferred to all strong potations beside him sat bevis on his tail slobbering and looking amiable moved by the rare smell of the breakfast which had quite overcome his native dignity of disposition  the chamber in which the doctor had established himself was a little octangular room with walls of great thickness within which were fabricated various issues leading in different directions and communicating with different parts of the building around him were packages with arms and near him one small barrel as it seemed of gunpowder many papers in different parcels and several keys for correspondence in cipher two or three scrolls covered with hieroglyphics were also beside him which albert took for plans of nativity and various models of machinery in which dr rochecliffe was an adept there were also tools of various kinds masks cloaks and a dark lantern and a number of other indescribable trinkets belonging to the trade of a daring plotter in dangerous times last there was a casket with gold and silver coin of different countries which was left carelessly open as if it were the least of dr rochecliffes concern although his habits in general announced narrow circumstances if not actual poverty close by the divines plate lay a bible and prayerbook with some proof sheets as they are technically called seemingly fresh from the press there was also within the reach of his hand a dirk or scottish poniard a powderhorn and a musketoon or blunderbuss with a pair of handsome pocketpistols in the midst of this miscellaneous collection the doctor sat eating his breakfast with great appetite as little dismayed by the various implements of danger around him as a workman is when accustomed to the perils of a gunpowder manufactory  so young gentleman he said getting up and extending his hand are you come to breakfast with me in good fellowship or to spoil my meal this morning as you did my supper last night by asking untimely questions  i will pick a bone with you with all my heart said albert and if you please doctor i would ask some questions which seem not quite untimely  so saying he sat down and assisted the doctor in giving a very satisfactory account of a brace of wildducks and a leash of teal bevis who maintained his place with great patience and insinuation had his share of a collop which was also placed on the wellfurnished board for like most highbred dogs he declined eating waterfowl  come hither then albert lee said the doctor laying down his knife and fork and plucking the towel from his throat so soon as joceline was withdrawn thou art still the same lad thou wert when i was thy tutornever satisfied with having got a grammar rule but always persecuting me with questions why the rule stood so and not otherwise overcurious after information which thou couldst not comprehend as bevis slobbered and whined for the duckwing which he could not eat  i hope you will find me more reasonable doctor answered albert and at the same time that you will recollect i am not now sub ferula but am placed in circumstances where i am not at liberty to act upon the ipse dixit of any man unless my own judgment be convinced i shall deserve richly to be hanged drawn and quartered should any misfortune happen by my misgovernment in this business  and it is therefore albert that i would have thee trust the whole to me without interfering thou sayest forsooth thou art not sub ferula but recollect that while you have been fighting in the field i have been plotting in the studythat i know all the combinations of the kings friends ay and all the motions of his enemies as well as a spider knows every mesh of his web think of my experience man not a cavalier in the land but has heard of rochecliffe the plotter i have been a main limb in every thing that has been attempted since fortytwopenned declarations conducted correspondence communicated with chiefs recruited followers commissioned arms levied money appointed rendezvouses i was in the western riding and before that in the city petition and in sir john owens stir in wales in short almost in every plot for the king since tomkins and challoners matter  but were not all these plots unsuccessful said albert and were not tomkins and challoner hanged doctor  yes my young friend answered the doctor gravely as many others have been with whom i have acted but only because they did not follow my advice implicitly you never heard that i was hanged myself  the time may come doctor said albert the pitcher goes oft to the wellthe proverb as my father would say is somewhat musty but i too have some confidence in my own judgment and much as i honour the church i cannot altogether subscribe to passive obedience i will tell you in one word what points i must have explanation on and it will remain with you to give it or to return a message to the king that you will not explain your plan in which case if he acts by my advice he will leave woodstock and resume his purpose of getting to the coast without delay  well then said the doctor thou suspicious monster make thy demands and if they be such as i can answer without betraying confidence i will reply to them  in the first place then what is all this story about ghosts and witchcrafts and apparitions and do you consider it as safe for his majesty to stay in a house subject to such visitations real or pretended  you must be satisfied with my answer in verbo sacerdotisthe circumstances you allude to will not give the least annoyance to woodstock during the kings residence i cannot explain farther but for this i will be bound at the risk of my neck  then said lee we must take dr rochecliffes bail that the devil will keep the peace towards our sovereign lord the kinggood now there lurked about this house the greater part of yesterday and perhaps slept here a fellow called tomkinsa bitter independent and a secretary or clerk or something or other to the regicide dog desborough the man is well knowna wild ranter in religious opinions but in private affairs farsighted cunning and interested even as any rogue of them all  be assured we will avail ourselves of his crazy fanaticism to mislead his wicked cunninga child may lead a hog if it has wit to fasten a cord to the ring in its nose replied the doctor  you may be deceived said albert the age has many such as this fellow whose views of the spiritual and temporal world are so different that they resemble the eyes of a squinting man one of which oblique and distorted sees nothing but the end of his nose while the other instead of partaking the same defect views strongly sharply and acutely whatever is subjected to its scrutiny  but we will put a patch on the better eye said the doctor and he shall only be allowed to speculate with the imperfect optic you must know this fellow has always seen the greatest number and the most hideous apparitions he has not the courage of a cat in such matters though stout enough when he hath temporal antagonists before him i have placed him under the charge of joceline joliffe who betwixt plying him with sack and ghoststories would make him incapable of knowing what was done if you were to proclaim the king in his presence  but why keep such a fellow here at all  oh sir content youhe lies leaguer as a sort of ambassador for his worthy masters and we are secure from any intrusion so long as they get all the news of woodstock from trusty tomkins  i know jocelines honesty well said albert and if he can assure me that he will keep a watch over this fellow i will so far trust in him he does not know the depth of the stake tis true but that my life is concerned will be quite enough to keep him vigilantwell then i proceedwhat if markham everard comes down on us  we have his word to the contrary answered rochecliffehis word of honour transmitted by his frienddo you think it likely he will break it  i hold him incapable of doing so answered albert and besides i think markham would make no bad use of any thing which might come to his knowledgeyet god forbid we should be under the necessity of trusting any who ever wore the parliaments colours in a matter of such dear concernment  amen said the doctorare your doubts silenced now  i still have an objection said albert to yonder impudent rakehelly fellow styling himself a cavalier who rushed himself on our company last night and gained my fathers heart by a story of the storm of brentford which i dare say the rogue never saw  you mistake him dear albert replied rocheclifferoger wildrake although till of late i only knew him by name is a gentleman was bred at the inns of court and spent his estate in the kings service  or rather in the devils service said albert it is such fellows as he who sunk from the license of their military habits into idle debauched ruffians infest the land with riots and robberies brawl in hedge alehouses and cellars where strong waters are sold at midnight and with their deep oaths their hot loyalty and their drunken valour make decent men abominate the very name of cavalier  alas said the doctor it is but too true but what can you expect when the higher and more qualified classes are broken down and mingled undistinguishably with the lower orders they are apt to lose the most valuable marks of their quality in the general confusion of morals and mannersjust as a handful of silver medals will become defaced and discoloured if jumbled about among the vulgar copper coin even the prime medal of all which we royalists would so willingly wear next our very hearts has not perhaps entirely escaped some deteriorationbut let other tongues than mine speak on that subject  albert lee paused deeply after having heard these communications on the part of rochecliffe doctor he said it is generally agreed even by some who think you may occasionally have been a little over busy in putting men upon dangerous actions  may god forgive them who entertain so false an opinion of me said the doctor  that nevertheless you have done and suffered more in the kings behalf than any man of your function  they do me but justice there said dr rochecliffeabsolute justice  i am therefore disposed to abide by your opinion if all things considered you think it safe that we should remain at woodstock  that is not the question answered the divine  and what is the question then replied the young soldier  whether any safer course can be pointed out i grieve to say that the question must be comparative as to the point of option absolute safety isalas the whileout of the question on all sides now i say woodstock is fenced and guarded as at present by far the most preferable place of concealment  enough replied albert i give up to you the question as to a person whose knowledge of such important affairs not to mention your age and experience is more intimate and extensive than mine can be  you do well answered rochecliffe and if others had acted with the like distrust of their own knowledge and confidence in competent persons it had been better for the age this makes understanding bar himself up within his fortalice and wit betake himself to his high tower here he looked around his cell with an air of selfcomplacence the wise man forseeth the tempest and hideth himself  doctor said albert let our foresight serve others far more precious than either of us let me ask you if you have well considered whether our precious charge should remain in society with the family or betake himself to some of the more hidden corners of the house  hum said the doctor with an air of deep reflectioni think he will be safest as louis kerneguy keeping himself close beside you  i fear it will be necessary added albert that i scout abroad a little and show myself in some distant part of the country lest coming here in quest of me they should find higher game  pray do not interrupt mekeeping himself close beside you or your father in or near to victor lees apartment from which you are aware he can make a ready escape should danger approach this occurs to me as best for the presenti hope to hear of the vessel todaytomorrow at farthest  albert lee bid the active but opiniated man good morrow admiring how this species of intrigue had become a sort of element in which the doctor seemed to enjoy himself notwithstanding all that the poet has said concerning the horrors which intervene betwixt the conception and execution of a conspiracy  in returning from dr rochecliffes sanctuary he met with joceline who was anxiously seeking him the young scotch gentleman he said in a mysterious manner has arisen from bed and hearing me pass he called me into his apartment  well replied albert i will see him presently  and he asked me for fresh linen and clothes now sir he is like a man who is quite accustomed to be obeyed so i gave him a suit which happened to be in a wardrobe in the west tower and some of your linen to conform and when he was dressed he commanded me to show him to the presence of sir henry lee and my young lady i would have said something sir about waiting till you came back but he pulled me goodnaturedly by the hair as indeed he has a rare humour of his own and told me he was guest to master albert lee and not his prisoner so sir though i thought you might be displeased with me for giving him the means of stirring abroad and perhaps being seen by those who should not see him what could i say  you are a sensible fellow joceline and comprehend always what is recommended to you this youth will not be controlled i fear by either of us but we must look the closer after his safety you keep your watch over that prying fellow the steward  trust him to my careon that side have no fear but ah sir i would we had the young scot in his old clothes again for the ridingsuit of yours which he now wears hath set him off in otherguess fashion  from the manner in which the faithful dependent expressed himself albert saw that he suspected who the scottish page in reality was yet he did not think it proper to acknowledge to him a fact of such importance secure as he was equally of his fidelity whether explicitly trusted to the full extent or left to his own conjectures full of anxious thought he went to the apartment of victor lee in which joliffe told him he would find the party assembled the sound of laughter as he laid his hand on the lock of the door almost made him start so singularly did it jar with the doubtful and melancholy reflections which engaged his own mind he entered and found his father in high goodhumour laughing and conversing freely with his young charge whose appearance was indeed so much changed to the better in externals that it seemed scarce possible a nights rest a toilet and a suit of decent clothes could have done so much in his favour in so short a time it could not however be imputed to the mere alteration of dress although that no doubt had its effect there was nothing splendid in that which louis kerneguy we continue to call him by his assumed name now wore it was merely a ridingsuit of grey cloth with some silver lace in the fashion of a country gentleman of the time but it happened to fit him very well and to become his very dark complexion especially as he now held up his head and used the manners not only of a wellbehaved but of a highlyaccomplished gentleman when he moved his clumsy and awkward limp was exchanged for a sort of shuffle which as it might be the consequence of a wound in those perilous times had rather an interesting than an ungainly effect at least it was as genteel an expression that the party had been overhard travelled as the most polite pedestrian could propose to himself  the features of the wanderer were harsh as ever but his red shock peruke for such it proved was laid aside his sable elflocks were trained by a little of jocelines assistance into curls and his fine black eyes shone from among the shade of these curls and corresponded with the animated though not handsome character of the whole head in his conversation he had laid aside all the coarseness of dialect which he had so strongly affected on the preceding evening and although he continued to speak a little scotch for the support of his character as a young gentleman of that nation yet it was not in a degree which rendered his speech either uncouth or unintelligible but merely afforded a certain doric tinge essential to the personage he represented no person on earth could better understand the society in which he moved exile had made him acquainted with life in all its shades and varietieshis spirits if not uniform were elastiche had that species of epicurean philosophy which even in the most extreme difficulties and dangers can in an interval of ease however brief avail itself of the enjoyments of the momenthe was in short in youth and misfortune as afterwards in his regal condition a goodhumoured but hardhearted voluptuarywise save where his passions intervenedbeneficent save when prodigality had deprived him of the means or prejudice of the wish to confer benefitshis faults such as might often have drawn down hatred but that they were mingled with so much urbanity that the injured person felt it impossible to retain the full sense of his wrongs  albert lee found the party consisting of his father sister and the supposed page seated by the breakfasttable at which he also took his place he was a pensive and anxious beholder of what passed while the page who had already completely gained the heart of the good old cavalier by mimicking the manner in which the scottish divines preached in favour of ma gude lord marquis of argyle and the solemn league and covenant was now endeavouring to interest the fair alice by such anecdotes partly of warlike and perilous adventure as possessed the same degree of interest for the female ear which they have had ever since desdemonas days but it was not only of dangers by land and sea that the disguised page spoke but much more and much oftener on foreign revels banquets balls where the pride of france of spain or of the low countries was exhibited in the eyes of their most eminent beauties alice being a very young girl who in consequence of the civil war had been almost entirely educated in the country and often in great seclusion it was certainly no wonder that she should listen with willing ears and a ready smile to what the young gentleman their guest and her brothers protege told with so much gaiety and mingled with such a shade of dangerous adventure and occasionally of serious reflection as prevented the discourse from being regarded as merely light and frivolous  in a word sir henry lee laughed alice smiled from time to time and all were satisfied but albert who would himself however have been scarce able to allege a sufficient reason for his depression of spirits the materials of breakfast were at last removed under the active superintendence of the neathanded phoebe who looked over her shoulder and lingered more than once to listen to the fluent discourse of their new guest whom on the preceding evening she had while in attendance at supper accounted one of the most stupid inmates to whom the gates of woodstock had been opened since the times of fair rosamond  louis kerneguy then when they were left only four in the chamber without the interruption of domestics and the successive bustle occasioned by the discussion and removal of the morning meal became apparently sensible that his friend and ostensible patron albert ought not altogether to be suffered to drop to leeward in the conversation while he was himself successfully engaging the attention of those members of his family to whom he had become so recently known he went behind his chair therefore and leaning on the back said with a goodhumoured tone which made his purpose entirely intelligible  either my good friend guide and patron has heard worse news this morning than he cares to tell us or he must have stumbled over my tattered jerkin and leathern hose and acquired by contact the whole mass of stupidity which i threw off last night with those most dolorous garments cheer up my dear colonel albert if your affectionate page may presume to say soyou are in company with those whose society dear to strangers must be doubly so to you oddsfish man cheer up i have seen you gay on a biscuit and a mouthful of watercressesdont let your heart fail you on rhenish wine and venison  dear louis said albert rousing himself into exertion and somewhat ashamed of his own silence i have slept worse and been astir earlier than you  be it so said his father yet i hold it no good excuse for your sullen silence albert you have met your sister and me so long separated from you so anxious on your behalf almost like mere strangers and yet you are returned safe to us and you find us well  returned indeedbut for safety my dear father that word must be a stranger to us worcester folk for some time however it is not my own safety about which i am anxious  about whose then should you be anxiousall accounts agree that the king is safe out of the dogs jaws  not without some danger though muttered louis thinking of his encounter with bevis on the preceding evening  no not without danger indeed echoed the knight but as old will says    theres such divinity doth hedge a king   that treason dares not peep at what it would  no nothank god thats cared for our hope and fortune is escaped so all news affirm escaped from bristolif i thought otherwise albert i should be as sad as you are for the rest of it i have lurked a month in this house when discovery would have been death and that is no longer since than after lord holland and the duke of buckinghams rising at kingston and hang me if i thought once of twisting my brow into such a tragic fold as yours but cocked my hat at misfortune as a cavalier should  if i might put in a word said louis it would be to assure colonel albert lee that i verily believe the king would think his own hap wherever he may be much the worse that his best subjects were seized with dejection on his account  you answer boldly on the kings part young man said sir henry  oh my father was meikle about the kings hand answered louis recollecting his present character  no wonder then said sir henry that you have so soon recovered your good spirits and good breeding when you heard of his majestys escape why you are no more like the lad we saw last night than the best hunter i ever had was like a drayhorse  oh there is much in rest and food and grooming answered louis you would hardly know the tired jade you dismounted from last night when she is brought out prancing and neighing the next morning rested refreshed and ready to start againespecially if the brute hath some good blood for such pick up unco fast  well then but since thy father was a courtier and thou hast learned i think something of the trade tell us a little master kerneguy of him we love most to hear aboutthe king we are all safe and secret you need not be afraid he was a hopeful youth i trust his flourishing blossom now gives promise of fruit  as the knight spoke louis bent his eyes on the ground and seemed at first uncertain what to answer but admirable at extricating himself from such dilemmas he replied that he really could not presume to speak on such a subject in the presence of his patron colonel albert lee who must be a much better judge of the character of king charles than he could pretend to be  albert was accordingly next assailed by the knight seconded by alice for some account of his majestys character  i will speak but according to facts said albert and then i must be acquitted of partiality if the king had not possessed enterprise and military skill he never would have attempted the expedition to worcesterhad he not had personal courage he had not so long disputed the battle that cromwell almost judged it lost that he possesses prudence and patience must be argued from the circumstances attending his flight and that he has the love of his subjects is evident since necessarily known to many he has been betrayed by none  for shame albert replied his sister is that the way a good cavalier doles out the character of his prince applying an instance at every concession like a pedlar measuring linen with his rodout upon youno wonder you were beaten if you fought as coldly for your king as you now talk for him  i did my best to trace a likeness from what i have seen and known of the original sister alice replied her brotherif you would have a fancy portrait you must get an artist of more imagination than i have to draw it for you  i will be that artist myself said alice and in my portrait our monarch shall show all that he ought to be having such high pretensionsall that he must be being so loftily descendedall that i am sure he is and that every loyal heart in the kingdom ought to believe him  well said alice quoth the old knightlook thou upon this picture and on thishere is our young friend shall judge i wager my best nagthat is i would wager him had i one leftthat alice proves the better painter of the twomy sons brain is still misty i think since his defeathe has not got the smoke of worcester out of it plague on theea young man and cast down for one beating had you been banged twenty times like me it had been time to look gravebut come alice forward the colours are mixed on your palletforward with something that shall show like one of vandycks living portraits placed beside the dull dry presentation there of our ancestor victor lee  alice it must be observed had been educated by her father in the notions of high and even exaggerated loyalty which characterized the cavaliers and she was really an enthusiast in the royal cause but besides she was in good spirits at her brothers happy return and wished to prolong the gay humour in which her father had of late scarcely ever indulged  well then she said though i am no apelles i will try to paint an alexander such as i hope and am determined to believe exists in the person of our exiled sovereign soon i trust to be restored and i will not go farther than his own family he shall have all the chivalrous courage all the warlike skill of henry of france his grandfather in order to place him on the throne all his benevolence love of his people patience even of unpleasing advice sacrifice of his own wishes and pleasures to the commonweal that seated there he may be blest while living and so long remembered when dead that for ages after it shall be thought sacrilege to breathe an aspersion against the throne which he had occupied long after he is dead while there remains an old man who has seen him were the condition of that survivor no higher than a groom or a menial his age shall be provided for at the public charge and his grey hairs regarded with more distinction than an earls coronet because he remembers the second charles the monarch of every heart in england  while alice spoke she was hardly conscious of the presence of any one save her father and brother for the page withdrew himself somewhat from the circle and there was nothing to remind her of him she gave the reins therefore to her enthusiasm and as the tears glittered in her eye and her beautiful features became animated she seemed like a descended cherub proclaiming the virtues of a patriot monarch the person chiefly interested in her description held himself back as we have said and concealed his own features yet so as to preserve a full view of the beautiful speaker  albert lee conscious in whose presence this eulogium was pronounced was much embarrassed but his father all whose feelings were flattered by the panegyric was in rapture  so much for the king alice he said and now for the man  for the man replied alice in the same tone need i wish him more than the paternal virtues of his unhappy father of whom his worst enemies have recorded that if moral virtues and religious faith were to be selected as the qualities which merited a crown no man could plead the possession of them in a higher or more indisputable degree temperate wise and frugal yet munificent in rewarding merita friend to letters and the muses but a severe discourager of the misuse of such giftsa worthy gentlemana kind masterthe best friend the best father the best christianher voice began to falter and her fathers handkerchief was already at his eyes  he was girl he was exclaimed sir henry but no more ont i charge yeno more ontenough let his son but possess his virtues with better advisers and better fortunes and he will be all that england in her warmest wishes could desire  there was a pause after this for alice felt as if she had spoken too frankly and too zealously for her sex and youth sir henry was occupied in melancholy recollections on the fate of his late sovereign while kerneguy and his supposed patron felt embarrassed perhaps from a consciousness that the real charles fell far short of his ideal character as designed in such glowing colours in some cases exaggerated or unappropriate praise becomes the most severe satire  but such reflections were not of a nature to be long willingly cherished by the person to whom they might have been of great advantage he assumed a tone of raillery which is perhaps the readiest mode of escaping from the feelings of selfreproof every cavalier he said should bend his knee to thank mistress alice lee for having made such a flattering portrait of the king their master by laying under contribution for his benefit the virtues of all his ancestors only there was one point he would not have expected a female painter to have passed over in silence when she made him in right of his grandfather and father a muster of royal and individual excellences why could she not have endowed him at the same time with his mothers personal charms why should not the son of henrietta maria the finest woman of her day add the recommendations of a handsome face and figure to his internal qualities he had the same hereditary title to good looks as to mental qualifications and the picture with such an addition would be perfect in its wayand god send it might be a resemblance  i understand you master kerneguy said alice but i am no fairy to bestow as those do in the nursery tales gifts which providence has denied i am woman enough to have made enquiries on the subject and i know the general report is that the king to have been the son of such handsome parents is unusually hardfavoured  good god sister said albert starting impatiently from his seat why you yourself told me so said alice surprised at the emotion he testified and you said  this is intolerable muttered albert i must out to speak with joceline without delaylouis with an imploring look to kerneguy you will surely come with me  i would with all my heart said kerneguy smiling maliciously but you see how i suffer still from lamenessnay nay albert he whispered resisting young lees attempt to prevail on him to leave the room can you suppose i am fool enough to be hurt by thison the contrary i have a desire of profiting by it  may god grant it said lee to himself as he left the roomit will be the first lecture you ever profited by and the devil confound the plots and plotters who made me bring you to this place so saying he carried his discontent forth into the park                                         chapter the twentythird     for there they say he daily doth frequent   with unrestrained loose companions   while he young wanton and effeminate boy   takes on the point of honour to support   so dissolute a crew     richard ii  the conversation which albert had in vain endeavoured to interrupt flowed on in the same course after he had left the room it entertained louis kerneguy for personal vanity or an oversensitiveness to deserved reproof were not among the faults of his character and were indeed incompatible with an understanding which combined with more strength of principle steadiness of exertion and selfdenial might have placed charles high on the list of english monarchs on the other hand sir henry listened with natural delight to the noble sentiments uttered by a being so beloved as his daughter his own parts were rather steady than brilliant and he had that species of imagination which is not easily excited without the action of another as the electrical globe only scintillates when rubbed against its cushion he was well pleased therefore when kerneguy pursued the conversation by observing that mistress alice lee had not explained how the same good fairy that conferred moral qualities could not also remove corporeal blemishes  you mistake sir said alice i confer nothing i do but attempt to paint our king such as i hope he issuch as i am sure he may be should he himself desire to be so the same general report which speaks of his countenance as unprepossessing describes his talents as being of the first order he has therefore the means of arriving at excellence should he cultivate them sedulously and employ them usefullyshould he rule his passions and be guided by his understanding every good man cannot be wise but it is in the power of every wise man if he pleases to be as eminent for virtue as for talent  young kerneguy rose briskly and took a turn through the room and ere the knight could make any observation on the singular vivacity in which he had indulged he threw himself again into his chair and said in rather an altered tone of voiceit seems then mistress alice lee that the good friends who have described this poor king to you have been as unfavourable in their account of his morals as of his person  the truth must be better known to you sir said alice than it can be to me some rumours there have been which accuse him of a license which whatever allowance flatterers make for it does not to say the least become the son of the martyri shall be happy to have these contradicted on good authority  i am surprised at your folly said sir henry lee in hinting at such things alice a pack of scandal invented by the rascals who have usurped the governmenta thing devised by the enemy  nay sir said kerneguy laughing we must not let our zeal charge the enemy with more scandal than they actually deserve mistress alice has put the question to me i can only answer that no one can be more devotedly attached to the king than i myselfthat i am very partial to his merits and blind to his defectsand that in short i would be the last man in the world to give up his cause where it was tenable nevertheless i must confess that if all his grandfather of navarres morals have not descended to him this poor king has somehow inherited a share of the specks that were thought to dim the lustre of that great princethat charles is a little softhearted or so where beauty is concerneddo not blame him too severely pretty mistress alice when a mans hard fate has driven him among thorns it were surely hard to prevent him from trifling with the few roses he may find among them  alice who probably thought the conversation had gone far enough rose while master kerneguy was speaking and was leaving the room before he had finished without apparently hearing the interrogation with which he concluded her father approved of her departure not thinking the turn which kerneguy had given to the discourse altogether fit for her presence and desirous civilly to break off the conversation i see he said this is about the time when as will says the household affairs will call my daughter hence i will therefore challenge you young gentleman to stretch your limbs in a little exercise with me either at single rapier or rapier and poniard backsword spadroon or your national weapons of broadsword and target for all or any of which i think we shall find implements in the hall  it would be too high a distinction master kerneguy said for a poor page to be permitted to try a passage of arms with a knight so renowned as sir henry lee and he hoped to enjoy so great an honour before he left woodstock but at the present moment his lameness continued to give him so much pain that he should shame himself in the attempt  sir henry then offered to read him a play of shakspeare and for this purpose turned up king richard ii but hardly had he commenced with    old john of gaunt timehonored lancaster  when the young gentleman was seized with such an incontrollable fit of the cramp as could only be relieved by immediate exercise he therefore begged permission to be allowed to saunter abroad for a little while if sir henry lee considered he might venture without danger  i can answer for the two or three of our people that are still left about the place said sir henry and i know my son has disposed them so as to be constantly on the watch if you hear the bell toll at the lodge i advise you to come straight home by the way of the kings oak which you see in yonder glade towering above the rest of the trees we will have some one stationed there to introduce you secretly into the house  the page listened to these cautions with the impatience of a schoolboy who desirous of enjoying his holiday hears without marking the advice of tutor or parent about taking care not to catch cold and so forth  the absence of alice lee had removed all which had rendered the interior of the lodge agreeable and the mercurial young page fled with precipitation from the exercise and amusement which sir henry had proposed he girded on his rapier and threw his cloak or rather that which belonged to his borrowed suit about him bringing up the lower part so as to muffle the face and show only the eyes over it which was a common way of wearing them in those days both in streets in the country and in public places when men had a mind to be private and to avoid interruption from salutations and greetings in the marketplace he hurried across the open space which divided the front of the lodge from the wood with the haste of a bird escaped from the cage which though joyful at its liberation is at the same time sensible of its need of protection and shelter the wood seemed to afford these to the human fugitive as it might have done to the bird in question  when under the shadow of the branches and within the verge of the forest covered from observation yet with the power of surveying the front of the lodge and all the open ground before it the supposed louis kerneguy meditated on his escape  what an inflictionto fence with a gouty old man who knows not i dare say a trick of the sword which was not familiar in the days of old vincent saviolo or as a change of misery to hear him read one of those wildernesses of scenes which the english call a play from prologue to epiloguefrom enter the first to the final exeunt omnesan unparalleled horrora penance which would have made a dungeon darker and added dullness even to woodstock  here he stopped and looked around then continued his meditationsso then it was here that the gay old norman secluded his pretty mistressi warrant without having seen her that rosamond clifford was never half so handsome as that lovely alice lee and what a soul there is in the girls eyewith what abandonment of all respects save that expressing the interest of the moment she poured forth her tide of enthusiasm were i to be long here in spite of prudence and halfadozen very venerable obstacles beside i should be tempted to try to reconcile her to the indifferent visage of this same hardfavoured princehard favouredit is a kind of treason for one who pretends to so much loyalty to say so of the kings features and in my mind deserves punishmentah pretty mistress alice many a mistress alice before you has made dreadful exclamations on the irregularities of mankind and the wickedness of the age and ended by being glad to look out for apologies for their own share in them but then her fatherthe stout old cavaliermy fathers old friendshould such a thing befall it would break his heartbreak a puddingsendhe has more sense if i give his grandson a title to quarter the arms of england what matter if a bar sinister is drawn across thempshaw far from an abatement it is a point of additionthe heralds in their next visitation will place him higher in the roll for it then if he did wince a little at first does not the old traitor deserve itfirst for his disloyal intention of punching mine anointed body black and blue with his vile foilsand secondly his atrocious complot with will shakspeare a fellow as much out of date as himself to read me to death with five acts of a historical play or chronicle being the piteous life and death of richard the second oddsfish my own life is piteous enough as i think and my death may match it for aught i see coming yet ah but then the brothermy friendmy guidemy guardso far as this little proposed intrigue concerns him such practising would be thought not quite fair but your bouncing swaggering revengeful brothers exist only on the theatre your dire revenge with which a brother persecuted a poor fellow who had seduced his sister or been seduced by her as the case might be as relentlessly as if he had trodden on his toes without making an apology is entirely out of fashion since dorset killed the lord bruce many a long year since pshaw when a king is the offender the bravest man sacrifices nothing by pocketing a little wrong which he cannot personally resent and in france there is not a noble house where each individual would not cock his hat an inch higher if they could boast of such a lefthanded alliance with the grand monarque  such were the thoughts which rushed through the mind of charles at his first quitting the lodge of woodstock and plunging into the forest that surrounded it his profligate logic however was not the result of his natural disposition nor received without scruple by his sound understanding it was a train of reasoning which he had been led to adopt from his too close intimacy with the witty and profligate youth of quality by whom he had been surrounded it arose from the evil communication with villiers wilmot sedley and others whose genius was destined to corrupt that age and the monarch on whom its character afterwards came so much to depend such men bred amidst the license of civil war and without experiencing that curb which in ordinary times the authority of parents and relations imposes upon the headlong passions of youth were practised in every species of vice and could recommend it as well by precept as by example turning into pitiless ridicule all those nobler feelings which withhold men from gratifying lawless passion the events of the kings life had also favoured his reception of this epicurean doctrine he saw himself with the highest claims to sympathy and assistance coldly treated by the courts which he visited rather as a permitted supplicant than an exiled monarch he beheld his own rights and claims treated with scorn and indifference and in the same proportion he was reconciled to the hardhearted and selfish course of dissipation which promised him immediate indulgence if this was obtained at the expense of the happiness of others should he of all men be scrupulous upon the subject since he treated others only as the world treated him  but although the foundations of this unhappy system had been laid the prince was not at this early period so fully devoted to it as he was found to have become when a door was unexpectedly opened for his restoration on the contrary though the train of gay reasoning which we have above stated as if it had found vent in uttered language did certainly arise in his mind as that which would have been suggested by his favourite counsellors on such occasions he recollected that what might be passed over as a peccadillo in france or the netherlands or turned into a diverting novel or pasquinade by the wits of his own wandering court was likely to have the aspect of horrid ingratitude and infamous treachery among the english gentry and would inflict a deep perhaps an incurable wound upon his interests among the more aged and respectable part of his adherents then it occurred to himfor his own interest did not escape him even in this mode of considering the subjectthat he was in the power of the lees father and son who were always understood to be at least sufficiently punctilious on the score of honour and if they should suspect such an affront as his imagination had conceived they could be at no loss to find means of the most ample revenge either by their own hands or by those of the ruling faction  the risk of reopening the fatal window at whitehall and renewing the tragedy of the man in the mask were a worse penalty was his final reflection than the old stool of the scottish penance and pretty though alice lee is i cannot afford to intrigue at such a hazard so farewell pretty maiden unless as sometimes has happened thou hast a humour to throw thyself at thy kings feet and then i am too magnanimous to refuse thee my protection yet when i think of the pale claycold figure of the old man as he lay last night extended before me and imagine the fury of albert lee raging with impatience his hand on a sword which only his loyalty prevents him from plunging into his sovereigns heartnay the picture is too horrible charles must for ever change his name to joseph even if he were strongly tempted which may fortune in mercy prohibit  to speak the truth of a prince more unfortunate in his early companions and the callousness which he acquired by his juvenile adventures and irregular mode of life than in his natural disposition charles came the more readily to this wise conclusion because he was by no means subject to those violent and engrossing passions to gratify which the world has been thought well lost his amours like many of the present day were rather matters of habit and fashion than of passion and affection and in comparing himself in this respect to his grandfather henry iv he did neither his ancestor nor himself perfect justice he was to parody the words of a bard himself actuated by the stormy passions which an intriguer often only simulates     none of those who loved so kindly    none of those who loved so blindly  an amour was with him a matter of amusement a regular consequence as it seemed to him of the ordinary course of things in society he was not at the trouble to practise seductive arts because he had seldom found occasion to make use of them his high rank and the profligacy of part of the female society with which he had mingled rendering them unnecessary added to this he had for the same reason seldom been crossed by the obstinate interference of relations or even of husbands who had generally seemed not unwilling to suffer such matters to take their course  so that notwithstanding his total looseness of principle and systematic disbelief in the virtue of women and the honour of men as connected with the character of their female relatives charles was not a person to have studiously introduced disgrace into a family where a conquest might have been violently disputed attained with difficulty and accompanied with general distress not to mention the excitation of all fiercer passions against the author of the scandal  but the danger of the kings society consisted in his being much of an unbeliever in the existence of such cases as were likely to be embittered by remorse on the part of the principal victim or rendered perilous by the violent resentment of her connexions or relatives he had even already found such things treated on the continent as matters of ordinary occurrence subject in all cases where a man of high influence was concerned to an easy arrangement and he was really generally speaking sceptical on the subject of severe virtue in either sex and apt to consider it as a veil assumed by prudery in women and hypocrisy in men to extort a higher reward for their compliance  while we are discussing the character of his disposition to gallantry the wanderer was conducted by the walk he had chosen through several whimsical turns until at last it brought him under the windows of victor lees apartment where he descried alice watering and arranging some flowers placed on the oriel window which was easily accessible by daylight although at night he had found it a dangerous attempt to scale it but not alice only her father also showed himself near the window and beckoned him up the family party seemed now more promising than before and the fugitive prince was weary of playing battledore and shuttlecock with his conscience and much disposed to let matters go as chance should determine  he climbed lightly up the broken ascent and was readily welcomed by the old knight who held activity in high honour alice also seemed glad to see the lively and interesting young man and by her presence and the unaffected mirth with which she enjoyed his sallies he was animated to display those qualities of wit and humour which nobody possessed in a higher degree  his satire delighted the old gentleman who laughed till his eyes ran over as he heard the youth whose claims to his respect he little dreamed of amusing him with successive imitations of the scottish presbyterian clergymen of the proud and poor hidalgo of the north of the fierce and overweening pride and celtic dialect of the mountain chief of the slow and more pedantic lowlander with all of which his residence in scotland had made him familiar alice also laughed and applauded amused herself and delighted to see that her father was so and the whole party were in the highest glee when albert lee entered eager to find louis kerneguy and to lead him away to a private colloquy with dr rochecliffe whose zeal assiduity and wonderful possession of information had constituted him their masterpilot in those difficult times  it is unnecessary to introduce the reader to the minute particulars of their conference the information obtained was so far favourable that the enemy seemed to have had no intelligence of the kings route towards the south and remained persuaded that he had made his escape from bristol as had been reported and as had indeed been proposed but the master of the vessel prepared for the kings passage had taken the alarm and sailed without his royal freight his departure however and the suspicion of the service in which he was engaged served to make the belief general that the king had gone off along with him  but though this was cheering the doctor had more unpleasant tidings from the seacoast alleging great difficulties in securing a vessel to which it might be fit to commit a charge so precious and above all requesting his majesty might on no account venture to approach the shore until he should receive advice that all the previous arrangements had been completely settled  no one was able to suggest a safer place of residence than that which he at present occupied colonel everard was deemed certainly not personally unfriendly to the king and cromwell as was supposed reposed in everard an unbounded confidence the interior presented numberless hidingplaces and secret modes of exit known to no one but the ancient residents of the lodgenay far better to rochecliffe than to any of them as when rector at the neighbouring town his prying disposition as an antiquary had induced him to make very many researches among the old ruinsthe results of which he was believed in some instances to have kept to himself  to balance these conveniences it was no doubt true that the parliamentary commissioners were still at no great distance and would be ready to resume their authority upon the first opportunity but no one supposed such an opportunity was likely to occur and all believed as the influence of cromwell and the army grew more and more predominant that the disappointed commissioners would attempt nothing in contradiction to his pleasure but wait with patience an indemnification in some other quarter for their vacated commissions report through the voice of master joseph tomkins stated that they had determined in the first place to retire to oxford and were making preparations accordingly this promised still farther to insure the security of woodstock it was therefore settled that the king under the character of louis kerneguy should remain an inmate of the lodge until a vessel should be procured for his escape at the port which might be esteemed the safest and most convenient                                         chapter the twentyfourth      the deadliest snakes are those which twined mongst flowers    blend their bright colouring with the varied blossoms    their fierce eyes glittering like the spangled dewdrop    in all so like what nature has most harmless    that sportive innocence which dreads no danger    is poisond unawares     old play  charles we must now give him his own name was easily reconciled to the circumstances which rendered his residence at woodstock advisable no doubt he would much rather have secured his safety by making an immediate escape out of england but he had been condemned already to many uncomfortable lurkingplaces and more disagreeable disguises as well as to long and difficult journeys during which between pragmatical officers of justice belonging to the prevailing party and parties of soldiers whose officers usually took on them to act on their own warrant risk of discovery had more than once become very imminent he was glad therefore of comparative repose and of comparative safety  then it must be considered that charles had been entirely reconciled to the society at woodstock since he had become better acquainted with it he had seen that to interest the beautiful alice and procure a great deal of her company nothing more was necessary than to submit to the humours and cultivate the intimacy of the old cavalier her father a few bouts at fencing in which charles took care not to put out his more perfect skill and full youthful strength and activitythe endurance of a few scenes from shakspeare which the knight read with more zeal than tastea little skill in music in which the old man had been a proficientthe deference paid to a few oldfashioned opinions at which charles laughed in his sleevewere allsufficient to gain for the disguised prince an interest in sir henry lee and to conciliate in an equal degree the goodwill of his lovely daughter  never were there two young persons who could be said to commence this species of intimacy with such unequal advantages charles was a libertine who if he did not in cold blood resolve upon prosecuting his passion for alice to a dishonourable conclusion was at every moment liable to be provoked to attempt the strength of a virtue in which he was no believer then alice on her part hardly knew even what was implied by the word libertine or seducer her mother had died early in the commencement of the civil war and she had been bred up chiefly with her brother and cousin so that she had an unfearing and unsuspicious frankness of manner upon which charles was not unwilling or unlikely to put a construction favourable to his own views even alices love for her cousinthe first sensation which awakens the most innocent and simple mind to feelings of shyness and restraint towards the male sex in generalhad failed to excite such an alarm in her bosom they were nearly related and everard though young was several years her elder and had from her infancy been an object of her respect as well as of her affection when this early and childish intimacy ripened into youthful love confessed and returned still it differed in some shades from the passion existing between lovers originally strangers to each other until their affections have been united in the ordinary course of courtship their love was fonder more familiar more perfectly confidential purer too perhaps and more free from starts of passionate violence or apprehensive jealousy  the possibility that any one could have attempted to rival everard in her affection was a circumstance which never occurred to alice and that this singular scottish lad whom she laughed with on account of his humour and laughed at for his peculiarities should be an object of danger or of caution never once entered her imagination the sort of intimacy to which she admitted kerneguy was the same to which she would have received a companion of her own sex whose manners she did not always approve but whose society she found always amusing  it was natural that the freedom of alice lees conduct which arose from the most perfect indifference should pass for something approaching to encouragement in the royal gallants apprehension and that any resolutions he had formed against being tempted to violate the hospitality of woodstock should begin to totter as opportunities for doing so became more frequent  these opportunities were favoured by alberts departure from woodstock the very day after his arrival it had been agreed in full council with charles and rochecliffe that he should go to visit his uncle everard in the county of kent and by showing himself there obviate any cause of suspicion which might arise from his residence at woodstock and remove any pretext for disturbing his fathers family on account of their harbouring one who had been so lately in arms he had also undertaken at his own great personal risk to visit different points on the seacoast and ascertain the security of different places for providing shipping for the kings leaving england  these circumstances were alike calculated to procure the kings safety and facilitate his escape but alice was thereby deprived of the presence of her brother who would have been her most watchful guardian but who had set down the kings light talk upon a former occasion to the gaiety of his humour and would have thought he had done his sovereign great injustice had he seriously suspected him of such a breach of hospitality as a dishonourable pursuit of alice would have implied  there were however two of the household at woodstock who appeared not so entirely reconciled with louis kerneguy or his purposes the one was bevis who seemed from their first unfriendly rencontre to have kept up a pique against their new guest which no advances on the part of charles were able to soften if the page was by chance left alone with his young mistress bevis chose always to be of the party came close by alices chair and growled audibly when the gallant drew near her it is a pity said the disguised prince that your bevis is not a bulldog that we might dub him a roundhead at oncehe is too handsome too noble too aristocratic to nourish those inhospitable prejudices against a poor houseless cavalier i am convinced the spirit of pym or hampden has transmigrated into the rogue and continues to demonstrate his hatred against royalty and all its adherents  alice would then reply that bevis was loyal in word and deed and only partook her fathers prejudices against the scots which she could not but acknowledge were tolerably strong  nay then said the supposed louis i must find some other reason for i cannot allow sir beviss resentment to rest upon national antipathy so we will suppose that some gallant cavalier who wended to the wars and never returned has adopted this shape to look back upon the haunts he left so unwillingly and is jealous at seeing even poor louis kerneguy drawing near to the lady of his lost affectionshe approached her chair as he spoke and bevis gave one of his deep growls  in that case you had best keep your distance said alice laughing for the bite of a dog possessed by the ghost of a jealous lover cannot be very safe and the king carried on the dialogue in the same strainwhich while it led alice to apprehend nothing more serious than the apish gallantry of a fantastic boy certainly induced the supposed louis kerneguy to think that he had made one of those conquests which often and easily fall to the share of sovereigns notwithstanding the acuteness of his apprehension he was not sufficiently aware that the royal road to female favour is only open to monarchs when they travel in grand costume and that when they woo incognito their path of courtship is liable to the same windings and obstacles which obstruct the course of private individuals  there was besides bevis another member of the family who kept a lookout upon louis kerneguy and with no friendly eye phoebe mayflower though her experience extended not beyond the sphere of the village yet knew the world much better than her mistress and besides she was five years older more knowing she was more suspicious she thought that oddlooking scotch boy made more up to her young mistress than was proper for his condition of life and moreover that alice gave him a little more encouragement than parthenia would have afforded to any such jackadandy in the absence of argalusfor the volume treating of the loves of these celebrated arcadians was then the favourite study of swains and damsels throughout merry england entertaining such suspicions phoebe was at a loss how to conduct herself on the occasion and yet resolved she would not see the slightest chance of the course of colonel everards true love being obstructed without attempting a remedy she had a peculiar favour for markham herself and moreover he was according to her phrase as handsome and personable a young man as was in oxfordshire and this scottish scarecrow was no more to be compared to him than chalk was to cheese and yet she allowed that master girnigy had a wonderfully welloiled tongue and that such gallants were not to be despised what was to be doneshe had no facts to offer only vague suspicion and was afraid to speak to her mistress whose kindness great as it was did not nevertheless encourage familiarity  she sounded joceline but he was she knew not why so deeply interested about this unlucky lad and held his importance so high that she could make no impression on him to speak to the old knight would have been to raise a general tempest the worthy chaplain who was at woodstock grand referee on all disputed matters would have been the damsels most natural resource for he was peaceful as well as moral by profession and politic by practice but it happened he had given phoebe unintentional offence by speaking of her under the classical epithet of rustica fidele the which epithet as she understood it not she held herself bound to resent as contumelious and declaring she was not fonder of a fiddle than other folk had ever since shunned all intercourse with dr rochecliffe which she could easily avoid  master tomkins was always coming and going about the house under various pretexts but he was a roundhead and she was too true to the cavaliers to introduce any of the enemy as parties to their internal discords besides he had talked to phoebe herself in a manner which induced her to decline everything in the shape of familiarity with him lastly cavaliero wildrake might have been consulted but phoebe had her own reasons for saying as she did with some emphasis that cavaliero wildrake was an impudent london rake at length she resolved to communicate her suspicions to the party having most interest in verifying or confuting them  ill let master markham everard know that there is a wasp buzzing about his honeycomb said phoebe and moreover that i know that this young scotch scapegrace shifted himself out of a womans into a mans dress at goody greens and gave goody greens dolly a goldpiece to say nothing about it and no more she did to any one but me and she knows best herself whether she gave change for the gold or notbut master louis is a saucy jackanapes and like enough to ask it  three or four days elapsed while matters continued in this conditionthe disguised prince sometimes thinking on the intrigue which fortune seemed to have thrown in his way for his amusement and taking advantage of such opportunities as occurred to increase his intimacy with alice lee but much oftener harassing dr rochecliffe with questions about the possibility of escape which the good man finding himself unable to answer secured his leisure against royal importunity by retreating into the various unexplored recesses of the lodge known perhaps only to himself who had been for nearly a score of years employed in writing the wonders of woodstock  it chanced on the fourth day that some trifling circumstance had called the knight abroad and he had left the young scotsman now familiar in the family along with alice in the parlour of victor lee thus situated he thought the time not unpropitious for entering upon a strain of gallantry of a kind which might be called experimental such as is practised by the croats in skirmishing when they keep bridle in hand ready to attack the enemy or canter off without coming to close quarters as circumstances may recommend after using for nearly ten minutes a sort of metaphysical jargon which might according to alices pleasure have been interpreted either into gallantry or the language of serious pretension and when he supposed her engaged in fathoming his meaning he had the mortification to find by a single and brief question that he had been totally unattended to and that alice was thinking on anything at the moment rather than the sense of what he had been saying she asked him if he could tell what it was oclock and this with an air of real curiosity concerning the lapse of time which put coquetry wholly out of the question  i will go look at the sundial mistress alice said the gallant rising and colouring through a sense of the contempt with which he thought himself treated  you will do me a pleasure master kerneguy said alice without the least consciousness of the indignation she had excited  master louis kerneguy left the room accordingly not however to procure the information required but to vent his anger and mortification and to swear with more serious purpose than he had dared to do before that alice should rue her insolence goodnatured as he was he was still a prince unaccustomed to contradiction far less to contempt and his self pride felt for the moment wounded to the quick with a hasty step he plunged into the chase only remembering his own safety so far as to choose the deeper and sequestered avenues where walking on with the speedy and active step which his recovery from fatigue now permitted him to exercise according to his wont he solaced his angry purposes by devising schemes of revenge on the insolent country coquette from which no consideration of hospitality was in future to have weight enough to save her  the irritated gallant passed     the dialstone aged and green  without deigning to ask it a single question nor could it have satisfied his curiosity if he had for no sun happened to shine at the moment he then hastened forward muffling himself in his cloak and assuming a stooping and slouching gait which diminished his apparent height he was soon involved in the deep and dim alleys of the wood into which he had insensibly plunged himself and was traversing it at a great rate without having any distinct idea in what direction he was going when suddenly his course was arrested first by a loud hello and then by a summons to stand accompanied by what seemed still more startling and extraordinary the touch of a cane upon his shoulder imposed in a goodhumoured but somewhat imperious manner  there were few symptoms of recognition which would have been welcome at this moment but the appearance of the person who had thus arrested his course was least of all that he could have anticipated as timely or agreeable when he turned on receiving the signal he beheld himself close to a young man nearly six feet in height well made in joint and limb but the gravity of whose apparel although handsome and gentlemanlike and a sort of precision in his habit from the cleanness and stiffness of his band to the unsullied purity of his spanishleather shoes bespoke a love of order which was foreign to the impoverished and vanquished cavaliers and proper to the habits of those of the victorious party who could afford to dress themselves handsomely and whose rulethat is such as regarded the higher and more respectable classesenjoined decency and sobriety of garb and deportment there was yet another weight against the prince in the scale and one still more characteristic of the inequality in the comparison under which he seemed to labour there was strength in the muscular form of the stranger who had brought him to this involuntary parley authority and determination in his brow a long rapier on the left and a poniard or dagger on the right side of his belt and a pair of pistols stuck into it which would have been sufficient to give the unknown the advantage louis kerneguy having no weapon but his sword even had his personal strength approached nearer than it did to that of the person by whom he was thus suddenly stopped  bitterly regretting the thoughtless fit of passion that brought him into his present situation but especially the want of the pistols he had left behind and which do so much to place bodily strength and weakness upon an equal footing charles yet availed himself of the courage and presence of mind in which few of his unfortunate family had for centuries been deficient he stood firm and without motion his cloak still wrapped round the lower part of his face to give time for explanation in case he was mistaken for some other person  this coolness produced its effect for the other party saidwith doubt and surprise on his part joceline joliffe is it notif i know not joceline joliffe i should at least know my own cloak  i am not joceline joliffe as you may see sir said kerneguy calmly drawing himself erect to show the difference of size and dropping the cloak from his face and person  indeed replied the stranger in surprise then sir unknown i have to express my regret at having used my cane in intimating that i wished you to stop from that dress which i certainly recognise for my own i concluded you must be joceline in whose custody i had left my habit at the lodge  if it had been joceline sir replied the supposed kerneguy with perfect composure methinks you should not have struck so hard the other party was obviously confused by the steady calmness with which he was encountered the sense of politeness dictated in the first place an apology for a mistake when he thought he had been tolerably certain of the person master kerneguy was not in a situation to be punctilious he bowed gravely as indicating his acceptance of the excuse offered then turned and walked as he conceived towards the lodge though he had traversed the woods which were cut with various alleys in different directions too hastily to be certain of the real course which he wished to pursue  he was much embarrassed to find that this did not get him rid of the companion whom he had thus involuntarily acquired walked he slow walked he fast his friend in the genteel but puritanic habit strong in person and well armed as we have described him seemed determined to keep him company and without attempting to join or enter into conversation never suffered him to outstrip his surveillance for more than two or three yards the wanderer mended his pace but although he was then in his youth as afterwards in his riper age one of the best walkers in britain the stranger without advancing his pace to a run kept fully equal to him and his persecution became so close and constant and inevitable that the pride and fear of charles were both alarmed and he began to think that whatever the danger might be of a singlehanded rencontre he would nevertheless have a better bargain of this tall satellite if they settled the debate betwixt them in the forest than if they drew near any place of habitation where the man in authority was likely to find friends and concurrents  betwixt anxiety therefore vexation and anger charles faced suddenly round on his pursuer as they reached a small narrow glade which led to the little meadow over which presided the kings oak the ragged and scathed branches and gigantic trunk of which formed a vista to the little wild avenue  sir said he to his pursuer you have already been guilty of one piece of impertinence towards me you have apologised and knowing no reason why you should distinguish me as an object of incivility i have accepted your excuse without scruple is there any thing remains to be settled betwixt us which causes you to follow me in this manner if so i shall be glad to make it a subject of explanation or satisfaction as the case may admit of i think you can owe me no malice for i never saw you before to my knowledge if you can give any good reason for asking it i am willing to render you personal satisfaction if your purpose is merely impertinent curiosity i let you know that i will not suffer myself to be dogged in my private walks by any one  when i recognise my own cloak on another mans shoulders replied the stranger dryly methinks i have a natural right to follow and see what becomes of it for know sir though i have been mistaken as to the wearer yet i am confident i had as good a right to stretch my cane across the cloak you are muffled in as ever had any one to brush his own garments if therefore we are to be friends i must ask for instance how you came by that cloak and where you are going with it i shall otherwise make bold to stop you as one who has sufficient commission to do so  oh unhappy cloak thought the wanderer ay and thrice unhappy the idle fancy that sent me here with it wrapped around my nose to pick quarrels and attract observation when quiet and secrecy were peculiarly essential to my safety  if you will allow me to guess sir continued the stranger who was no other than markham everard i will convince you that you are better known than you think for  now heaven forbid prayed the party addressed in silence but with as much devotion as ever he applied to a prayer in his life yet even in this moment of extreme urgency his courage and composure did not fail and he recollected it was of the utmost importance not to seem startled and to answer so as if possible to lead the dangerous companion with whom he had met to confess the extent of his actual knowledge or suspicions concerning him  if you know me sir he said and are a gentleman as your appearance promises you cannot be at a loss to discover to what accident you must attribute my wearing these clothes which you say are yours oh sir replied colonel everard his wrath in no sort turned away by the mildness of the strangers answerwe have learned our ovids metamorphoses and we know for what purposes young men of quality travel in disguisewe know that even female attire is resorted to on certain occasionswe have heard of vertumnus and pomona  the monarch as he weighed these words again uttered a devout prayer that this illlooking affair might have no deeper root than the jealousy of some admirer of alice lee promising to himself that devotee as he was to the fair sex he would make no scruple of renouncing the fairest of eves daughters in order to get out of the present dilemma  sir he said you seem to be a gentleman i have no objection to tell you as such that i also am of that class  or somewhat higher perhaps said everard  a gentleman replied charles is a term which comprehends all ranks entitled to armorial bearingsa duke a lord a prince is no more than a gentleman and if in misfortune as i am he may be glad if that general term of courtesy is allowed him  sir replied everard i have no purpose to entrap you to any acknowledgment fatal to your own safetynor do i hold it my business to be active in the arrest of private individuals whose perverted sense of national duty may have led them into errors rather to be pitied than punished by candid men but if those who have brought civil war and disturbance into their native country proceed to carry dishonour and disgrace into the bosom of familiesif they attempt to carry on their private debaucheries to the injury of the hospitable roofs which afford them refuge from the consequences of their public crimes do you think my lord that we shall bear it with patience  if it is your purpose to quarrel with me said the prince speak it out at once like a gentleman you have the advantage no doubt of arms but it is not that odds which will induce me to fly from a single man if on the other hand you are disposed to hear reason i tell you in calm words that i neither suspect the offence to which you allude nor comprehend why you give me the title of my lord  you deny then being the lord wilmot said everard  i may do so most safely said the prince  perhaps you rather style yourself earl of rochester we heard that the issuing of some such patent by the king of scots was a step which your ambition proposed  neither lord nor earl am i as sure as i have a christian soul to be saved my name is  do not degrade yourself by unnecessary falsehood my lord and that to a single man who i promise you will not invoke public justice to assist his own good sword should he see cause to use it can you look at that ring and deny that you are lord wilmot  he handed to the disguised prince a ring which he took from his purse and his opponent instantly knew it for the same he had dropped into alices pitcher at the fountain obeying only through imprudently the gallantry of the moment in giving a pretty gem to a handsome girl whom he had accidentally frightened  i know the ring he said it has been in my possession how it should prove me to be lord wilmot i cannot conceive and beg to say it bears false witness against me  you shall see the evidence answered everard and resuming the ring he pressed a spring ingeniously contrived in the collet of the setting on which the stone flew back and showed within it the cipher of lord wilmot beautifully engraved in miniature with a coronetwhat say you now sir  that probabilities are no proofs said the prince there is nothing here save what may be easily accounted for i am the son of a scottish nobleman who was mortally wounded and made prisoner at worcester fight when he took leave and bid me fly he gave me the few valuables he possessed and that among others i have heard him talk of having changed rings with lord wilmot on some occasion in scotland but i never knew the trick of the gem which you have shown me  in this it may be necessary to say charles spoke very truly nor would he have parted with it in the way he did had he suspected it would be easily recognised he proceeded after a minutes pauseonce more siri have told you much that concerns my safetyif you are generous you will let me pass and i may do you on some future day as good service if you mean to arrest me you must do so here and at your own peril for i will neither walk farther your way nor permit you to dog me on mine if you let me pass i will thank you if not take to your weapon  young gentleman said colonel everard whether you be actually the gay young nobleman for whom i took you you have made me uncertain but intimate as you say your family has been with him i have little doubt that you are proficient in the school of debauchery of which wilmot and villiers are professors and their hopeful master a graduated student your conduct at woodstock where you have rewarded the hospitality of the family by meditating the most deadly wound to their honour has proved you too apt a scholar in such an academy i intended only to warn you on this subjectit will be your own fault if i add chastisement to admonition  warn me sir said the prince indignantly and chastisement this is presuming more on my patience than is consistent with your own safety draw sirso saying he laid his hand on his sword  my religion said everard forbids me to be rash in shedding bloodgo home sirbe wiseconsult the dictates of honour as well as prudence respect the honour of the house of lee and know there is one nearly allied to it by whom your motions will be called to severe account  aha said the prince with a bitter laugh i see the whole matter nowwe have our roundheaded colonel our puritan cousin before usthe man of texts and morals whom alice lee laughs at so heartily if your religion sir prevents you from giving satisfaction it should prevent you from offering insult to a person of honour  the passions of both were now fully upthey drew mutually and began to fight the colonel relinquishing the advantage he could have obtained by the use of his firearms a thrust of the arm or a slip of the foot might at the moment have changed the destinies of britain when the arrival of a third party broke off the combat                                         chapter the twentyfifth     stayfor the king has thrown his warder down     richard ii  the combatants whom we left engaged at the end of the last chapter made mutual passes at each other with apparently equal skill and courage charles had been too often in action and too long a party as well as a victim to civil war to find any thing new or surprising in being obliged to defend himself with his own hands and everard had been distinguished as well for his personal bravery as for the other properties of a commander but the arrival of a third party prevented the tragic conclusion of a combat in which the success of either party must have given him much cause for regretting his victory  it was the old knight himself who arrived mounted upon a forest pony for the war and sequestration had left him no steed of a more dignified description he thrust himself between the combatants and commanded them on their lives to hold so soon as a glance from one to the other had ascertained to him whom he had to deal with he demanded whether the devils of woodstock whom folk talked about had got possession of them both that they were tilting at each other within the verge of the royal liberties let me tell both of you he said that while old henry lee is at woodstock the immunities of the park shall be maintained as much as if the king were still on the throne none shall fight duellos here excepting the stags in their season put up both of you or i shall lug out as thirdsman and prove perhaps the worst devil of the threeas will says    ill so maul you and your toastingirons   that you shall think the devil has come from hell  the combatants desisted from their encounter but stood looking at each other sullenly as men do in such a situation each unwilling to seem to desire peace more than the other and averse therefore to be the first to sheathe his sword  return your weapons gentlemen upon the spot said the knight yet more peremptorily one and both of you or you will have something to do with me i promise you you may be thankful times are changed i have known them such that your insolence might have cost each of you your right hand if not redeemed with a round sum of money nephew if you do not mean to alienate me for ever i command you to put upmaster kerneguy you are my guest i request of you not to do me the insult of remaining with your sword drawn where it is my duty to see peace observed  i obey you sir henry said the king sheathing his rapieri hardly indeed know wherefore i was assaulted by this gentleman i assure you none respects the kings person or privileges more than myselfthough the devotion is somewhat out of fashion  we may find a place to meet sir replied everard where neither the royal person nor privileges can be offended  faith very hardly sir said charles unable to suppress the rising jesti mean the king has so few followers that the loss of the least of them might be some small damage to him but risking all that i will meet you wherever there is fair field for a poor cavalier to get off in safety if he has the luck in fight  sir henry lees first idea had been fixed upon the insult offered to the royal demesne he now began to turn them towards the safety of his kinsman and of the young royalist as he deemed him gentlemen he said i must insist on this business being put to a final end nephew markham is this your return for my condescension in coming back to woodstock on your warrant that you should take an opportunity to cut the throat of my guest  if you knew his purpose as well as i dosaid markham and then paused conscious that he might only incense his uncle without convincing him as any thing he might say of kerneguys addresses to alice was likely to be imputed to his own jealous suspicionshe looked on the ground therefore and was silent  and you master kerneguy said sir henry can you give me any reason why you seek to take the life of this young man in whom though unhappily forgetful of his loyalty and duty i must yet take some interest as my nephew by affinity  i was not aware the gentleman enjoyed that honour which certainly would have protected him from my sword answered kerneguy but the quarrel is his nor can i tell any reason why he fixed it upon me unless it were the difference of our political opinions  you know the contrary said everard you know that i told you you were safe from me as a fugitive royalistand your last words showed you were at no loss to guess my connexion with sir henry that indeed is of little consequence i should debase myself did i use the relationship as a means of protection from you or any one  as they thus disputed neither choosing to approach the real cause of quarrel sir henry looked from one to the other with a peacemaking conscience exclaiming    why what an intricate impeach is this   i think you both have drunk of circes cup  come my young masters allow an old man to mediate between you i am not shortsighted in such mattersthe mother of mischief is no bigger than a gnats wing and i have known fifty instances in my own day when as will says    gallants have been confronted hardily   in single opposition hand to hand  in which after the field was fought no one could remember the cause of quarreltush a small thing will do itthe taking of the wallor the gentle rub of the shoulder in passing each other or a hasty word or a misconceived gesturecome forget your cause of quarrel be what it willyou have had your breathing and though you put up your rapiers unbloodied that was no default of yours but by command of your elder and one who had right to use authority in malta where the duello is punctiliously well understood the persons engaged in a single combat are bound to halt on the command of a knight or priest or lady and the quarrel so interrupted is held as honourably terminated and may not be revivednephew it is i think impossible that you can nourish spleen against this young gentleman for having fought for his king hear my honest proposal markhamyou know i bear no malice though i have some reason to be offended with yougive the young man your hand in friendship and we will back to the lodge all three together and drink a cup of sack in token of reconciliation  markham everard found himself unable to resist this approach towards kindness on his uncles part he suspected indeed what was partly the truth that it was not entirely from reviving goodwill but also that his uncle thought by such attention to secure his neutrality at least if not his assistance for the safety of the fugitive royalist he was sensible that he was placed in an awkward predicament and that he might incur the suspicions of his own party for holding intercourse even with a near relation who harboured such guests but on the other hand he thought his services to the commonwealth had been of sufficient importance to outweigh whatever envy might urge on that topic indeed although the civil war had divided families much and in many various ways yet when it seemed ended by the triumph of the republicans the rage of political hatred began to relent and the ancient ties of kindred and friendship regained at least a part of their former influence many reunions were formed and those who like everard adhered to the conquering party often exerted themselves for the protection of their deserted relatives  as these things rushed through his mind accompanied with the prospect of a renewed intercourse with alice lee by means of which he might be at hand to protect her against every chance either of injury or insult he held out his hand to the supposed scottish page saying at the same time that for his part he was very ready to forget the cause of quarrel or rather to consider it as arising out of a misapprehension and to offer master kerneguy such friendship as might exist between honourable men who had embraced different sides in politics  unable to overcome the feeling of personal dignity which prudence recommended him to forget louis kerneguy in return bowed low but without accepting everards proffered hand  he had no occasion he said to make any exertions to forget the cause of quarrel for he had never been able to comprehend it but as he had not shunned the gentlemans resentment so he was now willing to embrace and return any degree of his favour with which he might be pleased to honour him  everard withdrew his hand with a smile and bowed in return to the salutation of the page whose stiff reception of his advances he imputed to the proud pettish disposition of a scotch boy trained up in extravagant ideas of family consequence and personal importance which his acquaintance with the world had not yet been sufficient to dispel  sir henry lee delighted with the termination of the quarrel which he supposed to be in deep deference to his own authority and not displeased with the opportunity of renewing some acquaintance with his nephew who had notwithstanding his political demerits a warmer interest in his affections than he was perhaps himself aware of said in a tone of consolation never be mortified young gentlemen i protest it went to my heart to part you when i saw you stretching yourselves so handsomely and in fair love of honour without any malicious or bloodthirsty thoughts i promise you had it not been for my duty as ranger here and sworn to the office i would rather have been your umpire than your hinderancebut a finished quarrel is a forgotten quarrel and your tilting should have no further consequence excepting the appetite it may have given you  so saying he urged forward his pony and moved in triumph towards the lodge by the nearest alley his feet almost touching the ground the ball of his toe just resting in the stirrupthe forepart of the thigh brought round to the saddlethe heels turned outwards and sunk as much as possiblehis body precisely erectthe reins properly and systematically divided in his left hand his right holding a ridingrod diagonally pointed towards the horses left earhe seemed a champion of the manege fit to have reined bucephalus himself his youthful companions who attended on either hand like equerries could scarcely suppress a smile at the completely adjusted and systematic posture of the rider contrasted with the wild and diminutive appearance of the pony with its shaggy coat and long tail and mane and its keen eyes sparkling like red coals from amongst the mass of hair which fell over its small countenance if the reader has the duke of newcastles book on horsemanship splendida moles he may have some idea of the figure of the good knight if he can conceive such a figure as one of the cavaliers there represented seated in all the graces of his art on a welsh or exmoor pony in its native savage state without grooming or discipline of any kind the ridicule being greatly enhanced by the disproportion of size betwixt the animal and its rider  perhaps the knight saw their wonder for the first words he said after they left the ground were pixie though small is mettlesome gentlemen here he contrived that pixie should himself corroborate the assertion by executing a gambadehe is diminutive but full of spiritindeed save that i am somewhat too large for an elfin horseman the knight was upwards of six feet high i should remind myself when i mount him of the fairy king as described by mike drayton    himself he on an earwig set   yet scarce upon his back could get   so oft and high he did curvet       ere he himself did settle   he made him stop and turn and bound   to gallop and to trot the round   he scarce could stand on any ground       he was so full of mettle  my old friend pixie said everard stroking the ponys neck i am glad that he has survived all these bustling dayspixie must be above twenty years old sir henry  above twenty years certainly yes nephew markham war is a whirlwind in a plantation which only spares what is least worth leaving old pixie and his old master have survived many a tall fellow and many a great horseneither of them good for much themselves yet as will says an old man can do somewhat so pixie and i still survive  so saying he again contrived that pixie should show some remnants of activity  still survive said the young scot completing the sentence which the good knight had left unfinisheday still survive    to witch the world with noble horsemanship  everard coloured for he felt the irony but not so his uncle whose simple vanity never permitted him to doubt the sincerity of the compliment  are you advised of that he said in king jamess time indeed i have appeared in the tiltyard and there you might have said    you saw young harry with his beaver up  as to seeing old harry whyhere the knight paused and looked as a bashful man in labour of a punas to old harrywhy you might as well see the devil you take me master kerneguythe devil you know is my namesakehahahacousin everard i hope your precision is not startled by an innocent jest  he was so delighted with the applause of both his companions that he recited the whole of the celebrated passage referred to and concluded with defying the present age bundle all its wits donne cowley waller and the rest of them together to produce a poet of a tenth part of the genius of old will  why we are said to have one of his descendants among ussir william davenant said louis kerneguy and many think him as clever a fellow  what exclaimed sir henrywill davenant whom i knew in the north an officer under newcastle when the marquis lay before hullwhy he was an honest cavalier and wrote good doggrel enough but how came he akin to will shakspeare i trow  why replied the young scot by the surer side of the house and after the old fashion if davenant speaks truth it seems that his mother was a goodlooking laughing buxom mistress of an inn between stratford and london at which will shakspeare often quartered as he went down to his native town and that out of friendship and gossipred as we say in scotland will shakspeare became godfather to will davenant and not contented with this spiritual affinity the younger will is for establishing some claim to a natural one alleging that his mother was a great admirer of wit and there were no bounds to her complaisance for men of genius  out upon the hound said colonel everard would he purchase the reputation of descending from poet or from prince at the expense of his mothers good famehis nose ought to be slit  that would be difficult answered the disguised prince recollecting the peculiarity of the bards countenance footnote davenant actually wanted the nose the foundation of many a jest of the day  will davenant the son of will shakspeare said the knight who had not yet recovered his surprise at the enormity of the pretension why it reminds me of a verse in the puppetshow of phaeton where the hero complains to his mother    besides by all the village boys i am shamd   you the suns son you rascal you be dd  i never heard such unblushing assurance in my lifewill davenant the son of the brightest and best poet that ever was is or will bebut i crave your pardon nephewyou i believe love no stage plays  nay i am not altogether so precise as you would make me uncle i have loved them perhaps too well in my time and now i condemn them not altogether or in gross though i approve not their excesses and extravagancesi cannot even in shakspeare but see many things both scandalous to decency and prejudicial to good mannersmany things which tend to ridicule virtue or to recommend viceat least to mitigate the hideousness of its features i cannot think these fine poems are an useful study and especially for the youth of either sex in which bloodshed is pointed out as the chief occupation of the men and intrigue as the sole employment of the women  in making these observations everard was simple enough to think that he was only giving his uncle an opportunity of defending a favourite opinion without offending him by a contradiction which was so limited and mitigated but here as on other occasions he forgot how obstinate his uncle was in his views whether of religion policy or taste and that it would be as easy to convert him to the presbyterian form of government or engage him to take the abjuration oath as to shake his belief in shakspeare there was another peculiarity in the good knights mode of arguing which everard being himself of a plain and downright character and one whose religious tenets were in some degree unfavourable to the suppressions and simulations often used in society could never perfectly understand sir henry sensible of his natural heat of temper was wont scrupulously to guard against it and would for some time when in fact much offended conduct a debate with all the external appearance of composure till the violence of his feelings would rise so high as to overcome and bear away the artificial barriers opposed to it and rush down upon the adversary with accumulating wrath it thus frequently happened that like a wily old general he retreated in the face of his disputant in good order and by degrees with so moderate a degree of resistance as to draw on his antagonists pursuit to the spot where at length making a sudden and unexpected attack with horse foot and artillery at once he seldom failed to confound the enemy though he might not overthrow him  it was on this principle therefore that hearing everards last observation he disguised his angry feelings and answered with a tone where politeness was called in to keep guard upon passion that undoubtedly the presbyterian gentry had given through the whole of these unhappy times such proofs of an humble unaspiring and unambitious desire of the public good as entitled them to general credit for the sincerity of those very strong scruples which they entertained against works in which the noblest sentiments of religion and virtuesentiments which might convert hardened sinners and be placed with propriety in the mouths of dying saints and martyrs happened from the rudeness and coarse taste of the times to be mixed with some broad jests and similar matter which lay not much in the way excepting of those who painfully sought such stuff out that they might use it in vilifying what was in itself deserving of the highest applause but what he wished especially to know from his nephew was whether any of those gifted men who had expelled the learned scholars and deep divines of the church of england from the pulpit and now flourished in their stead received any inspiration from the muses if he might use so profane a term without offence to colonel everard or whether they were not as sottishly and brutally averse from elegant letters as they were from humanity and common sense  colonel everard might have guessed by the ironical tone in which this speech was delivered what storm was mustering within his uncles bosomnay he might have conjectured the state of the old knights feelings from his emphasis on the word colonel by which epithet as that which most connected his nephew with the party he hated he never distinguished everard unless when his wrath was rising while on the contrary when disposed to be on good terms with him he usually called him kinsman or nephew markham indeed it was under a partial sense that this was the case and in the hope to see his cousin alice that the colonel forbore making any answer to the harangue of his uncle which had concluded just as the old knight had alighted at the door of the lodge and was entering the hall followed by his two attendants  phoebe at the same time made her appearance in the hall and received orders to bring some beverage for the gentlemen the hebe of woodstock failed not to recognise and welcome everard by an almost imperceptible curtsy but she did not serve her interest as she designed when she asked the knight as a question of course whether he commanded the attendance of mistress alice a stern no was the decided reply and the illtimed interference seemed to increase his previous irritation against everard for his depreciation of shakspeare i would insist said sir henry resuming the obnoxious subject were it fit for a poor disbanded cavalier to use such a phrase towards a commander of the conquering armyupon knowing whether the convulsion which has sent us saints and prophets without end has not also afforded us a poet with enough both of gifts and grace to outshine poor old will the oracle and idol of us blinded and carnal cavaliers  surely sir replied colonel everard i know verses written by a friend of the commonwealth and those too of a dramatic character which weighed in an impartial scale might equal even the poetry of shakspeare and which are free from the fustian and indelicacy with which that great bard was sometimes content to feed the coarse appetites of his barbarous audience  indeed said the knight keeping down his wrath with difficulty i should like to be acquainted with this masterpiece of poetrymay we ask the name of this distinguished person  it must be vicars or withers at least said the feigned page  no sir replied everard nor drummond of hawthornden nor lord stirling neither and yet the verses will vindicate what i say if you will make allowance for indifferent recitation for i am better accustomed to speak to a battalion than to those who love the muses the speaker is a lady benighted who having lost her way in a pathless forest at first expresses herself agitated by the supernatural fears to which her situation gave rise  a play too and written by a roundhead author said sir henry in surprise  a dramatic production at least replied his nephew and began to recite simply but with feeling the lines now so well known but which had then obtained no celebrity the fame of the author resting upon the basis rather of his polemical and political publications than on the poetry doomed in after days to support the eternal structure of his immortality    these thoughts may startle but will not astound   the virtuous mind that ever walks attended   by a strongsiding champion conscience  my own opinion nephew markham my own opinion said sir henry with a burst of admiration better expressed but just what i said when the scoundrelly roundheads pretended to see ghosts at woodstockgo on i prithee  everard proceeded    o welcome pureeyed faith whitehanded hope   thou hovering angel girt with golden wings   and thou unblemishd form of chastity   i see ye visibly and now believe   that he the supreme good to whom all things ill   are but as slavish officers of vengeance   would send a glistering guardian if need were   to keep my life and honour unassaild   was i deceived or did a sable cloud   turn forth her silver lining on the night  the rest has escaped me said the reciter and i marvel i have been able to remember so much  sir henry lee who had expected some effusion very different from those classical and beautiful lines soon changed the scornful expression of his countenance relaxed his contorted upper lip and stroking down his beard with his left hand rested the forefinger of the right upon his eyebrow in sign of profound attention after everard had ceased speaking the old man signed as at the end of a strain of sweet music he then spoke in a gentler manner than formerly  cousin markham he said these verses flow sweetly and sound in my ears like the welltouched warbling of a lute but thou knowest i am somewhat slow of apprehending the full meaning of that which i hear for the first time repeat me these verses again slowly and deliberately for i always love to hear poetry twice the first time for sound and the latter time for sense  thus encouraged everard recited again the lines with more hardihood and better effect the knight distinctly understanding and from his looks and motions highly applauding them  yes he broke out when everard was again silentyes i do call that poetrythough it were even written by a presbyterian or an anabaptist either ay there were good and righteous people to be found even amongst the offending towns which were destroyed by fire and certainly i have heard though with little credence begging your pardon cousin everard that there are men among you who have seen the error of their ways in rebelling against the best and kindest of masters and bringing it to that pass that he was murdered by a gang yet fiercer than themselves ay doubtless the gentleness of spirit and the purity of mind which dictated those beautiful lines has long ago taught a man so amiable to say i have sinned i have sinned yes i doubt not so sweet a harp has been broken even in remorse for the crimes he was witness to and now he sits drooping for the shame and sorrow of englandall his noble rhymes as will says    like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh  dost thou not think so master kerneguy  not i sir henry answered the page somewhat maliciously  what dost not believe the author of these lines must needs be of the better file and leaning to our persuasion  i think sir henry that the poetry qualifies the author to write a play on the subject of dame potiphar and her recusant lover and as for his callingthat last metaphor of the cloud in a black coat or cloak with silver lining would have dubbed him a tailor with me only that i happen to know that he is a schoolmaster by profession and by political opinions qualified to be poet laureate to cromwell for what colonel everard has repeated with such unction is the production of no less celebrated a person than john milton  john milton exclaimed sir henry in astonishmentwhat john milton the blasphemous and bloodyminded author of the defensio populi anglicanithe advocate of the infernal high court of fiends the creature and parasite of that grand impostor that loathsome hypocrite that detestable monster that prodigy of the universe that disgrace of mankind that landscape of iniquity that sink of sin and that compendium of baseness oliver cromwell  even the same john milton answered charles schoolmaster to little boys and tailor to the clouds which he furnishes with suits of black lined with silver at no other expense than that of common sense  markham everard said the old knight i will never forgive thee never never thou hast made me speak words of praise respecting one whose offal should fatten the regionkites speak not to me sir but begone am i your kinsman and benefactor a fit person to be juggled out of my commendation and eulogy and brought to bedaub such a whitened sepulchre as the sophist milton  i profess said everard this is hard measure sir henry you pressed meyou defied me to produce poetry as good as shakspeares i only thought of the verses not of the politics of milton  oh yes sir replied sir henry we well know your power of making distinctions you could make war against the kings prerogative without having the least design against his person oh heaven forbid but heaven will hear and judge you set down the beverage phoebethis was added by way of parenthesis to phoebe who entered with refreshmentcolonel everard is not thirstyyou have wiped your mouths and said you have done no evil but though you have deceived man yet god you cannot deceive and you shall wipe no lips in woodstock either after meat or drink i promise you  charged thus at once with the faults imputed to his whole religious sect and political party everard felt too late of what imprudence he had been guilty in giving the opening by disputing his uncles taste in dramatic poetry he endeavoured to explainto apologise  i mistook your purpose honoured sir and thought you really desired to know something of our literature and in repeating what you deemed not unworthy your hearing i profess i thought i was doing you pleasure instead of stirring your indignation  o ay returned the knight with unmitigated rigour of resentment professprofessay that is the new phrase of asseveration instead of the profane adjuration of courtiers and cavaliersoh sir profess less and practise moreand so good day to you master kerneguy you will find beverage in my apartment  while phoebe stood gaping in admiration at the sudden quarrel which had arisen colonel everards vexation and resentment was not a little increased by the nonchalance of the young scotsman who with his hands thrust into his pockets with a courtly affectation of the time had thrown himself into one of the antique chairs and though habitually too polite to laugh aloud and possessing that art of internal laughter by which men of the world learn to indulge their mirth without incurring quarrels or giving direct offence was at no particular pains to conceal that he was exceedingly amused by the result of the colonels visit to woodstock colonel everards patience however had reached bounds which it was very likely to surpass for though differing widely in politics there was a resemblance betwixt the temper of the uncle and nephew  damnation exclaimed the colonel in a tone which became a puritan as little as did the exclamation itself  amen said louis kerneguy but in a tone so soft and gentle that the ejaculation seemed rather to escape him than to be designedly uttered sir said everard striding towards him in that sort of humour when a man full of resentment would not unwillingly find an object on which to discharge it  plaitil said the page in the most equable tone looking up in his face with the most unconscious innocence  i wish to know sir retorted everard the meaning of that which you said just now  only a pouring out of the spirit worthy sir returned kerneguya small skiff dispatched to heaven on my own account to keep company with your holy petition just now expressed  sir i have known a merry gentlemans bones broke for such a smile as you wear just now replied everard  there look you now answered the malicious page who could not weigh even the thoughts of his safety against the enjoyment of his jestif you had stuck to your professions worthy sir you must have choked by this time but your round execration bolted like a cork from a bottle of cider and now allows your wrath to come foaming out after it in the honest unbaptized language of common ruffians  for heavens sake master girnegy said phoebe forbear giving the colonel these bitter words and do you good colonel markham scorn to take offence at his handshe is but a boy  if the colonel or you choose mistress phoebe you shall find me a mani think the gentleman can say something to the purpose already probably he may recommend to you the part of the lady in comus and i only hope his own admiration of john milton will not induce him to undertake the part of samson agonistes and blow up this old house with execration or pull it down in wrath about our ears  young man said the colonel still in towering passion if you respect my principles for nothing else be grateful to the protection which but for them you would not easily attain  nay then said the attendant i must fetch those who have more influence with you than i have and away tripped phoebe while kerneguy answered everard in the same provoking tone of calm indifference before you menace me with a thing so formidable as your resentment you ought to be certain whether i may not be compelled by circumstances to deny you the opportunity you seem to point at  at this moment alice summoned no doubt by her attendant entered the hall hastily  master kerneguy she said my father requests to see you in victor lees apartment  kerneguy arose and bowed but seemed determined to remain till everards departure so as to prevent any explanation betwixt the cousins markham said alice hurriedlycousin everardi have but a moment to remain herefor gods sake do you instantly begonebe cautious and patientbut do not tarry heremy father is fearfully incensed  i have had my uncles word for that madam replied everard as well as his injunction to depart which i will obey without delay i was not aware that you would have seconded so harsh an order quite so willingly but i go madam sensible i leave those behind whose company is more agreeable  unjustungenerousungrateful said alice but fearful her words might reach ears for which they were not designed she spoke them in a voice so feeble that her cousin for whom they were intended lost the consolation they were calculated to convey  he bowed coldly to alice as taking leave and said with an air of that constrained courtesy which sometimes covers among men of condition the most deadly hatred i believe master kerneguy that i must make it convenient at present to suppress my own peculiar opinions on the matter which we have hinted at in our conversation in which case i will send a gentleman who i hope may be able to conquer yours  the supposed scotsman made him a stately and at the same time a condescending bow said he should expect the honour of his commands offered his hand to mistress alice to conduct her back to her fathers apartment and took a triumphant leave of his rival  everard on the other hand stung beyond his patience and from the grace and composed assurance of the youths carriage still conceiving him to be either wilmot or some of his compeers in rank and profligacy returned to the town of woodstock determined not to be outbearded even though he should seek redress by means which his principles forbade him to consider as justifiable                                         chapter the twentysixth          boundless intemperance   in nature is a tyrannyit hath been   the untimely emptying of many a throne   and fall of many kings    macbeth  while colonel everard retreated in high indignation from the little refection which sir henry lee had in his goodhumour offered and withdrawn under the circumstances of provocation which we have detailed the good old knight scarce recovered from his fit of passion partook of it with his daughter and guest and shortly after recollecting some silvan task for though to little efficient purpose he still regularly attended to his duties as ranger he called bevis and went out leaving the two young people together  now said the amorous prince to himself that alice is left without her lion it remains to see whether she is herself of a tigress breed so sir bevis has left his charge he said loud i thought the knights of old those stern guardians of which he is so fit a representative were more rigorous in maintaining a vigilant guard  bevis said alice knows that his attendance on me is totally needless and moreover he has other duties to perform which every true knight prefers to dangling the whole morning by a ladys sleeve  you speak treason against all true affection said the gallant a ladys lightest wish should to a true knight be more binding than aught excepting the summons of his sovereign i wish mistress alice you would but intimate your slightest desire to me and you should see how i have practised obedience  you never brought me word what oclock it was this morning replied the young lady and there i sate questioning of the wings of time when i should have remembered that gentlemens gallantry can be quite as fugitive as time himself how do you know what your disobedience may have cost me and others pudding and pasty may have been burned to a cinder for sir i practise the old domestic rule of visiting the kitchen or i may have missed prayers or i may have been too late for an appointment simply by the negligence of master louis kerneguy failing to let me know the hour of the day  o replied kerneguy i am one of those lovers who cannot endure absencei must be eternally at the feet of my fair enemysuch i think is the title with which romances teach us to grace the fair and cruel to whom we devote our hearts and livesspeak for me good lute he added taking up the instrument and show whether i know not my duty  he sung but with more taste than execution the air of a french rondelai to which some of the wits or sonnetteers in his gay and roving train had adapted english verses    an hour with theewhen earliest day   dapples with gold the eastern grey   oh what can frame my mind to bear   the toil and turmoil cark and care   new griefs which coming hours unfold   and sad remembrance of the old   one hour with thee    one hour with theewhen burning june   waves his red flag at pitch of noon   what shall repay the faithful swain   his labour on the sultry plain   and more than cave or sheltering bough   cool feverish blood and throbbing brow   one hour with thee    one hour with theewhen sun is set   o what can teach me to forget   the thankless labours of the day   the hopes the wishes flung away   the increasing wants and lessening gains   the masters pride who scorns my pains   one hour with thee  truly there is another verse said the songster but i sing it not to you mistress alice because some of the prudes of the court liked it not i thank you master louis answered the young lady both for your discretion in singing what has given me pleasure and in forbearing what might offend me though a country girl i pretend to be so far of the court mode as to receive nothing which does not pass current among the better class there  i would answered louis that you were so well confirmed in their creed as to let all pass with you to which court ladies would give currency  and what would be the consequence said alice with perfect composure  in that case said louis embarrassed like a general who finds that his preparations for attack do not seem to strike either fear or confusion into the enemyin that case you would forgive me fair alice if i spoke to you in a warmer language than that of mere gallantryif i told you how much my heart was interested in what you consider as idle jestingif i seriously owned it was in your power to make me the happiest or the most miserable of human beings  master kerneguy said alice with the same unshaken nonchalance let us understand each other i am little acquainted with highbred manners and i am unwilling i tell you plainly to be accounted a silly country girl who either from ignorance or conceit is startled at every word of gallantry addressed to her by a young man who for the present has nothing better to do than coin and circulate such false compliments but i must not let this fear of seeming rustic and awkwardly timorous carry me too far and being ignorant of the exact limits i will take care to stop within them  i trust madam said kerneguy that however severely you may be disposed to judge of me your justice will not punish me too severely for an offence of which your charms are alone the occasion  hear me out sir if you please resumed alice i have listened to you when you spoke en bergernay my complaisance has been so great as to answer you en bergèrefor i do not think any thing except ridicule can come of dialogues between lindor and jeanneton and the principal fault of the style is its extreme and tiresome silliness and affectation but when you begin to kneel offer to take my hand and speak with a more serious tone i must remind you of our real characters i am the daughter of sir henry lee sir you are or profess to be master louis kerneguy my brothers page and a fugitive for shelter under my fathers roof who incurs danger by the harbour he affords you and whose household therefore ought not to be disturbed by your unpleasing importunities  i would to heaven fair alice said the king that your objections to the suit which i am urging not in jest but most seriously as that on which my happiness depends rested only on the low and precarious station of louis kerneguyalice thou hast the soul of thy family and must needs love honour i am no more the needy scottish page whom i have for my own purposes personated than i am the awkward lout whose manners i adopted on the first night of our acquaintance this hand poor as i seem can confer a coronet  keep it said alice for some more ambitious damsel my lordfor such i conclude is your title if this romance be truei would not accept your hand could you confer a duchy  in one sense lovely alice you have neither overrated my power nor my affection it is your kingit is charles stewart who speaks to youhe can confer duchies and if beauty can merit them it is that of alice lee nay nayrisedo not kneelit is for your sovereign to kneel to thee alice to whom he is a thousand times more devoted than the wanderer louis dared venture to profess himself my alice has i know been trained up in those principles of love and obedience to her sovereign that she cannot in conscience or in mercy inflict on him such a wound as would be implied in the rejection of his suit  in spite of all charless attempts to prevent her alice had persevered in kneeling on one knee until she had touched with her lip the hand with which he attempted to raise her but this salutation ended she stood upright with her arms folded on her bosomher looks humble but composed keen and watchful and so possessed of herself so little flattered by the communication which the king had supposed would have been overpowering that he scarce knew in what terms next to urge his solicitation  thou art silentthou art silent he said my pretty alice has the king no more influence with thee than the poor scottish page  in one sense every influence said alice for he commands my best thoughts my best wishes my earnest prayers my devoted loyalty which as the men of the house of lee have been ever ready to testify with the sword so are the women bound to seal if necessary with their blood but beyond the duties of a true and devoted subject the king is even less to alice lee than poor louis kerneguy the page could have tendered an honourable unionthe monarch can but offer a contaminated coronet  you mistake aliceyou mistake said the king eagerly sit down and let me speak to yousit downwhat ist you fear  i fear nothing my liege answered alice what can i fear from the king of britaini the daughter of his loyal subject and under my fathers roof but i remember the distance betwixt us and though i might trifle and jest with mine equal to my king i must only appear in the dutiful posture of a subject unless where his safety may seem to require that i do not acknowledge his dignity  charles though young being no novice in such scenes was surprised to encounter resistance of a kind which had not been opposed to him in similar pursuits even in cases where he had been unsuccessful there was neither anger nor injured pride nor disorder nor disdain real or affected in the manners and conduct of alice she stood as it seemed calmly prepared to argue on the subject which is generally decided by passionshowed no inclination to escape from the apartment but appeared determined to hear with patience the suit of the loverwhile her countenance and manner intimated that she had this complaisance only in deference to the commands of the king  she is ambitious thought charles it is by dazzling her love of glory not by mere passionate entreaties that i must hope to be successfuli pray you be seated my fair alice he said the lover entreatsthe king commands you  the king said alice may permit the relaxation of the ceremonies due to royalty but he cannot abrogate the subjects duty even by express command i stand here while it is your majestys pleasure to addressa patient listener as in duty bound  know then simple girl said the king that in accepting my proffered affection and protection you break through no law either of virtue or morality those who are born to royalty are deprived of many of the comforts of private lifechiefly that which is perhaps the dearest and most precious the power of choosing their own mates for life their formal weddings are guided upon principles of political expedience only and those to whom they are wedded are frequently in temper person and disposition the most unlikely to make them happy society has commiseration therefore towards us and binds our unwilling and often unhappy wedlocks with chains of a lighter and more easy character than those which fetter other men whose marriage ties as more voluntarily assumed ought in proportion to be more strictly binding and therefore ever since the time that old henry built these walls priests and prelates as well as nobles and statesmen have been accustomed to see a fair rosamond rule the heart of an affectionate monarch and console him for the few hours of constraint and state which he must bestow upon some angry and jealous eleanor to such a connection the world attaches no blame they rush to the festival to admire the beauty of the lovely esther while the imperious vashti is left to queen it in solitude they throng the palace to ask her protection whose influence is more in the state an hundred times than that of the proud consort her offspring rank with the nobles of the land and vindicate by their courage like the celebrated longsword earl of salisbury their descent from royalty and from love from such connections our richest ranks of nobles are recruited and the mother lives in the greatness of her posterity honoured and blest as she died lamented and wept in the arms of love and friendship  did rosamond so die my lord said alice our records say she was poisoned by the injured queenpoisoned without time allowed to call to god for the pardon of her many faults did her memory so live i have heard that when the bishop purified the church at godstowe her monument was broken open by his orders and her bones thrown out into unconsecrated ground  those were rude old days sweet alice answered charles queens are not now so jealous nor bishops so rigorous and know besides that in the lands to which i would lead the loveliest of her sex other laws obtain which remove from such ties even the slightest show of scandal there is a mode of matrimony which fulfilling all the rites of the church leaves no stain on the conscience yet investing the bride with none of the privileges peculiar to her husbands condition infringes not upon the duties which the king owes to his subjects so that alice lee may in all respects become the real and lawful wife of charles stewart except that their private union gives her no title to be queen of england  my ambition said alice will be sufficiently gratified to see charles king without aiming to share either his dignity in public or his wealth and regal luxury in private  i understand thee alice said the king hurt but not displeased you ridicule me being a fugitive for speaking like a king it is a habit i admit which i have learned and of which even misfortune cannot cure me but my case is not so desperate as you may suppose my friends are still many in these kingdoms my allies abroad are bound by regard to their own interest to espouse my cause i have hopes given me from spain from france and from other nations and i have confidence that my fathers blood has not been poured forth in vain nor is doomed to dry up without due vengeance my trust is in him from whom princes derive their title and think what thou wilt of my present condition i have perfect confidence that i shall one day sit on the throne of england  may god grant it said alice and that he may grant it noble prince deign to considerwhether you now pursue a conduct likely to conciliate his favour think of the course you recommend to a motherless maiden who has no better defence against your sophistry than what a sense of morality together with the natural feeling of female dignity inspires whether the death of her father which would be the consequence of her imprudencewhether the despair of her brother whose life has been so often in peril to save that of your majesty whether the dishonour of the roof which has sheltered you will read well in your annals or are events likely to propitiate god whose controversy with your house has been but too visible or recover the affections of the people of england in whose eyes such actions are an abomination i leave to your own royal mind to consider  charles paused struck with a turn to the conversation which placed his own interests more in collision with the gratification of his present passion than he had supposed  if your majesty said alice curtsying deeply has no farther commands for my attendance may i be permitted to withdraw  stay yet a little strange and impracticable girl said the king and answer me but one questionis it the lowness of my present fortunes that makes my suit contemptible  i have nothing to conceal my liege she said and my answer shall be as plain and direct as the question you have asked if i could have been moved to an act of ignominious insane and ungrateful folly it could only arise from my being blinded by that passion which i believe is pleaded as an excuse for folly and for crime much more often than it has a real existence i must in short have been in love as it is calledand that might have beenwith my equal but surely never with my sovereign whether such only in title or in possession of his kingdom  yet loyalty was ever the pride almost the ruling passion of your family alice said the king  and could i reconcile that loyalty said alice with indulging my sovereign by permitting him to prosecute a suit dishonourable to himself as to me ought i as a faithful subject to join him in a folly which might throw yet another stumblingblock in the path to his restoration and could only serve to diminish his security even if he were seated upon his throne  at this rate said charles discontentedly i had better have retained my character of the page than assumed that of a sovereign which it seems is still more irreconcilable with my wishes  my candour shall go still farther said alice i could have felt as little for louis kerneguy as for the heir of britain for such love as i have to bestow and it is not such as i read of in romance or hear poured forth in song has been already conferred on another object this gives your majesty paini am sorry for itbut the wholesomest medicines are often bitter  yes answered the king with some asperity and physicians are reasonable enough to expect their patients to swallow them as if they were honeycomb it is true then that whispered tale of the cousin colonel and the daughter of the loyal lee has set her heart upon a rebellious fanatic  my love was given ere i knew what these words fanatic and rebel meant i recalled it not for i am satisfied that amidst the great distractions which divide the kingdom the person to whom you allude has chosen his part erroneously perhaps but conscientiouslyhe therefore has still the highest place in my affection and esteem more he cannot have and will not ask until some happy turn shall reconcile these public differences and my father be once more reconciled to him devoutly do i pray that such an event may occur by your majestys speedy and unanimous restoration  you have found out a reason said the king pettishly to make me detest the thought of such a changenor have you alice any sincere interest to pray for it on the contrary do you not see that your lover walking side by side with cromwell may or rather must share his power nay if lambert does not anticipate him he may trip up olivers heels and reign in his stead and think you not he will find means to overcome the pride of the loyal lees and achieve an union for which things are better prepared than that which cromwell is said to meditate betwixt one of his brats and the no less loyal heir of fauconberg  your majesty said alice has found a way at length to avenge yourselfif what i have said deserves vengeance  i could point out a yet shorter road to your union said charles without minding her distress or perhaps enjoying the pleasure of retaliation suppose that you sent your colonel word that there was one charles stewart here who had come to disturb the saints in their peaceful government which they had acquired by prayer and preaching pike and gunand suppose he had the art to bring down a halfscore of troopers quite enough as times go to decide the fate of this heir of royaltythink you not the possession of such a prize as this might obtain from the rumpers or from cromwell such a reward as might overcome your fathers objections to a roundheads alliance and place the fair alice and her cousin colonel in full possession of their wishes  my liege said alice her cheeks glowing and her eyes sparklingfor she too had her share of the hereditary temperament of her family this passes my patience i have heard without expressing anger the most ignominious persuasions addressed to myself and i have vindicated myself for refusing to be the paramour of a fugitive prince as if i had been excusing myself from accepting a share of an actual crown but do you think i can hear all who are dear to me slandered without emotion or reply i will not sir and were you seated with all the terrors of your fathers starchamber around you you should hear me defend the absent and the innocent of my father i will say nothing but that if he is now without wealthwithout state almost without a sheltering home and needful foodit is because he spent all in the service of the king he needed not to commit any act of treachery or villany to obtain wealth he had an ample competence in his own possessions for markham everard he knows no such thing as selfishnesshe would not for broad england had she the treasures of peru in her bosom and a paradise on her surface do a deed that would disgrace his own name or injure the feelings of anotherkings my liege may take a lesson from him my liege for the present i take my leave  alice alicestay exclaimed the king she is gonethis must be virtuereal disinterested overawing virtueor there is no such thing on earth yet wilmot and villiers will not believe a word of it but add the tale to the other wonders of woodstock tis a rare wench and i profess to use the colonels obtestation that i know not whether to forgive and be friends with her or study a dire revenge if it were not for that accursed cousinthat puritan coloneli could forgive every thing else to so noble a wench but a roundheaded rebel preferred to methe preference avowed to my face and justified with the assertion that a king might take a lesson from himit is gall and wormwood if the old man had not come up this morning as he did the king should have taken or given a lesson and a severe one it was a mad rencontre to venture upon with my rank and responsibilityand yet this wench has made me so angry with her and so envious of him that if an opportunity offered i should scarce be able to forbear himha whom have we here  the interjection at the conclusion of this royal soliloquy was occasioned by the unexpected entrance of another personage of the drama                                         chapter the twentyseventh     benedict shall i speak a word in your ear   claudio god bless me from a challenge     much ado about nothing  as charles was about to leave the apartment he was prevented by the appearance of wildrake who entered with an unusual degree of swagger in his gait and of fantastic importance on his brow i crave your pardon fair sir he said but as they say in my country when doors are open dogs enter i have knocked and called in the hall to no purpose so knowing the way to this parlour sirfor i am a light partisan and the road i once travel i never forgeti ventured to present myself unannounced  sir henry lee is abroad sir i believe in the chase said charles coldly for the appearance of this somewhat vulgar debauchee was not agreeable to him at the moment and master albert lee has left the lodge for two or three days  i am aware of it sir said wildrake but i have no business at present with either  and with whom is your business said charles that is if i may be permitted to asksince i think it cannot in possibility be with me  pardon me in turn sir answered the cavalier in no possibility can it be imparted to any other but yourself if you be as i think you are though in something better habit master louis girnigo the scottish gentleman who waits upon master albert lee  i am all you are like to find for him answered charles  in truth said the cavalier i do perceive a difference but rest and better clothing will do much and i am glad of it since i would be sorry to have brought a message such as i am charged with to a tatterdemalion  let us get to the business sir if you please said the kingyou have a message for me you say  true sir replied wildrake i am the friend of colonel markham everard sir a tall man and a worthy person in the field although i could wish him a better causea message i have to you it is certain in a slight note which i take the liberty of presenting with the usual formalities so saying he drew his sword put the billet he mentioned upon the point and making a profound bow presented it to charles  the disguised monarch accepted of it with a grave return of the salute and said as he was about to open the letter i am not i presume to expect friendly contents in an epistle presented in so hostile a manner  ahem sir replied the ambassador clearing his voice while he arranged a suitable answer in which the mild strain of diplomacy might be properly maintained not utterly hostile i suppose sir is the invitation though it be such as must be construed in the commencement rather bellicose and pugnacious i trust sir we shall find that a few thrusts will make a handsome conclusion of the business and so as my old master used to say pax mascitur ex bello for my own poor share i am truly glad to have been graced by my friend markham everard in this matterthe rather as i feared the puritan principles with which he is imbued i will confess the truth to you worthy sir might have rendered him unwilling from certain scruples to have taken the gentlemanlike and honourable mode of righting himself in such a case as the present and as i render a friends duty to my friend so i humbly hope master louis girnigo that i do no injustice to you in preparing the way for the proposed meeting where give me leave to say i trust that if no fatal accident occur we shall be all better friends when the skirmish is over than we were before it began  i should suppose so sir in any case said charles looking at the letter worse than mortal enemies we can scarce be and it is that footing upon which this billet places us  you say true sir said wildrake it is sir a cartel introducing to a single combat for the pacific object of restoring a perfect good understanding betwixt the survivorsin case that fortunately that word can be used in the plural after the event of the meeting  in short we only fight i suppose replied the king that we may come to a perfectly good and amicable understanding  you are right again sir and i thank you for the clearness of your apprehension said wildrakeah sir it is easy to do with a person of honour and of intellect in such a case as this and i beseech you sir as a personal kindness to myself that as the morning is like to be frosty and myself am in some sort rheumaticas war will leave its scars behind siri say i will entreat of you to bring with you some gentleman of honour who will not disdain to take part in what is going forwarda sort of potluck sirwith a poor old soldier like myself that we may take no harm by standing unoccupied during such cold weather  i understand sir replied charles if this matter goes forward be assured i will endeavour to provide you with a suitable opponent  i shall remain greatly indebted to you sir said wildrake and i am by no means curious about the quality of my antagonist it is true i write myself esquire and gentleman and should account myself especially honoured by crossing my sword with that of sir henry or master albert lee but should that not be convenient i will not refuse to present my poor person in opposition to any gentleman who has served the king which i always hold as a sort of letters of nobility in itself and therefore would on no account decline the duello with such a person  the king is much obliged to you sir said charles for the honour you do his faithful subjects  o sir i am scrupulous on that pointvery scrupulouswhen there is a roundhead in question i consult the heralds books to see that he is entitled to bear arms as is master markham everard without which i promise you i had borne none of his cartel but a cavalier is with me a gentleman of coursebe his birth ever so low his loyalty has ennobled his condition  it is well sir said the king this paper requests me to meet master everard at six tomorrow morning at the tree called the kings oaki object neither to place nor time he proffers the sword at which he says we possess some equalityi do not decline the weapon for company two gentlemeni shall endeavour to procure myself an associate and a suitable partner for you sir if you incline to join in the dance  i kiss your hand sir and rest yours under a sense of obligation answered the envoy  i thank you sir continued the king i will therefore be ready at place and time and suitably furnished and i will either give your friend such satisfaction with my sword as he requires or will render him such cause for not doing so as he will be contented with  you will excuse me sir said wildrake if my mind is too dull under the circumstances to conceive any alternative that can remain betwixt two men of honour in such a case exceptingsasa he threw himself into a fencing position and made a pass with his sheathed rapier but not directed towards the person of the king whom he addressed  excuse me sir said charles if i do not trouble your intellects with the consideration of a case which may not occurbut for example i may plead urgent employment on the part of the public this he spoke in a low and mysterious tone of voice which wildrake appeared perfectly to comprehend for he laid his forefinger on his nose with what he meant for a very intelligent and apprehensive nod  sir said he if you be engaged in any affair for the king my friend shall have every reasonable degree of patiencenay i will fight him myself in your stead merely to stay his stomach rather than you should be interruptedand sir if you can find room in your enterprise for a poor gentleman that has followed lunsford and goring you have but to name day time and place of rendezvous for truly sir i am tired of the scald hat cropped hair and undertakers cloak with which my friend has bedizened me and would willingly ruffle it out once more in the kings cause when whether i be banged or hanged i care not  i shall remember what you say sir should an opportunity occur said the king and i wish his majesty had many such subjectsi presume our business is now settled  when you shall have been pleased sir to give me a trifling scrap of writing to serve for my credentialsfor such you know is the customyour written cartel hath its written answer  that sir will i presently do said charles and in good time here are the materials  and sir continued the envoyahahemif you have interest in the household for a cup of sacki am a man of few words and am somewhat hoarse with much speakingmoreover a serious business of this kind always makes one thirstybesides sir to part with dry lips argues malice which god forbid should exist in such an honourable conjuncture  i do not boast much influence in the house sir said the king but if you would have the condescension to accept of this broad piece towards quenching your thirst at the george  sir said the cavalier for the times admitted of this strange species of courtesy nor was wildrake a man of such peculiar delicacy as keenly to dispute the matteri am once again beholden to you but i see not how it consists with my honour to accept of such accommodation unless you were to accompany and partake  pardon me sir replied charles my safety recommends that i remain rather private at present  enough said wildrake observed poor cavaliers must not stand on ceremony i see sir you understand cutters lawwhen one tall fellow has coin another must not be thirsty i wish you sir a continuance of health and happiness until tomorrow at the kings oak at six oclock  farewell sir said the king and added as wildrake went down the stair whistling hey for cavaliers to which air his long rapier jarring against the steps and banisters bore no unsuitable burden farewell thou too just emblem of the state to which war and defeat and despair have reduced many a gallant gentleman  during the rest of the day there occurred nothing peculiarly deserving of notice alice sedulously avoided showing towards the disguised prince any degree of estrangement or shyness which could be discovered by her father or by any one else to all appearance the two young persons continued on the same footing in every respect yet she made the gallant himself sensible that this apparent intimacy was assumed merely to save appearances and in no way designed as retracting from the severity with which she had rejected his suit the sense that this was the case joined to his injured selflove and his enmity against a successful rival induced charles early to withdraw himself to a solitary walk in the wilderness where like hercules in the emblem of cebes divided betwixt the personifications of virtue and of pleasure he listened alternately to the voice of wisdom and of passionate folly  prudence urged to him the importance of his own life to the future prosecution of the great object in which he had for the present miscarriedthe restoration of monarchy in england the rebuilding of the throne the regaining the crown of his father the avenging his death and restoring to their fortunes and their country the numerous exiles who were suffering poverty and banishment on account of their attachment to his cause pride too or rather a just and natural sense of dignity displayed the unworthiness of a prince descending to actual personal conflict with a subject of any degree and the ridicule which would be thrown on his memory should he lose his life for an obscure intrigue by the hand of a private gentleman what would his sage counsellors nicholas and hydewhat would his kind and wise governor the marquis of hertford say to such an act of rashness and folly would it not be likely to shake the allegiance of the staid and prudent persons of the royalist party since wherefore should they expose their lives and estates to raise to the government of a kingdom a young man who could not command his own temper to this was to be added the consideration that even his success would add double difficulties to his escape which already seemed sufficiently precarious if stopping short of death he merely had the better of his antagonist how did he know that he might not seek revenge by delivering up to government the malignant louis kerneguy whose real character could not in that case fail to be discovered  these considerations strongly recommended to charles that he should clear himself of the challenge without fighting and the reservation under which he had accepted it afforded him some opportunity of doing so  but passion also had her arguments which she addressed to a temper rendered irritable by recent distress and mortification in the first place if he was a prince he was also a gentleman entitled to resent as such and obliged to give or claim the satisfaction expected on occasion of differences among gentlemen with englishmen she urged he could never lose interest by showing himself ready instead of sheltering himself under his royal birth and pretensions to come frankly forward and maintain what he had done or said on his own responsibility in a free nation it seemed as if he would rather gain than lose in the public estimation by a conduct which could not but seem gallant and generous then a character for courage was far more necessary to support his pretensions than any other kind of reputation and the lying under a challenge without replying to it might bring his spirit into question what would villiers and wilmot say of an intrigue in which he had allowed himself to be shamefully baffled by a country girl and had failed to revenge himself on his rival the pasquinades which they would compose the witty sarcasms which they would circulate on the occasion would be harder to endure than the grave rebukes of hertford hyde and nicholas this reflection added to the stings of youthful and awakened courage at length fixed his resolution and he returned to woodstock determined to keep his appointment come of it what might  perhaps there mingled with his resolution a secret belief that such a rencontre would not prove fatal he was in the flower of his youth active in all his exercises and no way inferior to colonel everard as far as the mornings experiment had gone in that of selfdefence at least such recollection might pass through his royal mind as he hummed to himself a wellknown ditty which he had picked up during his residence in scotland    a man may drink and not be drunk      a man may fight and not be slain    a man may kiss a bonnie lass      and yet be welcome back again  meanwhile the busy and alldirecting dr rochecliffe had contrived to intimate to alice that she must give him a private audience and she found him by appointment in what was called the study once filled with ancient books which long since converted into cartridges had made more noise in the world at their final exit than during the space which had intervened betwixt that and their first publication the doctor seated himself in a highbacked leathern easychair and signed to alice to fetch a stool and sit down beside him  alice said the old man taking her hand affectionately thou art a good girl a wise girl a virtuous girl one of those whose price is above rubiesnot that rubies is the proper translationbut remind me to tell you of that another time alice thou knowest who this louis kerneguy isnay hesitate not to mei know every thingi am well aware of the whole matter thou knowest this honoured house holds the fortunes of england alice was about to answer nay speak not but listen to me alicehow does he bear himself towards you  alice coloured with the deepest crimson i am a countrybred girl she said and his manners are too courtlike for me  enough saidi know it all alice he is exposed to a great danger tomorrow and you must be the happy means to prevent him  i prevent himhow and in what manner said alice in surprise it is my duty as a subject to do anythinganything that may become my fathers daughter  here she stopped considerably embarrassed  yes continued the doctor tomorrow he hath made an appointmentan appointment with markham everard the hour and place are setsix in the morning by the kings oak if they meet one will probably fall  now may god forefend they should meet said alice turning as suddenly pale as she had previously reddened but harm cannot come of it everard will never lift his sword against the king  for that said dr rochecliffe i would not warrant but if that unhappy young gentleman shall have still some reserve of the loyalty which his general conduct entirely disavows it would not serve us here for he knows not the king but considers him merely as a cavalier from whom he has received injury  let him know the truth doctor rochecliffe let him know it instantly said alice he lift hand against the king a fugitive and defenceless he is incapable of it my life on the issue he becomes most active in his preservation  that is the thought of a maiden alice answered the doctor and as i fear of a maiden whose wisdom is misled by her affections it were worse than treason to admit a rebel officer the friend of the archtraitor cromwell into so great a secret i dare not answer for such rashness hammond was trusted by his father and you know what came of it  then let my father know he will meet markham or send to him representing the indignity done to him by attacking his guest  we dare not let your father into the secret who louis kerneguy really is i did but hint the possibility of charles taking refuge at woodstock and the rapture into which sir henry broke out the preparations for accommodation and the defence which he began to talk of plainly showed that the mere enthusiasm of his loyalty would have led to a risk of discovery it is you alice who must save the hopes of every true royalist  i answered alice it is impossiblewhy cannot my father be induced to interfere as in behalf of his friend and guest though he know him as no other than louis kerneguy  you have forgot your fathers character my young friend said the doctor an excellent man and the best of christians till there is a clashing of swords and then he starts up the complete martialist as deaf to every pacific reasoning as if he were a gamecock  you forget doctor rochecliffe said alice that this very morning if i understand the thing aright my father prevented them from fighting  ay answered the doctor because he deemed himself bound to keep the peace in the royalpark but it was done with such regret alice that should he find them at it again i am clear to foretell he will only so far postpone the combat as to conduct them to some unprivileged ground and there bid them tilt and welcome while he regaled his eyes with a scene so pleasing no alice it is you and you only who can help us in this extremity  i see no possibility said she again colouring how i can be of the least use  you must send a note answered dr rochecliffe to the kinga note such as all women know how to write better than any man can teach themto meet you at the precise hour of the rendezvous he will not fail you for i know his unhappy foible  doctor rochecliffe said alice gravelyyou have known me from infancywhat have you seen in me to induce you to believe that i should ever follow such unbecoming counsel  and if you have known me from infancy retorted the doctor what have you seen of me that you should suspect me of giving counsel to my friends daughter which it would be misbecoming in her to follow you cannot be fool enough i think to suppose that i mean you should carry your complaisance farther than to keep him in discourse for an hour or two till i have all in readiness for his leaving this place from which i can frighten him by the terrors of an alleged searchso c s mounts his horse and rides off and mistress alice lee has the honour of saving him  yes at the expense of my own reputation said alice and the risk of an eternal stain on my family you say you know all what can the king think of my appointing an assignation with him after what has passed and how will it be possible to disabuse him respecting the purpose of my doing so  i will disabuse him alice i will explain the whole  doctor rochecliffe said alice you propose what is impossible you can do much by your ready wit and great wisdom but if newfallen snow were once sullied not all your art could wash it clean again and it is altogether the same with a maidens reputation  alice my dearest child said the doctor bethink you that if i recommended this means of saving the life of the king at least rescuing him from instant peril it is because i see no other of which to avail myself if i bid you assume even for a moment the semblance of what is wrong it is but in the last extremity and under circumstances which cannot returni will take the surest means to prevent all evil report which can arise from what i recommend  say not so doctor said alice better undertake to turn back the isis than to stop the course of calumny the king will make boast to his whole licentious court of the ease with which but for a sudden alarm he could have brought off alice lee as a paramourthe mouth which confers honour on others will then be the means to deprive me of mine take a fitter course one more becoming your own character and profession do not lead him to fail in an engagement of honour by holding out the prospect of another engagement equally dishonourable whether false or true go to the king himself speak to him as the servants of god have a right to speak even to earthly sovereigns point out to him the folly and the wickedness of the course he is about to pursueurge upon him that he fear the sword since wrath bringeth the punishment of the sword tell him that the friends who died for him in the field at worcester on the scaffolds and on the gibbets since that bloody daythat the remnant who are in prison scattered fled and ruined on his account deserve better of him and his fathers race than that he should throw away his life in an idle brawltell him that it is dishonest to venture that which is not his own dishonourable to betray the trust which brave men have reposed in his virtue and in his courage  dr rochecliffe looked on her with a melancholy smile his eyes glistening as he said alas alice even i could not plead that just cause to him so eloquently or so impressively as thou dost but alack charles would listen to neither it is not from priests or women he would say that men should receive counsel in affairs of honour  then hear me doctor rochecliffei will appear at the place of rendezvous and i will prevent the combatdo not fear that i can do what i sayat a sacrifice indeed but not that of my reputation my heart may be brokenshe endeavoured to stifle her sobs with difficultyfor the consequence but not in the imagination of a man and far less that man her sovereign shall a thought of alice lee be associated with dishonour she hid her face in her handkerchief and burst out into unrestrained tears  what means this hysterical passion said dr rochecliffe surprised and somewhat alarmed by the vehemence of her griefmaiden i must have no concealments i must know  exert your ingenuity then and discover it said alicefor a moment put out of temper at the doctors pertinacious selfimportanceguess my purpose as you can guess at every thing else it is enough to have to go through my task i will not endure the distress of telling it over and that to one whoforgive me dear doctormight not think my agitation on this occasion fully warranted  nay then my young mistress you must be ruled said rochecliffe and if i cannot make you explain yourself i must see whether your father can gain so far on you so saying he arose somewhat displeased and walked towards the door  you forget what you yourself told me doctor rochecliffe said alice of the risk of communicating this great secret to my father  it is too true he said stopping short and turning round and i think wench thou art too smart for me and i have not met many such but thou art a good girl and wilt tell me thy device of freewillit concerns my character and influence with the king that i should be fully acquainted with whatever is actum atque tractatum done and treated of in this matter  trust your character to me good doctor said alice attempting to smile it is of firmer stuff than those of women and will be safer in my custody than mine could have been in yours and thus much i condescendyou shall see the whole sceneyou shall go with me yourself and much will i feel emboldened and heartened by your company  that is something said the doctor though not altogether satisfied with this limited confidence thou wert ever a clever wench and i will trust thee indeed trust thee i find i must whether voluntarily or no  meet me then said alice in the wilderness tomorrow but first tell me are you well assured of time and placea mistake were fatal  assure yourself my information is entirely accurate said the doctor resuming his air of consequence which had been a little diminished during the latter part of their conference  may i ask said alice through what channel you acquired such important information  you may ask unquestionably he answered now completely restored to his supremacy but whether i will answer or not is a very different question i conceive neither your reputation nor my own is interested in your remaining in ignorance on that subject so i have my secrets as well as you mistress and some of them i fancy are a good deal more worth knowing  be it so said alice quietly if you will meet me in the wilderness by the broken dial at halfpast five exactly we will go together tomorrow and watch them as they come to the rendezvous i will on the way get the better of my present timidity and explain to you the means i design to employ to prevent mischief you can perhaps think of making some effort which may render my interference unbecoming and painful as it must be altogether unnecessary  nay my child said the doctor if you place yourself in my hands you will be the first that ever had reason to complain of my want of conduct and you may well judge you are the very last one excepted whom i would see suffer for want of counsel at halfpast five then at the dial in the wildernessand god bless our undertaking  here their interview was interrupted by the sonorous voice of sir henry lee which shouted their names daughter alicedoctor rochecliffe through passage and gallery  what do you here said he entering sitting like two crows in a mist when we have such rare sport below here is this wild crackbrained boy louis kerneguy now making me laugh till my sides are fit to split and now playing on his guitar sweetly enough to win a lark from the heavenscome away with you come away it is hard work to laugh alone                                       chapter the twentyeighth     this is the place the centre of the grove   here stands the oak the monarch of the wood    john home  the sun had risen on the broad boughs of the forest but without the power of penetrating into its recesses which hung rich with heavy dewdrops and were beginning on some of the trees to exhibit the varied tints of autumn it being the season when nature like a prodigal whose race is wellnigh run seems desirous to make up in profuse gaiety and variety of colours for the short space which her splendour has then to endure the birds were silentand even robinredbreast whose chirruping song was heard among the bushes near the lodge emboldened by the largesses with which the good old knight always encouraged his familiarity did not venture into the recesses of the wood where he encountered the sparrowhawk and other enemies of a similar description preferring the vicinity of the dwellings of man from whom he almost solely among the feathered tribes seems to experience disinterested protection  the scene was therefore at once lovely and silent when the good dr rochecliffe wrapped in a scarlet roquelaure which had seen service in its day muffling his face more from habit than necessity and supporting alice on his arm she also defended by a cloak against the cold and damp of the autumn morning glided through the tangled and long grass of the darkest alleys almost ankledeep in dew towards the place appointed for the intended duel both so eagerly maintained the consultation in which they were engaged that they were alike insensible of the roughness and discomforts of the road though often obliged to force their way through brushwood and coppice which poured down on them all the liquid pearls with which they were loaded till the mantles they were wrapped in hung lank by their sides and clung to their shoulders heavily charged with moisture they stopped when they had attained a station under the coppice and shrouded by it from which they could see all that passed on the little esplanade before the kings oak whose broad and scathed form contorted and shattered limbs and frowning brows made it appear like some ancient warworn champion well selected to be the umpire of a field of single combat  the first person who appeared at the rendezvous was the gay cavalier roger wildrake he also was wrapped in his cloak but had discarded his puritanic beaver and wore in its stead a spanish hat with a feather and gilt hatband all of which had encountered bad weather and hard service but to make amends for the appearance of poverty by the show of pretension the castor was accurately adjusted after what was rather profanely called the dme cut used among the more desperate cavaliers he advanced hastily and exclaimed aloudfirst in the field after all by jove though i bilked everard in order to have my morning draught it has done me much good he added smacking his lipswell i suppose i should search the ground ere my principal comes up whose presbyterian watch trudges as slow as his presbyterian step  he took his rapier from under his cloak and seemed about to search the thickets around  i will prevent him whispered the doctor to alice i will keep faith with youyou shall not come on the scenenisi dignus vindice nodus ill explain that another time vindex is feminine as well as masculine so the quotation is defensiblekeep you close  so saying he stepped forward on the esplanade and bowed to wildrake  master louis kerneguy said wildrake pulling off his hat but instantly discovering his error he added but noi beg your pardon sirfatter shorter oldermr kerneguys friend i suppose with whom i hope to have a turn by and byand why not now sir before our principals come up just a snack to stay the orifice of the stomach till the dinner is served sir what say you  to open the orifice of the stomach more likely or to give it a new one said the doctor  true sir said roger who seemed now in his element you say wellthat is as thereafter may bebut come sir you wear your face muffled i grant you it is honest mens fashion at this unhappy time the more is the pity but we do all above boardwe have no traitors here ill get into my gears first to encourage you and show you that you have to deal with a gentleman who honours the king and is a match fit to fight with any who follow him as doubtless you do sir since you are the friend of master louis kerneguy  all this while wildrake was busied undoing the clasps of his squarecaped cloak  offoff ye lendings he said borrowings i should more properly call you  so saying he threw the cloak from him and appeared in cuerpo in a most cavalierlike doublet of greasy crimson satin pinked and slashed with what had been once white tiffany breeches of the same and netherstocks or as we now call them stockings darned in many places and which like those of poins had been once peachcoloured a pair of pumps ill calculated for a walk through the dew and a broad shoulderbelt of tarnished embroidery completed his equipment  come sir he exclaimed make haste off with your sloughhere i stand tight and trueas loyal a lad as ever stuck rapier through a roundheadcome sir to your tools he continued we may have halfadozen thrusts before they come yet and shame them for their tardinesspshaw he exclaimed in a most disappointed tone when the doctor unfolding his cloak showed his clerical dress tush its but the parson after all  wildrakes respect for the church however and his desire to remove one who might possibly interrupt a scene to which he looked forward with peculiar satisfaction induced him presently to assume another tone  i beg pardon he said my dear doctori kiss the hem of your cassocki do by the thundering jovei beg your pardon againbut i am happy i have met with youthey are raving for your presence at the lodgeto marry or christen or bury or confess or something very urgentfor heavens sake make haste  at the lodge said the doctor why i left the lodge this instanti was there later i am sure than you could be who came the woodstock road  well replied wildrake it is at woodstock they want yourat it did i say the lodgeno nowoodstockmine host cannot be hangedhis daughter marriedhis bastard christened or his wife buriedwithout the assistance of a real clergymanyour holdenoughs wont do for themhes a true man mine host so as you value your function make haste  you will pardon me master wildrake said the doctori wait for master louis kerneguy  the devil you do exclaimed wildrake why i always knew the scots could do nothing without their minister but dn it i never thought they put them to this use neither but i have known jolly customers in orders who understood how to handle the sword as well as their prayerbook you know the purpose of our meeting doctor do you come only as a ghostly comforteror as a surgeon perhapsor do you ever take bilboa in handsasa  here he made a fencing demonstration with his sheathed rapier  i have done so sir on necessary occasion said dr rochecliffe  good sir let this stand for a necessary one said wildrake you know my devotion for the church if a divine of your skill would do me the honour to exchange but three passes with me i should think myself happy for ever  sir said rochecliffe smiling were there no other objection to what you propose i have not the meansi have no weapon  what you want the de quoi that is unlucky indeed but you have a stout cane in your handwhat hinders our trying a pass my rapier being sheathed of course until our principals come up my pumps are full of this frostdew and i shall be a toe or two out of pocket if i am to stand still all the time they are stretching themselves for i fancy doctor you are of my opinion that the matter will not be a fight of cocksparrows  my business here is to make it if possible be no fight at all said the divine  now rat me doctor but that is too spiteful said wildrake and were it not for my respect for the church i could turn presbyterian to be revenged  stand back a little if you please sir said the doctor do not press forward in that directionfor wildrake in the agitation of his movements induced by his disappointment approached the spot where alice remained still concealed  and wherefore not i pray you doctor said the cavalier  but on advancing a step he suddenly stopped short and muttered to himself with a round oath of astonishment a petticoat in the coppice by all that is reverend and at this hour in the morning whewewewhe gave vent to his surprise in a long low interjectional whistle then turning to the doctor with his finger on the side of his nose youre sly doctor dd sly but why not give me a hint of youryour commodity thereyour contraband goods gad sir i am not a man to expose the eccentricities of the church  sir said dr rochecliffe you are impertinent and if time served and it were worth my while i would chastise you  and the doctor who had served long enough in the wars to have added some of the qualities of a captain of horse to those of a divine actually raised his cane to the infinite delight of the rake whose respect for the church was by no means able to subdue his love of mischief  nay doctor said he if you wield your weapon broadswordfashion in that way and raise it as high as your head i shall be through you in a twinkling so saying he made a pass with his sheathed rapier not precisely at the doctors person but in that direction when rochecliffe changing the direction of his cane from the broadsword guard to that of the rapier made the cavaliers sword spring ten yards out of his hand with all the dexterity of my friend francalanza at this moment both the principal parties appeared on the field  everard exclaimed angrily to wildrake is this your friendship in heavens name what make you in that fools jacket and playing the pranks of a jackpudding while his worthy second somewhat crestfallen held down his head like a boy caught in roguery and went to pick up his weapon stretching his head as he passed into the coppice to obtain another glimpse if possible of the concealed object of his curiosity  charles in the meantime still more surprised at what he beheld called out on his partwhat doctor rochecliffe become literally one of the church militant and tilting with my friend cavalier wildrake may i use the freedom to ask him to withdraw as colonel everard and i have some private business to settle  it was dr rochecliffes cue on this important occasion to have armed himself with the authority of his sacred office and used a tone of interference which might have overawed even a monarch and made him feel that his monitor spoke by a warrant higher than his own but the indiscreet latitude he had just given to his own passion and the levity in which he had been detected were very unfavourable to his assuming that superiority to which so uncontrollable a spirit as that of charles wilful as a prince and capricious as a wit was at all likely to submit the doctor did however endeavour to rally his dignity and replied with the gravest and at the same time the most respectful tone he could assume that he also had business of the most urgent nature which prevented him from complying with master kerneguys wishes and leaving the spot  excuse this untimely interruption said charles taking off his hat and bowing to colonel everard which i will immediately put an end to everard gravely returned his salute and was silent  are you mad doctor rochecliffe said charlesor are you deafor have you forgotten your mothertongue i desired you to leave this place  i am not mad said the divine rousing up his resolution and regaining the natural firmness of his voicei would prevent others from being so i am not deafi would pray others to hear the voice of reason and religion i have not forgotten my mothertonguebut i have come hither to speak the language of the master of kings and princes  to fence with broomsticks i should rather suppose said the king come doctor rochecliffe this sudden fit of assumed importance befits you as little as your late frolic you are not i apprehend either a catholic priest or a scotch massjohn to claim devoted obedience from your hearers but a churchofenglandman subject to the rules of that communionand to its head in speaking the last words the king lowered his voice to a low and impressive whisper everard observing this drew back the natural generosity of his temper directing him to avoid overhearing private discourse in which the safety of the speakers might be deeply concerned they continued however to observe great caution in their forms of expression  master kerneguy said the clergyman it is not i who assume authority or control over your wishesgod forbid i do but tell you what reason scripture religion and morality alike prescribe for your rule of conduct  and i doctor said the king smiling and pointing to the unlucky cane will take your example rather than your precept if a reverend clergyman will himself fight a bout at singlestick what right can he have to interfere in gentlemens quarrelscome sir remove yourself and do not let your present obstinacy cancel former obligations  bethink yourself said the divinei can say one word which will prevent all this  do it replied the king and in doing so belie the whole tenor and actions of an honourable lifeabandon the principles of your church and become a perjured traitor and an apostate to prevent another person from discharging his duty as a gentleman this were indeed killing your friend to prevent the risk of his running himself into danger let the passive obedience which is so often in your mouth and no doubt in your head put your feet for once into motion and step aside for ten minutes within that space your assistance may be needed either as bodycurer or soulcurer  nay then said dr rochecliffe i have but one argument left  while this conversation was carried on apart everard had almost forcibly detained by his own side his follower wildrake whose greater curiosity and lesser delicacy would otherwise have thrust him forward to get if possible into the secret but when he saw the doctor turn into the coppice he whispered eagerly to everarda gold carolus to a commonwealth farthing the doctor has not only come to preach a peace but has brought the principal conditions along with him  everard made no answer he had already unsheathed his sword and charles hardly saw rochecliffes back fairly turned than he lost no time in following his example but ere they had done more than salute each other with the usual courteous nourish of their weapons dr rochecliffe again stood between them leading in his hand alice lee her garments dank with dew and her long hair heavy with moisture and totally uncurled her face was extremely pale but it was the paleness of desperate resolution not of fear there was a dead pause of astonishmentthe combatants rested on their swordsand even the forwardness of wildrake only vented itself in halfsuppressed ejaculations as well done doctorthis beats the parson among the peaseno less than your patrons daughterand mistress alice whom i thought a very snowdrop turned out a dogviolet after alla lindabrides by heavens and altogether one of ourselves  excepting these unheeded mutterings alice was the first to speak  master everard she saidmaster kerneguy you are surprised to see me hereyet why should i not tell the reason at once convinced that i am however guiltlessly the unhappy cause of your misunderstanding i am too much interested to prevent fatal consequences to pause upon any step which may end itmaster kerneguy have my wishes my entreaties my prayershave your noble thoughtsthe recollections of your own high duties no weight with you in this matter let me entreat you to consult reason religion and common sense and return your weapon  i am obedient as an eastern slave madam answered charles sheathing his sword but i assure you the matter about which you distress yourself is a mere trifle which will be much better settled betwixt colonel everard and myself in five minutes than with the assistance of the whole convocation of the church with a female parliament to assist their reverend deliberationsmr everard will you oblige me by walking a little fartherwe must change ground it seems  i am ready to attend you sir said everard who had sheathed his sword so soon as his antagonist did so  i have then no interest with you sir said alice continuing to address the kingdo you not fear i should use the secret in my power to prevent this affair going to extremity think you this gentleman who raises his hand against you if he knew  if he knew that i were lord wilmot you would sayaccident has given him proof to that effect with which he is already satisfied and i think you would find it difficult to induce him to embrace a different opinion  alice paused and looked on the king with great indignation the following words dropping from her mouth by intervals as if they burst forth one by one in spite of feelings that would have restrained themcoldselfishungratefulunkindwoe to the land whichhere she paused with marked emphasis then addedwhich shall number thee or such as thee among her nobles and rulers  nay fair alice said charles whose good nature could not but feel the severity of this reproach though too slightly to make all the desired impression you are too unjust to metoo partial to a happier man do not call me unkind i am but here to answer mr everards summons i could neither decline attending nor withdraw now i am here without loss of honour and my loss of honour would be a disgrace which must extend to manyi cannot fly from mr everardit would be too shameful if he abides by his message it must be decided as such affairs usually are if he retreats or yields it up i will for your sake wave punctilio i will not even ask an apology for the trouble it has afforded me but let all pass as if it were the consequence of some unhappy mistake the grounds of which shall remain on my part unenquired intothis i will do for your sake and it is much for a man of honour to condescend so faryou know that the condescension from me in particular is great indeed then do not call me ungenerous or ungrateful or unkind since i am ready to do all which as a man i can do and more perhaps than as a man of honour i ought to do  do you hear this markham everard exclaimed alicedo you hear thisthe dreadful option is left entirely at your disposal you were wont to be temperate in passion religious forgivingwill you for a mere punctilio drive on this private and unchristian broil to a murderous extremity believe me if you now contrary to all the better principles of your life give the reins to your passions the consequences may be such as you will rue for your lifetime and even if heaven have not mercy rue after your life is finished  markham everard remained for a moment gloomily silentwith his eyes fixed on the ground at length he looked up and answered heralice you are a soldiers daughtera soldiers sister all your relations even including one whom you then entertained some regard for have been made soldiers by these unhappy discords yet you have seen them take the fieldin some instances on contrary sides to do their duty where their principles called them without manifesting this extreme degree of interest  he continued however what is the true concern here is our relations with your own self and mine is with this gentlemans interest in you i had expected that our disagreement could be dealt with as men dispute matters of honor with your intrusion this cannot be done i have few other options for politely resolving this for you would surely hate the one who killed the other to the loss of us both therefore addressing charles in the interest of avoid this fate i am forced to yield my interest in her to you and as i will never be the means of giving her pain i trust you will not think i act unworthily in retracting the letter which gave you the trouble of attending this place at this houralice he said turning his head towards her farewell alice at once and for ever  the poor young lady whose adventitious spirit had almost deserted her attempted to repeat the word farewell but failing in the attempt only accomplished a broken and imperfect sound and would have sunk to the ground but for dr rochecliffe who caught her as she fell roger wildrake also who had twice or thrice put to his eyes what remained of a kerchief interested by the ladys evident distress though unable to comprehend the mysterious cause hastened to assist the divine in supporting so fair a burden  meanwhile the disguised prince had beheld the whole in silence but with an agitation to which he was unwonted and which his swarthy features and still more his motions began to betray his posture was at first absolutely stationary with his arms folded on his bosom as one who waits to be guided by the current of events presently after he shifted his position advanced and retired his foot clenched and opened his hand and otherwise showed symptoms that he was strongly agitated by contending feelingswas on the point too of forming some sudden resolution and yet still in uncertainty what course he should pursue  but when he saw markham everard after one look of unspeakable anguish towards alice turning his back to depart he broke out into his familiar ejaculation oddsfish this must not be in three strides he overtook the slowly retiring everard tapped him smartly on the shoulder and as he turned round said with an air of command which he well knew how to adopt at pleasure one word with you sir  at your pleasure sir replied everard and naturally conjecturing the purpose of his antagonist to be hostile took hold of his rapier with the left hand and laid the right on the hilt not displeased at the supposed call for anger is at least as much akin to disappointment as pity is said to be to love  pshaw answered the king that cannot be nowcolonel everard i am charles stewart  everard recoiled in the greatest surprise and next exclaimed impossibleit cannot be the king of scots has escaped from bristolmy lord wilmot your talents for intrigue are well known but this will not pass upon me  the king of scots master everard replied charles since you are so pleased to limit his sovereigntyat any rate the eldest son of the late sovereign of britainis now before you therefore it is impossible he could have escaped from bristol doctor rochecliffe shall be my voucher and will tell you moreover that wilmot is of a fair complexion and light hair mine you may see is swart as a raven  rochecliffe seeing what was passing abandoned alice to the care of wildrake whose extreme delicacy in the attempts he made to bring her back to life formed an amiable contrast to his usual wildness and occupied him so much that he remained for the moment ignorant of the disclosure in which he would have been so much interested as for dr rochecliffe he came forward wringing his hands in all the demonstration of extreme anxiety and with the usual exclamations attending such a state  peace doctor rochecliffe said the king with such complete selfpossession as indeed became a prince we are in the hands i am satisfied of a man of honour master everard must be pleased in finding only a fugitive prince in the person in whom he thought he had discovered a successful rival he cannot but be aware of the feelings which prevented me from taking advantage of the cover which this young ladys devoted loyalty afforded me at the risk of her own happiness he is the party who is to profit by my candour and certainly i have a right to expect that my condition already indifferent enough shall not be rendered worse by his becoming privy to it under such circumstances at any rate the avowal is made and it is for colonel everard to consider how he is to conduct himself  oh your majesty my liege my king my royal prince exclaimed wildrake who at length discovering what was passing had crawled on his knees and seizing the kings hand was kissing it more like a child mumbling gingerbread or like a lover devouring the yielded hand of his mistress than in the manner in which such salutations pass at courtif my dear friend mark everard should prove a dog on this occasion rely on me i will cut his throat on the spot were i to do the same for myself the moment afterwards  hush hush my good friend and loyal subject said the king and compose yourself for though i am obliged to put on the prince for a moment we have not privacy or safety to receive our subjects in king cambyses vein  everard who had stood for a time utterly confounded awoke at length like a man from a dream  sire he said bowing low and with profound deference if i do not offer you the homage of a subject with knee and sword it is because god by whom kings reign has denied you for the present the power of ascending your throne without rekindling civil war for your safety being endangered by me let not such an imagination for an instant cross your mind had i not respected your personwere i not bound to you for the candour with which your noble avowal has prevented the misery of my future life your misfortunes would have rendered your person as sacred so far as i can protect it as it could be esteemed by the most devoted royalist in the kingdom if your plans are soundly considered and securely laid think that all which is now passed is but a dream if they are in such a state that i can aid them saving my duty to the commonwealth which will permit me to be privy to no schemes of actual violence your majesty may command my services  it may be i may be troublesome to you sir said the king for my fortunes are not such as to permit me to reject even the most limited offers of assistance but if i can i will dispense with applying to you i would not willingly put any mans compassion at war with his sense of duty on my accountdoctor i think there will be no farther tilting today either with sword or cane so we may as well return to the lodge and leave theselooking at alice and everardwho may have more to say in explanation  nono exclaimed alice who was now perfectly come to herself and partly by her own observation and partly from the report of dr rochecliffe comprehended all that had taken placemy cousin everard and i have nothing to explain he will forgive me for having riddled with him when i dared not speak plainly and i forgive him for having read my riddle wrong but my father has my promisewe must not correspond or converse for the presenti return instantly to the lodge and he to woodstock unless you sire bowing to the king command his duty otherwise instant to the town cousin markham and if danger should approach give us warning  everard would have delayed her departure would have excused himself for his unjust suspicion would have said a thousand things but she would not listen to him saying for all other answerfarewell markham till god send better days  she is an angel of truth and beauty said roger wildrake and i like a blasphemous heretic called her a lindabrides footnote a sort of court name for a female of no reputation but has your majesty craving your pardon no commands for poor hodge wildrake who will blow out his own or any other mans brains in england to do your grace a pleasure  we entreat our good friend wildrake to do nothing hastily said charles smiling such brains as his are rare and should not be rashly dispersed as the like may not be easily collected we recommend him to be silent and prudentto tilt no more with loyal clergymen of the church of england and to get himself a new jacket with all convenient speed to which we beg to contribute our royal aid when fit time comes we hope to find other service for him  as he spoke he slid ten pieces into the hand of poor wildrake who confounded with the excess of his loyal gratitude blubbered like a child and would have followed the king had not dr rochecliffe in few words but peremptory insisted that he should return with his patron promising him he should certainly be employed in assisting the kings escape could an opportunity be found of using his services  be so generous reverend sir and you bind me to you for ever said the cavalier and i conjure you not to keep malice against me on account of the foolery you wot of  i have no occasion captain wildrake said the doctor for i think i had the best of it  well then doctor i forgive you on my part and i pray you for christian charity let me have a finger in this good service for as i live in hope of it rely that i shall die of disappointment  while the doctor and soldier thus spoke together charles took leave of everard who remained uncovered while he spoke to him with his usual gracei need not bid you no longer be jealous of me said the king for i presume you will scarce think of a match betwixt alice and me which would be too losing a one on her side for other thoughts the wildest libertine could not entertain them towards so highminded a creature and believe me that my sense of her merit did not need this last distinguished proof of her truth and loyalty i saw enough of her from her answers to some idle sallies of gallantry to know with what a lofty character she is endowed mr everard her happiness i see depends on you and i trust you will be the careful guardian of it if we can take any obstacle out of the way of your joint happiness be assured we will use our influencefarewell sir if we cannot be better friends do not at least let us entertain harder or worse thoughts of each other than we have now  there was something in the manner of charles that was extremely affecting something too in his condition as a fugitive in the kingdom which was his own by inheritance that made a direct appeal to everards bosomthough in contradiction to the dictates of that policy which he judged it his duty to pursue in the distracted circumstances of the country he remained as we have said uncovered and in his manner testified the highest expression of reverence up to the point when such might seem a symbol of allegiance he bowed so low as almost to approach his lips to the hand of charlesbut he did not kiss iti would rescue your person sir he said with the purchase of my own life morehe stopped short and the king took up his sentence where it broke offmore you cannot do said charles to maintain an honourable consistencybut what you have said is enough you cannot render homage to my proffered hand as that of a sovereign but you will not prevent my taking yours as a friendif you allow me to call myself soi am sure as a wellwisher at least  the generous soul of everard was touchedhe took the kings hand and pressed it to his lips  oh he said were better times to come  bind yourself to nothing dear everard said the goodnatured prince partaking his emotionwe reason ill while our feelings are moved i will recruit no man to his loss nor will i have my fallen fortunes involve those of others because they have humanity enough to pity my present condition if better times come why we will meet again and i hope to our mutual satisfaction if not as your future fatherinlaw would say a benevolent smile came over his face and accorded not unmeetly with his glistening eyesif not this parting was well made  everard turned away with a deep bow almost choking under contending feelings the uppermost of which was a sense of the generosity with which charles at his own imminent risk had cleared away the darkness that seemed about to overwhelm his prospects of happiness for life mixed with a deep sense of the perils by which he was environed he returned to the little town followed by his attendant wildrake who turned back so often with weeping eyes and hands clasped and uplifted as supplicating heaven that everard was obliged to remind him that his gestures might be observed by some one and occasion suspicion  the generous conduct of the king during the closing part of this remarkable scene had not escaped alices notice and erasing at once from her mind all resentment of charless former conduct and all the suspicions they had deservedly excited awakened in her bosom a sense of the natural goodness of his disposition which permitted her to unite regard for his person with that reverence for his high office in which she had been educated as a portion of her creed she felt convinced and delighted with the conviction that his virtues were his own his libertinism the fault of education or rather want of education and the corrupting advice of sycophants and flatterers she could not know or perhaps did not in that moment consider that in a soil where no care is taken to eradicate tares they will outgrow and smother the wholesome seed even if the last is more natural to the soil for as dr rochecliffe informed her afterwards for her edification promising as was his custom to explain the precise words on some future occasion if she would put him in mindvirtus rectorem ducemque desiderat vitia sine magistro discuntur footnote the quotations of the learned doctor and antiquary were often left uninterpreted though seldom incommunicated owing to his contempt for those who did not understand the learned languages and his dislike to the labour of translation for the benefit of ladies and of country gentlemen that fair readers and country thanes may not on this occasion burst in ignorance we add the meaning of the passage in the textvirtue requires the aid of a governor and director vices are learned without a teacher there was no room for such reflections at present conscious of mutual sincerity by a sort of intellectual communication through which individuals are led to understand each other better perhaps in delicate circumstances than by words reserve and simulation appeared to be now banished from the intercourse between the king and alice with manly frankness and at the same time with princely condescension he requested her exhausted as she was to accept of his arm on the way homeward instead of that of dr rochecliffe and alice accepted of his support with modest humility but without a shadow of mistrust or fear it seemed as if the last half hour had satisfied them perfectly with the character of each other and that each had full conviction of the purity and sincerity of the others intentions  dr rochecliffe in the meantime had fallen some four or five paces behind for less light and active than alice who had besides the assistance of the kings support he was unable without effort and difficulty to keep up with the pace of charles who then was as we have elsewhere noticed one of the best walkers in england and was sometimes apt to forget as great men will that others were inferior to him in activity  dear alice said the king but as if the epithet were entirely fraternal i like your everard muchi would to god he were of our determinationbut since that cannot be i am sure he will prove a generous enemy may it please you sire said alice modestly but with some firmness my cousin will never be your majestys personal enemyand he is one of the few on whose slightest word you may rely more than on the oath of those who profess more strongly and formally he is utterly incapable of abusing your majestys most generous and voluntary confidence  on my honour i believe so alice replied the king but oddsfish my girl let majesty sleep for the presentit concerns my safety as i told your brother latelycall me sir then which belongs alike to king peer knight and gentlemanor rather let me be wild louis kerneguy again alice looked down and shook her head that cannot be please your majesty  what louis was a saucy companiona naughty presuming boyand you cannot abide himwell perhaps you are rightbut we will wait for dr rochecliffehe said desirous with goodnatured delicacy to make alice aware that he had no purpose of engaging her in any discussion which could recall painful ideas they paused accordingly and again she felt relieved and grateful  i cannot persuade our fair friend mistress alice doctor said the king that she must in prudence forbear using titles of respect to me while there are such very slender means of sustaining them  it is a reproach to earth and to fortune answered the divine as fast as his recovered breath would permit him that your most sacred majestys present condition should not accord with the rendering of those honours which are your own by birth and which with gods blessing on the efforts of your loyal subjects i hope to see rendered to you as your hereditary right by the universal voice of the three kingdoms  true doctor replied the king but in the meanwhile can you expound to mistress alice lee two lines of horace which i have carried in my thick head several years till now they have come pat to my purpose as my canny subjects of scotland say if you keep a thing seven years you are sure to find a use for it at lasttelephusay so it begins    telephus et peleus cum pauper et exul uterque   projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba  i will explain the passage to mistress alice said the doctor when she reminds me of itor rather he added recollecting that his ordinary dilatory answer on such occasions ought not to be returned when the order for exposition emanated from his sovereign i will repeat a poor couplet from my own translation of the poem    heroes and kings in exile forced to roam   leave swelling phrase and sevenleagued words at home  a most admirable version doctor said charles i feel all its force and particularly the beautiful rendering of sesquipedalia verba into sevenleagued bootswords i meanit reminds me like half the things i meet with in this world of the contes de commère loye footnote tales of mother goose  thus conversing they reached the lodge and as the king went to his chamber to prepare for the breakfast summons now impending the idea crossed his mind wilmot and villiers and killigrew would laugh at me did they hear of a campaign in which neither man nor woman had been conqueredbut oddsfish let them laugh as they will there is something at my heart which tells me that for once in my life i have acted well  that day and the next were spent in tranquillity the king waiting impatiently for the intelligence which was to announce to him that a vessel was prepared somewhere on the coast none such was yet in readiness but he learned that the indefatigable albert lee was at great personal risk traversing the seacoast from town to village and endeavouring to find means of embarkation among the friends of the royal cause and the correspondents of dr rochecliffe                                       chapter the twentyninth     ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch   two gentlemen of verona  at this time we should give some account of the other actors in our drama the interest due to the principal personages having for some time engrossed our attention exclusively  we are therefore to inform the reader that the lingering longings of the commissioners who had been driven forth of their proposed paradise of woodstock not by a cherub indeed but as they thought by spirits of another sort still detained them in the vicinity they had indeed left the little borough under pretence of indifferent accommodation the more palpable reasons were that they entertained some resentment against everard as the means of their disappointment and had no mind to reside where their proceedings could be overlooked by him although they took leave in terms of the utmost respect they went however no farther than oxford and remained there as ravens who are accustomed to witness the chase sit upon a tree or crag at a little distance and watch the disembowelling of the deer expecting the relics which fall to their share meantime the university and city but especially the former supplied them with some means of employing their various faculties to advantage until the expected moment when as they hoped they should either be summoned to windsor or woodstock should once more be abandoned to their discretion  bletson to pass the time vexed the souls of such learned and pious divines and scholars as he could intrude his hateful presence upon by sophistry atheistical discourse and challenges to them to impugn the most scandalous theses desborough one of the most brutally ignorant men of the period got himself nominated the head of a college and lost no time in cutting down trees and plundering plate as for harrison he preached in full uniform in saint marys church wearing his buffcoat boots and spurs as if he were about to take the field for the fight at armageddon and it was hard to say whether the seat of learning religion and loyalty as it is called by clarendon was more vexed by the rapine of desborough the cold scepticism of bletson or the frantic enthusiasm of the fifthmonarchy champion  ever and anon soldiers under pretence of relieving guard or otherwise went and came betwixt woodstock and oxford and maintained it may be supposed a correspondence with trusty tomkins who though he chiefly resided in the town of woodstock visited the lodge occasionally and to whom therefore they doubtless trusted for information concerning the proceedings there  indeed this man tomkins seemed by some secret means to have gained the confidence in part if not in whole of almost every one connected with these intrigues all closeted him all conversed with him in private those who had the means propitiated him with gifts those who had not were liberal of promises when he chanced to appear at woodstock which always seemed as it were by accidentif he passed through the hall the knight was sure to ask him to take the foils and was equally certain to be after less or more resistance victorious in the encounter so in consideration of so many triumphs the good sir henry almost forgave him the sins of rebellion and puritanism then if his slow and formal step was heard in the passages approaching the gallery dr rochecliffe though he never introduced him to his peculiar boudoir was sure to meet master tomkins in some neutral apartment and to engage him in long conversations which apparently had great interest for both  neither was the independents reception below stairs less gracious than above joceline failed not to welcome him with the most cordial frankness the pasty and the flagon were put in immediate requisition and good cheer was the general word the means for this it may be observed had grown more plenty at woodstock since the arrival of dr rochecliffe who in quality of agent for several royalists had various sums of money at his disposal by these funds it is likely that trusty tomkins also derived his own full advantage  in his occasional indulgence in what he called a fleshly frailty and for which he said he had a privilege which was in truth an attachment to strong liquors and that in no moderate degree his language at other times remarkably decorous and reserved became wild and animated he sometimes talked with all the unction of an old debauchee of former exploits such as deerstealing orchardrobbing drunken gambols and desperate affrays in which he had been engaged in the earlier part of his life sung bacchanalian and amorous ditties dwelt sometimes upon adventures which drove phoebe mayflower from the company and penetrated even the deaf ears of dame jellicot so as to make the buttery in which he held his carousals no proper place for the poor old woman  in the middle of these wild rants tomkins twice or thrice suddenly ran into religious topics and spoke mysteriously but with great animation and a rich eloquence on the happy and preeminent saints who were saints as he termed them indeedmen who had stormed the inner treasurehouse of heaven and possessed themselves of its choicest jewels all other sects he treated with the utmost contempt as merely quarrelling as he expressed it like hogs over a trough about husks and acorns under which derogatory terms he included alike the usual rites and ceremonies of public devotion the ordinances of the established churches of christianity and the observances nay the forbearances enjoined by every class of christians scarcely hearing and not at all understanding him joceline who seemed his most frequent confidant on such occasions generally led him back into some strain of rude mirth or old recollection of follies before the civil wars without caring about or endeavouring to analyze the opinion of this saint of an evil fashion but fully sensible of the protection which his presence afforded at woodstock and confident in the honest meaning of so freespoken a fellow to whom ale and brandy when better liquor was not to be come by seemed to be principal objects of life and who drank a health to the king or any one else whenever required provided the cup in which he was to perform the libation were but a brimmer  these peculiar doctrines which were entertained by a sect sometimes termed the family of love but more commonly ranters had made some progress in times when such variety of religious opinions were prevalent that men pushed the jarring heresies to the verge of absolute and most impious insanity secrecy had been enjoined on these frantic believers in a most blasphemous doctrine by the fear of consequences should they come to be generally announced and it was the care of master tomkins to conceal the spiritual freedom which he pretended to have acquired from all whose resentment would have been stirred by his public avowal of them this was not difficult for their profession of faith permitted nay required their occasional conformity with the sectaries or professors of any creed which chanced to be uppermost  tomkins had accordingly the art to pass himself on dr rochecliffe as still a zealous member of the church of england though serving under the enemys colours as a spy in their camp and as he had on several times given him true and valuable intelligence this active intriguer was the more easily induced to believe his professions  nevertheless lest this persons occasional presence at the lodge which there were perhaps no means to prevent without exciting suspicion should infer danger to the kings person rochecliffe whatever confidence he otherwise reposed in him recommended that if possible the king should keep always out of his sight and when accidentally discovered that he should only appear in the character of louis kerneguy joseph tomkins he said was he really believed honest joe but honesty was a horse which might be overburdened and there was no use in leading our neighbour into temptation  it seemed as if tomkins himself had acquiesced in this limitation of confidence exercised towards him or that he wished to seem blinder than he really was to the presence of this stranger in the family it occurred to joceline who was a very shrewd fellow that once or twice when by inevitable accident tomkins had met kerneguy he seemed less interested in the circumstance than he would have expected from the mans disposition which was naturally prying and inquisitive he asked no questions about the young stranger said jocelinegod avert that he knows or suspects too much but his suspicions were removed when in the course of their subsequent conversation joseph tomkins mentioned the kings escape from bristol as a thing positively certain and named both the vessel in which he said he had gone off and the master who commanded her seeming so convinced of the truth of the report that joceline judged it impossible he could have the slightest suspicion of the reality  yet notwithstanding this persuasion and the comradeship which had been established between them the faithful underkeeper resolved to maintain a strict watch over his gossip tomkins and be in readiness to give the alarm should occasion arise true he thought he had reason to believe that his said friend notwithstanding his drunken and enthusiastic rants was as trustworthy as he was esteemed by dr rochecliffe yet still he was an adventurer the outside and lining of whose cloak were of different colours and a high reward and pardon for past acts of malignancy might tempt him once more to turn his tippet for these reasons joceline kept a strict though unostentatious watch over trusty tomkins  we have said that the discreet seneschal was universally well received at woodstock whether in the borough or at the lodge and that even joceline joliffe was anxious to conceal any suspicions which he could not altogether repress under a great show of cordial hospitality there were however two individuals who for very different reasons nourished personal dislike against the individual so generally acceptable  one was nehemiah holdenough who remembered with great bitterness of spirit the independents violent intrusion into his pulpit and who ever spoke of him in private as a lying missionary into whom satan had put a spirit of delusion and preached besides a solemn sermon on the subject of the false prophet out of whose mouth came frogs the discourse was highly prized by the mayor and most of the better class who conceived that their minister had struck a heavy blow at the very root of independency on the other hand those of the private spirit contended that joseph tomkins had made a successful and triumphant rally in an exhortation on the evening of the same day in which he proved to the conviction of many handicraftsmen that the passage in jeremiah the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bare rule by their means was directly applicable to the presbyterian system of church government the clergyman dispatched an account of his adversarys conduct to the reverend master edwards to be inserted in the next edition of gangraena as a pestilent heretic and tomkins recommended the parson to his master desborough as a good subject on whom to impose a round fine for vexing the private spirit assuring him at the same time that though the minister might seem poor yet if a few troopers were quartered on him till the fine was paid every rich shopkeepers wife in the borough would rob the till rather than go without the mammon of unrighteousness with which to redeem their priest from sufferance holding according to his expression with laban you have taken from me my gods and what have i more there was of course little cordiality between the polemical disputants when religious debate took so worldly a turn  but joe tomkins was much more concerned at the evil opinion which seemed to be entertained against him by one whose good graces he was greatly more desirous to obtain than those of nehemiah holdenough this was no other than pretty mistress phoebe mayflower for whose conversion he had felt a strong vocation ever since his lecture upon shakspeare on their first meeting at the lodge he seemed desirous however to carry on this more serious work in private and especially to conceal his labours from his friend joceline joliffe lest perchance he had been addicted to jealousy but it was in vain that he plied the faithful damsel sometimes with verses from the canticles sometimes with quotations from greens arcadia or pithy passages from venus and adonis and doctrines of a nature yet more abstruse from the popular work entitled aristotles masterpiece unto no wooing of his sacred or profane metaphysical or physical would phoebe mayflower seriously incline  the maiden loved joceline joliffe on the one hand and on the other if she disliked joseph tomkins when she first saw him as a rebellious puritan she had not been at all reconciled by finding reason to regard him as a hypocritical libertine she hated him in both capacitiesnever endured his conversation when she could escape from itand when obliged to remain listened to him only because she knew he had been so deeply trusted that to offend him might endanger the security of the family in the service of which she had been born and bred up and to whose interest she was devoted for reasons somewhat similar she did not suffer her dislike of the steward to become manifest before joceline joliffe whose spirit as a forester and a soldier might have been likely to bring matters to an arbitrement in which the couteau de chasse and quarterstaff of her favourite would have been too unequally matched with the long rapier and pistols which his dangerous rival always carried about his person but it is difficult to blind jealousy when there is any cause of doubt and perhaps the sharp watch maintained by joceline on his comrade was prompted not only by his zeal for the kings safety but by some vague suspicion that tomkins was not ill disposed to poach upon his own fair manor  phoebe in the meanwhile like a prudent girl sheltered herself as much as possible by the presence of goody jellicot then indeed it is true the independent or whatever he was used to follow her with his addresses to very little purpose for phoebe seemed as deaf through wilfulness as the old matron by natural infirmity this indifference highly incensed her new lover and induced him anxiously to watch for a time and place in which he might plead his suit with an energy that should command attention fortune that malicious goddess who so often ruins us by granting the very object of our vows did at length procure him such an opportunity as he had long coveted  it was about sunset or shortly after when phoebe upon whose activity much of the domestic arrangements depended went as far as fair rosamonds spring to obtain water for the evening meal or rather to gratify the prejudice of the old knight who believed that celebrated fountain afforded the choicest supplies of the necessary element such was the respect in which he was held by his whole family that to neglect any of his wishes that could be gratified though with inconvenience to themselves would in their estimation have been almost equal to a breach of religious duty  to fill the pitcher had we know been of late a troublesome task but jocelines ingenuity had so far rendered it easy by repairing rudely a part of the ruined front of the ancient fountain that the water was collected and trickling along a wooden spout dropped from a height of about two feet a damsel was thereby enabled to place her pitcher under the slowly dropping supply and without toil to herself might wait till her vessel was filled  phoebe mayflower on the evening we allude to saw for the first time this little improvement and justly considering it as a piece of gallantry of her silvan admirer designed to save her the trouble of performing her task in a more inconvenient manner she gratefully employed the minutes of ease which the contrivance procured her in reflecting on the goodnature and ingenuity of the obliging engineer and perhaps in thinking he might have done as wisely to have waited till she came to the fountain that he might have secured personal thanks for the trouble he had taken but then she knew he was detained in the buttery with that odious tomkins and rather than have seen the independent along with him she would have renounced the thought of meeting joceline  as she was thus reflecting fortune was malicious enough to send tomkins to the fountain and without joceline when she saw his figure darken the path up which he came an anxious reflection came over the poor maidens breast that she was alone and within the verge of the forest where in general persons were prohibited to come during the twilight for fear of disturbing the deer settling to their repose she encouraged herself however and resolved to show no sense of fear although as the steward approached there was something in the mans look and eye no way calculated to allay her apprehensions  the blessings of the evening upon you my pretty maiden he said i meet you even as the chief servant of abraham who was a steward like myself met rebecca the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah at the well of the city of nahor in mesopotamia shall i not therefore say to you set down thy pitcher that i may drink  the pitcher is at your service master tomkins she replied and you may drink as much as you will but you have i warrant drank better liquor and that not long since  it was indeed obvious that the steward had arisen from a revel for his features were somewhat flushed though he had stopped far short of intoxication but phoebes alarm at his first appearance was rather increased when she observed how he had been lately employed  i do but use my privilege my pretty rebecca the earth is given to the saints and the fulness thereof they shall occupy and enjoy it both the riches of the mine and the treasures of the vine and they shall rejoice and their hearts be merry within them thou hast yet to learn the privileges of the saints my rebecca  my name is phoebe said the maiden in order to sober the enthusiastic rapture which he either felt or affected  phoebe after the flesh he said but rebecca being spiritualised for art thou not a wandering and stray sheepand am i not sent to fetch thee within the foldwherefore else was it said thou shalt find her seated by the well in the wood which is called after the ancient harlot rosamond  you have found me sitting here sure enough said phoebe but if you wish to keep me company you must walk to the lodge with me and you shall carry my pitcher for me if you will be so kind i will hear all the good things you have to say to me as we go along but sir henry calls for his glass of water regularly before prayers  what exclaimed tomkins hath the old man of bloody hand and perverse heart sent thee hither to do the work of a bondswoman verily thou shalt return enfranchised and for the water thou hast drawn for him it shall be poured forth even as david caused to be poured forth the water of the well of bethlehem  so saying he emptied the water pitcher in spite of phoebes exclamations and entreaties he then replaced the vessel beneath the little conduit and continuedknow that this shall be a token to thee the filling of that pitcher shall be like the running of a sandglass and if within the time which shall pass ere it rises to the brim thou shalt listen to the words which i shall say to thee then it shall be well with thee and thy place shall be high among those who forsaking the instruction which is as milk for babes and sucklings eat the strong food which nourishes manhood but if the pitcher shall overbrim with water ere thy ear shall hear and understand thou shalt then be given as a prey and as a bondsmaiden unto those who shall possess the fat and the fair of the earth  you frighten me master tomkins said phoebe though i am sure you do not mean to do so i wonder how you dare speak words so like the good words in the bible when you know how you laughed at your own master and all the rest of themwhen you helped to play the hobgoblins at the lodge  thinkst thou then thou simple fool that in putting that deceit upon harrison and the rest i exceeded my privilegesnay verilylisten to me foolish girl when in former days i lived the most wild malignant rakehell in oxfordshire frequenting wakes and fairs dancing around maypoles and showing my lustihood at football and cudgelplayingyea when i was called in the language of the uncircumcised philip hazeldine and was one of the singers in the choir and one of the ringers in the steeple and served the priest yonder by name rochecliffe i was not farther from the straight road than when after long reading i at length found one blind guide after another all burners of bricks in egypt i left them one by one the poor tool harrison being the last and by my own unassisted strength i have struggled forward to the broad and blessed light whereof thou too phoebe shalt be partaker  i thank you master tomkins said phoebe suppressing some fear under an appearance of indifference but i shall have light enough to carry home my pitcher would you but let me take it and that is all the want of light i shall have this evening  so saying she stooped to take the pitcher from the fountain but he snatched hold of her by the arm and prevented her from accomplishing her purpose phoebe however was the daughter of a bold forester prompt at thoughts of selfdefence and though she missed getting hold of the pitcher she caught up instead a large pebble which she kept concealed in her right hand  stand up foolish maiden and listen said the independent sternly and know in one word that sin for which the spirit of man is punished with the vengeance of heaven lieth not in the corporal act but in the thought of the sinner believe lovely phoebe that to the pure all acts are pure and that sin is in our thought not in our actionseven as the radiance of the day is dark to a blind man but seen and enjoyed by him whose eyes receive it to him who is but a novice in the things of the spirit much is enjoined much is prohibited and he is fed with milk fit for babesfor him are ordinances prohibitions and commands but the saint is above these ordinances and restraintsto him as to the chosen child of the house is given the passkey to open all locks which withhold him from the enjoyment of his hearts desire into such pleasant paths will i guide thee lovely phoebe as shall unite in joy in innocent freedom pleasures which to the unprivileged are sinful and prohibited i really wish master tomkins you would let me go home said phoebe not comprehending the nature of his doctrine but disliking at once his words and his manner he went on however with the accursed and blasphemous doctrines which in common with others of the pretended saints he had adopted after having long shifted from one sect to another until he settled in the vile belief that sin being of a character exclusively spiritual only existed in the thoughts and that the worst actions were permitted to those who had attained to the pitch of believing themselves above ordinance thus my phoebe he continued endeavouring to draw her towards him i can offer thee more than ever was held out to woman since adam first took his bride by the hand it shall be for others to stand drylipped doing penance like papists by abstinence when the vessel of pleasure pours forth its delights dost thou love moneyi have it and can procure moream at liberty to procure it on every hand and by every meansthe earth is mine and its fulness do you desire powerwhich of these poor cheated commissionerfellows estates dost thou covet i will work it out for thee for i deal with a mightier spirit than any of them and it is not without warrant that i have aided the malignant rochecliffe and the clown joliffe to frighten and baffle them in the guise they did ask what thou wilt phoebe i can give or i can procure it for theethen enter with me into a life of delight in this world which shall prove but an anticipation of the joys of paradise hereafter  again the fanatical voluptuary endeavoured to pull the poor girl towards him while she alarmed but not scared out of her presence of mind endeavoured by fair entreaty to prevail on him to release her but his features in themselves not marked had acquired a frightful expression and he exclaimed no phoebedo not think to escapethou art given to me as a captivethou hast neglected the hour of grace and it has glided pastsee the water trickles over thy pitcher which was to be a sign between ustherefore i will urge thee no more with words of which thou art not worthy but treat thee as a recusant of offered grace  master tomkins said phoebe in an imploring tone consider for gods sake i am a fatherless childdo me no injury it would be a shame to your strength and your manhoodi cannot understand your fine wordsi will think on them till tomorrow then in rising resentment she added more vehementlyi will not be used rudelystand off or i will do you a mischief but as he pressed upon her with a violence of which the object could not be mistaken and endeavoured to secure her right hand she exclaimed take it then with a wanion to youand struck him an almost stunning blow on the face with the pebble which she held ready for such an extremity  the fanatic let her go and staggered backward half stupified while phoebe instantly betook herself to flight screaming for help as she ran but still grasping the victorious pebble irritated to frenzy by the severe blow which he had received tomkins pursued with every black passion in his soul and in his face mingled with fear least his villany should be discovered he called on phoebe loudly to stop and had the brutality to menace her with one of his pistols if she continued to fly yet she slacked not her pace for his threats and he must either have executed them or seen her escape to carry the tale to the lodge had she not unhappily stumbled over the projecting root of a firtree but as he rushed upon his prey rescue interposed in the person of joceline joliffe with his quarterstaff on his shoulder how now what means this he said stepping between phoebe and her pursuer tomkins already roused to fury made no other answer than by discharging at joceline the pistol which he held in his hand the ball grazed the under keepers face who in requital of the assault and saying aha let ash answer iron applied his quarterstaff with so much force to the independents head that lighting on the left temple the blow proved almost instantly mortal  a few convulsive struggles were accompanied with these broken words jocelinei am gonebut i forgive theedoctor rochecliffei wish i had minded moreohthe clergymanthe funeral serviceas he uttered these words indicative it may be of his return to a creed which perhaps he had never abjured so thoroughly as he had persuaded himself his voice was lost in a groan which rattling in the throat seemed unable to find its way to the air these were the last symptoms of life the clenched hands presently relaxedthe closed eyes opened and stared on the heavens a lifeless jellythe limbs extended themselves and stiffened the body which was lately animated with life was now a lump of senseless claythe soul dismissed from its earthly tenement in a moment so unhallowed was gone before the judgmentseat  oh what have you donewhat have you done joceline exclaimed phoebe you have killed the man  better than he should have killed me answered joceline for he was none of the blinkers that miss their mark twice runningand yet i am sorry for himmany a merry bout have we had together when he was wild philip hazeldine and then he was bad enough but since he daubed over his vices with hypocrisy he seems to have proved worse devil than ever  oh joceline come away said poor phoebe and do not stand gazing on him thus for the woodsman resting on his fatal weapon stood looking down on the corpse with the appearance of a man half stunned at the event  this comes of the ale pitcher she continued in the true style of female consolation as i have often told youfor heavens sake come to the lodge and let us consult what is to be done  stay first girl and let me drag him out of the path we must not have him lie herein all mens sightwill you not help me wench  i cannot jocelinei would not touch a lock on him for all woodstock  i must to this gear myself then said joceline who a soldier as well as a woodsman still had great reluctance to the necessary task something in the face and broken words of the dying man had made a deep and terrific impression on nerves not easily shaken he accomplished it however so far as to drag the late steward out of the open path and bestow his body amongst the undergrowth of brambles and briers so as not to be visible unless particularly looked for he then returned to phoebe who had sate speechless all the while beneath the tree over whose roots she had stumbled  come away wench he said come away to the lodge and let us study how this is to be answered forthe mishap of his being killed will strangely increase our danger what had he sought of thee wench when you ran from him like a madwomanbut i can guessphil was always a devil among the girls and i think as doctor rochecliffe says that since he turned saint he took to himself seven devils worse than himselfhere is the very place where i saw him with his sword in his hand raised against the old knight and he a child of the parishit was high treason at leastbut by my faith he hath paid for it at last  but oh joceline said phoebe how could you take so wicked a man into your counsels and join him in all his plots about scaring the roundhead gentlemen  why look thee wench i thought i knew him at the first meeting especially when bevis who was bred here when he was a dogleader would not fly at him and when we made up our old acquaintance at the lodge i found he kept up a close correspondence with doctor rochecliffe who was persuaded that he was a good kings man and held consequently good intelligence with himthe doctor boasts to have learned much through his means i wish to heaven he may not have been as communicative in turn  oh joceline said the waitingwoman you should never have let him within the gate of the lodge  no more i would if i had known how to keep him out but when he went so frankly into our scheme and told me how i was to dress myself like robinson the player whose ghost haunted harrisoni wish no ghost may haunt mewhen he taught me how to bear myself to terrify his lawful master what could i think wench i only trust the doctor has kept the great secret of all from his knowledgebut here we are at the lodge go to thy chamber wench and compose thyself i must seek out doctor rochecliffe he is ever talking of his quick and ready invention here come times i think that will demand it all  phoebe went to her chamber accordingly but the strength arising from the pressure of danger giving way when the danger was removed she quickly fell into a succession of hysterical fits which required the constant attention of dame jellicot and the less alarmed but more judicious care of mistress alice before they even abated in their rapid recurrence  the underkeeper carried his news to the politic doctor who was extremely disconcerted alarmed nay angry with joceline for having slain a person on whose communications he had accustomed himself to rely yet his looks declared his suspicion whether his confidence had not been too rashly conferreda suspicion which pressed him the more anxiously that he was unwilling to avow it as a derogation from his character for shrewdness on which he valued himself  dr rochecliffes reliance however on the fidelity of tomkins had apparently good grounds before the civil wars as may be partly collected from what has been already hinted at tomkins under his true name of hazeldine had been under the protection of the rector of woodstock occasionally acted as his clerk was a distinguished member of his choir and being a handy and ingenious fellow was employed in assisting the antiquarian researches of dr rochecliffe through the interior of woodstock when he engaged in the opposite side in the civil wars he still kept up his intelligence with the divine to whom he had afforded what seemed valuable information from time to time his assistance had latterly been eminently useful in aiding the doctor with the assistance of joceline and phoebe in contriving and executing the various devices by which the parliamentary commissioners had been expelled from woodstock indeed his services in this respect had been thought worthy of no less a reward than a present of what plate remained at the lodge which had been promised to the independent accordingly the doctor therefore while admitting he might be a bad man regretted him as a useful one whose death if enquired after was likely to bring additional danger on a house which danger already surrounded and which contained a pledge so precious                                       chapter the thirtieth     cassio that thrust had been my enemy indeed   but that my coat is better than thou knowst     othello  on the dark october night succeeding the evening on which tomkins was slain colonel everard besides his constant attendant roger wildrake had master nehemiah holdenough with him as a guest at supper the devotions of the evening having been performed according to the presbyterian fashion a light entertainment and a double quart of burnt claret were placed before his friends at nine oclock an hour unusually late master holdenough soon engaged himself in a polemical discourse against sectaries and independents without being aware that his eloquence was not very interesting to his principal hearer whose ideas in the meanwhile wandered to woodstock and all which it containedthe prince who lay concealed therehis uncleabove all alice lee as for wildrake after bestowing a mental curse both on sectaries and presbyterians as being in his opinion never a barrel the better herring he stretched out his limbs and would probably have composed himself to rest but that he as well as his patron had thoughts which murdered sleep  the party were waited upon by a little gipsylooking boy in an orangetawny doublet much decayed and garnished with blue worsted lace the rogue looked somewhat stinted in size but active both in intelligence and in limb as his black eyes seemed to promise by their vivacity he was an attendant of wildrakes choice who had conferred on him the nom de guerre of spitfire and had promised him promotion so soon as his young protegé breakfast was fit to succeed him in his present office it need scarce be said that the manege was maintained entirely at the expense of colonel everard who allowed wildrake to arrange the household very much according to his pleasure the page did not omit in offering the company wine from time to time to accommodate wildrake with about twice the number of opportunities of refreshing himself which he considered it necessary to afford to the colonel or his reverend guest  while they were thus engaged the good divine lost in his own argument and the hearers in their private thoughts their attention was about halfpast ten arrested by a knocking at the door of the house to those who have anxious hearts trifles give cause of alarm  even a thing so simple as a knock at the door may have a character which excites apprehension this was no quiet gentle tap intimating a modest intruder no redoubled rattle as the pompous annunciation of some vain person neither did it resemble the formal summons to formal business nor the cheerful visit of some welcome friend it was a single blow solemn and stern if not actually menacing in the sound the door was opened by some of the persons of the house a heavy foot ascended the stair a stout man entered the room and drawing the cloak from his face said markham everard i greet thee in gods name  it was general cromwell  everard surprised and taken at unawares endeavoured in vain to find words to express his astonishment a bustle occurred in receiving the general assisting him to uncloak himself and offering in dumb show the civilities of reception the general cast his keen eye around the apartment and fixing it first on the divine addressed everard as follows a reverend man i see is with thee thou art not one of those good markham who let the time unnoted and unimproved pass away casting aside the things of this worldpressing forward to those of the nextit is by thus using our time in this poor seat of terrestrial sin and care that we may as it werebut how is this he continued suddenly changing his tone and speaking briefly sharply and anxiously one hath left the room since i entered  wildrake had indeed been absent for a minute or two but had now returned and stepped forward from a bay window as if he had been out of sight only not out of the apartment not so sir i stood but in the background out of respect noble general i hope all is well with the estate that your excellency makes us so late a visit would not your excellency choose some  ah said oliver looking sternly and fixedly at himour trusty gobetweenour faithful confidantno sir at present i desire nothing more than a kind reception which methinks my friend markham everard is in no hurry to give me  you bring your own welcome my lord said everard compelling himself to speak i can only trust it was no bad news that made your excellency a late traveller and ask like my follower what refreshment i shall command for your accommodation  the state is sound and healthy colonel everard said the general and yet the less so that many of its members who have been hitherto workers together and propounders of good counsel and advancers of the public weal have now waxed cold in their love and in their affection for the good cause for which we should be ready in our various degrees to act and do so soon as we are called to act that whereunto we are appointed neither rashly nor overslothfully neither lukewarmly nor overviolently but with such a frame and disposition in which zeal and charity may as it were meet and kiss each other in our streets howbeit because we look back after we have put our hand to the plough therefore is our force waxed dim  pardon me sir said nehemiah holdenough who listening with some impatience began to guess in whose company he stoodpardon me for unto this i have a warrant to speak  ah ah said cromwell surely most worthy sir we grieve the spirit when we restrain those pourings forth which like water from a rock  nay therein i differ from you sir said holdenough for as there is the mouth to transmit the food and the profit to digest what heaven hath sent so is the preacher ordained to teach and the people to hear the shepherd to gather the flock into the sheepfold the sheep to profit by the care of the shepherd  ah my worthy sir said cromwell with much unction methinks you verge upon the great mistake which supposes that churches are tall large houses built by masons and hearers are menwealthy men who pay tithes the larger as well as the less and that the priests men in black gowns or grey cloaks who receive the same are in guerdon the only distributors of christian blessings whereas in my apprehension there is more of christian liberty in leaving it to the discretion of the hungry soul to seek his edification where it can be found whether from the mouth of a lay teacher who claimeth his warrant from heaven alone or at the dispensation of those who take ordinations and degrees from synods and universities at best but associations of poor sinful creatures like themselves  you speak you know not what sir replied holdenough impatiently can light come out of darkness sense out of ignorance or knowledge of the mysteries of religion from such ignorant mediciners as give poisons instead of wholesome medicaments and cram with filth the stomachs of such as seek to them for food this which the presbyterian divine uttered rather warmly the general answered with the utmost mildness  lackaday lackaday a learned man but intemperate overzeal hath eaten him upa welladay sir you may talk of your regular gospelmeals but a word spoken in season by one whose heart is with your heart just perhaps when you are riding on to encounter an enemy or are about to mount a breach is to the poor spirit like a rasher on the coals which the hungry shall find preferable to a great banquet at such times when the full soul loatheth the honeycomb nevertheless although i speak thus in my poor judgment i would not put force on the conscience of any man leaving to the learned to follow the learned and the wise to be instructed by the wise while poor simple wretched souls are not to be denied a drink from the stream which runneth by the wayay verily it will be a comely sight in england when men shall go on as in a better world bearing with each others infirmities joining in each others comfortsay truly the rich drink out of silver flagons and goblets of silver the poor out of paltry bowls of woodand even so let it be since they both drink the same element  here an officer opened the door and looked in to whom cromwell exchanging the canting drawl in which it seemed he might have gone on interminably for the short brief tone of action called out pearson is he come  no sir replied pearson we have enquired for him at the place you noted and also at other haunts of his about the town  the knave said cromwell with bitter emphasis can he have proved falseno no his interest is too deeply engaged we shall find him by and by hark thee hither  while this conversation was going forward the reader must imagine the alarm of everard he was certain that the personal attendance of cromwell must be on some most important account and he could not but strongly suspect that the general had some information respecting charless lurking place if taken a renewal of the tragedy of the 30th of january was instantly to be apprehended and the ruin of the whole family of lee with himself probably included must be the necessary consequence  he looked eagerly for consolation at wildrake whose countenance expressed much alarm which he endeavoured to bear out with his usual look of confidence but the weight within was too great he shuffled with his feet rolled his eyes and twisted his hands like an unassured witness before an acute and not to be deceived judge  oliver meanwhile left his company not a minutes leisure to take counsel together even while his perplexed eloquence flowed on in a stream so mazy that no one could discover which way its course was tending his sharp watchful eye rendered all attempts of everard to hold communication with wildrake even by signs altogether vain everard indeed looked for an instant at the window then glanced at wildrake as if to hint there might be a possibility to escape that way but the cavalier had replied with a disconsolate shake of the head so slight as to be almost imperceptible everard therefore lost all hope and the melancholy feeling of approaching and inevitable evil was only varied by anxiety concerning the shape and manner in which it was about to make its approach  but wildrake had a spark of hope left the very instant cromwell entered he had got out of the room and down to the door of the house back back repeated by two armed sentinels convinced him that as his fears had anticipated the general had come neither unattended nor unprepared he turned on his heel ran up stairs and meeting on the landingplace the boy whom he called spitfire hurried him into the small apartment which he occupied as his own wildrake had been shooting that morning and game lay on the table he pulled a feather from a woodcocks wing and saying hastily for thy life spitfire mind my ordersi will put thee safe out at the window into the courtthe yard wall is not highand there will be no sentry therefly to the lodge as thou wouldst win heaven and give this feather to mistress alice lee if possibleif not to joceline joliffesay i have won the wages of the young lady dost mark me boy  the sharpwitted youth clapped his hand in his masters and only replied done and done  wildrake opened the window and though the height was considerable he contrived to let the boy down safely by holding his cloak a heap of straw on which spitfire lighted rendered the descent perfectly safe and wildrake saw him scramble over the wall of the courtyard at the angle which bore on a back lane and so rapidly was this accomplished that the cavalier had just reentered the room when the bustle attending cromwells arrival subsiding his own absence began to be noticed  he remained during cromwells lecture on the vanity of creeds anxious in mind whether he might not have done better to send an explicit verbal message since there was no time to write but the chance of the boy being stopped or becoming confused with feeling himself the messenger of a hurried and important communication made him on the whole glad that he had preferred a more enigmatical way of conveying the intelligence he had therefore the advantage of his patron for he was conscious still of a spark of hope  pearson had scarce shut the door when holdenough as ready in arms against the future dictator as he had been prompt to encounter the supposed phantoms and fiends of woodstock resumed his attack upon the schismatics whom he undertook to prove to be at once soulslayers false brethren and false messengers and was proceeding to allege texts in behalf of his proposition when cromwell apparently tired of the discussion and desirous to introduce a discourse more accordant with his real feelings interrupted him though very civilly and took the discourse into his own hands  lackaday he said the good man speaks truth according to his knowledge and to his lightsay bitter truths and hard to be digested while we see as men see and not with the eyes of angels false messengers said the reverend manay truly the world is full of such you shall see them who will carry your secret message to the house of your mortal foe and will say to him lo my master is going forth with a small train by such and such desolate places be you speedy therefore that you may arise and slay him and another who knoweth where the foe of your house and enemy of your person lies hidden shall instead of telling his master thereof carry tidings to the enemy even where he lurketh saying lo my master knoweth of your secret abodeup now and fly lest he come on thee like a lion on his preybut shall this go without punishment looking at wildrake with a withering glance now as my soul liveth and as he liveth who hath made me a ruler in israel such false messengers shall be knitted to gibbets on the wayside and their right hands shall be nailed above their heads in an extended position as if pointing out to others the road from which they themselves have strayed  surely said master holdenough it is right to cut off such offenders  thank ye massjohn muttered wildrake when did the presbyterian fail to lend the devil a shove  but i say continued holdenough that the matter is estranged from our present purpose for the false brethren of whom i spoke are  right excellent sir they be those of our own house answered cromwell the good man is right once more ay of whom can we now say that he is a true brother although he has lain in the same womb with us although we have struggled in the same cause eat at the same table fought in the same battle worshipped at the same throne there shall be no truth in himah markham everard markham everard  he paused at this ejaculation and everard desirous at once of knowing how far he stood committed replied your excellency seems to have something in your mind in which i am concerned may i request you will speak it out that i may know what i am accused of  ah mark mark replied the general there needeth no accuser speak when the still small voice speaks within us is there not moisture on thy brow mark everard is there not trouble in thine eye is there not a failure in thy frame and who ever saw such things in noble and stout markham everard whose brow was only moist after having worn the helmet for a summers day whose hand only shook when it had wielded for hours the weighty falchionbut go to man thou doubtest over much hast thou not been to me as a brother and shall i not forgive thee even the seventyseventh time the knave hath tarried somewhere who should have done by this time an office of much import take advantage of his absence mark it is a grace that god gives thee beyond expectance i do not say fall at my feet but speak to me as a friend to his friend  i have never said any thing to your excellency that was in the least undeserving the title you have assigned to me said colonel everard proudly  nay nay markham answered cromwell i say not you have butbut you ought to have remembered the message i sent you by that person pointing to wildrake and you must reconcile it with your conscience how having such a message guarded with such reasons you could think yourself at liberty to expel my friends from woodstock being determined to disappoint my object whilst you availed yourself of the boon on condition of which my warrant was issued  everard was about to reply when to his astonishment wildrake stepped forward and with a voice and look very different from his ordinary manner and approaching a good deal to real dignity of mind said boldly and calmly you are mistaken master cromwell and address yourself to the wrong party here  the speech was so sudden and intrepid that cromwell stepped a pace back and motioned with his right hand towards his weapon as if he had expected that an address of a nature so unusually bold was to be followed by some act of violence he instantly resumed his indifferent posture and irritated at a smile which he observed on wildrakes countenance he said with the dignity of one long accustomed to see all tremble before him this to me fellow know you to whom you speak  fellow echoed wildrake whose reckless humour was now completely set afloatno fellow of yours master oliver i have known the day when roger wildrake of squattleseamere lincoln a handsome young gallant with a good estate would have been thought no fellow of the bankrupt brewer of huntingdon  be silent said everard be silent wildrake if you love your life  i care not a maravedi for my life said wildrake zounds if he dislikes what i say let him take to his tools i know after all he hath good blood in his veins and i will indulge him with a turn in the court yonder had he been ten times a brewer  such ribaldry friend said oliver i treat with the contempt it deserves but if thou hast any thing to say touching the matter in question speak out like a man though thou lookst more like a beast  all i have to say is replied wildrake that whereas you blame everard for acting on your warrant as you call it i can tell you he knew not a word of the rascally conditions you talk of i took care of that and you may take the vengeance on me if you list  slave dare you tell this to me said cromwell still heedfully restraining his passion which he felt was about to discharge itself upon an unworthy object  ay you will make every englishman a slave if you have your own way said wildrake not a whit abashedfor the awe which had formerly overcome him when alone with this remarkable man had vanished now that they were engaged in an altercation before witnessesbut do your worst master oliver i tell you beforehand the bird has escaped you  you dare not say soescapedso ho pearson tell the soldiers to mount instantlythou art a lying foolescapedwhere or from whence  ay that is the question said wildrake for look you sirthat men do go from hence is certainbut how they go or to what quarter  cromwell stood attentive expecting some useful hint from the careless impetuosity of the cavalier upon the route which the king might have taken  or to what quarter as i said before why your excellency master oliver may een find that out yourself  as he uttered the last words he unsheathed his rapier and made a full pass at the generals body had his sword met no other impediment than the buff jerkin cromwells course had ended on the spot but fearful of such attempts the general wore under his military dress a shirt of the finest mail made of rings of the best steel and so light and flexible that it was little or no encumbrance to the motions of the wearer it proved his safety on this occasion for the rapier sprung in shivers while the owner now held back by everard and holdenough flung the hilt with passion on the ground exclaiming be damned the hand that forged theeto serve me so long and fail me when thy true service would have honoured us both for ever but no good could come of thee since thou wert pointed even in jest at a learned divine of the church of england  in the first instant of alarmand perhaps suspecting wildrake might be supported by others cromwell half drew from his bosom a concealed pistol which he hastily returned observing that both everard and the clergyman were withholding the cavalier from another attempt  pearson and a soldier or two rushed insecure that fellow said the general in the indifferent tone of one to whom imminent danger was too familiar to cause irritationbind himbut not so hard pearsonfor the men to show their zeal were drawing their belts which they used for want of cords brutally tight round wildrakes limbs he would have assassinated me but i would reserve him for his fit doom  assassinatedi scorn your words master oliver said wildrake i proffered you a fair duello  shall we shoot him in the street for an example said pearson to cromwell while everard endeavoured to stop wildrake from giving further offence  on your life harm him not but let him be kept in safe ward and well looked after said cromwell while the prisoner exclaimed to everard i prithee let me alonei am now neither thy follower nor any mans and i am as willing to die as ever i was to take a cup of liquorand hark ye speaking of that master oliver you were once a jolly fellow prithee let one of thy lobsters here advance yonder tankard to my lips and your excellency shall hear a toast a song and asecret  unloose his head and hand the debauched beast the tankard said oliver while yet he exists it were shame to refuse him the element he lives in  blessings on your head for once said wildrake whose object in continuing this wild discourse was if possible to gain a little delay when every moment was precious thou hast brewed good ale and thats warrant for a blessing for my toast and my song here they go together    son of a witch   mayst thou die in a ditch     with the hutchers who back thy quarrels   and rot above ground   while the world shall resound     a welcome to royal king charles  and now for my secret that you may not say i had your liquor for nothingi fancy my song will scarce pass current for muchmy secret is master cromwellthat the bird is flownand your red nose will be as white as your windingsheet before you can smell out which way  pshaw rascal answered cromwell contemptuously keep your scurrile jests for the gibbet foot  i shall look on the gibbet more boldly replied wildrake than i have seen you look on the royal martyrs picture  this reproach touched cromwell to the very quickvillain he exclaimed drag him hence draw out a party andbut hold not nowto prison with himlet him be close watched and gagged if he attempts to speak to the sentinelsnay holdi mean put a bottle of brandy into his cell and he will gag himself in his own way i warrant youwhen day comes that men can see the example he shall be gagged after my fashion  during the various breaks in his orders the general was evidently getting command of his temper and though he began in fury he ended with the contemptuous sneer of one who overlooks the abusive language of an inferior something remained on his mind notwithstanding for he continued standing as if fixed to the same spot in the apartment his eyes bent on the ground and with closed hand pressed against his lips like a man who is musing deeply pearson who was about to speak to him drew back and made a sign to those in the room to be silent  master holdenough did not mark or at least did not obey it approaching the general he said in a respectful but firm tone did i understand it to be your excellencys purpose that this poor man shall die next morning  hah exclaimed cromwell starting from his reverie what sayst thou  i took leave to ask if it was your will that this unhappy man should die tomorrow  whom saidst thou demanded cromwell markham everardshall he die saidst thou  god forbid replied holdenough stepping backi asked whether this blinded creature wildrake was to be so suddenly cut off  ay marry is he said cromwell were the whole general assembly of divines at westminsterthe whole sanhedrim of presbyteryto offer bail for him  if you will not think better of it sir said holdenough at least give not the poor man the means of destroying his senseslet me go to him as a divine to watch with him in case he may yet be admitted into the vineyard at the latest houryet brought into the sheepfold though he has neglected the call of the pastor till time is wellnigh closed upon him  for gods sake said everard who had hitherto kept silence because he knew cromwells temper on such occasions think better of what you do  is it for thee to teach me replied cromwell think thou of thine own matters and believe me it will require all thy witand for you reverend sir i will have no fatherconfessors attend my prisonersno tales out of school if the fellow thirsts after ghostly comfort as he is much more like to thirst after a quartern of brandy there is corporal humgudgeon who commands the corps de garde will preach and pray as well as the best of yebut this delay is intolerablecomes not this fellow yet  no sir replied pearson had we not better go down to the lodge the news of our coming hither may else get there before us  true said cromwell speaking aside to his officer but you know tomkins warned us against doing so alleging there were so many posterndoors and sallyports and concealed entrances in the old house that it was like a rabbitwarren and that an escape might be easily made under our very noses unless he were with us to point out all the ports which should be guarded he hinted too that he might be delayed a few minutes after his time of appointmentbut we have now waited halfanhour  does your excellency think tomkins is certainly to be depended upon said pearson  as far as his interest goes unquestionably replied the general he has ever been the pump by which i have sucked the marrow out of many a plot in special those of the conceited fool rochecliffe who is goose enough to believe that such a fellow as tomkins would value any thing beyond the offer of the best bidder and yet it groweth latei fear we must to the lodge without himyet all things well considered i will tarry here till midnightah everard thou mightest put this gear to rights if thou wilt shall some foolish principle of fantastic punctilio have more weight with thee man than have the pacification and welfare of england the keeping of faith to thy friend and benefactor and who will be yet more so and the fortune and security of thy relations are these i say lighter in the balance than the cause of a worthless boy who with his father and his fathers house have troubled israel for fifty years  i do not understand your excellency nor at what service you point which i can honestly render replied everard that which is dishonest i should be loth that you proposed  then this at least might suit your honesty or scrupulous humour call it which thou wilt said cromwell thou knowest surely all the passages about jezebels palace down yonderlet me know how they may be guarded against the escape of any from within  i cannot pretend to aid you in this matter said everard i know not all the entrances and posterns about woodstock and if i did i am not free in conscience to communicate with you on this occasion  we shall do without you sir replied cromwell haughtily and if aught is found which may criminate you remember you have lost right to my protection  i shall be sorry said everard to have lost your friendship general but i trust my quality as an englishman may dispense with the necessity of protection from any man i know no law which obliges me to be spy or informer even if i were in the way of having opportunity to do service in either honourable capacity  well sir said cromwell for all your privileges and qualities i will make bold to take you down to the lodge at woodstock tonight to enquire into affairs in which the state is concernedcome hither pearson he took a paper from his pocket containing a rough sketch or groundplan of woodstock lodge with the avenues leading to itlook here he said we must move in two bodies on foot and with all possible silencethou must march to the rear of the old house of iniquity with twenty file of men and dispose them around it the wisest thou canst take the reverend man there along with you he must be secured at any rate and may serve as a guide i myself will occupy the front of the lodge and thus having stopt all the earths thou wilt come to me for farther orderssilence and dispatch is allbut for the dog tomkins who broke appointment with me he had need render a good excuse or woe to his fathers sonreverend sir be pleased to accompany that officercolonel everard you are to follow me but first give your sword to captain pearson and consider yourself as under arrest  everard gave his sword to pearson without any comment and with the most anxious presage of evil followed the republican general in obedience to commands which it would have been useless to dispute                                       chapter the thirtyfirst     were my son william here but now     he wadna fail the pledge   wi that in at the door there ran     a ghastlylooking page   i saw them master o i saw     beneath the thornie brae   of blackmaild warriors many a rank     revenge he cried and gae    henry mackenzie  the little party at the lodge were assembled at supper at the early hour of eight oclock sir henry lee neglecting the food that was placed on the table stood by a lamp on the chimneypiece and read a letter with mournful attention  does my son write to you more particularly than to me doctor rochecliffe said the knight he only says here that he will return probably this night and that master kerneguy must be ready to set off with him instantly what can this haste mean have you heard of any new search after our suffering party i wish they would permit me to enjoy my sons company in quiet but for a day  the quiet which depends on the wicked ceasing from troubling said dr rochecliffe is connected not by days and hours but by minutes their glut of blood at worcester had satiated them for a moment but their appetite i fancy has revived  you have news then to that purpose said sir henry  your son replied the doctor wrote to me by the same messenger he seldom fails to do so being aware of what importance it is that i should know every thing that passes means of escape are provided on the coast and master kerneguy must be ready to start with your son the instant he appears  it is strange said the knight for forty years i have dwelt in this house man and boy and the point only was how to make the day pass over our heads for if i did not scheme out some hunting match or hawking or the like i might have sat here on my armchair as undisturbed as a sleeping dormouse from one end of the year to the other and now i am more like a hare on her form that dare not sleep unless with her eyes open and scuds off when the wind rustles among the fern  it is strange said alice looking at dr rochecliffe that the roundhead steward has told you nothing of this he is usually communicative enough of the motions of his party and i saw you close together this morning  i must be closer with him this evening said the doctor gloomily but he will not blab  i wish you may not trust him too much said alice in replyto me that mans face with all its shrewdness evinces such a dark expression that methinks i read treason in his very eye  be assured that matter is looked to answered the doctor in the same ominous tone as before no one replied and there was a chilling and anxious feeling of apprehension which seemed to sink down on the company at once like those sensations which make such constitutions as are particularly subject to the electrical influence conscious of an approaching thunderstorm  the disguised monarch apprised that day to be prepared on short notice to quit his temporary asylum felt his own share of the gloom which involved the little society but he was the first also to shake it off as what neither suited his character nor his situation gaiety was the leading distinction of the former and presence of mind not depression of spirits was required by the latter  we make the hour heavier he said by being melancholy about it had you not better join me mistress alice in patrick careys jovial farewellah you do not know pat careya younger brother of lord falklands  a brother of the immortal lord falklands and write songs said the doctor  oh doctor the muses take tithe as well as the church said charles and have their share in every family of distinction you do not know the words mistress alice but you can aid me notwithstanding in the burden at least    come now that were parting and tis one to ten   if the towers of sweet woodstock i eer see agen   let us een have a frolic and drink like tall men     while the goblet goes merrily round  the song arose but not with spirit it was one of those efforts at forced mirth by which above all other modes of expressing it the absence of real cheerfulness is most distinctly animated charles stopt the song and upbraided the choristers  you sing my dear mistress alice as if you were chanting one of the seven penitential psalms and you good doctor as if you recited the funeral service  the doctor rose hastily from the table and turned to the window for the expression connected singularly with the task which he was that evening to discharge charles looked at him with some surprise for the peril in which he lived made him watchful of the slightest motions of those around himthen turned to sir henry and said my honoured host can you tell any reason for this moody fit which has so strangely crept upon us all  not i my dear louis replied the knight i have no skill in these nice quillets of philosophy i could as soon undertake to tell you the reason why bevis turns round three times before he lies down i can only say for myself that if age and sorrow and uncertainty be enough to break a jovial spirit or at least to bend it now and then i have my share of them all so that i for one cannot say that i am sad merely because i am not merry i have but too good cause for sadness i would i saw my son were it but for a minute  fortune seemed for once disposed to gratify the old man for albert lee entered at that moment he was dressed in a riding suit and appeared to have travelled hard he cast his eye hastily around as he entered it rested for a second on that of the disguised prince and satisfied with the glance which he received in lieu he hastened after the fashion of the olden day to kneel down to his father and request his blessing  it is thine my boy said the old man a tear springing to his eyes as he laid his hand on the long locks which distinguished the young cavaliers rank and principles and which usually combed and curled with some care now hung wild and dishevelled about his shoulders they remained an instant in this posture when the old man suddenly started from it as if ashamed of the emotion which he had expressed before so many witnesses and passing the back of his hand hastily across his eyes bid albert get up and mind his supper since i dare say you have ridden fast and far since you last baitedand well send round a cup to his health if doctor rochecliffe and the company pleasesjoceline thou knave skink aboutthou lookst as if thou hadst seen a ghost  joceline said alice is sick for sympathyone of the stags ran at phoebe mayflower today and she was fain to have jocelines assistance to drive the creature offthe girl has been in fits since she came home  silly slut said the old knightshe a woodmans daughterbut joceline if the deer gets dangerous you must send a broad arrow through him  it will not need sir henry said joceline speaking with great difficulty of utterancehe is quiet enough nowhe will not offend in that sort again  see it be so replied the knight remember mistress alice often walks in the chase and now fill round and fill too a cup to thyself to overred thy fear as mad will has it tush man phoebe will do well enoughshe only screamed and ran that thou mightst have the pleasure to help her mind what thou dost and do not go spilling the wine after that fashioncome here is a health to our wanderer who has come to us again  none will pledge it more willingly than i said the disguised prince unconsciously assuming an importance which the character he personated scarce warranted but sir henry who had become fond of the supposed page with all his peculiarities imposed only a moderate rebuke upon his petulance thou art a merry goodhumoured youth louis he said but it is a world to see how the forwardness of the present generation hath gone beyond the gravity and reverence which in my youth was so regularly observed towards those of higher rank and stationi dared no more have given my own tongue the rein when there was a doctor of divinity in company than i would have dared to have spoken in church in service time  true sir said albert hastily interfering but master kerneguy had the better right to speak at present that i have been absent on his business as well as my own have seen several of his friends and bring him important intelligence  charles was about to rise and beckon albert aside naturally impatient to know what news he had procured or what scheme of safe escape was now decreed for him but dr rochecliffe twitched his cloak as a hint to him to sit still and not show any extraordinary motive for anxiety since in case of a sudden discovery of his real quality the violence of sir henry lees feelings might have been likely to attract too much attention  charles therefore only replied as to the knights stricture that he had a particular title to be sudden and unceremonious in expressing his thanks to colonel leethat gratitude was apt to be unmannerlyfinally that he was much obliged to sir henry for his admonition and that quit woodstock when he would he was sure to leave it a better man than he came there  his speech was of course ostensibly directed towards the father but a glance at alice assured her that she had her full share in the compliment  i fear he concluded addressing albert that you come to tell us our stay here must be very short  a few hours only said albertjust enough for needful rest for ourselves and our horses i have procured two which are good and tried but doctor rochecliffe broke faith with me i expected to have met some one down at jocelines hut where i left the horses and finding no person i was delayed an hour in littering them down myself that they might be ready for tomorrows workfor we must be off before day  iiintended to have sent tomkinsbutbuthesitated the doctor i  the roundheaded rascal was drunk or out of the way i presume said albert i am glad of ityou may easily trust him too far  hitherto he has been faithful said the doctor and i scarce think he will fail me now but joceline will go down and have the horses in readiness in the morning  jocelines countenance was usually that of alacrity itself on a case extraordinary now however he seemed to hesitate  you will go with me a little way doctor he said as he edged himself closely to rochecliffe  how puppy fool and blockhead said the knight wouldst thou ask doctor rochecliffe to bear thee company at this hourout houndget down to the kennel yonder instantly or i will break the knaves pate of thee  joceline looked with an eye of agony at the divine as if entreating him to interfere in his behalf but just as he was about to speak a most melancholy howling arose at the halldoor and a dog was heard scratching for admittance  what ails bevis next said the old knight i think this must be allfoolsday and that every thing around me is going mad  the same sound startled albert and charles from a private conference in which they had engaged and albert ran to the halldoor to examine personally into the cause of the noise  it is no alarm said the old knight to kerneguy for in such cases the dogs bark is short sharp and furious these long howls are said to be ominous it was even so that beviss grandsire bayed the whole livelong night on which my poor father died if it comes now as a presage god send it regard the old and useless not the young and those who may yet serve king and country  the dog had pushed past colonel lee who stood a little while at the halldoor to listen if there were any thing stirring without while bevis advanced into the room where the company were assembled bearing something in his mouth and exhibiting in an unusual degree that sense of duty and interest which a dog seems to show when he thinks he has the charge of something important he entered therefore drooping his long tail slouching his head and ears and walking with the stately yet melancholy dignity of a warhorse at his masters funeral in this manner he paced through the room went straight up to joceline who had been regarding him with astonishment and uttering a short and melancholy howl laid at his feet the object which he bore in his mouth joceline stooped and took from the floor a mans glove of the fashion worn by the troopers having something like the oldfashioned gauntleted projections of thick leather arising from the wrist which go half way up to the elbow and secure the arm against a cut with a sword but joceline had no sooner looked at what in itself was so common an object than he dropped it from his hand staggered backward uttered a groan and nearly fell to the ground  now the cowards curse be upon thee for an idiot said the knight who had picked up the glove and was looking at itthou shouldst be sent back to school and flogged till the cravens blood was switched out of theewhat dost thou look at but a glove thou base poltroon and a very dirty glove too stay here is writingjoseph tomkins why that is the roundheaded fellowi wish he hath not come to some mischief for this is not dirt on the cheveron but blood bevis may have bit the fellow and yet the dog seemed to love him well too or the stag may have hurt him out joceline instantly and see where he iswind your bugle  i cannot go said joliffe unlessand again he looked piteously at dr rochecliffe who saw no time was to be lost in appeasing the rangers terrors as his ministry was most needful in the present circumstancesget spade and mattock he whispered to him and a dark lantern and meet me in the wilderness  joceline left the room and the doctor before following him had a few words of explanation with colonel lee his own spirit far from being dismayed on the occasion rather rose higher like one whose natural element was intrigue and danger here hath been wild work he said since you parted tomkins was rude to the wench phoebejoceline and he had a brawl together and tomkins is lying dead in the thicket not far from rosamonds well it will be necessary that joceline and i go directly to bury the body for besides that some one might stumble upon it and raise an alarm this fellow joceline will never be fit for any active purpose till it is under ground though as stout as a lion the underkeeper has his own weak side and is more afraid of a dead body than a living one when do you propose to start tomorrow  by daybreak or earlier said colonel lee but we will meet again a vessel is provided and i have relays in more places than onewe go off from the coast of sussex and i am to get a letter at  acquainting me precisely with the spot  wherefore not go off instantly said the doctor  the horses would fail us replied albert they have been hard ridden today  adieu said rochecliffe i must to my taskdo you take rest and repose for yours to conceal a slaughtered body and convey on the same night a king from danger and captivity are two feats which have fallen to few folks save myself but let me not while putting on my harness boast myself as if i were taking it off after a victory so saying he left the apartment and muffling himself in his cloak went out into what was called the wilderness  the weather was a raw frost the mists lay in partial wreaths upon the lower grounds but the night considering that the heavenly bodies were in a great measure hidden by the haze was not extremely dark dr rochecliffe could not however distinguish the underkeeper until he had hemmed once or twice when joceline answered the signal by showing a glimpse of light from the dark lantern which he carried guided by this intimation of his presence the divine found him leaning against a buttress which had once supported a terrace now ruinous he had a pickaxe and shovel together with a deers hide hanging over his shoulder  what do you want with the hide joceline said dr rochecliffe that you lumber it about with you on such an errand  why look you doctor he answered it is as well to tell you all about it the man and ihe thereyou know whom i meanhad many years since a quarrel about this deer for though we were great friends and philip was sometimes allowed by my masters permission to help me in mine office yet i knew for all that philip hazeldine was sometimes a trespasser the deerstealers were very bold at that time it being just before the breaking out of the war when men were becoming unsettled and so it chanced that one day in the chase i found two fellows with their faces blacked and shirts over their clothes carrying as prime a buck between them as any was in the park i was upon them in the instantone escaped but i got hold of the other fellow and who should it prove to be but trusty phil hazeldine well i dont know whether it was right or wrong but he was my old friend and potcompanion and i took his word for amendment in future and he helped me to hang up the deer on a tree and i came back with a horse to carry him to the lodge and tell the knight the story all but phils name but the rogues had been too clever for me for they had flayed and dressed the deer and quartered him and carried him off and left the hide and horns with a chime saying    the haunch to thee   the breast to me   the hide and the horns for the keepers fee  and this i knew for one of phils mad pranks that he would play in those days with any lad in the country but i was so nettled that i made the deers hide be curried and dressed by a tanner and swore that it should be his windingsheet or mine and though i had long repented my rash oath yet now doctor you see what it is come tothough i forgot it the devil did not  it was a very wrong thing to make a vow so sinful said rochecliffe but it would have been greatly worse had you endeavoured to keep it therefore i bid you cheer up said the good divine for in this unhappy case i could not have wished after what i have heard from phoebe and yourself that you should have kept your hand still though i may regret that the blow has proved fatal nevertheless thou hast done even that which was done by the great and inspired legislator when he beheld an egyptian tyrannizing over a hebrew saving that in the case present it was a female when says the septuagint percussum egyptium abscondit sabulo the meaning whereof i will explain to you another time wherefore i exhort you not to grieve beyond measure for although this circumstance is unhappy in time and place yet from what phoebe hath informed me of yonder wretchs opinions it is much to be regretted that his brains had not been beaten out in his cradle rather than that he had grown up to be one of those grindlestonians or muggletonians in whom is the perfection of every foul and blasphemous heresy united with such an universal practice of hypocritical assentation as would deceive their master even satan himself  nevertheless sir said the forester i hope you will bestow some of the service of the church on this poor man as it was his last wish naming you sir at the same time and unless this were done i should scarce dare to walk out in the dark again for my whole life  thou art a silly fellow but if continued the doctor he named me as he departed and desired the last rites of the church there was it may be a turning from evil and a seeking to good even in his last moments and if heaven granted him grace to form a prayer so fitting wherefore should man refuse it all i fear is the briefness of time  nay your reverence may cut the service somewhat short said joceline assuredly he does not deserve the whole of it only if something were not to be done i believe i should flee the country they were his last words and methinks he sent bevis with his glove to put me in mind of them  out fool do you think said the doctor dead men send gauntlets to the living like knights in a romance or if so would they choose dogs to carry their challenges i tell thee fool the cause was natural enough bevis questing about found the body and brought the glove to you to intimate where it was lying and to require assistance for such is the high instinct of these animals towards one in peril  nay if you think so doctor said jocelineand doubtless i must say bevis took an interest in the manif indeed it was not something worse in the shape of bevis for methought his eyes looked wild and fiery as if he would have spoken  as he talked thus joceline rather hung back and in doing so displeased the doctor who exclaimed come along thou lazy laggard art thou a soldier and a brave one and so much afraid of a dead man thou hast killed men in battle and in chase i warrant thee  ay but their backs were to me said joceline i never saw one of them cast back his head and glare at me as yonder fellow did his eye retaining a glance of hatred mixed with terror and reproach till it became fixed like a jelly and were you not with me and my masters concerns and something else very deeply at stake i promise you i would not again look at him for all woodstock  you must though said the doctor suddenly pausing for here is the place where he lies come hither deep into the copse take care of stumblinghere is a place just fitting and we will draw the briars over the grave afterwards  as the doctor thus issued his directions he assisted also in the execution of them and while his attendant laboured to dig a shallow and mishapen grave a task which the state of the soil perplexed with roots and hardened by the influence of the frost rendered very difficult the divine read a few passages out of the funeral service partly in order to appease the superstitious terrors of joceline and partly because he held it matter of conscience not to deny the churchs rites to one who had requested their aid in extremity                                       chapter the thirty second     case ye case yeon with your vizards              henry iv  the company whom we had left in victor lees parlour were about to separate for the night and had risen to take a formal leave of each other when a tap was heard at the halldoor albert the vidette of the party hastened to open it enjoining as he left the room the rest to remain quiet until he had ascertained the cause of the knocking when he gained the portal he called to know who was there and what they wanted at so late an hour  it is only me answered a treble voice  and what is your name my little fellow said albert  spitfire sir replied the voice without  spitfire said albert  yes sir replied the voice all the world calls me so and colonel everard himself but my name is spittal for all that  colonel everard arrive you from him demanded young lee  no sir i come sir from roger wildrake esquire of squattleseamere if it like you said the boy and i have brought a token to mistress lee which i am to give into her own hands if you would but open the door sir and let me inbut i can do nothing with a threeinch board between us  it is some freak of that drunken rakehell said albert in a low voice to his sister who had crept out after him on tiptoe  yet let us not be hasty in concluding so said the young lady at this moment the least trifle may be of consequencewhat tokens has master wildrake sent me my little boy  nay nothing very valuable neither replied the boy but he was so anxious you should get it that he put me out of window as one would chuck out a kitten that i might not be stopped by the soldiers  hear you said alice to her brother undo the gate for gods sake her brother to whom her feelings of suspicion were now sufficiently communicated opened the gate in haste and admitted the boy whose appearance not much dissimilar to that of a skinned rabbit in a livery or a monkey at a fair would at another time have furnished them with amusement the urchin messenger entered the hall making several odd bows and delivered the woodcocks feather with much ceremony to the young lady assuring her it was the prize she had won upon a wager about hawking  i prithee my little man said albert was your master drunk or sober when he sent thee all this way with a feather at this time of night  with reverence sir said the boy he was what he calls sober and what i would call concerned in liquor for any other person  curse on the drunken coxcomb said albertthere is a tester for thee boy and tell thy master to break his jests on suitable persons and at fitting times  stay yet a minute exclaimed alice we must not go too fastthis craves wary walking  a feather said albert all this work about a feather why doctor rochecliffe who can suck intelligence out of every trifle as a magpie would suck an egg could make nothing of this  let us try what we can do without him then said alice then addressing herself to the boyso there are strangers at your masters  at colonel everards madam which is the same thing said spitfire  and what manner of strangers said alice guests i suppose  ay mistress said the boy a sort of guests that make themselves welcome wherever they come if they meet not a welcome from their landlordsoldiers madam  the men that have long been lying at woodstock said albert  no sir said spitfire new comers with gallant buffcoats and steel breastplates and their commanderyour honour and your ladyship never saw such a manat least i am sure bill spitfire never did  was he tall or short said albert now much alarmed  neither one nor other said the boy stout made with slouching shoulders a nose large and a face one would not like to say no to he had several officers with him i saw him but for a moment but i shall never forget him while i live  you are right said albert lee to his sister pulling her to one side quite rightthe archfiend himself is upon us  and the feather said alice whom fear had rendered apprehensive of slight tokens means flightand a woodcock is a bird of passage  you have hit it said her brother but the time has taken us cruelly short give the boy a trifle morenothing that can excite suspicion and dismiss him i must summon rochecliffe and joceline  he went accordingly but unable to find those he sought he returned with hasty steps to the parlour where in his character of louis the page was exerting himself to detain the old knight who while laughing at the tales he told him was anxious to go to see what was passing in the hall  what is the matter albert said the old man who calls at the lodge at so undue an hour and wherefore is the halldoor opened to them i will not have my rules and the regulations laid down for keeping this house broken through because i am old and poor why answer you not why keep a chattering with louis kerneguy and neither of you all the while minding what i saydaughter alice have you sense and civility enough to tell me what or who it is that is admitted here contrary to my general orders  no one sir replied alice a boy brought a message which i fear is an alarming one  there is only fear sir said albert stepping forward that whereas we thought to have stayed with you till tomorrow we must now take farewell of you tonight  not so brother said alice you must stay and aid the defence hereif you and master kerneguy are both missed the pursuit will be instant and probably successful but if you stay the hidingplaces about this house will take some time to search you can change coats with kerneguy too  right noble wench said albert most excellentyeslouis i remain as kerneguy you fly as young master lee  i cannot see the justice of that said charles  nor i neither said the knight interfering men come and go lay schemes and alter them in my house without deigning to consult me and who is master kerneguy or what is he to me that my son must stay and take the chance of mischief and this your scotch page is to escape in his dress i will have no such contrivance carried into effect though it were the finest cobweb that was ever woven in doctor rochecliffes brainsi wish you no ill louis thou art a lively boy but i have been somewhat too lightly treated in this man  i am fully of your opinion sir henry replied the person whom he addressed you have been indeed repaid for your hospitality by want of that confidence which could never have been so justly reposed but the moment is come when i must say in a word i am that unfortunate charles stewart whose lot it has been to become the cause of ruin to his best friends and whose present residence in your family threatens to bring destruction to you and all around you  master louis kerneguy said the knight very angrily i will teach you to choose the subjects of your mirth better when you address them to me and moreover very little provocation would make me desire to have an ounce or two of that malapert blood from you  be still sir for gods sake said albert to his father this is indeed the king and such is the danger of his person that every moment we waste may bring round a fatal catastrophe  good god said the father clasping his hands together and about to drop on his knees has my earnest wish been accomplished and is it in such a manner as to make me pray it had never taken place  he then attempted to bend his knee to the kingkissed his hand while large tears trickled from his eyesthen said pardon my lordyour majesty i meanpermit me to sit in your presence but one instant till my blood beats more freely and then  charles raised his ancient and faithful subject from the ground and even in that moment of fear and anxiety and danger insisted on leading him to his seat upon which he sunk in apparent exhaustion his head drooping upon his long white beard and big unconscious tears mingling with its silver hairs alice and albert remained with the king arguing and urging his instant departure  the horses are at the underkeepers hut said albert and the relays only eighteen or twenty miles off if the horses can but carry you so far  will you not rather interrupted alice trust to the concealments of this place so numerous and so well triedrochecliffes apartments and the yet farther places of secrecy  alas said albert i know them only by name my father was sworn to confide them to but one man and he had chosen rochecliffe  i prefer taking the field to any hidinghole in england said the king could i but find my way to this hut where the horses are i would try what arguments whip and spur could use to get them to the rendezvous where i am to meet sir thomas acland and fresh cattle come with me colonel lee and let us run for it the roundheads have beat us in battle but if it come to a walk or a race i think i can show which has the best mettle  but then said albert we lose all the time which may otherwise be gained by the defence of this houseleaving none here but my poor father incapable from his state of doing any thing and you will be instantly pursued by fresh horses while ours are unfit for the road oh where is the villain joceline  what can have become of doctor rochecliffe said alice he that is so ready with advicewhere can they be gone oh if my father could but rouse himself  your father is roused said sir henry rising and stepping up to them with all the energy of full manhood in his countenance and motionsi did but gather my thoughtsfor when did they fail a lee when his king needed counsel or aid he then began to speak with the ready and distinct utterance of a general at the head of an army ordering every motion for attack and defenceunmoved himself and his own energy compelling obedience and that cheerful obedience from all who heard him daughter he said beat up dame jellicotlet phoebe rise if she were dying and secure doors and windows  that hath been done regularly sincewe have been thus far honoured said his daughter looking at the kingyet let them go through the chambers once more and alice retired to give the orders and presently returned  the old knight proceeded in the same decided tone of promptitude and dispatchwhich is your first stage  graysrothebury by henley where sir thomas acland and young knolles are to have horses in readiness said albert but how to get there with our weary cattle  trust me for that said the knight and proceeding with the same tone of authorityyour majesty must instantly to jocelines lodge he said there are your horses and your means of flight the secret places of this house well managed will keep the rebel dogs in play two or three hours goodrochecliffe is i fear kidnapped and his independent hath betrayed himwould i had judged the villain better i would have struck him through at one of our trials of fence with an unbated weapon as will saysbut for your guide when on horseback half a bowshot from jocelines hut is that of old martin the verdurer he is a score of years older than i but as fresh as an old oakbeat up his quarters and let him ride with you for death and life he will guide you to your relay for no fox that ever earthed in the chase knows the country so well for seven leagues around  excellent my dearest father excellent said albert i had forgot martin the verdurer  young men forget all answered the knightalas that the limbs should fail when the head which can best direct themis come perhaps to its wisest  but the tired horses said the kingcould we not get fresh cattle  impossible at this time of night answered sir henry but tired horses may do much with care and looking to he went hastily to the cabinet which stood in one of the oriel windows and searched for something in the drawers pulling out one after another  we lose time father said albert afraid that the intelligence and energy which the old man displayed had been but a temporary flash of the lamp which was about to relapse into evening twilight  go to sir boy said his father sharply is it for thee to tax me in this presenceknow that were the whole roundheads that are out of hell in present assemblage round woodstock i could send away the royal hope of england by a way that the wisest of them could never guess alice my love ask no questions but speed to the kitchen and fetch a slice or two of beef or better of venison cut them long and thin dye mark me  this is wandering of the mind said albert apart to the king we do him wrong and your majesty harm to listen to him  i think otherwise said alice and i know my father better than you so saying she left the room to fulfil her fathers orders  i think so too said charlesin scotland the presbyterian ministers when thundering in their pulpits on my own sins and those of my house took the freedom to call me to my face jeroboam or rehoboam or some such name for following the advice of young counsellors oddsfish i will take that of the grey beard for once for never saw i more sharpness and decision than in the countenance of that noble old man  by this time sir henry had found what he was seeking in this tin box he said are six balls prepared of the most cordial spices mixed with medicaments of the choicest and most invigorating quality given from hour to hour wrapt in a covering of good beef or venison a horse of spirit will not flag for five hours at the speed of fifteen miles an hour and please god the fourth of the time places your majesty in safetywhat remains may be useful on some future occasion martin knows how to administer them and alberts weary cattle shall be ready if walked gently for ten minutes in running to devour the way as old will saysnay waste not time in speech your majesty does me but too much honour in using what is your ownnow see if the coast is clear albert and let his majesty set off instantlywe will play our parts but ill if any take the chase after him for these two hours that are between night and daychange dresses as you proposed in yonder sleeping apartmentsomething may be made of that too  but good sir henry said the king your zeal overlooks a principal point i have indeed come from the underkeepers hut you mention to this place but it was by daylight and under guidancei shall never find my way thither in utter darkness and without a guidei fear you must let the colonel go with me and i entreat and command you will put yourself to no trouble or risk to defend the houseonly make what delay you can in showing its secret recesses  rely on me my royal and liege sovereign said sir henry but albert must remain here and alice shall guide your majesty to jocelines hut in his stead  alice said charles stepping back in surprisewhy it is dark nightandandand he glanced his eye towards alice who had by this time returned to the apartment and saw doubt and apprehension in her look an intimation that the reserve under which he had placed his disposition for gallantry since the morning of the proposed duel had not altogether effaced the recollection of his previous conduct he hastened to put a strong negative upon a proposal which appeared so much to embarrass her it is impossible for me indeed sir henry to use alices servicesi must walk as if bloodhounds were at my heels  alice shall trip it said the knight with any wench in oxfordshire and what would your majestys best speed avail if you know not the way to go  nay nay sir henry continued the king the night is too darkwe stay too longi will find it myself  lose no time in exchanging your dress with albert said sir henryleave me to take care of the rest  charles still inclined to expostulate withdrew however into the apartment where young lee and he were to exchange clothes while sir henry said to his daughter get thee a cloak wench and put on thy thickest shoes thou mightst have ridden pixie but he is something spirited and them art a timid horsewoman and ever wert sothe only weakness i have known of thee  but my father said alice fixing her eyes earnestly on sir henrys face must i really go along with the king might not phoebe or dame jellicot go with us  nonono answered sir henry phoebe the silly slut has as you well know been in fits tonight and i take it such a walk as you must take is no charm for hystericsdame jellicot hobbles as slow as a brokenwinded marebesides her deafness were there occasion to speak to hernonoyou shall go alone and entitle yourself to have it written on your tomb here lies she who saved the kingand hark you do not think of returning tonight but stay at the verdurers with his niecethe park and chase will shortly be filled with our enemies and whatever chances here you will learn early enough in the morning  and what is it i may then learn said alicealas who can tello dearest father let me stay and share your fate i will pull off the timorous woman and fight for the king if it be necessarybuti cannot think of becoming his only attendant in the dark night and through a road so lonely  how said the knight raising his voice do you bring ceremonious and silly scruples forward when the kings safety nay his life is at stake by this mark of loyalty stroking his grey beard as he spoke could i think thou wert other than becomes a daughter of the house of lee i would  at this moment the king and albert interrupted him by entering the apartment having exchanged dresses and from their stature bearing some resemblance to each other though charles was evidently a plain and lee a handsome young man their complexions were different but the difference could not be immediately noticed albert having adopted a black peruque and darkened his eyebrows  albert lee walked out to the front of the mansion to give one turn around the lodge in order to discover in what direction any enemies might be approaching that they might judge of the road which it was safest for the royal fugitive to adopt meanwhile the king who was first in entering the apartment had heard a part of the angry answer which the old knight made to his daughter and was at no loss to guess the subject of his resentment he walked up to him with the dignity which he perfectly knew how to assume when he chose it  sir henry he said it is our pleasure nay our command that you forbear all exertion of paternal authority in this matter mistress alice i am sure must have good and strong reasons for what she wishes and i should never pardon myself were she placed in an unpleasant situation on my account i am too well acquainted with woods and wildernesses to fear losing my way among my native oaks of woodstock  your majesty shall not incur the danger said alice her temporary hesitation entirely removed by the calm clear and candid manner in which charles uttered these last words you shall run no risk that i can prevent and the unhappy chances of the times in which i have lived have from experience made the forest as well known to me by night as by day so if you scorn not my company let us away instantly  if your company is given with goodwill i accept it with gratitude replied the monarch  willingly she said most willingly let me be one of the first to show that zeal and that confidence which i trust all england will one day emulously display in behalf of your majesty  she uttered these words with an alacrity of spirit and made the trifling change of habit with a speed and dexterity which showed that all her fears were gone and that her heart was entirely in the mission on which her father had dispatched her  all is safe around said albert lee showing himself you may take which passage you willthe most private is the best  charles went gracefully up to sir henry lee ere his departure and took him by the handi am too proud to make professions he said which i may be too poor ever to realize but while charles stewart lives he lives the obliged and indebted debtor of sir henry lee  say not so please your majesty say not so exclaimed the old man struggling with the hysterical sobs which rose to his throat he who might claim all cannot become indebted by accepting some small part  farewell good friend farewell said the king think of me as a son a brother to albert and to alice who are i see already impatient give me a fathers blessing and let me be gone  the god through whom kings reign bless your majesty said sir henry kneeling and turning his reverend face and clasped hands up to heaventhe lord of hosts bless you and save your majesty from your present dangers and bring you in his own good time to the safe possession of the crown that is your due  charles received this blessing like that of a father and alice and he departed on their journey  as they left the apartment the old knight let his hands sink gently as he concluded this fervent ejaculation his head sinking at the same time his son dared not disturb his meditation yet feared the strength of his feelings might overcome that of his constitution and that he might fall into a swoon at length he ventured to approach and gradually touch him the old knight started to his feet and was at once the same alert activeminded forecasting director which he had shown himself a little before  you are right boy he said we must be up and doing they lie the roundheaded traitors that call him dissolute and worthless he hath feelings worthy the son of the blessed martyr you saw even in the extremity of danger he would have perilled his safety rather than take alices guidance when the silly wench seemed in doubt about going profligacy is intensely selfish and thinks not of the feelings of others but hast thou drawn bolt and bar after them i vow i scarce saw when they left the hall  i let them out at the little postern said the colonel and when i returned i was afraid i had found you ill  joyjoy only joy alberti cannot allow a thought of doubt to cross my breast god will not desert the descendant of an hundred kingsthe rightful heir will not be given up to the ruffians there was a tear in his eye as he took leave of mei am sure of it wouldst not die for him boy  if i lay my life down for him tonight said albert i would only regret it because i should not hear of his escape tomorrow  well let us to this gear said the knight thinkst thou knowst enough of his manner clad as thou art in his dress to induce the women to believe thee to be the page kerneguy  umph replied albert it is not easy to bear out a personification of the king when women are in the case but there is only a very little light below and i can try  do so instantly said his father the knaves will be here presently albert accordingly left the apartment while the knight continuedif the women be actually persuaded that kerneguy be still here it will add strength to my plotthe beagles will open on a false scent and the royal stag be safe in cover ere they regain the slot of him then to draw them on from hidingplace to hidingplace why the east will be grey before they have sought the half of themyes i will play at bobcherry with them hold the bait to their nose which they are never to gorge upon i will drag a trail for them which will take them some time to puzzle outbut at what cost do i do this continued the old knight interrupting his own joyous soliloquyoh absalom absalom my son my sonbut let him go he can but die as his fathers have died and in the cause for which they lived but he comeshushalbert hast thou succeeded hast thou taken royalty upon thee so as to pass current  i have sir replied albert the women will swear that louis kerneguy was in the house this very last minute  right for they are good and faithful creatures said the knight and would swear what was for his majestys safety at any rate yet they will do it with more nature and effect if they believe they are swearing truthhow didst thou impress the deceit upon them  by a trifling adoption of the royal manner sir not worth mentioning  out rogue replied the knight i fear the kings character will suffer under your mummery  umph said albert muttering what he dared not utter aloudwere i to follow the example close up i know whose character would be in the greatest danger  well now we must adjust the defence of the outworks the signals c betwixt us both and the best way to baffle the enemy for the longest time possible he then again had recourse to the secret drawers of his cabinet and pulled out a piece of parchment on which was a plan this said he is a scheme of the citadel as i call it which may hold out long enough after you have been forced to evacuate the places of retreat you are already acquainted with the ranger was always sworn to keep this plan secret save from one person only in case of sudden deathlet us sit down and study it together  they accordingly adjusted their measures in a manner which will better show itself from what afterwards took place than were we to state the various schemes which they proposed and provisions made against events that did not arrive  at length young lee armed and provided with some food and liquor took leave of his father and went and shut himself up in victor lees apartment from which was an opening to the labyrinth of private apartments or hidingplaces that had served the associates so well in the fantastic tricks which they had played off at the expense of the commissioners of the commonwealth  i trust said sir henry sitting down by his desk after having taken a tender farewell of his son that rochecliffe has not blabbed out the secret of the plot to yonder fellow tomkins who was not unlikely to prate of it out of schoolbut here am i seatedperhaps for the last time with my bible on the one hand and old will on the other prepared thank god to die as i have livedi marvel they come not yet he said after waiting for some timei always thought the devil had a smarter spur to give his agents when they were upon his own special service                                       chapter the thirtythird     but see his face is black and full of blood   his eyeballs farther out than when he lived   staring full ghastly like a strangled man   his hair upreardhis nostrils stretchd with struggling   his hands abroad displayd as one who graspd   and tuggd for life and was by strength subdued     henry vi part i  had those whose unpleasant visit sir henry expected come straight to the lodge instead of staying for three hours at woodstock they would have secured their prey but the familist partly to prevent the kings escape partly to render himself of more importance in the affair had represented the party at the lodge as being constantly on the alert and had therefore inculcated upon cromwell the necessity of his remaining quiet until he tomkins should appear to give him notice that the household were retired to rest on this condition he undertook not only to discover the apartment in which the unfortunate charles slept but if possible to find some mode of fastening the door on the outside so as to render flight impossible he had also promised to secure the key of a postern by which the soldiers might be admitted into the house without exciting alarm nay the matter might by means of his local knowledge be managed as he represented it with such security that he would undertake to place his excellency or whomsoever he might appoint for the service by the side of charles stewarts bed ere he had slept off the last nights claret above all he had stated that from the style of the old house there were many passages and posterns which must be carefully guarded before the least alarm was caught by those within otherwise the success of the whole enterprise might be endangered he had therefore besought cromwell to wait for him at the village if he found him not there on his arrival and assured him that the marching and countermarching of soldiers was at present so common that even if any news were carried to the lodge that fresh troops had arrived in the borough so ordinary a circumstance would not give them the least alarm he recommended that the soldiers chosen for this service should be such as could be depended uponno fainters in spiritnone who turn back from mount gilead for fear of the amalekites but men of war accustomed to strike with the sword and to need no second blow finally he represented that it would be wisely done if the general should put pearson or any other officer whom he could completely trust into the command of the detachment and keep his own person if he should think it proper to attend secret even from the soldiers  all this mans counsels cromwell had punctually followed he had travelled in the van of this detachment of one hundred picked soldiers whom he had selected for the service men of dauntless resolution bred in a thousand dangers and who were steeled against all feelings of hesitation and compassion by the deep and gloomy fanaticism which was their chief principle of actionmen to whom as their general and no less as the chief among the elect the commands of oliver were like a commission from the deity  great and deep was the generals mortification at the unexpected absence of the personage on whose agency he so confidently reckoned and many conjectures he formed as to the cause of such mysterious conduct some times he thought tomkins had been overcome by liquor a frailty to which cromwell knew him to be addicted and when he held this opinion he discharged his wrath in maledictions which of a different kind from the wild oaths and curses of the cavaliers had yet in them as much blasphemy and more determined malevolence at other times he thought some unexpected alarm or perhaps some drunken cavalier revel had caused the family of woodstock lodge to make later hours than usual to this conjecture which appeared the most probable of any his mind often recurred and it was the hope that tomkins would still appear at the rendezvous which induced him to remain at the borough anxious to receive communication from his emissary and afraid of endangering the success of the enterprise by any premature exertion on his own part  in the meantime cromwell finding it no longer possible to conceal his personal presence disposed of every thing so as to be ready at a minutes notice half his soldiers he caused to dismount and had the horses put into quarters the other half were directed to keep their horses saddled and themselves ready to mount at a moments notice the men were brought into the house by turns and had some refreshment leaving a sufficient guard on the horses which was changed from time to time  thus cromwell waited with no little uncertainty often casting an anxious eye upon colonel everard who he suspected could if he chose it well supply the place of his absent confidant everard endured this calmly with unaltered countenance and brow neither ruffled nor dejected  midnight at length tolled and it became necessary to take some decisive step tomkins might have been treacherous or a suspicion which approached more near to the reality his intrigue might have been discovered and he himself murdered or kidnapped by the vengeful royalists in a word if any use was to be made of the chance which fortune afforded of securing the most formidable claimant of the supreme power which he already aimed at no farther time was to be lost he at length gave orders to pearson to get the men under arms he directed him concerning the mode of forming them and that they should march with the utmost possible silence or as it was given out in the orders even as gideon marched in silence when he went down against the camp of the midianites with only phurah his servant peradventure continued this strange document we too may learn of what yonder midianites have dreamed  a single patrol followed by a corporal and five steady experienced soldiers formed the advanced guard of the party then followed the main body a rearguard of ten men guarded everard and the minister cromwell required the attendance of the former as it might be necessary to examine him or confront him with others and he carried master holdenough with him because he might escape if left behind and perhaps raise some tumult in the village the presbyterians though they not only concurred with but led the way in the civil war were at its conclusion highly dissatisfied with the ascendency of the military sectaries and not to be trusted as cordial agents in anything where their interest was concerned the infantry being disposed of as we have noticed marched off from the left of their line cromwell and pearson both on foot keeping at the head of the centre or main body of the detachment they were all armed with petronels short guns similar to the modern carabine and like them used by horsemen they marched in the most profound silence and with the utmost regularity the whole body moving like one man  about one hundred yards behind the rearmost of the dismounted party came the troopers who remained on horseback and it seemed as if even the irrational animals were sensible to cromwells orders for the horses did not neigh and even appeared to place their feet on the earth cautiously and with less noise than usual  their leader full of anxious thoughts never spoke save to enforce by whispers his caution respecting silence while the men surprised and delighted to find themselves under the command of their renowned general and destined doubtless for some secret service of high import used the utmost precaution in attending to his reiterated orders  they marched down the street of the little borough in the order we have mentioned few of the townsmen were abroad and one or two who had protracted the orgies of the evening to that unusual hour were too happy to escape the notice of a strong party of soldiers who often acted in the character of police to inquire about their purpose for being under arms so late or the route which they were pursuing  the external gate of the chase had ever since the party had arrived at woodstock been strictly guarded by three file of troopers to cut off all communication between the lodge and the town spitfire wildrakes emissary who had often been abirdnesting or on similar mischievous excursions in the forest had evaded these mens vigilance by climbing over a breach with which he was well acquainted in a different part of the wall  between this party and the advanced guard of cromwells detachment a whispered challenge was exchanged according to the rules of discipline the infantry entered the park and were followed by the cavalry who were directed to avoid the hard road and ride as much as possible upon the turf which bordered on the avenue here too an additional precaution was used a file or two of foot soldiers being detached to search the woods on either hand and make prisoner or in the event of resistance put to death any whom they might find lurking there under what pretence soever  meanwhile the weather began to show itself as propitious to cromwell as he had found most incidents in the course of his successful career the grey mist which had hitherto obscured everything and rendered marching in the wood embarrassing and difficult had now given way to the moon which after many efforts at length forced her way through the vapour and hung her dim dull cresset in the heavens which she enlightened as the dying lamp of an anchorite does the cell in which he reposes the party were in sight of the front of the palace when holdenough whispered to everard as they walked near each othersee ye not yonder flutters the mysterious light in the turret of the incontinent rosamond this night will try whether the devil of the sectaries or the devil of the malignants shall prove the stronger o sing jubilee for the kingdom of satan is divided against itself  here the divine was interrupted by a noncommissioned officer who came hastily yet with noiseless steps to say in a low stern whisper silence prisoner in the rearsilence on pain of death  a moment afterwards the whole party stopped their march the word halt being passed from one to another and instantly obeyed  the cause of this interruption was the hasty return of one of the flanking party to the main body bringing news to cromwell that they had seen a light in the wood at some distance on the left  what can it be said cromwell his low stern voice even in a whisper making itself distinctly heard does it move or is it stationary  so far as we can judge it moveth not answered the trooper  strangethere is no cottage near the spot where it is seen  so please your excellency it may be a device of sathan said corporal humgudgeon snuffing through his nose he is mighty powerful in these parts of late  so please your idiocy thou art an ass said cromwell but instantly recollecting that the corporal had been one of the adjutators or tribunes of the common soldiers and was therefore to be treated with suitable respect he said nevertheless if it be the device of satan please it the lord we will resist him and the foul slave shall fly from uspearson he said resuming his soldierlike brevity take four file and see what is yondernothe knaves may shrink from thee go thou straight to the lodgeinvest it in the way we agreed so that a bird shall not escape out of itform an outward and an inward ring of sentinels but give no alarm until i come should any attempt to escape kill themhe spoke that command with terrible emphasiskill them on the spot he repeated be they who or what they will better so than trouble the commonwealth with prisoners  pearson heard and proceeded to obey his commanders orders  meanwhile the future protector disposed the small force which remained with him in such a manner that they should approach from different points at once the light which excited his suspicions and gave them orders to creep as near to it as they could taking care not to lose each others support and to be ready to rush in at the same moment when he should give the sign which was to be a loud whistle anxious to ascertain the truth with his own eyes cromwell who had by instinct all the habits of military foresight which in others are the result of professional education and long experience advanced upon the object of his curiosity he skulked from tree to tree with the light step and prowling sagacity of an indian bushfighter and before any of his men had approached so near as to descry them he saw by the lantern which was placed on the ground two men who had been engaged in digging what seemed to be an illmade grave near them lay extended something wrapped in a deers hide which greatly resembled the dead body of a man they spoke together in a low voice yet so that their dangerous auditor could perfectly overhear what they said  it is done at last said one the worst and hardest labour i ever did in my life i believe there is no luck about me left my very arms feel as if they did not belong to me and strange to tell toil as hard as i would i could not gather warmth in my limbs  i have warmed me enough said rochecliffe breathing short with fatigue  but the cold lies at my heart said joceline i scarce hope ever to be warm again it is strange and a charm seems to be on us here have we been nigh two hours in doing what diggon the sexton would have done to better purpose in half a one  we are wretched spadesmen enough answered dr rochecliffe every man to his toolsthou to thy buglehorn and i to my papers in cipherbut do not be discouraged it is the frost on the ground and the number of roots which rendered our task difficult and now all due rites done to this unhappy man and having read over him the service of the church valeat quantum let us lay him decently in this place of last repose there will be small lack of him above ground so cheer up thy heart man like a soldier as thou art we have read the service over his body and should times permit it we will have him removed to consecrated ground though he is all unworthy of such favour here help me to lay him in the earth we will drag briers and thorns over the spot when we have shovelled dust upon dust and do thou think of this chance more manfully and remember thy secret is in thine own keeping  i cannot answer for that said joceline methinks the very night winds among the leaves will tell of what we have been doingmethinks the trees themselves will say there is a dead corpse lies among our roots witnesses are soon found when blood hath been spilled  they are so and that right early exclaimed cromwell starting from the thicket laying hold on joceline and putting a pistol to his head at any other period of his life the forester would even against the odds of numbers have made a desperate resistance but the horror he had felt at the slaughter of an old companion although in defence of his own life together with fatigue and surprise had altogether unmanned him and he was seized as easily as a sheep is secured by the butcher dr rochecliffe offered some resistance but was presently secured by the soldiers who pressed around him  look some of you said cromwell what corpse this is upon whom these lewd sons of belial have done a murdercorporal gracebehere humgudgeon see if thou knowest the face  i profess i do even as i should do mine own in a mirror snuffled the corporal after looking on the countenance of the dead man by the help of the lantern of a verity it is our trusty brother in the faith joseph tomkins  tomkins exclaimed cromwell springing forward and satisfying himself with a glance at the features of the corpsetomkinsand murdered as the fracture of the temple intimatesdogs that ye are confess the truthyou have murdered him because you have discovered his treachery i should say his true spirit towards the commonwealth of england and his hatred of those complots in which you would have engaged his honest simplicity  ay said gracebehere humgudgeon and then to misuse his dead body with your papistical doctrines as if you had crammed cold porridge into its cold mouth i pray thee general let these mens bonds be made strong  forbear corporal said cromwell our time pressesfriend to youwhom i believe to be doctor anthony rochecliffe by name and surname i have to give the choice of being hanged at daybreak tomorrow or making atonement for the murder of one of the lords people by telling what thou knowest of the secrets which are in yonder house  truly sir replied rochecliffe you found me but in my duty as a clergyman interring the dead and respecting answering your questions i am determined myself and do advise my fellowsufferer on this occasion  remove him said cromwell i know his stiffneckedness of old though i have made him plough in my furrow when he thought he was turning up his own swatheremove him to the rear and bring hither the other fellowcome thou herethis waycloserclosercorporal gracebehere do thou keep thy hand upon the belt with which he is bound we must take care of our life for the sake of this distracted country though lackaday for its own proper worth we could peril it for a pins pointnow mark me fellow choose betwixt buying thy life by a full confession or being tucked presently up to one of these old oakshow likest thou that  truly master answered the underkeeper affecting more rusticity than was natural to him for his frequent intercourse with sir henry lee had partly softened and polished his manners i think the oak is like to bear a lusty acornthat is all  dally not with me friend continued oliver i profess to thee in sincerity i am no trifler what guests have you seen at yonder house called the lodge  many a brave guest in my day ise warrant ye master said joceline ah to see how the chimneys used to smoke some twelve years back ah sir a sniff of it would have dined a poor man  out rascal said the general dost thou jeer me tell me at once what guests have been of late in the lodgeand look thee friend be assured that in rendering me this satisfaction thou shalt not only rescue thy neck from the halter but render also an acceptable service to the state and one which i will see fittingly rewarded for truly i am not of those who would have the rain fall only on the proud and stately plants but rather would so far as my poor wishes and prayers are concerned that it should also fall upon the lowly and humble grass and corn that the heart of the husbandman may be rejoiced and that as the cedar of lebanon waxes in its height in its boughs and in its roots so may the humble and lowly hyssop that groweth upon the walls flourish andand trulyunderstandst thou me knave  not entirely if it please your honour said joceline but it sounds as if you were preaching a sermon and has a marvellous twang of doctrine with it  then in one wordthou knowest there is one louis kerneguy or carnego or some such name in hiding at the lodge yonder  nay sir replied the underkeeper there have been many coming and going since worcesterfield and how should i know who they aremy service is out of doors i trow  a thousand pounds said cromwell do i tell down to thee if thou canst place that boy in my power  a thousand pounds is a marvellous matter sir said joceline but i have more blood on my hand than i like already i know not how the price of life may thriveand scape or hang i have no mind to try  away with him to the rear said the general and let him not speak with his yokefellow yonderfool that i am to waste time in expecting to get milk from mulesmove on towards the lodge  they moved with the same silence as formerly notwithstanding the difficulties which they encountered from being unacquainted with the road and its various intricacies at length they were challenged in a low voice by one of their own sentinels two concentric circles of whom had been placed around the lodge so close to each other as to preclude the possibility of an individual escaping from within the outer guard was maintained partly by horse upon the roads and open lawn and where the ground was broken and bushy by infantry the inner circle was guarded by foot soldiers only the whole were in the highest degree alert expecting some interesting and important consequences from the unusual expedition on which they were engaged  any news pearson said the general to his aidedecamp who came instantly to report to his superior  he received for answer none  cromwell led his officer forward just opposite to the door of the lodge and there paused betwixt the circles of guards so that their conversation could not be overheard  he then pursued his enquiry demanding were there any lightsany appearances of stirringany attempt at sallyany preparation for defence  all as silent as the valley of the shadow of deatheven as the vale of jehosaphat  pshaw tell me not of jehosaphat pearson said cromwell these words are good for others but not for thee speak plainly and like a blunt soldier as thou art each man hath his own mode of speech and bluntness not sanctity is thine  well then nothing has been stirring said pearsonyet peradventure  peradventure not me said cromwell or thou wilt tempt me to knock thy teeth out i ever distrust a man when he speaks after another fashion from his own  zounds let me speak to an end answered pearson and i will speak in what language your excellency will  thy zounds friend said oliver showeth little of grace but much of sincerity go to thenthou knowest i love and trust thee hast thou kept close watch it behoves us to know that before giving the alarm  on my soul said pearson i have watched as closely as a cat at a mousehole it is beyond possibility that any thing could have eluded our vigilance or even stirred within the house without our being aware of it  tis well said cromwell thy services shall not be forgotten pearson thou canst not preach and pray but thou canst obey thine orders gilbert pearson and that may make amends  i thank your excellency replied pearson but i beg leave to chime in with the humours of the times a poor fellow hath no right to hold himself singular  he paused expecting cromwells orders what next was to be done and indeed not a little surprised that the generals active and prompt spirit had suffered him during a moment so critical to cast away a thought upon a circumstance so trivial as his officers peculiar mode of expressing himself he wondered still more when by a brighter gleam of moonshine than he had yet enjoyed he observed that cromwell was standing motionless his hands supported upon his sword which he had taken out of the belt and his stern brows bent on the ground he waited for some time impatiently yet afraid to interfere lest he should awaken this unwonted fit of illtimed melancholy into anger and impatience he listened to the muttering sounds which escaped from the halfopening lips of his principal in which the words hard necessity which occurred more than once were all of which the sense could be distinguished my lordgeneral at length he said time flies  peace busy fiend and urge me not said cromwell thinkst thou like other fools that i have made a paction with the devil for success and am bound to do my work within an appointed hour lest the spell should lose its force  i only think my lordgeneral said pearson that fortune has put into your coffer what you have long desired to make prize of and that you hesitate  cromwell sighed deeply as he answered ah pearson in this troubled world a man who is called like me to work great things in israel had need to be as the poets feign a thing made of hardened metal immovable to feelings of human charities impassible resistless pearson the world will hereafter perchance think of me as being such a one as i have described an iron man and made of iron mouldyet they will wrong my memorymy heart is flesh and my blood is mild as that of others when i was a sportsman i have wept for the gallant heron that was struck down by my hawk and sorrowed for the hare which lay screaming under the jaws of my greyhound and canst thou think it a light thing to me that the blood of this lads father lying in some measure upon my head i should now put in peril that of the son they are of the kindly race of english sovereigns and doubtless are adored like to demigods by those of their own party i am called parricide bloodthirsty usurper already for shedding the blood of one man that the plague might be stayedor as achan was slain that israel might thereafter stand against the face of their enemies nevertheless who has spoke unto me graciously since that high deed those who acted in the matter with me are willing that i should be the scapegoat of the atonementthose who looked on and helped not bear themselves now as if they had been borne down by violence and while i looked that they should shout applause on me because of the victory of worcester whereof the lord had made me the poor instrument they look aside to say ha ha the kingkiller the parricidesoon shall his place be made desolatetruly it is a great thing gilbert pearson to be lifted above the multitude but when one feeleth that his exaltation is rather hailed with hate and scorn than with love and reverencein sooth it is still a hard matter for a mild tenderconscienced infirm spirit to bearand god be my witness that rather than do this new deed i would shed my own best heartsblood in a pitched field twenty against one here he fell into a flood of tears which he sometimes was wont to do this extremity of emotion was of a singular character it was not actually the result of penitence and far less that of absolute hypocrisy but arose merely from the temperature of that remarkable man whose deep policy and ardent enthusiasm were intermingled with a strain of hypochondriacal passion which often led him to exhibit scenes of this sort though seldom as now when he was called to the execution of great undertakings  pearson well acquainted as he was with the peculiarities of his general was baffled and confounded by this fit of hesitation and contrition by which his enterprising spirit appeared to be so suddenly paralysed after a moments silence he said with some dryness of manner if this be the case it is a pity your excellency came hither corporal humgudgeon and i the greatest saint and greatest sinner in your army had done the deed and divided the guilt and the honour betwixt us  ha said cromwell as if touched to the quick wouldst thou take the prey from the lion  if the lion behaves like a village cur said pearson boldly who now barks and seems as if he would tear all to pieces and now flies from a raised stick or a stone i know not why i should fear him if lambert had been here there had been less speaking and more action  lambert what of lambert said cromwell very sharply  only said pearson that i long since hesitated whether i should follow your excellency or himand i begin to be uncertain whether i have made the best choice thats all  lambert exclaimed cromwell impatiently yet softening his voice lest he should be overheard descanting on the character of his rivalwhat is lamberta tulipfancying fellow whom nature intended for a dutch gardener at delft or rotterdam ungrateful as thou art what could lambert have done for thee  he would not answered pearson have stood here hesitating before a locked door when fortune presented the means of securing by one blow his own fortune and that of all who followed him  thou art right gilbert pearson said cromwell grasping his officers hand and strongly pressing it be the half of this bold accompt thine whether the reckoning be on earth or heaven  be the whole of it mine hereafter said pearson hardily so your excellency have the advantage of it upon earth step back to the rear till i force the doorthere may be danger if despair induce them to make a desperate sally  and if they do sally is there one of my ironsides who fears fire or steel less than myself said the general let ten of the most determined men follow us two with halberts two with petronels the others with pistolslet all their arms be loaded and fire without hesitation if there is any attempt to resist or to sally forthlet corporal humgudgeon be with them and do thou remain here and watch against escape as thou wouldst watch for thy salvation  the general then struck at the door with the hilt of his swordat first with a single blow or two then with a reverberation of strokes that made the ancient building ring again this noisy summons was repeated once or twice without producing the least effect  what can this mean said cromwell they cannot surely have fled and left the house empty  no replied pearson i will ensure you against that but your excellency strikes so fiercely you allow no time for an answer hark i hear the baying of a hound and the voice of a man who is quieting himshall we break in at once or hold parley  i will speak to them first said cromwellhollo who is within there  who is it enquires answered sir henry lee from the interior or what want you here at this dead hour  we come by warrant of the commonwealth of england said the general  i must see your warrant ere i undo either bolt or latch replied the knight we are enough of us to make good the castle neither i nor my fellows will deliver it up but upon good quarter and conditions and we will not treat for these save in fair daylight  since you will not yield to our right you must try our might replied cromwell look to yourselves within the door will be in the midst of you in five minutes  look to yourselves without replied the stouthearted sir henry we will pour our shot upon you if you attempt the least violence  but alas while he assumed this bold language his whole garrison consisted of two poor terrified women for his son in conformity with the plan which they had fixed upon had withdrawn from the hall into the secret recesses of the palace  what can they be doing now sir said phoebe hearing a noise as it were of a carpenter turning screwnails mixed with a low buzz of men talking  they are fixing a petard said the knight with great composure i have noted thee for a clever wench phoebe and i will explain it to thee tis a metal pot shaped much like one of the roguish knaves own sugarloaf hats supposing it had narrower brimsit is charged with some few pounds of fine gunpowder then  gracious we shall be all blown up exclaimed phoebethe word gunpowder being the only one which she understood in the knights description  not a bit foolish girl pack old dame jellicot into the embrasure of yonder window said the knight on that side of the door and we will ensconce ourselves on this and we shall have time to finish my explanation for they have bungling engineers we had a clever french fellow at newark would have done the job in the firing of a pistol  they had scarce got into the place of security when the knight proceeded with his descriptionthe petard being formed as i tell you is secured with a thick and strong piece of plank termed the madrier and the whole being suspended or rather secured against the gate to be forcedbut thou mindest me not  how can i sir henry she said within reach of such a thing as you speak ofo lord i shall go mad with very terrorwe shall be crushedblown upin a few minutes  we are secure from the explosion replied the knight gravely which will operate chiefly in a forward direction into the middle of the chamber and from any fragments that may fly laterally we are sufficiently guarded by this deep embrasure  but they will slay us when they enter said phoebe  they will give thee fair quarter wench said sir henry and if i do not bestow a brace of balls on that rogue engineer it is because i would not incur the penalty inflicted by martial law which condemns to the edge of the sword all persons who attempt to defend an untenable post not that i think the rigour of the law could reach dame jellicot or thyself phoebe considering that you carry no arms if alice had been here she might indeed have done somewhat for she can use a birdingpiece  phoebe might have appealed to her own deeds of that day as more allied to feats of mêlée and battle than any which her young lady ever acted but she was in an agony of inexpressible terror expecting from the knights account of the petard some dreadful catastrophe of what nature she did not justly understand notwithstanding his liberal communication on the subject  they are strangely awkward at it said sir henry little boutirlin would have blown the house up before nowah he is a fellow would take the earth like a rabbitif he had been here never may i stir but he would have countermined them ere now and    tis sport to have the engineer   hoist with his own petard  as our immortal shakspeare has it  oh lord the poor mad old gentleman thought phoebeoh sir had you not better leave alone playbooks and think of your end uttered she aloud in sheer terror and vexation of spirit  if i had not made up my mind to that many days since answered the knight i had not now met this hour with a free bosom    as gentle and as jocund as to rest   go i to deathtruth hath a quiet breast  as he spoke a broad glare of light flashed from without through the windows of the hall and betwixt the strong iron stanchions with which they were secureda broad discoloured light it was which shed a red and dusky illumination on the old armour and weapons as if it had been the reflection of a conflagration phoebe screamed aloud and forgetful of reverence in the moment of passion clung close to the knights cloak and arm while dame jellicot from her solitary niche having the use of her eyes though bereft of her hearing yelled like an owl when the moon breaks out suddenly  take care good phoebe said the knight you will prevent my using my weapon if you hang upon me thusthe bungling fools cannot fix their petard without the use of torches now let me take the advantage of this intervalremember what i told thee and how to put off time  oh lorday sir said phoebe i will say any thing oh lord that it were but overah ahtwo prolonged screamsi hear something hissing like a serpent  it is the fusee as we martialists call it replied the knight that is phoebe the match which fires the petard and which is longer or shorter according to the distance  here the knights discourse was cut short by a dreadful explosion which as he had foretold shattered the door strong as it was to pieces and brought down the glass clattering from the windows with all the painted heroes and heroines who had been recorded on that fragile place of memory for centuries the women shrieked incessantly and were answered by the bellowing of bevis though shut up at a distance from the scene of action the knight shaking phoebe from him with difficulty advanced into the hall to meet those who rushed in with torches lighted and weapons prepared  death to all who resistlife to those who surrender exclaimed cromwell stamping with his foot who commands this garrison  sir henry lee of ditchley answered the old knight stepping forward who having no other garrison than two weak women is compelled to submit to what he would willingly have resisted  disarm the inveterate and malignant rebel cried oliver art thou not ashamed sir to detain me before the door of a house which you had no force to defend wearest thou so white a beard and knowest thou not that to refuse surrendering an indefensible post by the martial law deserves hanging  my beard and i said sir henry have settled that matter between us and agree right cordially it is better to run the risk of being hanged like honest men than to give up our trust like cowards and traitors  ha sayst thou said cromwell thou hast powerful motives i doubt not for running thy head into a noose but i will speak with thee by and byho pearson gilbert pearson take this scrolltake the elder woman with theelet her guide you to the various places therein mentionedsearch every room therein set down and arrest or slay upon the slightest resistance whomsoever you find there then note those places marked as commanding points for cutting off intercourse through the mansionthe landingplaces of the great staircase the great gallery and so forth use the woman civilly the plan annexed to the scroll will point out the posts even if she prove stupid or refractory meanwhile the corporal with a party will bring the old man and the girl there to some apartmentthe parlour i think called victor lees will do as well as anotherwe will then be out of this stifling smell of gunpowder  so saying and without requiring any farther assistance or guidance he walked towards the apartment he had named sir henry had his own feelings when he saw the unhesitating decision with which the general led the way and which seemed to intimate a more complete acquaintance with the various localities of woodstock than was consistent with his own present design to engage the commonwealth party in a fruitless search through the intricacies of the lodge  i will now ask thee a few questions old man said the general when they had arrived in the room and i warn thee that hope of pardon for thy many and persevering efforts against the commonwealth can be no otherwise merited than by the most direct answers to the questions i am about to ask  sir henry bowed he would have spoken but he felt his temper rising high and became afraid it might be exhausted before the part he had settled to play in order to afford the king time for his escape should be brought to an end  what household have you had here sir henry lee within these few dayswhat guestswhat visitors we know that your means of housekeeping are not so profuse as usual so the catalogue cannot be burdensome to your memory  far from it replied the knight with unusual command of temper my daughter and latterly my son have been my guests and i have had these females and one joceline joliffe to attend upon us  i do not ask after the regular members of your household but after those who have been within your gates either as guests or as malignant fugitives taking shelter  there may have been more of both kinds sir than i if it please your valour am able to answer for replied the knight i remember my kinsman everard was here one morningalso i bethink me a follower of his called wildrake  did you not also receive a young cavalier called louis garnegey said cromwell  i remember no such name were i to hang for it said the knight kerneguy or some such word said the general we will not quarrel for a sound  a scotch lad called louis kerneguy was a guest of mine said sir henry and left me this morning for dorsetshire  so late exclaimed cromwell stamping with his foothow fate contrives to baffle us even when she seems most favourablewhat direction did he take old man continued cromwellwhat horse did he ridewho went with him  my son went with him replied the knight he brought him here as the son of a scottish lordi pray you sir to be finished with these questions for although i owe thee as will shakspeare says    respect for thy great place and let the devil   be sometimes honoured for his burning throne  yet i feel my patience wearing thin  cromwell here whispered to the corporal who in turn uttered orders to two soldiers who left the room place the knight aside we will now examine the servant damsel said the generaldost them know said he to phoebe of the presence of one louis kerneguy calling himself a scotch page who came here a few days since  surely sir she replied i cannot easily forget him and i warrant no welllooking wench that comes into his way will be like to forget him either  aha said cromwell sayst thou so truly i believe the woman will prove the truer witnesswhen did he leave this house  nay i know nothing of his movements not i said phoebe i am only glad to keep out of his way but if he have actually gone hence i am sure he was here some two hours since for he crossed me in the lower passage between the hall and the kitchen  how did you know it was he demanded cromwell  by a rude enough token said phoebela sir you do ask such questions she added hanging down her head  humgudgeon here interfered taking upon himself the freedom of a coadjutor verily he said if what the damsel is called to speak upon hath aught unseemly i crave your excellencys permission to withdraw not desiring that my nightly meditations may be disturbed with tales of such a nature  nay your honour said phoebe i scorn the old mans words in the way of seemliness or unseemliness either master louis did but snatch a kiss that is the truth of it if it must be told  here humgudgeon groaned deeply while his excellency avoided laughing with some difficulty thou hast given excellent tokens phoebe he said and if they be true as i think they seem to be thou shalt not lack thy rewardand here comes our spy from the stables  there are not the least signs said the trooper that horses have been in the stables for a monththere is no litter in the stalls no hay in the racks the cornbins are empty and the mangers are full of cobwebs  ay ay said the old knight i have seen when i kept twenty good horses in these stalls with many a groom and stableboy to attend them  in the meanwhile said cromwell their present state tells little for the truth of your own story that there were horses today on which this kerneguy and your son fled from justice  i did not say that the horses were kept there said the knight i have horses and stables elsewhere  fie fie for shame for shame said the general can a whitebearded man i ask it once more be a false witness  faith sir said sir henry lee it is a thriving trade and i wonder not that you who live on it are so severe in prosecuting interlopers but it is the times and those who rule the times that make greybeards deceivers  thou art facetious friend as well as daring in thy malignity said cromwell but credit me i will cry quittance with you ere i am done whereunto lead these doors  to bedrooms answered the knight  bedrooms only to bedrooms said the republican general in a voice which indicated such was the internal occupation of his thoughts that he had not fully understood the answer  lord sir said the knight why should you make it so strange i say these doors lead to bedroomsto places where honest men sleep and rogues lie awake  you are running up a farther account sir henry said the general but we will balance it once and for all  during the whole of the scene cromwell whatever might be the internal uncertainty of his mind maintained the most strict temperance in language and manner just as if he had no farther interest in what was passing than as a military man employed in discharging the duty enjoined him by his superiors but the restraint upon his passion was but    the torrents smoothness ere it dash below  footnote   but mortal pleasure what art thou in truth   the torrents smoothness ere it dash below            campbells gertrude of wyoming  the course of his resolution was hurried on even more forcibly because no violence of expression attended or announced its current he threw himself into a chair with a countenance that indicated no indecision of mind but a determination which awaited only the signal for action meanwhile the knight as if resolved in nothing to forego the privileges of his rank and place sat himself down in turn and putting on his hat which lay on a table regarded the general with a calm look of fearless indifference the soldiers stood around some holding the torches which illuminated the apartment with a lurid and sombre glare of light the others resting upon their weapons phoebe with her hands folded her eyes turned upwards till the pupils were scarce visible and every shade of colour banished from her ruddy cheek stood like one in immediate apprehension of the sentence of death being pronounced and instant execution commanded  heavy steps were at last heard and pearson and some of the soldiers returned this seemed to be what cromwell waited for he started up and asked hastily any news pearson any prisonersany malignants slain in thy defence  none so please your excellency said the officer  and are thy sentinels all carefully placed as tomkins scroll gave direction and with fitting orders  with the most deliberate care said pearson  art thou very sure said cromwell pulling him a little to one side that this is all well and duly cared for bethink thee that when we engage ourselves in the private communications all will be lost should the party we look for have the means of dodging us by an escape into the more open rooms and from thence perhaps into the forest  my lordgeneral answered pearson if placing the guards on the places pointed out in this scroll be sufficient with the strictest orders to stop and if necessary to stab or shoot whoever crosses their post such orders are given to men who will not fail to execute them if more is necessary your excellency has only to speak  nonono pearson said the general thou hast done wellthis night over and let it end but as we hope thy reward shall not be wantingand now to businesssir henry lee undo me the secret spring of yonder picture of your ancestor nay spare yourself the trouble and guilt of falsehood or equivocation and i say undo me that spring presently  when i acknowledge you for my master and wear your livery i may obey your commands answered the knight even then i would need first to understand them  wench said cromwell addressing phoebe go thou undo the springyou could do it fast enough when you aided at the gambols of the demons of woodstock and terrified even mark everard who i judged had more sense  oh lord sir what shall i do said phoebe looking to the knight they know all about it what shall i do  for thy life hold out to the last wench every minute is worth a million  ha heard you that pearson said cromwell to the officer then stamping with his foot he added undo the spring or i will else use levers and wrenchingironsor ha another petard were well bestowed call the engineer  o lord sir cried phoebe i shall never live another peteri will open the spring  do as thou wilt said sir henry it shall profit them but little  whether from real agitation or from a desire to gain time phoebe was some minutes ere she could get the spring to open it was indeed secured with art and the machinery on which it acted was concealed in the frame of the portrait the whole when fastened appeared quite motionless and betrayed as when examined by colonel everard no external mark of its being possible to remove it it was now withdrawn however and showed a narrow recess with steps which ascended on one side into the thickness of the wall cromwell was now like a greyhound slipped from the leash with the prey in full viewup he cried pearson thou art swifter than iup thou next corporal with more agility than could have been expected from his person or years which were past the meridian of life and exclaiming before those with the torches he followed the party like an eager huntsman in the rear of his hounds to encourage at once and direct them as they penetrated into the labyrinth described by dr rochecliffe in the wonders of woodstock                                       chapter the thirtyfourth     the king therefore for his defence    against the furious queen   at woodstock builded such a bower    as never yet was seen   most curiously that bower was built    of stone and timber strong   an hundred and fifty doors    did to this bower belong   and they so cunningly contrived    with turnings round about   that none but with a clew of thread    could enter in or out     ballad of fair rosamond  the tradition of the country as well as some historical evidence confirmed the opinion that there existed within the old royal lodge at woodstock a labyrinth or connected series of subterranean passages built chiefly by henry ii for the security of his mistress rosamond clifford from the jealousy of his queen the celebrated eleanor dr rochecliffe indeed in one of those fits of contradiction with which antiquaries are sometimes seized was bold enough to dispute the alleged purpose of the perplexed maze of rooms and passages with which the walls of the ancient palace were perforated but the fact was undeniable that in raising the fabric some norman architect had exerted the utmost of the complicated art which they have often shown elsewhere in creating secret passages and chambers of retreat and concealment there were stairs which were ascended merely as it seemed for the purpose of descending againpassages which after turning and winding for a considerable way returned to the place where they set outthere were trapdoors and hatchways panels and portcullises although oliver was assisted by a sort of groundplan made out and transmitted by joseph tomkins whose former employment in dr rochecliffes service had made him fully acquainted with the place it was found imperfect and moreover the most serious obstacles to their progress occurred in the shape of strong doors partywalls and irongratesso that the party blundered on in the dark uncertain whether they were not going farther from rather than approaching the extremity of the labyrinth they were obliged to send for mechanics with sledgehammers and other instruments to force one or two of those doors which resisted all other means of undoing them labouring along in these dusky passages where from time to time they were like to be choked by the dust which their acts of violence excited the soldiers were obliged to be relieved oftener than once and the bulky corporal gracebehere himself puffed and blew like a grampus that has got into shoal water cromwell alone continued with unabated zeal to push on his researchesto encourage the soldiers by the exhortations which they best understood against fainting for lack of faithand to secure by sentinels at proper places possession of the ground which they had already explored his acute and observing eye detected with a sneering smile the cordage and machinery by which the bed of poor desborough had been inverted and several remains of the various disguises as well as private modes of access by which desborough bletson and harrison had been previously imposed upon he pointed them out to pearson with no farther comment than was implied in the exclamation the simple fools  but his assistants began to lose heart and be discouraged and required all his spirit to raise theirs he then called their attention to voices which they seemed to hear before them and urged these as evidence that they were moving on the track of some enemy of the commonwealth who for the execution of his malignant plots had retreated into these extraordinary fastnesses  the spirits of the men became at last downcast notwithstanding all this encouragement they spoke to each other in whispers of the devils of woodstock who might be all the while decoying them forward to a room said to exist in the palace where the floor revolving on an axis precipitated those who entered into a bottomless abyss humgudgeon hinted that he had consulted the scripture that morning by way of lot and his fortune had been to alight on the passage eutychus fell down from the third loft the energy and authority of cromwell however and the refreshment of some food and strong waters reconciled them to pursuing their task  nevertheless with all their unwearied exertions morning dawned on the search before they had reached dr rochecliffes sitting apartment into which after all they obtained entrance by a mode much more difficult than that which the doctor himself employed but here their ingenuity was long at fault from the miscellaneous articles that were strewed around and the preparations made for food and lodging it seemed they had gained the very citadel of the labyrinth but though various passages opened from it they all terminated in places with which they were already acquainted or communicated with the other parts of the house where their own sentinels assured them none had passed cromwell remained long in deep uncertainty meantime he directed pearson to take charge of the ciphers and more important papers which lay on the table though there is little there he said that i have not already known by means of trusty tomkinshonest josephfor an artful and thoroughpaced agent the like of thee is not left in england  after a considerable pause during which he sounded with the pommel of his sword almost every stone in the building and every plank on the floor the general gave orders to bring the old knight and dr rochecliffe to the spot trusting that he might work out of them some explanation of the secrets of this apartment  so please your excellency to let me deal with him said pearson who was a true soldier of fortune and had been a buccaneer in the west indies i think that by a whipcord twitched tight round their forehead and twisted about with a pistolbut i could make either the truth start from their lips or the eyes from their head  out upon thee pearson said cromwell with abhorrence we have no warrant for such cruelty neither as englishmen nor christians we may slay malignants as we crush noxious animals but to torture them is a deadly sin for it is written he made them to be pitied of those who carried them captive nay i recall the order even for their examination trusting that wisdom will be granted us without it to discover their most secret devices  there was a pause accordingly during which an idea seized upon cromwells imaginationbring me hither he said yonder stool and placing it beneath one of the windows of which there were two so high in the wall as not to be accessible from the floor he clambered up into the entrance of the window which was six or seven feet deep corresponding with the thickness of the wall come up hither pearson said the general but ere thou comest double the guard at the foot of the turret called loves ladder and bid them bring up the other petardso now come thou hither  the inferior officer however brave in the field was one of those whom a great height strikes with giddiness and sickness he shrunk back from the view of the precipice on the verge of which cromwell was standing with complete indifference till the general catching the hand of his follower pulled him forward as far as he would advance i think said the general i have found the clew but by this light it is no easy one see you we stand in the portal near the top of rosamonds tower and yon turret which rises opposite to our feet is that which is called loves ladder from which the drawbridge reached that admitted the profligate norman tyrant to the bower of his mistress  true my lord but the drawbridge is gone said pearson  ay pearson replied the general but an active man might spring from the spot we stand upon to the battlements of yonder turret  i do not think so my lord said pearson  what said cromwell not if the avenger of blood were behind you with his slaughterweapon in his hand  the fear of instant death might do much answered pearson but when i look at that sheer depth on either side and at the empty chasm between us and yonder turret which is i warrant you twelve feet distant i confess the truth nothing short of the most imminent danger should induce me to try pahthe thought makes my head grow giddyi tremble to see your highness stand there balancing yourself as if you meditated a spring into the empty air i repeat i would scarce stand so near the verge as does your highness for the rescue of my life  ah base and degenerate spirit said the general soul of mud and clay wouldst thou not do it and much more for the possession of empirethat is peradventure continued he changing his tone as one who has said too much shouldst thou be called on to do this that thereby becoming a great man in the tribes of israel thou mightest redeem the captivity of jerusalemay and it may be work some great work for the afflicted people of this land  your highness may feel such calls said the officer but they are not for poor gilbert pearson your faithful follower you made a jest of me yesterday when i tried to speak your language and i am no more able to fulfil your designs than to use your mode of speech  but pearson said cromwell thou hast thrice yea four times called me your highness  did i my lord i was not sensible of it i crave your pardon said the officer  nay said oliver there was no offence i do indeed stand high and i may perchance stand higherthough alas it were fitter for a simple soul like me to return to my plough and my husbandry nevertheless i will not wrestle against the supreme will should i be called on to do yet more in that worthy cause for surely he who hath been to our british israel as a shield of help and a sword of excellency making her enemies be found liars unto her will not give over the flock to those foolish shepherds of westminster who shear the sheep and feed them not and who are in very deed hirelings not shepherds  i trust to see your lordship quoit them all down stairs answered pearson but may i ask why we pursue this discourse even now until we have secured the common enemy  i will tarry no jot of time said the general fence the communication of loves ladder as it is called below as i take it for almost certain that the party whom we have driven from fastness to fastness during the night has at length sprung to the top of yonder battlements from the place where we now stand finding the turret is guarded below the place he has chosen for his security will prove a rattrap from whence there is no returning  there is a cask of gunpowder in this cabinet said pearson were it not better my lord to mine the tower if he will not render himself and send the whole turret with its contents one hundred feet in the air  ah silly man said cromwell striking him familiarly on the shoulder if thou hadst done this without telling me it had been good service but we will first summon the turret and then think whether the petard will serve our turnit is but mining at lastblow a summons there down below  the trumpets rang at his bidding till the old walls echoed from every recess and vaulted archway cromwell as if he cared not to look upon the person whom he expected to appear drew back like a necromancer afraid of the spectre which he has evoked  he has come to the battlement said pearson to his general  in what dress or appearance answered cromwell from within the chamber  a grey ridingsuit passmented with silver russet walkingboots a cut band a grey hat and plume black hair  it is he it is he said cromwell and another crowning mercy is vouchsafed  meantime pearson and young lee exchanged defiance from their respective posts  surrender said the former or we blow you up in your fastness  i am come of too high a race to surrender to rebels said albert assuming the air with which in such a condition a king might have spoken i bear you to witness cried cromwell exultingly he hath refused quarter of a surety his blood be on his headone of you bring down the barrel of powder as he loves to soar high we will add what can be taken from the soldiers bandolierscome with me pearson thou understandest this gearcorporal gracebehere stand thou fast on the platform of the window where captain pearson and i stood but even now and bend the point of thy partisan against any who shall attempt to pass thou art as strong as a bull and i will back thee against despair itself  but said the corporal mounting reluctantly the place is as the pinnacle of the temple and it is written that eutychus fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead  because he slept upon his post answered cromwell readily beware thou of carelessness and thus thy feet shall be kept from stumbling you four soldiers remain here to support the corporal if it be necessary and you as well as the corporal will draw into the vaulted passage the minute the trumpets sound a retreat it is as strong as a casemate and you may lie there safe from the effects of the mine thou zerubbabel robins i know wilt be their lanceprisade footnote lanceprisade or lancebrisade a private appointed to a small commanda sort of temporary corporal  robins bowed and the general departed to join those who were without  as he reached the door of the hall the petard was heard to explode and he saw that it had succeeded for the soldiers rushed brandishing their swords and pistols in at the postern of the turret whose gate had been successfully forced a thrill of exultation but not unmingled with horror shot across the veins of the ambitious soldier  nownow he cried they are dealing with him  his expectations were deceived pearson and the others returned disappointed and reported they had been stopt by a strong trapdoor of grated iron extended over the narrow stair and they could see there was an obstacle of the same kind some ten feet higher to remove it by force while a desperate and well armed man had the advantage of the steps above them might cost many lives which lackaday said the general it is our duty to be tender of what dost thou advise gilbert pearson  we must use powder my lord answered pearson who saw his master was too modest to reserve to himself the whole merit of the proceeding there may be a chamber easily and conveniently formed under the foot of the stair we have a sausage by good luck to form the trainand so  ah said cromwell i know thou canst manage such gear wellbut gilbert i go to visit the posts and give them orders to retire to a safe distance when the retreat is sounded you will allow them five minutes for this purpose  three is enough for any knave of them all said pearson they will be lame indeed that require more on such a servicei ask but one though i fire the train myself  take heed said cromwell that the poor soul be listened to if he asks quarter it may be he may repent him of his hardheartedness and call for mercy  and mercy he shall have answered pearson provided he calls loud enough to make me hear him for the explosion of that damned petard has made me as deaf as the devils dam  hush gilbert hush said cromwell you offend in your language  zooks sir i must speak either in your way or in my own said pearson unless i am to be dumb as well as deafaway with you my lord to visit the posts and you will presently hear me make some noise in the world  cromwell smiled gently at his aidedecamps petulance patted him on the shoulder and called him a mad fellow walked a little way then turned back to whisper what thou dost do quickly then returned again towards the outer circle of guards turning his head from time to time as if to assure himself that the corporal to whom he had intrusted the duty still kept guard with his advanced weapon upon the terrific chasm between rosamonds tower and the corresponding turret seeing him standing on his post the general muttered between his mustaches the fellow hath the strength and courage of a bear and yonder is a post where one shall do more to keep back than an hundred in making way he cast a last look on the gigantic figure who stood in that airy position like some gothic statue the weapon half levelled against the opposite turret with the but rested against his right foot his steel cap and burnished corslet glittering in the rising sun  cromwell then passed on to give the necessary orders that such sentinels as might be endangered at their present posts by the effect of the mine should withdraw at the sound of the trumpet to the places which he pointed out to them never on any occasion of his life did he display more calmness and presence of mind he was kind nay facetious with the soldiers who adored him and yet he resembled the volcano before the eruption commencesall peaceful and quiet without while an hundred contradictory passions were raging in his bosom  corporal humgudgeon meanwhile remained steady upon his post yet though as determined a soldier as ever fought among the redoubted regiment of ironsides and possessed of no small share of that exalted fanaticism which lent so keen an edge to the natural courage of those stern religionists the veteran felt his present situation to be highly uncomfortable within a pikes length of him arose a turret which was about to be dispersed in massive fragments through the air and he felt small confidence in the length of time which might be allowed for his escape from such a dangerous vicinity the duty of constant vigilance upon his post was partly divided by this natural feeling which induced him from time to time to bend his eyes on the miners below instead of keeping them riveted on the opposite turret  at length the interest of the scene arose to the uttermost after entering and returning from the turret and coming out again more than once in the course of about twenty minutes pearson issued as it might be supposed for the last time carrying in his hand and uncoiling as he went along the sausage or linen bag so called from its appearance which strongly sewed together and crammed with gunpowder was to serve as a train betwixt the mine to be sprung and the point occupied by the engineer who was to give fire he was in the act of finally adjusting it when the attention of the corporal on the tower became irresistibly and exclusively riveted upon the preparations for the explosion but while he watched the aidedecamp drawing his pistol to give fire and the trumpeter handling his instrument as waiting the order to sound the retreat fate rushed on the unhappy sentinel in a way he least expected  young active bold and completely possessed of his presence of mind albert lee who had been from the loopholes a watchful observer of every measure which had been taken by his besiegers had resolved to make one desperate effort for selfpreservation while the head of the sentinel on the opposite platform was turned from him and bent rather downwards he suddenly sprung across the chasm though the space on which he lighted was scarce wide enough for two persons threw the surprised soldier from his precarious stand and jumped himself down into the chamber the gigantic trooper went sheer down twenty feet struck against a projecting battlement which launched the wretched man outwards and then fell on the earth with such tremendous force that the head which first touched the ground dinted a hole in the soil of six inches in depth and was crushed like an eggshell scarce knowing what had happened yet startled and confounded at the descent of this heavy body which fell at no great distance from him pearson snapt his pistol at the train no previous warning given the powder caught and the mine exploded had it been strongly charged with powder many of those without might have suffered but the explosion was only powerful enough to blow out in a lateral direction a part of the wall just above the foundation sufficient however to destroy the equipoise of the building then amid a cloud of smoke which began gradually to encircle the turret like a shroud arising slowly from its base to its summit it was seen to stagger and shake by all who had courage to look steadily at a sight so dreadful slowly at first the building inclined outwards then rushed precipitately to its base and fell to the ground in huge fragments the strength of its resistance showing the excellence of the masonwork the engineer so soon as he had fired the train fled in such alarm that he wellnigh ran against his general who was advancing towards him while a huge stone from the summit of the building flying farther than the rest lighted within a yard of them  thou hast been over hasty pearson said cromwell with the greatest composure possiblehath no one fallen in that same tower of siloe  some one fell said pearson still in great agitation and yonder lies his body halfburied in the rubbish  with a quick and resolute step cromwell approached the spot and exclaimed pearson thou hast ruined methe young man hath escapedthis is our own sentinelplague on the idiot let him rot beneath the ruins which crushed him  a cry now resounded from the platform of rosamonds tower which appeared yet taller than formerly deprived of the neighbouring turret which emulated though it did not attain to its heighta prisoner noble generala prisonerthe fox whom we have chased all night is now in the snarethe lord hath delivered him into the hand of his servants  look you keep him in safe custody exclaimed cromwell and bring him presently down to the apartment from which the secret passages have their principal entrance  your excellency shall be obeyed  the proceedings of albert lee to which these exclamations related had been unfortunate he had dashed from the platform as we have related the gigantic strength of the soldier opposed to him and had instantly jumped down into rochecliffes chamber but the soldiers stationed there threw themselves upon him and after a struggle which was hopelessly maintained against such advantage of numbers had thrown the young cavalier to the ground two of them drawn down by his strenuous exertions falling across him at the same moment a sharp and severe report was heard which like a clap of thunder in the immediate vicinity shook all around them till the strong and solid tower tottered like the masts of a stately vessel when about to part by the board in a few seconds this was followed by another sullen sound at first low and deep but augmenting like the roar of a cataract as it descends reeling bellowing and rushing as if to astound both heaven and earth so awful indeed was the sound of the neighbour tower as it fell that both the captive and those who struggled with him continued for a minute or two passive in each others grasp  albert was the first who recovered consciousness and activity he shook off those who lay above him and made a desperate effort to gain his feet in which he partly succeeded but as he had to deal with men accustomed to every species of danger and whose energies were recovered nearly as soon as his own he was completely secured and his arms held down loyal and faithful to his trust and resolved to sustain to the last the character which he had assumed he exclaimed as his struggles were finally overpowered rebel villains would you slay your king  ha heard you that cried one of the soldiers to the lanceprisade who commanded the party shall i not strike this son of a wicked father under the fifth rib even as the tyrant of moab was smitten by ehud with a dagger of a cubits length  but robins answered be it far from us merciful strickalthrow to slay in cold blood the captive of our bow and of our spear me thinks since the storm of tredagh footnote tredagh or drogheda was taken by cromwell in 1649 by storm and the governor and the whole garrison put to the sword we have shed enough of bloodtherefore on your lives do him no evil but take from him his arms and let us bring him before the chosen instrument even our general that he may do with him what is meet in his eyes  by this time the soldier whose exultation had made him the first to communicate the intelligence from the battlements to cromwell returned and brought commands corresponding to the orders of their temporary officer and albert lee disarmed and bound was conducted as a captive into the apartment which derived its name from the victories of his ancestor and placed in the presence of general cromwell  running over in his mind the time which had elapsed since the departure charles till the siege if it may be termed so had terminated in his own capture albert had every reason to hope that his royal master must have had time to accomplish his escape yet he determined to maintain to the last a deceit which might for a time insure the kings safety the difference betwixt them could not he thought be instantly discovered begrimed as he was with dust and smoke and with blood issuing from some scratches received in the scuffle  in this evil plight but bearing himself with such dignity as was adapted to the princely character albert was ushered into the apartment of victor lee where in his fathers own chair reclined the triumphant enemy of the cause to which the house of lee had been hereditarily faithful                                       chapter the thirtyfifth     a barren title hast thou bought too dear   why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king           henry iv part i  oliver cromwell arose from his seat as the two veteran soldiers zerubbabel robins and merciful strickalthrow introduced into the apartment the prisoner whom they held by the arms and fixed his stern hazel eye on albert long before he could give vent to the ideas which were swelling in his bosom exultation was the most predominant  art not thou he at length said that egyptian which before these days madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness many thousand men who were murderersha youth i have hunted thee from stirling to worcester from worcester to woodstock and we have met at last  i would replied albert speaking in the character which he had assumed that we had met where i could have shown thee the difference betwixt a rightful king and an ambitious usurper  go to young man said cromwell say rather the difference between a judge raised up for the redemption of england and the son of those kings whom the lord in his anger permitted to reign over her but we will not waste useless words god knows that it is not of our will that we are called to such high matters being as humble in our thoughts as we are of ourselves and in our unassisted nature frail and foolish and unable to render a reason but for the better spirit within us which is not of usthou art weary young man and thy nature requires rest and refection being doubtless dealt with delicately as one who hath fed on the fat and drunk of the sweet and who hath been clothed in purple and fine linen  here the general suddenly stopt and then abruptly exclaimedbut is thisay whom have we here these are not the locks of the swarthy lad charles stewarta cheat a cheat  albert hastily cast his eyes on a mirror which stood in the room and perceived that a dark peruke found among dr rochecliffes miscellaneous wardrobe had been disordered in the scuffle with the soldiery and that his own lightbrown hair was escaping from beneath it  who is this said cromwell stamping with furypluck the disguise from him  the soldiers did so and bringing him at the same time towards the light the deception could not be maintained for a moment longer with any possibility of success cromwell came up to him with his teeth set and grinding against each other as he spoke his hands clenched and trembling with emotion and speaking with a voice lowpitched bitterly and deeply emphatic such as might have preceded a stab with his dagger thy name young man  he was answered calmly and firmly while the countenance of the speaker wore a cast of triumph and even contempt  albert lee of ditchley a faithful subject of king charles  i might have guessed it said cromwellay and to king charles shalt thou go as soon as it is noon on the dialpearson he continued let him be carried to the others and let them be executed at twelve exactly  all sir said pearson surprised for cromwell though he at times made formidable examples was in general by no means sanguinary  allrepeated cromwell fixing his eye on young lee yes young sir your conduct has devoted to death thy father thy kinsman and the stranger that was in thine household such wreck hast thou brought on thy fathers house  my father toomy aged father said albert looking upward and endeavouring to raise his hands in the same direction which was prevented by his bonds the lords will be done  all this havoc can be saved if said the general thou wilt answer one questionwhere is the young charles stewart who was called king of scotland  under heavens protection and safe from thy power was the firm and unhesitating answer of the young royalist  away with him to prison said cromwell and from thence to execution with the rest of them as malignants taken in the fact let a courtmartial sit on them presently  one word said young lee as they led him from the room stop stop said cromwell with the agitation of renewed hopelet him be heard  you love texts of scripture said albertlet this be the subject of your next homilyhad zimri peace who slew his master  away with him said the general let him die the deathi have said it  as cromwell spoke these words his aidedecamp observed that he became unwontedly pale  your excellency is overtoiled in the public service said pearson a course of the stag in the evening will refresh you the old knight hath a noble hound here if we can but get him to hunt without his master which may be hard as he is faithful and  hang him up said cromwell  whatwhomhang the noble dog your excellency was wont to love a good hound  it matters not said cromwell let him be killed is it not written that they slew in the valley of achor not only the accursed achan with his sons and his daughters but also his oxen and asses and his sheep and every live thing belonging unto him and even thus shall we do to the malignant family of lee who have aided sisera in his flight when israel might have been delivered of his trouble for ever but send out couriers and patrolsfollow pursue watch in every directionlet my horse be ready at the door in five minutes or bring me the first thou canst find  it seemed to pearson that this was something wildly spoken and that the cold perspiration was standing upon the generals brow as he said it he therefore again pressed the necessity of repose and it would appear that nature seconded strongly the representation cromwell arose and made a step or two towards the door of the apartment but stopped staggered and after a pause sate down in a chair truly friend pearson he said this weary carcass of ours is an impediment to us even in our most necessary business and i am fitter to sleep than to watch which is not my wont place guards therefore till we repose ourselves for an hour or two send out in every direction and spare not for horses flesh wake me if the courtmartial require instruction and forget not to see the sentence punctually executed on the lees and those who were arrested with them  as cromwell spoke thus he arose and halfopened a bedroom door when pearson again craved pardon for asking if he had rightly understood his excellency that all the prisoners were to be executed  have i not said it answered cromwell displeasedly is it because thou art a man of blood and hast ever been that thou dost affect these scruples to show thyself tenderhearted at my expense i tell thee that if there lack one in the full tale of execution thine own life shall pay the forfeit  so saying he entered the apartment followed by the groom of his chamber who attended upon pearsons summons  when his general had retired pearson remained in great perplexity what he ought to do and that from no scruples of conscience but from uncertainty whether he might not err either in postponing or in too hastily and too literally executing the instructions he had received  in the meantime strickalthrow and robins had returned after lodging albert in prison to the room where pearson was still musing on his generals commands both these men were adjutators in their army and old soldiers whom cromwell was accustomed to treat with great familiarity so that robins had no hesitation to ask captain pearson whether he meant to execute the commands of the general even to the letter  pearson shook his head with an air of doubt but added there was no choice left  be assured said the old man that if thou dost this folly thou wilt cause israel to sin and that the general will not be pleased with your service thou knowest and none better than thou that oliver although he be like unto david the son of jesse in faith and wisdom and courage yet there are times when the evil spirit cometh upon him as it did upon saul and he uttereth commands which he will not thank any one for executing  pearson was too good a politician to assent directly to a proposition which he could not denyhe only shook his head once more and said that it was easy for those to talk who were not responsible but the soldiers duty was to obey his orders and not to judge of them  very righteous truth said merciful strickalthrow a grim old scotchman i marvel where our brother zerubbabel caught up this softness of heart  why i do but wish said zerubbabel that four or five human creatures may draw the breath of gods air for a few hours more there can be small harm done by delaying the executionand the general will have some time for reflection  ay said captain pearson but i in my service must be more pointedly obsequious than thou in thy plainness art bound to be friend zerubbabel  then shall the coarse frieze cassock of the private soldier help the golden gaberdine of the captain to bear out the blast said zerubbabel ay indeed i can show you warrant why we be aidful to each other in doing acts of kindness and longsuffering seeing the best of us are poor sinful creatures who might suffer being called to a brief accounting  of a verity you surprise me brother zerubbabel said strickalthrow that thou being an old and experienced soldier whose head hath grown grey in battle shouldst give such advice to a young officer is not the generals commission to take away the wicked from the land and to root out the amalekite and the jebusite and the perizzite and the hittite and the girgashite and the amorite and are not these men justly to be compared to the five kings who took shelter in the cave of makedah who were delivered into the hands of joshua the son of nun and he caused his captains and his soldiers to come near and tread on their necksand then he smote them and he slew them and then he hanged them on five trees even till eveningand thou gilbert pearson by name be not withheld from the duty which is appointed to thee but do even as has been commanded by him who is raised up to judge and to deliver israel for it is written cursed is he who holdeth back his sword from the slaughter  thus wrangled the two military theologians while pearson much more solicitous to anticipate the wishes of oliver than to know the will of heaven listened to them with great indecision and perplexity                                       chapter the thirtysixth     but let us now like soldiers on the watch   put the souls armour on alike prepared   for all a soldiers warfare brings                             joanna baillie  the reader will recollect that when rochecliffe and joceline were made prisoners the party which escorted them had two other captives in their train colonel everard namely and the rev nehemiah holdenough when cromwell had obtained entrance into woodstock and commenced his search after the fugitive prince the prisoners were placed in what had been an old guardroom and which was by its strength well calculated to serve for a prison and a guard was placed over them by pearson no light was allowed save that of a glimmering fire of charcoal the prisoners remained separated from each other colonel everard conversing with nehemiah holdenough at a distance from dr rochecliffe sir henry lee and joceline the party was soon after augmented by wildrake who was brought down to the lodge and thrust in with so little ceremony that his arms being bound he had very nearly fallen on his nose in the middle of the prison  i thank you my good friend he said looking back to the door which they who had pushed him in were securingpoint de ceremonieno apology for tumbling so we light in good companysave ye save ye gentlemen allwhat á la mort and nothing stirring to keep the spirits up and make a night

somewhat more cordial with a comrade in distress this is a different scene from the brentford stormingparty the jade fortune has been a very stepmother to me i will sing you a song i made on my own illluck  at this moment captain wildrake we are not in a fitting mood for singing said sir henry civilly and gravely  nay it will aid your devotionsegad it sounds like a penitential psalm    when i

found in ramsays teatable miscellany among the wild slips of minstrelsy which are there collected  the door opened as wildrake finished this stanza at the top of his voice and in rushed a sentinel who greeting him by the title of a blasphemous bellowing bull of bashan bestowed a severe blow with his ramrod on the shoulders of the songster whose bonds permitted him no means of returning the compliment  your humble servant again sir said wildrake shrugging his shoulderssorry i have no means of showing my gratitude i am bound over to keep the peace like captain bobadilha knight did you

the morning which never happened to me before in all my life    when i was a young lad    my fortune was bad  pshaw this is not the tune it goes to here he fell fast asleep and sooner or later all his companions in misfortune followed his example  the benches intended for the repose of the soldiers of the guard afforded the prisoners convenience enough to lie down though their slumbers it may be believed were neither sound nor undisturbed but when daylight was but a little while broken the explosion of gunpowder which took place and the subsequent fall of the turret to which the mine was applied would have awakened the seven sleepers or morpheus himself the smoke penetrating through the windows left them at no loss for the cause of the din  there went my gunpowder said rochecliffe which has i trust blown up as many rebel villains as it might have been the means of destroying otherwise in a fair field it must have caught fire by chance  by chanceno said sir henry depend on it my bold albert has fired the train and that in yonder blast cromwell was flying towards the heaven whose battlements he will never reachah my brave boy and perhaps thou art thyself sacrificed like a youthful samson among the rebellious philistinesbut i will not be long behind thee albert  everard hastened to the door hoping to obtain from the guard to whom his name and rank might be known some explanation of the noise which seemed to announce some dreadful catastrophe  but nehemiah holdenough whose rest had been broken by the trumpet which gave signal for the explosion appeared in the very acme of horrorit is the trumpet of the archangel he criedit is the crushing of this world of elementsit is the summons to the judgmentseat the dead are obeying the callthey are with usthey are amongst usthey arise in their bodily framesthey come to summon us  as he spoke his eyes were riveted upon dr rochecliffe who stood directly opposite to him in rising hastily the cap which he commonly wore according to a custom then usual both among clergymen and gownmen of a civil profession had escaped from his head and carried with it the large silk patch which he probably wore for the purpose of disguise for the cheek which was disclosed was unscarred and the eye as good as that which was usually uncovered  colonel everard returning from the door endeavoured in vain to make master holdenough comprehend what he learned from the guard without that the explosion had involved only the death of one of cromwells soldiers the presbyterian divine continued to stare wildly at him of the episcopal persuasion  but dr rochecliffe heard and understood the news brought by colonel everard and relieved from the instant anxiety which had kept him stationary he advanced towards the retiring calvinist extending his hand in the most friendly manner  avoid theeavoid thee said holdenough the living may not join hands with the dead  but i said rochecliffe am as much alive as you are  thou alivethou

tremendousthou canst not be my joseph albany  i am joseph albany rochecliffe said the doctor become so in virtue of my mothers little estate which fines and confiscations have made an end of  and is it so indeed said holdenough and have i recovered mine old chum  even so replied rochecliffe by the same token i appeared to you in the mirror chamberthou wert so bold nehemiah that our whole scheme would have been shipwrecked had i not appeared to thee in the shape of a departed friend yet believe me it went against my heart to do it  ah fie on thee fie on thee said holdenough throwing himself into his arms and clasping him to his bosom thou wert ever a naughty wag how couldst thou play me such a trickah albany dost thou remember dr purefoy and caius college  marry do i said the doctor thrusting his arm through the presbyterian divines and guiding him to a seat apart from the other prisoners who witnessed this scene with much surprise remember caius college said rochecliffe ay and the good ale we drank and our parties to mother huffcaps  vanity of vanities said holdenough smiling kindly at the same time and still holding his recovered friends arm enclosed and handlocked in his  but the breaking the principals orchard so cleanly done said the doctor it was the first plot i ever framed and much work i had to prevail on thee to go into it  oh name not that iniquity said nehemiah since i may well say as the pious master baxter that these boyish offences have had their punishment in later years inasmuch as that inordinate appetite for fruit hath produced stomachic affections under which i yet labour  true true dear nehemiah said rochecliffe but care not for thema dram of brandy will correct it all mr baxter was he was about to say an ass but checked himself and only filled up the sentence with a good man i dare say but over scrupulous  so they sat down together the best of friends and for half an hour talked with mutual delight over old college stories by degrees they got on the politics of the day and though then they unclasped their hands and there occurred between them such expressions as nay my dear brother and there i must needs differ and on this point i crave leave to think yet a hue and cry against the independents and other sectarists being started they followed like brethren in full hollo and it was hard to guess which was most forward unhappily in the course of this amicable intercourse something was mentioned about the bishopric of titus which at once involved them in the doctrinal question of church government then alas the floodgates were opened and they showered on each other greek and hebrew texts while their eyes kindled their cheeks glowed their hands became clenched and they looked more like fierce polemics about to rend each others eyes out than christian divines  roger wildrake by making himself an auditor of the debate contrived to augment its violence he took of course a most decided part in a question the merits of which were totally unknown to him somewhat overawed by holdenoughs ready oratory and learning the cavalier watched with a face of anxiety the countenance of dr rochecliffe but when he saw the proud eye and steady bearing of the episcopal champion and heard him answer greek with greek and hebrew with hebrew wildrake backed his arguments as he closed them with a stout rap upon the bench and an exulting laugh in the face of the antagonist it was with some difficulty that sir henry and colonel everard having at length and reluctantly interfered prevailed on the two alienated friends to adjourn their dispute removing at the same time to a distance and regarding each other with looks in which old friendship appeared to have totally given way to mutual animosity  but while they sat lowering on each other and longing to renew a contest in which each claimed the victory pearson entered the prison and in a low and troubled voice desired the persons whom it contained to prepare for instant death  sir henry lee received the doom with the stern composure which he had hitherto displayed colonel everard attempted the interposition of a strong and resentful appeal to the parliament against the judgment of the courtmartial and the general but pearson declined to receive or transmit any such remonstrance and with a dejected look and mien of melancholy presage renewed his exhortation to them to prepare for the hour of noon and withdrew from the prison  the operation of this intelligence on the two clerical disputants was more remarkable they gazed for a moment on each other with eyes in which repentant kindness and a feeling of generous shame quenched every lingering feeling of resentment and joined in the mutual exclamation my brothermy brother i have sinned i have sinned in offending thee they rushed into each others arms shed tears as they demanded each others forgiveness and like two warriors who sacrifice a personal quarrel to discharge their duty against the common enemy they recalled nobler ideas of their sacred character and assuming the part which best became them on an occasion so melancholy began to exhort those around them to meet the doom that had been announced with the firmness and dignity which christianity alone can give                                       chapter the thirtyseventh     most gracious prince good cannyng cried     leave vengeance to our god   and lay the iron rule aside     be thine the olive rod     ballad of sir charles bawdin  the hour appointed for execution had been long past and it was about five in the evening when the protector summoned pearson to his presence he went with fear and reluctance uncertain how he might be received after remaining about a quarter of an hour the aidedecamp returned to victor lees parlour where he found the old soldier zerubbabel robins in attendance for his return  how is oliver said the old man anxiously  why well answered pearson and hath asked no questions of the execution but many concerning the reports we have been able to make regarding the flight of the young man and is much moved at thinking he must now be beyond pursuit also i gave him certain papers belonging to the malignant doctor rochecliffe  then will i venture upon him said the adjutator so give me a napkin that i may look like a sewer and fetch up the food which i directed should be in readiness  two troopers attended accordingly with a ration of beef such as was distributed to the private soldiers and dressed after their fashiona pewter pot of ale a trencher with salt black pepper and a loaf of ammunition bread come with me he said to pearson and fear notnoll loves an innocent jest he boldly entered the generals sleeping apartment and said aloud arise thou that art called to be a judge in israellet there be no more folding of the hands to sleep lo i come as a sign to thee wherefore arise eat drink and let thy heart be glad within thee for thou shalt eat with joy the food of him that laboureth in the trenches seeing that since thou wert commander over the host the poor sentinel hath had such provisions as i have now placed for thine own refreshment  truly brother zerubbabel said cromwell accustomed to such acts of enthusiasm among his followers we would wish that it were so neither is it our desire to sleep soft nor feed more highly than the meanest that ranks under our banners verily thou hast chosen well for my refreshment and the smell of the food is savoury in my nostrils  he arose from the bed on which he had lain down half dressed and wrapping his cloak around him sate down by the bedside and partook heartily of the plain food which was prepared for him while he was eating cromwell commanded pearson to finish his reportyou need not desist for the presence of a worthy soldier whose spirit is as my spirit  nay but interrupted robins you are to know that gilbert pearson hath not fully executed thy commands touching a part of those malignants all of whom should have died at noon  what executionwhat malignants said cromwell laying down his knife and fork  those in the prison here at woodstock answered zerubbabel whom your excellency commanded should be executed at noon as taken in the fact of rebellion against the commonwealth  wretch said cromwell starting up and addressing pearson thou hast not touched mark everard in whom there was no guilt for he was deceived by him who passed between usneither hast thou put forth thy hand on the pragmatic presbyterian minister to have all those of their classes cry sacrilege and alienate them from us for ever  if your excellency wish them to live they livetheir life and death are in the power of a word said pearson  enfranchise them i must gain the presbyterian interest over to us if i can  rochecliffe the archplotter said pearson i thought to have executed but  barbarous man said cromwell alike ungrateful and impoliticwouldst thou have destroyed our decoyduck this doctor is but like a well a shallow one indeed but something deeper than the springs which discharge their secret tribute into his keeping then come i with a pump and suck it all up to the open air enlarge him and let him have money if he wants it i know his haunts he can go nowhere but our eye will be upon himbut you look at each other darkly as if you had more to say than you durst i trust you have not done to death sir henry lee  no yet the man replied pearson is a confirmed malignant and  ay but he is also a noble relic of the ancient english gentleman said the general i would i knew how to win the favour of that race but we pearson whose royal robes are the armour which we wear on our bodies and whose leading staves are our sceptres are too newly set up to draw the respect of the proud malignants who cannot brook to submit to less than royal lineage yet what can they see in the longest kingly line in europe save that it runs back to a successful soldier i grudge that one man should be honoured and followed because he is the descendant of a victorious commander while less honour and allegiance is paid to another who in personal qualities and in success might emulate the founder of his rivals dynasty well sir henry lee lives and shall live for me his son indeed hath deserved the death which he has doubtless sustained  my lord stammered pearson since your excellency has found i am right in suspending your order in so many instances i trust you will not blame me in this alsoi thought it best to await more special orders  thou art in a mighty merciful humour this morning pearson said cromwell not entirely satisfied  if your excellency please the halter is ready and so is the provostmarshal  nay if such a bloody fellow as thou hast spared him it would ill become me to destroy him said the general but then here is among rochecliffes papers the engagement of twenty desperadoes to take us offsome example ought to be made  my lord said zerubbabel consider now how often this young man albert lee hath been near you nay probably quite close to your excellency in these dark passages which he knew and we did not had he been of an assassins nature it would have cost him but a pistolshot and the light of israel was extinguished nay in the unavoidable confusion which must have ensued the sentinels quitting their posts he might have had a fair chance of escape  enough zerubbabel he lives said the general he shall remain in custody for some time however and be then banished from england the other two are safe of course for you would not dream of considering such paltry fellows as fit victims for my revenge  one fellow the underkeeper called joliffe deserves death however said pearson since he has frankly admitted that he slew honest joseph tomkins  he deserves a reward for saving us a labour said cromwell that tomkins was a most doublehearted villain i have found evidence among these papers here that if we had lost the fight at worcester we should have had reason to regret that we had ever trusted master tomkinsit was only our success which anticipated his treacherywrite us down debtor not creditor to joceline an you call him so and to his quarterstaff  there remains the sacrilegious and graceless cavalier who attempted your excellencys life last night said pearson  nay said the general that were stooping too low for revenge his sword had no more power than had he thrusted with a tobaccopipe eagles stoop not at mallards or wilddrakes either  yet sir said pearson the fellow should be punished as a libeller the quantity of foul and pestilential abuse which we found in his pockets makes me loth he should go altogether freeplease to look at them sir  a most vile hand said oliver as he looked at a sheet or two of our friend wildrakes poetical miscellaniesthe very handwriting seems to be drunk and the very poetry not soberwhat have we here    when i was a young lad   my fortune was bad   if eer i do well tis a wonder  why what trash is thisand then again    now a plague on the poll   of old politic noll   we will drink till we bring   in triumph back the king  in truth if it could be done that way this poet would be a stout champion give the poor knave five pieces pearson and bid him go sell his ballads if he come within twenty miles of our person though we will have him flogged till the blood runs down to his heels  there remains only one sentenced person said pearson a noble wolfhound finer than any your excellency saw in ireland he belongs to the old knight sir henry lee should your excellency not desire to keep the fine creature yourself might i presume to beg that i might have leave  no pearson said cromwell the old man so faithful himself shall not be deprived of his faithful dogi would i had any creature were it but a dog that followed me because it loved me not for what it could make of me  your excellency is unjust to your faithful soldiers said zerubbabel bluntly who follow you like dogs fight for you like dogs and have the grave of a dog on the spot where they happen to fall  how now old grumbler said the general what means this change of note  corporal humgudgeons remains are left to moulder under the ruins of yonder tower and tomkins is thrust into a hole in a thicket like a beast  true true said cromwell they shall be removed to the churchyard and every soldier shall attend with cockades of seagreen and blue ribbonevery one of the noncommissioned officers and adjutators shall have a mourningscarf we ourselves will lead the procession and there shall be a proper dole of wine burnt brandy and rosemary see that it is done pearson after the funeral woodstock shall be dismantled and destroyed that its recesses may not again afford shelter to rebels and malignants  the commands of the general were punctually obeyed and when the other prisoners were dismissed albert lee remained for some time in custody he went abroad after his liberation entered in king charless guards where he was promoted by that monarch but his fate as we shall see hereafter only allowed him a short though bright career  we return to the liberation of the other prisoners from woodstock the two divines completely reconciled to each other retreated arm in arm to the parsonagehouse formerly the residence of dr rochecliffe but which he now visited as the guest of his successor nehemiah holdenough the presbyterian had no sooner installed his friend under his roof than he urged upon him an offer to partake it and the income annexed to it as his own dr rochecliffe was much affected but wisely rejected the generous offer considering the difference of their tenets on church government which each entertained as religiously as his creed another debate though a light one on the subject of the office of bishops in the primitive church confirmed him in his resolution they parted the next day and their friendship remained undisturbed by controversy till mr holdenoughs death in 1658 a harmony which might be in some degree owing to their never meeting again after their imprisonment dr rochecliffe was restored to his living after the restoration and ascended from thence to high clerical preferment  the inferior personages of the grand jaildelivery at woodstock lodge easily found themselves temporary accommodations in the town among old acquaintance but no one ventured to entertain the old knight understood to be so much under the displeasure of the ruling powers and even the innkeeper of the george who had been one of his tenants scarce dared to admit him to the common privileges of a traveller who has food and lodging for his money everard attended him unrequested unpermitted but also unforbidden the heart of the old man had been turned once more towards him when he learned how he had behaved at the memorable rencontre at the kings oak and saw that he was an object of the enmity rather than the favour of cromwell but there was another secret feeling which tended to reconcile him to his nephewthe consciousness that everard shared with him the deep anxiety which he experienced on account of his daughter who had not yet returned from her doubtful and perilous expedition he felt that he himself would perhaps be unable to discover where alice had taken refuge during the late events or to obtain her deliverance if she was taken into custody he wished everard to offer him his service in making a search for her but shame prevented his preferring the request and everard who could not suspect the altered state of his uncles mind was afraid to make the proposal of assistance or even to name the name of alice  the sun had already setthey sat looking each other in the face in silence when the trampling of horses was heardthere was knocking at the doorthere was a light step on the stair and alice the subject of their anxiety stood before them she threw herself joyfully into her fathers arms who glanced his eye needfully round the room as he said in a whisper is all safe  safe and out of danger as i trust replied alicei have a token for you  her eye then rested on everardshe blushed was embarrassed and silent  you need not fear your presbyterian cousin said the knight with a goodhumoured smile he has himself proved a confessor at least for loyalty and ran the risk of being a martyr  she pulled from her bosom the royal rescript written on a small and soiled piece of paper and tied round with a worsted thread instead of a seal such as it was sir henry ere he opened it pressed the little packet with oriental veneration to his lips to his heart to his forehead and it was not before a tear had dropt on it that he found courage to open and read the billet it was in these words  loyal our much esteemed friend and our trusty subject  it having become known to us that a purpose of marriage has been entertained betwixt mrs alice lee your only daughter and markham everard esq of eversly chase her kinsman and by affiancy your nephew and being assured that this match would be highly agreeable to you had it not been for certain respects to our service which induced you to refuse your consent theretowe do therefore acquaint you that far from our affairs suffering by such an alliance we do exhort and so far as we may require you to consent to the same as you would wish to do us good pleasure and greatly to advance our affairs leaving to you nevertheless as becometh a christian king the full exercise of your own discretion concerning other obstacles to such an alliance which may exist independent of those connected with our service witness our hand together with our thankful recollections of your good services to our late royal father as well as ourselves        c r  long and steadily did sir henry gaze on the letter so that it might almost seem as if he were getting it by heart he then placed it carefully in his pocketbook and asked alice the account of her adventures the preceding night they were briefly told their midnight walk through the chase had been speedily and safely accomplished nor had the king once made the slightest relapse into the naughty louis kerneguy when she had seen charles and his attendant set off she had taken some repose in the cottage where they parted with the morning came news that woodstock was occupied by soldiers so that return thither might have led to danger suspicion and enquiry alice therefore did not attempt it but went to a house in the neighbourhood inhabited by a lady of established loyalty whose husband had been major of sir henry lees regiment and had fallen at the battle of naseby mrs aylmer was a sensible woman and indeed the necessities of the singular times had sharpened every ones faculties for stratagem and intrigue she sent a faithful servant to scout about the mansion at woodstock who no sooner saw the prisoners dismissed and in safety and ascertained the knights destination for the evening than he carried the news to his mistress and by her orders attended alice on horseback to join her father  there was seldom perhaps an evening meal made in such absolute silence as by this embarrassed party each occupied with their own thoughts and at a loss how to fathom those of the others at length the hour came when alice felt herself at liberty to retire to repose after a day so fatiguing everard handed her to the door of her apartment and was then himself about to take leave when to his surprise his uncle asked him to return pointed to a chair and giving him the kings letter to read fixed his looks on him steadily during the perusal determined that if he could discover aught short of the utmost delight in the reading the commands of the king himself should be disobeyed rather than alice should be sacrificed to one who received not her hand as the greatest blessing earth had to bestow but the features of everard indicated joyful hope even beyond what the father could have anticipated yet mingled with surprise and when he raised his eye to the knights with timidity and doubt a smile was on sir henrys countenance as he broke silence the king he said had he no other subject in england should dispose at will of those of the house of lee but methinks the family of everard have not been so devoted of late to the crown as to comply with a mandate inviting its heir to marry the daughter of a beggar  the daughter of sir henry lee said everard kneeling to his uncle and perforce kissing his hand would grace the house of a duke  the girl is well enough said the knight proudly for myself my poverty shall neither shame nor encroach on my friends some few pieces i have by doctor rochecliffes kindness and joceline and i will strike out something  nay my dear uncle you are richer than you think for said everard that part of your estate which my father redeemed for payment of a moderate composition is still your own and held by trustees in your name myself being one of them you are only our debtor for an advance of monies for which if it will content you we will count with you like usurers my father is incapable of profiting by making a bargain on his own account for the estate of a distressed friend and all this you would have learned long since but that you would noti mean time did not serve for explanationi mean  you mean i was too hot to hear reason mark and i believe it is very true but i think we understand each other now tomorrow i go with my family to kingston where is an old house i may still call mine come hither at thy leisure markor thy best speed as thou wiltbut come with thy fathers consent  with my father in person said everard if you will permit  be that answered the knight as he and you willi think joceline will scarce shut the door in thy face or bevis growl as he did after poor louis kerneguynay no more raptures but goodnight mark goodnight and if thou art not tired with the fatigue of yesterdaywhy if you appear here at seven in the morning i think we must bear with your company on the kingston road  once more everard pressed the knights hand caressed bevis who received his kindness graciously and went home to dreams of happiness which were realized as far as this motley world permits within a few months afterwards                                       chapter the thirtyeighth         my life was of a piece   spent in your servicedying at your feet    don sebastian  years rush by us like the wind we see not whence the eddy comes nor whitherward it is tending and we seem ourselves to witness their flight without a sense that we are changed and yet time is beguiling man of his strength as the winds rob the woods of their foliage  after the marriage of alice and markham everard the old knight resided near them in an ancient manorhouse belonging to the redeemed portion of his estate where joceline and phoebe now man and wife with one or two domestics regulated the affairs of his household when he tired of shakspeare and solitude he was ever a welcome guest at his soninlaws where he went the more frequently that markham had given up all concern in public affairs disapproving of the forcible dismissal of the parliament and submitting to cromwells subsequent domination rather as that which was the lesser evil than as to a government which he regarded as legal cromwell seemed ever willing to show himself his friend but everard resenting highly the proposal to deliver up the king which he considered as an insult to his honour never answered such advances and became on the contrary of the opinion which was now generally prevalent in the nation that a settled government could not be obtained without the recall of the banished family there is no doubt that the personal kindness which he had received from charles rendered him the more readily disposed to such a measure he was peremptory however in declining all engagements during olivers life whose power he considered as too firmly fixed to be shaken by any plots which could be formed against it  meantime wildrake continued to be everards protected dependent as before though sometimes the connexion tended not a little to his inconvenience that respectable person indeed while he remained stationary in his patrons house or that of the old knight discharged many little duties in the family and won alices heart by his attention to the children teaching the boys of whom they had three to ride fence toss the pike and many similar exercises and above all filling up a great blank in her fathers existence with whom he played at chess and backgammon or read shakspeare or was clerk to prayers when any sequestrated divine ventured to read the service of the church or he found game for him while the old gentleman continued to go asporting and especially he talked over the storming of brentford and the battles of edgehill banbury roundwaydown and others themes which the aged cavalier delighted in but which he could not so well enter upon with colonel everard who had gained his laurels in the parliament service  the assistance which he received from wildrakes society became more necessary after sir henry was deprived of his gallant and only son who was slain in the fatal battle of dunkirk where unhappily english colours were displayed on both the contending sides the french being then allied with oliver who sent to their aid a body of auxiliaries and the troops of the banished king fighting in behalf of the spaniards sir henry received the melancholy news like an old man that is with more external composure than could have been anticipated he dwelt for weeks and months on the lines forwarded by the indefatigable dr rochecliffe superscribed in small letters c r and subscribed louis kerneguy in which the writer conjured him to endure this inestimable loss with the greater firmness that he had still left one son intimating himself who would always regard him as a father  but in spite of this balsam sorrow acting imperceptibly and sucking the blood like a vampire seemed gradually drying up the springs of life and without any formed illness or outward complaint the old mans strength and vigour gradually abated and the ministry of wildrake proved daily more indispensable  it was not however always to be had the cavalier was one of those happy persons whom a strong constitution an unreflecting mind and exuberant spirits enable to play through their whole lives the part of a schoolboyhappy for the moment and careless of consequences  once or twice every year when he had collected a few pieces the cavaliero wildrake made a start to london where as he described it he went on the ramble drank as much wine as he could come by and led a skeldering life to use his own phrase among roystering cavaliers like himself till by some rash speech or wild action he got into the marshalsea the fleet or some other prison from which he was to be delivered at the expense of interest money and sometimes a little reputation  at length cromwell died his son resigned the government and the various changes which followed induced everard as well as many others to adopt more active measures in the kings behalf everard even remitted considerable sums for his service but with the utmost caution and corresponding with no intermediate agent but with the chancellor himself to whom he communicated much useful information upon public affairs with all his prudence he was very nearly engaged in the ineffectual rising of booth and middleton in the west and with great difficulty escaped from the fatal consequences of that illtimed attempt after this although the estate of the kingdom was trebly unsettled yet no card seemed to turn up favourable to the royal cause until the movement of general monk from scotland even then it was when at the point of complete success that the fortunes of charles seemed at a lower ebb than ever especially when intelligence had arrived at the little court which he then kept in brussels that monk on arriving in london had put himself under the orders of the parliament  it was at this time and in the evening while the king buckingham wilmot and some other gallants of his wandering court were engaged in a convivial party that the chancellor clarendon suddenly craved audience and entering with less ceremony than he would have done at another time announced extraordinary news for the messenger he said he could say nothing saving that he appeared to have drunk much and slept little but that he had brought a sure token of credence from a man for whose faith he would venture his life the king demanded to see the messenger himself  a man entered with something the manners of a gentleman and more those of a rakebelly debaucheehis eyes swelled and inflamedhis gait disordered and stumbling partly through lack of sleep partly through the means he had taken to support his fatigue he staggered without ceremony to the head of the table seized the kings hand which he mumbled like a piece of gingerbread while charles who began to recollect him from his mode of salutation was not very much pleased that their meeting should have taken place before so many witnesses  i bring good news said the uncouth messenger glorious newsthe king shall enjoy his own againmy feet are beautiful on the mountains gad i have lived with presbyterians till i have caught their language but we are all one mans children nowall your majestys poor babes the rump is all ruined in londonbonfires flaming music playing rumps roasting healths drinking london in a blaze of light from the strand to rotherhithetankards clattering  we can guess at that said the duke of buckingham  my old friend mark everard sent me off with the news im a villain if ive slept since your majesty recollects me i am sure your majesty remembers sasaat the kings oak at woodstock    o well dance and sing and play   for twill be a joyous day   when the king shall enjoy his own again  master wildrake i remember you well said the king i trust the good news is certain  certain your majesty did i not hear the bellsdid i not see the bonfiresdid i not drink your majestys health so often that my legs would scarce carry me to the wharf it is as certain as that i am poor roger wildrake of squattleseamere lincoln  the duke of buckingham here whispered to the king i have always suspected your majesty kept odd company during the escape from worcester but this seems a rare sample  why pretty much like yourself and other company i have kept here so many yearsas stout a heart as empty a head said charlesas much lace though somewhat tarnished as much brass on the brow and nearly as much copper in the pocket  i would your majesty would intrust this messenger of good news with me to get the truth out of him said buckingham  thank your grace replied the king but he has a will as well as yourself and such seldom agree my lord chancellor hath wisdom and to that we must trust ourselvesmaster wildrake you will go with my lord chancellor who will bring us a report of your tidings meantime i assure you that you shall be no loser for being the first messenger of good news so saying he gave a signal to the chancellor to take away wildrake whom he judged in his present humour to be not unlikely to communicate some former passages at woodstock which might rather entertain than edify the wits of his court  corroboration of the joyful intelligence soon arrived and wildrake was presented with a handsome gratuity and small pension which by the kings special desire had no duty whatever attached to it  shortly afterwards all england was engaged in chorusing his favourite ditty    oh the twentyninth of may   it was a glorious day   when the king did enjoy his own again  on that memorable day the king prepared to make his progress from rochester to london with a reception on the part of his subjects so unanimously cordial as made him say gaily it must have been his own fault to stay so long away from a country where his arrival gave so much joy on horseback betwixt his brothers the dukes of york and gloucester the restored monarch trode slowly over roads strewn with flowersby conduits running wine under triumphal arches and through streets hung with tapestry there were citizens in various bands some arrayed in coats of black velvet with gold chains some in military suits of cloth of gold or cloth of silver followed by all those craftsmen who having hooted the father from whitehall had now come to shout the son into possession of his ancestral place on his progress through blackheath he passed that army which so long formidable to england herself as well as to europe had been the means of restoring the monarchy which their own hands had destroyed as the king passed the last files of this formidable host he came to an open part of the heath where many persons of quality with others of inferior rank had stationed themselves to gratulate him as he passed towards the capital  there was one group however which attracted peculiar attention from those around on account of the respect shown to the party by the soldiers who kept the ground and who whether cavaliers or roundheads seemed to contest emulously which should contribute most to their accommodation for both the elder and younger gentlemen of the party had been distinguished in the civil war  it was a family group of which the principal figure was an old man seated in a chair having a complacent smile on his face and a tear swelling to his eye as he saw the banners wave on in interminable succession and heard the multitude shouting the long silenced acclamation god save king charles his cheek was ashy pale and his long beard bleached like the thistle down his blue eye was cloudless yet it was obvious that its vision was failing his motions were feeble and he spoke little except when he answered the prattle of his grandchildren or asked a question of his daughter who sate beside him matured in matronly beauty or of colonel everard who stood behind there too the stout yeoman joceline joliffe still in his silvan dress leaned like a second benaiah on the quarterstaff that had done the king good service in its day and his wife a buxom matron as she had been a pretty maiden laughed at her own consequence and ever and anon joined her shrill notes to the stentorian halloo which her husband added to the general acclamation  these fine boys and two pretty girls prattled around their grandfather who made them such answers as suited their age and repeatedly passed his withered hand over the fair locks of the little darlings while alice assisted by wildrake blazing in a splendid dress and his eyes washed with only a single cup of canary took off the childrens attention from time to time lest they should weary their grandfather we must not omit one other remarkable figure in the groupa gigantic dog which bore the signs of being at the extremity of canine life being perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old but though exhibiting the ruin only of his former appearance his eyes dim his joints stiff his head slouched down and his gallant carriage and graceful motions exchanged for a stiff rheumatic hobbling gait the noble hound had lost none of his instinctive fondness for his master to lie by sir henrys feet in the summer or by the fire in winter to raise his head to look on him to lick his withered hand or his shrivelled cheek from time to time seemed now all that bevis lived for  three or four livery servants attended to protect this group from the thronging multitude but it needed not the high respectability and unpretending simplicity of their appearance gave them even in the eyes of the coarsest of the people an air of patriarchal dignity which commanded general regard and they sat upon the bank which they had chosen for their station by the wayside as undisturbed as if they had been in their own park  and now the distant clarions announced the royal presence onward came pursuivant and trumpetonward came plumes and cloth of gold and waving standards displayed and swords gleaming to the sun and at length heading a group of the noblest in england and supported by his royal brothers on either side onward came king charles he had already halted more than once in kindness perhaps as well as policy to exchange a word with persons whom he recognized among the spectators and the shouts of the bystanders applauded a courtesy which seemed so well timed but when he had gazed an instant on the party we have described it was impossible if even alice had been too much changed to be recognized not instantly to know bevis and his venerable master the monarch sprung from his horse and walked instantly up to the old knight amid thundering acclamations which rose from the multitudes around when they saw charles with his own hand oppose the feeble attempts of the old man to rise to do his homage gently replacing him on his seatbless he said fatherbless your son who has returned in safety as you blessed him when he departed in danger  may god blessand preservemuttered the old man overcome by his feelings and the king to give him a few moments repose turned to alice  and you he said my fair guide how have you been employed since our perilous nightwalk but i need not ask glancing aroundin the service of king and kingdom bringing up subjects as loyal as their ancestorsa fair lineage by my faith and a beautiful sight to the eye of an english kingcolonel everard we shall see you i trust at whitehall here he nodded to wildrake and thou joceline thou canst hold thy quarterstaff with one hand surethrust forward the other palm  looking down in sheer bashfulness joceline like a bull about to push extended to the king over his ladys shoulder a hand as broad and hard as a wooden trencher which the king filled with gold coins buy a handful for my friend phoebe with some of these said charles she too has been doing her duty to old england  the king then turned once more to the knight who seemed making an effort to speak he took his aged hand in both his own and stooped his head towards him to catch his accents while the old man detaining him with the other hand said something faltering of which charles could only catch the quotation    unthread the rude eye of rebellion   and welcome home again discarded faith  extricating himself therefore as gently as possible from a scene which began to grow painfully embarrassing the goodnatured king said speaking with unusual distinctness to insure the old mans comprehending him this is something too public a place for all we have to say but if you come not soon to see king charles at whitehall he will send down louis kerneguy to visit you that you may see how rational that mischievous lad is become since his travels  so saying he once more pressed affectionately the old mans hand bowed to alice and all around and withdrew sir henry lee listening with a smile which showed he comprehended the gracious tendency of what had been said the old man leaned back on his seat and muttered the nunc dimittas  excuse me for having made you wait my lords said the king as he mounted his horse indeed had it not been for these good folks you might have waited for me long enough to little purposemove on sirs  the array moved on accordingly the sound of trumpets and drums again rose amid the acclamations which had been silent while the king stopped while the effect of the whole procession resuming its motion was so splendidly dazzling that even alices anxiety about for her fathers health was for a moment suspended while her eye followed the long line of varied brilliancy that proceeded over the heath when she looked again at sir henry she was startled to see that his cheek which had gained some colour during his conversation with the king had relapsed into earthly paleness that his eyes were closed and opened not again and that his features expressed amid their quietude a rigidity which is not that of sleep they ran to his assistance but it was too late the light that burned so low in the socket had leaped up and expired in one exhilarating flash  the rest must be conceived i have only to add that his faithful dog did not survive him many days and that the image of bevis lies carved at his masters feet on the tomb which was erected to the memory of sir henry lee of ditchley  footnote it may interest some readers to know that bevis the gallant hound one of the handsomest and active of the ancient highland deerhounds had his prototype in a dog called maida the gift of the late chief of glengarry to the author a beautiful sketch was made by edwin landseer and afterwards engraved i cannot suppress the avowal of some personal vanity when i mention that a friend going through munich picked up a common snuffbox such as are sold for one franc on which was displayed the form of this veteran favourite simply marked as
