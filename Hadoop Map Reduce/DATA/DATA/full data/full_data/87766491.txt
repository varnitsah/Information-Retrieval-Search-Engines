87766491	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                          monsieur du miroir    than the gentleman above named there is nobody in the whole circle of my acquaintance whom i have more attentively studied yet of whom i have less real knowledge beneath the surface which it pleases him to present  being anxious to discover who and what he really is and how connected with me and what are to be the results to him and to myself of the joint interest which without any choice on my part seems to be permanently established between us and incited furthermore by the propensities of a student of human nature though doubtful whether monsieur du miroir have aught of humanity but the figurei have determined to place a few of his remarkable points before the public hoping to be favored with some clew to the explanation of his character  nor let the reader condemn any part of the narrative as frivolous since a subject of such grave reflection diffuses its importance through the minutest particulars and there is no judging beforehand what odd little circumstance may do the office of a blind mans dog among the perplexities of this dark investigation and however extraordinary marvellous preternatural and utterly incredible some of the meditated disclosures may appear i pledge my honor to maintain as sacred a regard to fact as if my testimony were given on oath and involved the dearest interests of the personage in question  not that there is matter for a criminal accusation against monsieur du miroir nor am i the man to bring it forward if there were  the chief that i complain of is his impenetrable mystery which is no better than nonsense if it conceal anything good and much worse in the contrary case  but if undue partialities could be supposed to influence me monsieur du miroir might hope to profit rather than to suffer by them for in the whole of our long intercourse we have seldom had the slightest disagreement and moreover there are reasons for supposing him a near relative of mine and consequently entitled to the best word that i can give him  he bears indisputably a strong personal resemblance to myself and generally puts on mourning at the funerals of the family  on the other hand his name would indicate a french descent in which case infinitely preferring that my blood should flow from a bold british and pure puritan source i beg leave to disclaim all kindred with monsieur du miroir  some genealogists trace his origin to spain and dub him a knight of the order of the caballeros de los espejoz one of whom was overthrown by don quixote  but what says monsieur du miroir himself of his paternity and his fatherland  not a word did he ever say about the matter and herein perhaps lies one of his most especial reasons for maintaining such a vexatious mystery that he lacks the faculty of speech to expound it  his lips are sometimes seen to move his eyes and countenance are alive with shifting expression as if corresponding by visible hieroglyphics to his modulated breath and anon he will seem to pause with as satisfied an air as if he had been talking excellent sense  good sense or bad monsieur du miroir is the sole judge of his own conversational powers never having whispered so much as a syllable that reached the ears of any other auditor  is he really dumb or is all the world deaf or is it merely a piece of my friends waggery meant for nothing but to make fools of us  if so he has the joke all to himself  this dumb devil which possesses monsieur do miroir is i am persuaded the sole reason that he does not make me the most flattering protestations of friendship  in many particularsindeed as to all his cognizable and not preternatural points except that once in a great while i speak a word or twothere exists the greatest apparent sympathy between us  such is his confidence in my taste that he goes astray from the general fashion and copies all his dresses after mine  i never try on a new garment without expecting to meet monsieur du miroir in one of the same pattern  he has duplicates of all my waistcoats and cravats shirtbosoms of precisely a similar plait and an old coat for private wear manufactured i suspect by a chinese tailor in exact imitation of a beloved old coat of mine with a facsimile stitch by stitch of a patch upon the elbow  in truth the singular and minute coincidences that occur both in the accidents of the passing day and the serious events of our lives remind me of those doubtful legends of lovers or twin children twins of fate who have lived enjoyed suffered and died in unison each faithfully repeating the last tremor of the others breath though separated by vast tracts of sea and land strange to say my incommodities belong equally to my companion though the burden is nowise alleviated by his participation  the other morning after a night of torment from the toothache i met monsieur du miroir with such a swollen anguish in his cheek that my own pangs were redoubled as were also his if i might judge by a fresh contortion of his visage  all the inequalities of my spirits are communicated to him causing the unfortunate monsieur du miroir to mope and scowl through a whole summers day or to laugh as long for no better reason than the gay or gloomy crotchets of my brain  once we were joint sufferers of a three months sickness and met like mutual ghosts in the first days of convalescence  whenever i have been in love monsieur du miroir has looked passionate and tender and never did my mistress discard me but this too susceptible gentleman grew lackadaisical  his temper also rises to blood heat fever heat or boilingwater beat according to the measure of any wrong which might seem to have fallen entirely on myself  i have sometimes been calmed down by the sight of my own inordinate wrath depicted on his frowning brow yet however prompt in taking up my quarrels i cannot call to mind that he ever struck a downright blow in my behalf nor in fact do i perceive that any real and tangible good has resulted from his constant interference in my affairs so that in my distrustful moods i am apt to suspect monsieur du miroirs sympathy to be mere outward show not a whit better nor worse than other peoples sympathy  nevertheless as mortal man must have something in the guise of sympathyand whether the true metal or merely copperwashed is of less momenti choose rather to content myself with monsieur du miroirs such as it is than to seek the sterling coin and perhaps miss even the counterfeit  in my age of vanities i have often seen him in the ballroom and might again were i to seek him there  we have encountered each other at the tremont theatre where however he took his seat neither in the dresscircle pit nor upper regions nor threw a single glance at the stage though the brightest star even fanny kemble herself might be culminating there  no this whimsical friend of mine chose to linger in the saloon near one of the large lookingglasses which throw back their pictures of the illuminated room  he is so full of these unaccountable eccentricities that i never like to notice monsieur du miroir nor to acknowledge the slightest connection with him in places of public resort  he however has no scruple about claiming my acquaintance even when his commonsense if he had any might teach him that i would as willingly exchange a nod with the old nick  it was but the other day that he got into a large brass kettle at the entrance of a hardwarestore and thrust his head the moment afterwards into a bright new warmingpan whence he gave me a most merciless look of recognition  he smiled and so did i but these childish tricks make decent people rather shy of monsieur du miroir and subject him to more dead cuts than any other gentleman in town  one of this singular persons most remarkable peculiarities is his fondness for water wherein he excels any temperance man whatever his pleasure it must be owned is not so much to drink it in which respect a very moderate quantity will answer his occasions as to souse himself over head and ears wherever he may meet with it perhaps he is a merman or born of a mermaids marriage with a mortal and thus amphibious by hereditary right like the children which the old river deities or nymphs of fountains gave to earthly love when no cleaner bathingplace happened to be at hand i have seen the foolish fellow in a horsepond  some times he refreshes himself in the trough of a townpump without caring what the people think about him often while carefully picking my way along the street after a heavy shower i have been scandalized to see monsieur du miroir in full dress paddling from one mudpuddle to another and plunging into the filthy depths of each  seldom have i peeped into a well without discerning this ridiculous gentleman at the bottom whence he gazes up as through a long telescopic tube and probably makes discoveries among the stars by daylight wandering along lonesome paths or in pathless forests when i have come to virgin fountains of which it would have been pleasant to deem myself the first discoverer i have started to find monsieur du miroir there before me  the solitude seemed lonelier for his presence  i have leaned from a precipice that frowns over lake george which the french call natures font of sacramental water and used it in their logchurches here and their cathedrals beyond the sea and seen him far below in that pure element  at niagara too where i would gladly have forgotten both myself and him i could not help observing my companion in the smooth water on the very verge of the cataract just above the table rock  were i to reach the sources of the nile i should expect to meet him there  unless he be another ladurlad whose garments the depth of ocean could not moisten it is difficult to conceive how he keeps himself in any decent pickle though i am bound to confess that his clothes seem always as dry and comfortable as my own  but as a friend i could wish that he would not so often expose himself in liquor  all that i have hitherto related may be classed among those little personal oddities which agreeably diversify the surface of society and though they may sometimes annoy us yet keep our daily intercourse fresher and livelier than if they were done away  by an occasional hint however i have endeavored to pave the way for stranger things to come which had they been disclosed at once monsieur du miroir might have been deemed a shadow and myself a person of no veracity and this truthful history a fabulous legend but now that the reader knows me worthy of his confidence i will begin to make him stare  to speak frankly then i could bring the most astounding proofs that monsieur du miroir is at least a conjurer if not one of that unearthly tribe with whom conjurers deal  he has inscrutable methods of conveying himself from place to place with the rapidity of the swiftest steamboat or railcar  brick walls and oaken doors and iron bolts are no impediment to his passage here in my chamber for instance as the evening deepens into night i sit alonethe key turned and withdrawn from the lock the keyhole stuffed with paper to keep out a peevish little blast of wind  yet lonely as i seem were i to lift one of the lamps and step five paces eastward monsieur du miroir would be sure to meet me with a lamp also in his hand and were i to take the stagecoach tomorrow without giving him the least hint of my design and post onward till the weeks end at whatever hotel i might find myself i should expect to share my private apartment with this inevitable monsieur du miroir  or out of a mere wayward fantasy were i to go by moonlight and stand beside the stone pout of the shaker spring at canterbury monsieur du miroir would set forth on the same fools errand and would not fail to meet me there  shall i heighten the readers wonder  while writing these latter sentences i happened to glance towards the large round globe of one off the brass andirons and lo a miniature apparition of monsieur du miroir with his face widened and grotesquely contorted as if he were making fun of my amazement but he has played so many of these jokes that they begin to lose their effect  once presumptuous that he was he stole into the heaven of a young ladys eyes so that while i gazed and was dreaming only of herself i found him also in my dream  years have so changed him since that he need never hope to enter those heavenly orbs again  from these veritable statements it will be readily concluded that had monsieur du miroir played such pranks in old witch times matters might have gone hard with him at least if the constable and posse comitatus could have executed a warrant or the jailer had been cunning enough to keep him  but it has often occurred to me as a very singular circumstance and as betokening either a temperament morbidly suspicious or some weighty cause of apprehension that he never trusts himself within the grasp even of his most intimate friend  if you step forward to meet him he readily advances if you offer him your hand he extends his own with an air of the utmost frankness but though you calculate upon a hearty shake you do not get hold of his little finger ah this monsieur du miroir is a slippery fellow  these truly are matters of special admiration  after vainly endeavoring by the strenuous exertion of my own wits to gain a satisfactory insight into the character of monsieur du miroir i had recourse to certain wise men and also to books of abstruse philosophy seeking who it was that haunted me and why  i heard long lectures and read huge volumes with little profit beyond the knowledge that many former instances are recorded in successive ages of similar connections between ordinary mortals and beings possessing the attributes of monsieur du miroir  some now alive perhaps besides myself have such attendants  would that monsieur du miroir could be persuaded to transfer his attachment to one of those and allow some other of his race to assume the situation that he now holds in regard to me  if i must needs have so intrusive an intimate who stares me in the face in my closest privacy and follows me even to my bedchamber i should preferscandal apartthe laughing bloom of a young girl to the dark and bearded gravity of my present companion  but such desires are never to be gratified  though the members of monsieur du miroirs family have been accused perhaps justly of visiting their friends often in splendid halls and seldom in darksome dungeons yet they exhibit a rare constancy to the objects of their first attachment however unlovely in person or unamiable in dispositionhowever unfortunate or even infamous and deserted by all the world besides  so will it be with my associate  our fates appear inseparably blended  it is my belief as i find him mingling with my earliest recollections that we came into existence together as my shadow follows me into the sunshine and that hereafter as heretofore the brightness or gloom of my fortunes will shine upon or darken the face of monsieur du miroir  as we have been young together and as it is now near the summer noon with both of us so if long life be granted shall each count his own wrinkles on the others brow and his white hairs on the others head  and when the coffinlid shall have closed over me and that face and form which more truly than the lover swears it to his beloved are the sole light of his existencewhen they shall be laid in that dark chamber whither his swift and secret footsteps cannot bring himthen what is to become of poor monsieur du miroir  will he have the fortitude with my other friends to take a last look at my pale countenance  will he walk foremost in the funeral train will he come often and haunt around my grave and weed away the nettles and plant flowers amid the verdure and scrape the moss out of the letters of my burialstone  will he linger where i have lived to remind the neglectful world of one who staked much to win a name but will not then care whether he lost or won  not thus will he prove his deep fidelity  o what terror if this friend of mine after our last farewell should step into the crowded street or roam along our old frequented path by the still waters or sit down in the domestic circle where our faces are most familiar and beloved  no but when the rays of heaven shall bless me no more nor the thoughtful lamplight gleam upon my studies nor the cheerful fireside gladden the meditative man then his task fulfilled shall this mysterious being vanish from the earth forever  he will pass to the dark realm of nothingness but will not find me there  there is something fearful in bearing such a relation to a creature so imperfectly known and in the idea that to a certain extent all which concerns myself will be reflected in its consequences upon him  when we feel that another is to share the selfsame fortune with ourselves we judge more severely of our prospects and withhold our confidence from that delusive magic which appears to shed an infallibility of happiness over our own pathway  of late years indeed there has been much to sadden my intercourse with monsieur de miroir  had not our union been a necessary condition of our life we must have been estranged ere now  in early youth when my affections were warm and free i loved him well and could always spend a pleasant hour in his society chiefly because it gave me an excellent opinion of myself  speechless as he was monsieur du miroir had then a most agreeable way of calling me a handsome fellow and i of course returned the compliment so that the more we kept each others company the greater coxcombs we mutually grew but neither of us need apprehend any such misfortune now  when we chance to meetfor it is chance oftener than designeach glances sadly at the others forehead dreading wrinkles there and at our temples whence the hair is thinning away too early and at the sunken eyes which no longer shed a gladsome light over the whole face  i involuntarily peruse him as a record of my heavy youth which has been wasted in sluggishness for lack of hope and impulse or equally thrown away in toil that had no wise motive and has accomplished no good end  i perceive that the tranquil gloom of a disappointed soul has darkened through his countenance where the blackness of the future seems to mingle with the shadows of the past giving him the aspect of a fated man  is it too wild a thought that my fate may have assumed this image of myself and therefore haunts me with such inevitable pertinacity originating every act which it appears to imitate while it deludes me by pretending to share the events of which it is merely the emblem and the prophecy  i must banish this idea or it will throw too deep an awe round my companion  at our next meeting especially if it be at midnight or in solitude i fear that i shall glance aside and shudder in which case as monsieur du miroir is extremely sensitive to illtreatment he also will avert his eyes and express horror or disgust  but no this is unworthy of me  as of old i sought his society for the bewitching dreams of womans love which he inspired and because i fancied a bright fortune in his aspect so now will i hold daily and long communion with hint for the sake of the stern lessons that he will teach my manhood  with folded arms we will sit face to face and lengthen out our silent converse till a wiser cheerfulness shall have been wrought from the very texture of despondency  he will say perhaps indignantly that it befits only him to mourn for the decay of outward grace which while he possessed it was his all  but have not you he will ask a treasure in reserve to which every year may add far more value than age or death itself can snatch from that miserable clay  he will tell me that though the bloom of life has been nipped with a frost yet the soul must not sit shivering in its cell but bestir itself manfully and kindle a genial warmth from its own exercise against the autumnal and the wintry atmosphere  and i in return will bid him be of good cheer nor take it amiss that i must blanch his locks and wrinkle him up like a wilted apple since it shall be my endeavor so to beautify his face with intellect and mild benevolence that he shall profit immensely by the change  but here a smile will glimmer somewhat sadly over monsieur du miroirs visage  when this subject shall have been sufficiently discussed we may take up others as important  reflecting upon his power of following me to the remotest regions and into the deepest privacy i will compare the attempt to escape him to the hopeless race that men sometimes run with memory or their own hearts or their moral selves which though burdened with cares enough to crush an elephant will never be one step behind  i will be selfcontemplative as nature bids me and make him the picture or visible type of what i muse upon that my mind may not wander so vaguely as heretofore chasing its own shadow through a chaos and catching only the monsters that abide there  then will we turn our thoughts to the spiritual world of the reality of which my companions shall furnish me an illustration if not an argument for as we have only the testimony of the eye to monsieur du miroirs existence while all the other senses would fail to inform us that such a figure stands within armslength wherefore should there not be beings innumerable close beside us and filling heaven and earth with their multitude yet of whom no corporeal perception can take cognizance  a blind man might as reasonably deny that monsieur du miroir exists as we because the creator has hitherto withheld the spiritual perception can therefore contend that there are no spirits  o there are  and at this moment when the subject of which i write has grown strong within me and surrounded itself with those solemn and awful associations which might have seemed most alien to it i could fancy that monsieur du miroir himself is a wanderer from the spiritual world with nothing human except his delusive garment of visibility methinks i should tremble now were his wizard power of gliding through all impediments in search of me to place him suddenly before my eyes  ha  what is yonder  shape of mystery did the tremor of my heartstrings vibrate to thine own and call thee from thy home among the dancers of the northern lights and shadows flung from departed sunshine and giant spectres that appear on clouds at daybreak and affright the climber of the alps  in truth it startled me as i threw a wary glance eastward across the chamber to discern an unbidden guest with his eyes bent on mine the identical monsieur du miroir  still there he sits and returns my gaze with as much of awe and curiosity as if he too had spent a solitary evening in fantastic musings and made me his theme  so inimitably does he counterfeit that i could almost doubt which of us is the visionary form or whether each be not the others mystery and both twin brethren of one fate in mutually reflected spheres  o friend canst thou not hear and answer me  break down the barrier between us  grasp my hand speak  listen  a few words perhaps might satisfy the feverish yearning of my soul for some masterthought that should guide me through this labyrinth of life teaching wherefore i was born and how to do my task on earth and what is death  alas  even that unreal image should forget to ape me and smile at these vain questions  thus do mortals deify as it were a mere shadow of themselves a spectre of human reason and ask of that to unveil the mysteries which divine intelligence has revealed so far as needful to our guidance and hid the rest  farewell monsieur du miroir  of you perhaps as of many men it may be doubted whether you are the wiser though your whole business is reflection
