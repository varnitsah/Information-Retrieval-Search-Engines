of rudder grange to her former mistress euphemia may require a few words of introduction those who have not read the adventures and experiences of pomona in rudder grange should be told that she first appeared in that story as a very young and illiterate girl fond of sensational romances and with some outoftheway ideas in regard to domestic economy and the conventions of society this romantic orphan took service in the rudder grange family and as the story progressed she grew up into a very estimable young woman and finally married jonas the son of a welltodo farmer even after she came into possession of a husband and a daughter pomona did not lose her affection for her former employers  about a year before the beginning of the travels described in these letters jonass father died and left a comfortable little property which placed pomona and her husband in independent circumstances the ideas and ambitions of this eccentric but sensible young woman enlarged with her fortune as her daughter was now going to school pomona was seized with the spirit of emulation and determined as far as was possible to make the childs education an advantage to herself some of the books used by the little girl at school were carefully and earnestly studied by her mother and as jonas joined with hearty goodwill in the labors and pleasures of this system of domestic study the family standard of education was considerably raised in the quickwitted and observant pomona the improvement showed itself principally in her methods of expression and although she could not be called at the time of these travels an educated woman she was by no means an ignorant one  when the daughter was old enough she was allowed to accept an invitation from her grandmother to spend the summer in the country and pomona determined that it was the duty of herself and husband to avail themselves of this opportunity for foreign travel  accordingly one fine spring morning pomona still a young woman and jonas not many years older but imbued with a semipathetic complaisance beyond his years embarked for england and scotland to which countries it was determined to limit their travels the letters which follow were written in consequence of the earnest desire of euphemia to have a full account of the travels and foreign impressions of her former handmaiden pruned of dates addresses signatures and of many personal and friendly allusions these letters are here presented as pomona wrote them to euphemia     letter number one   illustration  london  the first thing jone said to me when i told him i was going to write about what i saw and heard was that i must be careful of two things in the first place i must not write a lot of stuff that everybody ought to be expected to know especially people who have travelled themselves and in the second place i must not send you my green opinions but must wait until they were seasoned so that i can see what they are good for before i send them  but if i do that said i i will get tired of them long before they are seasoned and they will be like a bundle of old sticks that i wouldnt offer to anybody jone laughed at that and said i might as well send them along green for after all i wasnt the kind of a person to keep things until they were seasoned to see if i liked them thats true said i theres a great many things such as husbands and apples that i like a good deal better fresh than dry is that all the advice youve got to give  for the present said he but i dare say i shall have a good deal more as we go along  all right said i but be careful you dont give me any of it green advice is like gooseberries thats got to be soft and ripe or else well cooked and sugared before theyre fit to take into anybodys stomach  jone was standing at the window of our sittingroom when i said this looking out into the street as soon as we got to london we took lodgings in a little street running out of the strand for we both want to be in the middle of things as long as we are in this conglomerate town as jone calls it he says and i think he is about right that it is made up of half a dozen large cities ten or twelve towns at least fifty villages more than a hundred little settlements or hamlets as they call them here and about a thousand country houses scattered along around the edges and over and above all these are the inhabitants of a large province which there being no province to put them into are crammed into all the cracks and crevices so as to fill up the town and pack it solid  when we was in london before with you and your husband madam and we lost my baby in kensington gardens we lived you know in a peaceful quiet street by a square or crescent where about half the inhabitants were pervaded with the solemnities of the past and the other half bowed down by the dolefulness of the present and no way of getting anywhere except by descending into a movable tomb which is what i always think of when we go anywhere in the underground railway but here we can walk to lots of things we want to see and if there was nothing else to keep us lively the fear of being run over would do it you may be sure  but after all jone and me didnt come here to london just to see the town we have ideas far ahead of that when we was in london before i saw pretty nearly all the sights for when ive got work like that to do i dont let the grass grow under my feet and what we want to do on this trip is to see the country part of england and scotland and in order to see english country life just as it is we both agreed that the best thing to do was to take a little house in the country and live there a while and ill say here that this is the only plan of the whole journey that jone gets real enthusiastic about for he is a domestic man as you well know and if anything swells his veins with fervent rapture it is the idea of living in some one place continuous even if it is only for a month  as we wanted a house in the country we came to london to get it for london is the place to get everything our landlady advised us when we told her what we wanted to try and get a vicarage in some little village because she said there are always lots of vicars who want to go away for a month in the summer and they cant do it unless they rent their houses while they are gone and in fact some of them she said got so little salary for the whole year and so much rent for their vicarages while they are gone that they often cant afford to stay in places unless they go away  so we answered some advertisements and there was no lack of them in the papers and three agents came to see us but we did not seem to have any luck each of them had a house to let which ought to have suited us according to their descriptions and although we found the prices a good deal higher than we expected jone said he wasnt going to be stopped by that because it was only for a little while and for the sake of experienceand experience as all the poets and a good many of the prose writers besides tell us is always dear but after the agents went away saying they would communicate with us in the morning we never heard anything more from them and we had to begin all over again there was something the matter jone and i both agreed on that but we didnt know what it was but i waked up in the night and thought about this thing for a whole hour and in the morning i had an idea  jone said i when we was eating breakfast its as plain as a b c that those agents dont want us for tenants and it isnt because they think we are not to be trusted for wed have to pay in advance and so their moneys safe it is something else and i think i know what it is these london men are very sharp and used to sizing and sorting all kinds of people as if they was potatoes being got ready for market and they have seen that we are not what they call over here gentlefolks  no lordly airs eh said jone  oh i dont mean that i answered him back lordly airs dont go into parsonages and i dont mean either that they see from our looks or manners that you used to drive horses and milk cows and work in the garden and that i used to cook and scrub and was maidofallwork on a canalboat but they do see that we are not the kind of people who are in the habit in this country at least of spending their evenings in the best parlors of vicarages  do you suppose said jone that they think a vicars kitchen would suit us better  no said i they wouldnt put us in a vicarage at all there wouldnt be no place there that would not be either too high or too low for us its my opinion that what they think we belong in is a lordly house where youd shine most as head butler or a steward while id be the housekeeper or a leading ladys maid  by george said jone getting up from the table if any of those fellows would favor me with an opinion like that id break his head  youd have a lot of heads to break said i if you went through this country asking for opinions on the subject its all very well for us to remember that weve got a house of our own as good as most rectors have over here and money enough to hire a minor canon if we needed one in the house but the people over here dont know that and it wouldnt make much difference if they did for it wouldnt matter how nice we lived or what we had so long as they knew we was retired servants  at this jone just blazed up and rammed his hands into his pockets and spread his feet wide upon the floor pomona said he i dont mind it in you but if anybody else was to call me a retired servant id  hold up jone said i dont waste good wholesome anger now i tell you madam it really did me good to see jone blaze up and get red in the face and i am sure that if hed get his blood boiling oftener it would be a good thing for his dyspeptic tendencies and what little malaria may be left in his system it wont do any good to flare up here i went on to say to him facts fact and we was servants and good ones too though i say it myself and the trouble is we havent got into the way of altogether forgetting it or at least acting as if we had forgotten it  jone sat down on a chair it might help matters a little he said if i knew what you was driving at  i mean just this said i as long as we are as anxious not to give trouble or as careful of peoples feelings as goodmannered to servants and as polite and goodnatured to everybody we have anything to do with as we both have been since we came here and as it is our nature to be i am proud to say were bound to be set down at least by the general run of people over here as belonging to the pick of the nobility and gentry or as wellbred servants its only those two classes that act as we do and anybody can see we are not special nobles and gents now if we want to be reckoned anywhere in between these two weve got to change our manners  will you kindly mention just how said jone  yes said i i will in the first place weve got to act as if we had always been waited on and had never been satisfied with the way it was done weve got to let people think that we think we are a good deal better than they are and what they think about it doesnt make the least difference and then again weve got to live in better quarters than these and whatever they may be we must make people think that we dont think they are quite good enough for us if we do all that agents may be willing to let us vicarages  it strikes me said jone that these quarters are good enough for us im comfortable and then he went on to say madam that when you and your husband was in london you was well satisfied with just such lodgings  thats all very well i said for they never moved in the lower paths of society and so they didnt have to make any change but just went along as they had been used to go but if we want to make people believe we belong to that class i should choose if i had my pick out of english social varieties weve got to bounce about as much above it as we were born below it so that we can strike somewhere near the proper average  and what variety would you pick out id like to know said jone just a little red in the face and looking as if i had told him he didnt know timothy hay from oat straw  well said i it is not easy to put it to you exactly but its a sort of a cross between a prosperous farmer without children and a poor country gentleman with two sons at college and one in the british army and no money to pay their debts with  that last is not to my liking said jone  but the farmer part of the cross would make it all right i said to him and it strikes me that a mixture like that would just suit us while we are staying over here now if you will try to think of yourself as part rich farmer and part poor gentleman ill consider myself the wife of the combination and i am sure we will get along better we didnt come over here to be looked upon as if we was the bottom of a pie dish and charged as if we was the upper crust im in favor of paying a little more money and getting a lot more respectfulness and the way to begin is to give up these lodgings and go to a hotel such as the upper middlers stop at from what ive heard the babylon hotel is the one for us while we are in london nobody will suspect that any of the people at that hotel are retired servants  illustration boy go order me a fourinhand  this hit jone hard as i knew it would and he jumped up made three steps across the room and rang the bell so that the people across the street must have heard it and up came the boy in green jacket and buttons with about every other button missing and i never knew him to come up so quick before  boy said jone to him as if he was hollering to a stubborn ox go order me a fourinhand  but this letter is so long i must stop for the present     letter number two   london  when jone gave the remarkable order mentioned in my last letter i did not correct him for i wouldnt do that before servants without giving him a chance to do it himself but before either of us could say another word the boy was gone  mercy on us i said what a stupid blunder you meant fourwheeler  illustration the landlady with an underdone visage  of course i did he said i was a little mad and got things mixed but i expect the fellow understood what i meant  you ought to have called a hansom any way i said for they are a lot more stylish to go to a hotel in than in a fourwheeler  if there was sixwheelers i would have ordered one said he i dont want anybody to have more wheels than we have  at this moment the landlady came into the room with a sarcastic glimmer on her underdone visage and says she i suppose you dont understand about the vehicles we have in london the fourinhand is what the quality and coach people use when as i looked at jone i saw his legs tremble and i know what that means if i was a wanderin dog and saw jones legs tremble the only thoughts that would fill my soul would be such as cluster around home sweet home jone was too much riled by the womans manner to be willing to let her think he had made a mistake and he stopped her short look here he said to her i dont ask you to come here to tell me anything about vehicles when i order any sort of a trap i want it when i heard jone say trap my soul lifted itself and i knew there was hope for us the stiffness melted right out of the landlady and she began to look soft and gummy  if you want to take a drive in a fourinhand coach sir she said theres two or three of them starts every morning from trafalgar square and its not too late now sir if you go over there immediate  go said jone throwing himself into a chair i said order one to come where i live that sort of vehicle comes to the door for its passengers  the woman looked at jone with a venerative uplifting of her eyebrows i cant say sir that a coach will come but ill send the boy they go to dorking and seven oaks and virginia water  i want to go to virginia water said jone as quick as lightning  now then said i when the woman had gone what are you going to do if the coach comes  go to virginia water in it said jone and when we come back we can go to the hotel i made a mistake but ive got to stand by it or be called a greenhorn  i was in hopes the fourinhand wouldnt come but in less than ten minutes there drove up to our door a fourhorse coach which not having half enough passengers was glad to come such a little ways to get some more there was a man in a high hat and red coat who was blowing a horn as the thing came around the corner and just as i was looking into the coach and thinking wed have it all to ourselves for there was nobody in it he put a ladder up against the top and says he touching his hat theres a seat for you madam right next the coachman and one just behind for the gentleman taint often that on a fine morning like this such seats as them is left vacant on account of a sudden case of croup in a baronets family  i looked at the ladder and i looked at that top front seat and i tell you madam i trembled in every pore but i remembered then that all the respectable seats was on top and the farther front the nobbier and as there was a young woman sitting already on the boxseat i made up my mind that if she could sit there i could and that i wasnt going to let jone or anybody else see that i was frightened by style and fashion though confronted by it so sudden and unexpected so up that ladder i went quick enough having had practice in haymows and sat myself down between the young woman and the coachman and when jone had tucked himself in behind me the horner blew his horn and away we went  illustration i looked at the ladder and at the top front seat  i tell you madam that boxseat was a queer box for me i felt as though i was sitting on the eaves of a roof with a herd of horses cavoorting under my feet i never had a birdseye view of horses before looking down on their squirming bodies with the coachman almost standing on his tiptoes driving them was so different from jones buggy and our tall gray horse which in general we look up to that for a good while i paid no attention to anything but the danger of falling out on top of them but having made sure that jone was holding on to my dress from behind i began to take an interest in the things around me  knowing as much as i thought i did about the bigness of london i found that morning that i never had any idea of what an everlasting town it is it is like a skein of tangled yarnthere doesnt seem to be any end to it going in this way from nelsons monument out into the country it was amazing to see how long it took to get there we would go out of the busy streets into a quiet rural neighborhood or what looked like it and the next thing we knew wed be in another whirl of omnibuses and cabs with people and shops everywhere and wed go on and through this and then come to another handsome village with country houses and the street would end in another busy town and so on until i began to think there was no real country at least in the direction we was going it is my opinion that if london was put on a pivot and spun round in the state of texas until it all flew apart it would spread all over the state and settle up the whole country  at last we did get away from the houses and began to roll along on the best made road i ever saw with a hedge on each side and the greenest grass in the fields and the most beautiful trees with the very trunks covered with green leaves and with white sheep and handsome cattle and pretty thatched cottages and everything in perfect order looking as if it had just been sprinkled and swept we had seen english country before but that was from the windows of a train and it was very different from this sort of thing where we went meandering along lanes for that is what the roads look like being so narrow  just as i was getting my whole soul full of this lovely ruralness down came a shower of rain without giving the least notice i gave a jump in my seat as i felt it on me and began to get ready to get down as soon as the coachman should stop for us all to get inside but he didnt stop but just drove along as if the sun was shining and the balmy breezes blowing and then i looked around and not a soul of the eight people on the top of that coach showed the least sign of expecting to get down and go inside they all sat there just as if nothing was happening and not one of them even mentioned the rain but i noticed that each of them had on a mackintosh or some kind of cape whereas jone and i never thought of taking anything in the way of waterproof or umbrellas as it was perfectly clear when we started  illustration down came a shower of rain  i looked around at jone but he sat there with his face as placid as a piece of cheese looking as if he had no more knowledge it was raining than the two englishmen on the seat next him seeing he wasnt going to let those men think he minded the rain any more than they did i determined that i wouldnt let the young woman who was sitting by me have any notion that i minded it and so i sat still with as cheerful a look as i could screw up gazing at the trees with as gladsome a countenance as anybody could have with water trickling down her nose her cheeks dripping and dewdrops on her very eyelashes while the dampness of her back was getting more and more perceptible as each second dragged itself along jone turned up the hood of my coat and so let down into the back of my neck what water had collected in it but i didnt say anything but set my teeth hard together and fixed my mind on columbia happy land and determined never to say anything about rain until some english person first mentioned it  but when one of the flowers on my hat leaned over the brim and exuded bloody drops on the front of my coat i began to weaken and to think that if there was nothing better to do i might get under one of the seats but just then the rain stopped and the sun shone it was so sudden that it startled me but not one of those english people mentioned that the rain had stopped and the sun was shining and so neither did jone or i we was feeling mighty moist and unhappy but we tried to smile as if we was plants in a greenhouse accustomed to being watered and feeling all the better for it  i cant write you all about the coach drive which was very delightful nor of that beautiful lake they call virginia water and which i know you have a picture of in your house they tell me it is artificial but as it was made more than a hundred years ago it might now be considered natural we dined at an inn and when we got back to town with two more showers on the way i said to jone that i thought wed better go straight to the babylon hotel which we intended to start out for although it was a long way round to go by virginia water and see about engaging a room and as jone agreed i asked the coachman if he would put us down there knowing that hed pass near it he agreed to this would be an advertisement for his coach  when we got on the street where the babylon hotel was he whipped up his horses so that they went almost on a run and the horner blew his horn until his eyes seemed bursting and with a grand sweep and a clank and a jingle we pulled up at the front of the big hotel out marched the head porter in a blue uniform and out ran two underporters with red coats and down jumped the horner and put up his ladder and jone and i got down after giving the coachman halfacrown and receiving from the passengers a combined gaze of differentialism which had been wholly wanting before the men in the red coats looked disappointed when they saw we had no baggage but the great doors was flung open and we went straight up to the clerks desk  when we was taken to look at rooms i remembered that there was always danger of jones tendency to thankful contentment getting the better of him and i took the matter in hand myself two rooms good enough for anybody was shown us but i was not going to take the first thing that was offered no matter what it was we settled the matter by getting a firstclass room with sofas and writingdesks and everything convenient for only a little more than we was charged for the other rooms and the next morning we went there  when we went back to our lodgings to pack up and i looked in the glass and saw what a smeary bedraggled state my hat and head was in from being rained on i said to jone i dont see how those people ever let such a person as me have a room at their hotel  it doesnt surprise me a bit said jone nobody but a very high and mighty person would have dared to go lording it about that hotel with her hat feathers and flowers all plastered down over her head most people can be uppish in good clothes but to look like a scarecrow and be uppish cant be expected except from the truly lofty  i hope you are right i said and i think he was  we hadnt been at the babylon hotel where we are now for more than two days when i said to jone that this sort of thing wasnt going to do he looked at me amazed what on earth is the matter now he said here is a room fit for a royal duke in a house with marble corridors and palace stairs and gorgeous smokingrooms and a postoffice and a diningroom pretty nigh big enough for a hall of congress with waiters enough to make two military companies and the bills of fare all in french if there is anything more you want pomona  stop there said i the last thing you mention is the rub its the diningroom its in that resplendent hall that weve got to give ourselves a social boom or be content to fold our hands and fade away forever  which i dont want to do yet said jone so speak out your trouble  illustration ask the waiter what the french words mean  the trouble this time is you said i and your awful meekness i never did see anybody anywhere as meek as you are in that diningroom a halfdrowned fly put into the sun to dry would be overbearing and supercilious compared to you when you sit down at one of those tables you look as if you was afraid of hurting the chair and when the waiter gives you the bill of fare you ask him what the french words mean and then he looks down on you as if he was a superior jove contemplating a hoptoad and he tells you that this one means beef and the other means potatoes and brings you the things that are easiest to get and you look as if you was thankful from the bottom of your heart that he is good enough to give you anything at all all the airs i put on are no good while you are so extra humble i tell him i dont want this french thingwhen i dont know what it isand he must bring me some of the otherwhich i never heard ofand when it comes i eat it no matter what it turns out to be and try to look as if i was used to it but generally had it better cooked but as i said before it is of no useyour humbleness is too much for me in a few days they will be bringing us cold victuals and recommending that we go outside somewhere and eat them as all the seats in the diningroom are wanted for other people  well said jone i must say i do feel a little overshadowed when i go into that diningroom and see those proud and haughty waiters some of them with silver chains and keys around their necks showing that they are lords of the winecellar and all of them with an air of lofty scorn for the poor beings who have to sit still and be waited on but ill try what i can do as far as i am able ill hold up my end of the social boom  you may think i break off my letters sudden madam like the instalments in a sensation weekly which stops short in the most harrowing parts so as to make certain the reader will buy the next number but when ive written as much as i think two foreign stamps will carryfor more than fivepence seems extravagant for a letteri generally stop     letter number three   illustration  london  at dinnertime the day when i had the conversation with jone mentioned in my last letter we was sitting in the diningroom at a little table in a far corner where wed never been before not being considered of any importance they put us sometimes in one place and sometimes in another instead of giving us regular seats as i noticed most of the other people had and i was looking around to see if anybody was ever coming to wait on us when suddenly i heard an awful noise  i have read about the rumblings of earthquakes and although i never heard any of them i have felt a shock and i can imagine the awfulness of the rumbling and i had a feeling as if the building was about to sway and swing as they do in earthquakes it wasnt all my imagining for i saw the people at the other tables near us jump and two waiters who was hurrying past stopped short as if they had been jerked up by a curb bit i turned to look at jone but he was sitting up straight in his chair as solemn and as steadfast as a gatepost and i thought to myself that if he hadnt heard anything he must have been struck deaf and i was just on the point of jumping up and shouting to him fly before the walls and roof come down upon us when that awful noise occurred again my blood stood frigid in my veins and as i started back i saw before me a waiter his face ashy pale and his knees bending beneath him some people near us were half getting up from their chairs and i pushed back and looked at jone again who had not moved except that his mouth was open then i knew what it was that i thought was an earthquakeit was jone giving an order to the waiter  illustration jone giving an order  i bit my lips and sat silent the people around kept on looking at us and the poor man who was receiving the shock stood trembling like a leaf when the volcanic disturbance so to speak was over the waiter bowed himself as if he had been a heathen in a temple and gasping yes sir immediate glided unevenly away he hadnt waited on us before and little thought when he was going to stride proudly pass our table what a doubleloaded vesuvius was sitting in jones chair i leaned over the table and said to jone that if he would stick to that we could rent a bishopric if we wanted to and i was so proud i could have patted him on the back well after that we had no more trouble about being waited on for that waiter of ours went about as if he had his neck bared for the fatal stroke and jone was holding the cimeter  the head waiter came to us before we was done dinner and asked if we had everything we wanted and if that table suited us because if it did we could always have it to which jone distantly thundered that if he would see that it always had a clean tablecloth it would do well enough  illustration the carver  even the man who stood at the big table in the middle of the room and carved the cold meats with his hair parted in the middle and who looked as if he were saying to himself as with a bland dexterity and tastefulness he laid each slice upon its plate now then the socialistic movement in paris is arrested for the time being and here again i put an end to the hopes of russia getting to the sea through afghanistan and now i carefully spread contentment over the minds of all them riotous welsh miners even he turned around and bowed to us as we passed him and once sent a waiter to ask if wed like a little bit of potted beef which was particularly good that day  jone kept up his rumblings though they sounded more distant and more deep under ground and one day at luncheon an elderly woman who was sitting alone at a table near us turned to me and spoke she was a very plain person with her face all seamed and rough with exposure to the weather like as if she had been captain to a pilot boat and with a general appearance of being a cook with good recommendations but at present out of a place i might have wondered at such a person being at such a hotel but remembering what i had been myself i couldnt say what mightnt happen to other people  im glad to see said she that you sent away that mutton for if more persons would object to things that are not properly cooked wed all be better served i suppose that in your country most people are so rich that they can afford to have the best of everything and have it always i fancy the great wealth of american citizens must make their housekeeping very different from ours  now i must say i began to bristle at being spoken to like that im as proud of being an american as anybody can be but i dont like the home of the free thrown into my teeth every time i open my mouth theres no knowing what money jone and i have lost through giving orders to london cabmen in what is called our american accent the minute we tell the driver of a hansom where we want to go that place doubles its distance from the spot we start from now i think the great reason jones rumbling worked so well was that it had in it a sort of great british chestsound as if his lungs was rusty the waiter had heard that before and knew what it meant if he had spoken out in the clear american fashion i expect his voice would have gone clear through the waiter without his knowing it like the person in the story whose neck was sliced through and who didnt know it until he sneezed and his head fell off  yes maam said i answering her with as much of a wearied feeling as i could put on our wealth is all very well in some ways but it is dreadful wearing on us however we try to bear up under it and be content  well said she contentment is a great blessing in every station though i have never tried it in yours do you expect to make a long stay in london  as she seemed like a civil and wellmeaning woman and was the first person who had spoken to us in a social way i didnt mind talking to her and i told her we was only stopping in london until we could find the kind of country house we wanted and when she asked what kind that was i described what we wanted and how we was still answering advertisements and going to see agents who was always recommending exactly the kind of house we did not care for  vicarages are all very well said she but it sometimes happens and has happened to friends of mine that when a vicar has let his house he makes up his mind not to waste his money in travelling and he takes lodgings near by and keeps an eternal eye upon his tenants i dont believe any independent american would fancy that  no indeed said i and then she went on to say that if we wanted a small country house for a month or two she knew of one which she believed would suit us and it wasnt a vicarage either when i asked her to tell me about it she brought her chair up to our table together with her mug of beer her bread and cheese and she went into particulars about the house she knew of  it is situated said she in the west of england in the most beautiful part of our country it is near one of the quaintest little villages that the past ages have left us and not far away are the beautiful waters of the bristol channel with the mountains of wales rising against the sky on the horizon and all about are hills and valleys and woods and beautiful moors and babbling streams with all the loveliness of cultivated rurality merging into the wild beauties of unadorned nature if these was not exactly her words they express the ideas she roused in my mind she said the place was far enough away from railways and the stream of travel and among the simple peasantry and that in the society of the resident gentry we would see english country life as it is uncontaminated by the tourist or the commercial traveller  i cant remember all the things she said about this charming cottage in this most supremely beautiful spot but i sat and listened and the description held me spellbound as a snake fascinates a frog with this difference instead of being swallowed by the description i swallowed it  when the old woman had given us the address of the person who had the letting of the cottage and jone and me had gone to our room i said to him before we had time to sit down  what do you think  i think said he that we ought to follow that old womans advice and go and look at this house  go and look at it i exclaimed not a bit of it if we do that we are bound to see something or hear something that will make us hesitate and consider and if we do that away goes our enthusiasm and our rapture i say telegraph this minute and say well take the house and send a letter by the next mail with a postal order in it to secure the place  jone looked at me hard and said hed feel easier in his mind if he understood what i was talking about  never mind understanding i said go down and telegraph well take the house there isnt a minute to lose  but said jone if we find out when we get there  never mind that said i if we find out when we get there it isnt all we thought it was and were bound to do that well make the best of what doesnt suit us because it cant be helped but if we go and look at it its ten to one we wont take it  how long are we to take it for said jone  a month anyway and perhaps longer i told him giving him a push toward the door  all right said he and he went and telegraphed i believe if jone was told he could go anywhere and stay for a month hed choose that place from among all the most enchanting spots on the earth where he couldnt stay so long as for me the one thing that held me was the romanticness of the place from what the old woman said i knew there couldnt be any mistake about that and if i could find myself the mistress of a romantic cottage near an ancient village of the olden time i would put up with most everything except dirt and as dirt and me seldom keeps company very long even that cant frighten me  when i saw the old woman at luncheon the next day and told her what we had done she was fairly dumfounded  really really she said you americans are the speediest people i ever did see why an english person would have taken a week to consider that place before taking it  and lost it ten to one said i  she shook her head  well said she i suppose its on account of your habits and you cant help it but its a poor way of doing business  illustration you americans are the speediest people  now i began to think from this that her conscience was beginning to trouble her for having given so fairylike a picture of the house and as i was afraid that she might think it her duty to bring up some disadvantages i changed the conversation and got away as soon as i could when we once get seated at our humble board in our rural cot i wont be afraid of any bugaboos but i didnt want them brought up then i can generally depend upon jone but sometimes he gets a little stubborn  we didnt see this old person any more and when i asked the waiter about her the next day he said he was sure she had left the hotel by which i suppose he must have meant hed got his halfcrown her fading away in this fashion made it all seem like a myth or a phantasm but when the next morning we got a receipt for the money jone sent and a note saying the house was ready for our reception i felt myself on solid ground again and tomorrow we start bag and baggage for chedcombe which is the name of the village where the house is that we have taken ill write to you madam as soon as we get there and i hope with all my heart and soul that when we see whats wrong with itand theres bound to be somethingthat it may not be anything bad enough to make us give it up and go floating off in voidness like a spiderweb blown before a summer breeze without knowing what its going to run against and stick to and what is more probably lose the money we paid in advance     letter number four   chedcombe somersetshire  last winter jone and i read all the books we could get about the rural parts of england and we knew that the country must be very beautiful but we had no proper idea of it until we came to chedcombe i am not going to write much about the scenery in this part of the country because perhaps you have been here and seen it and anyway my writing would not be half so good as what you could read in books which dont amount to anything  all ill say is that if you was to go over the whole of england and collect a lot of smooth green hills with sheep and deer wandering about on them brooks with great trees hanging over them and vines and flowers fairly crowding themselves into the water lanes and roads hedged in with hawthorn wild roses and tall purple foxgloves little woods and copses hills covered with heather thatched cottages like the pictures in drawingbooks with roses against their walls and thin blue smoke curling up from the chimneys distant views of the sparkling sea villages which are nearly covered up by greenness except their steeples rocky cliffs all green with vines and flowers spreading and thriving with the fervor and earnestness you might expect to find in the tropics but not hereand then if you was to put all these points of scenery into one place not too big for your eye to sweep over and take it all in you would have a country like that around chedcombe  i am sure the old lady was right when she said it was the most beautiful part of england the first day we was here we carried an umbrella as we walked through all this verdant loveliness but yesterday morning we went to the village and bought a couple of thin mackintoshes which will save us a lot of trouble opening and shutting umbrellas  when we got out at the chedcombe station we found a man there with a little carriage he called a fly who said he had been sent to take us to our house there was also a van to carry our baggage we drove entirely through the village which looked to me as if a bit of the middle ages had been turned up by the plough and on the other edge of it there was our house and on the doorstep stood a lady with a smiling eye and an umbrella and who turned out to be our landlady back of her was two other females one of them looking like a ministers wife while the other one i knew to be a servantmaid by her cap  illustration that was our house  the lady whose name was mrs shutterfield shook hands with us and seemed very glad to see us and the ministers wife took our hand bags from us and told the men where to carry our trunks mrs shutterfield took us into a little parlor on one side of the hall and then we three sat down and i must say i was so busy looking at the queer delightful room with everything in itchairs tables carpets walls pictures and flowervasesall belonging to a bygone epoch though perfectly fresh as if just made that i could scarcely pay attention to what the lady said but i listened enough to know that mrs shutterfield told us that she had taken the liberty of engaging for us two most excellent servants who had lived in the house before it had been let to lodgers and who she was quite sure would suit us very well though of course we were at liberty to do what we pleased about engaging them the one that i took for the ministers wife was a combination of cook and housekeeper by the name of miss pondar and the other was a maid in general named hannah when the lady mentioned two servants it took me a little aback for we had not expected to have more than one but when she mentioned the wages and i found that both put together did not cost as much as a very poor cook would expect in america and when i remembered we as now at work socially booming ourselves and that it wouldnt do to let this lady think that we had not been accustomed to varieties of servants i spoke up and said we would engage the two estimable women she recommended and was much obliged to her for getting them  then we went over that house down stairs and up and of all the lavendersmelling oldfashionedness anybody ever dreamed of this little house has as much as it can hold it is fitted up all through like one of your mothers bonnets which she bought before she was married and never wore on account of a funeral in the family but kept shut up in a box which she only opens now and then to show to her descendants in every room and on the stairs there was a general air of antiquated freshness mingled with the odors of english breakfast tea and recollections of the story of cranford which if jone and me had been alone would have made me dance from the garret of that house to the cellar every sentiment of romance that i had in my soul bubbled to the surface and i felt as if i was one of my ancestors before she emigrated to the colonies i could not say what i thought but i pinched jones arm whenever i could get a chance which relieved me a little and when miss pondar had come to me with a little courtesy and asked me what time i would like to have dinner and told me what she had taken the liberty of ordering so as to have everything ready by the time i came and mrs shutterfield had gone after begging to know what more she could do for us and we had gone to our own room i let out my feelings in one wild scream of delirious gladness that would have been heard all the way to the railroad station if i had not covered my head with two pillows and the corner of a blanket  after we had dinner which was as english as the british lion and much more to our taste than anything we had had in london jone went out to smoke a pipe and i had a talk with miss pondar about fish meat and groceries and about housekeeping matters in general miss pondar whose general aspect of ministers wife began to wear off when i talked to her mingles respectfulness and respectability in a manner i havent been in the habit of seeing generally those two things run against each other but they dont in her  when she asked what kind of wine we preferred i must say i was struck all in a heap for wines to jone and me is like a trackless wilderness without compass or binnacle light and we seldom drink them except made hot with nutmeg grated in for colic but as i wanted her to understand that if there was any luxuries we didnt order it was because we didnt approve of them i told her that we was total abstainers and at that she smiled very pleasant and said that was her persuasion also and that she was glad not to be obliged to handle intoxicating drinks though of course she always did it without objection when the family used them when i told jone this he looked a little blank for foreign water generally doesnt agree with him i mentioned this afterwards to miss pondar and she said it was very common in total abstaining families when water didnt agree with any one of them especially if it happened to be the gentleman to take a little good scotch whiskey with it but when i told this to jone he said he would try to bear up under the shackles of abstinence  this morning when i was talking with miss pondar about fish and trying to show her that i knew something about the names of english fishes i said that we was very fond of whitebait at this she looked astonished for the first time  whitebait said she we always looked upon that as belonging entirely to the nobility and gentry at this my back began to bristle but i didnt let her know it and i said in a tone of emphatic mildness that we would have whitebait twice a week on tuesday and friday at this miss pondar gave a little courtesy and thanked me very much and said she would attend to it  when jone and me came back after taking a long walk that morning i saw a pair of church of england prayerbooks looking as if they had just been neatly dusted lying on the parlor table where they hadnt been before for i had carefully looked over every book i think that when it was borne in upon miss pondars soul that we was accustomed to having whitebait as a regular thing she made up her mind we was all right and that nothing but the established church would do for us before she might have thought we was wesleyans  our maid hannah is very nice to look at and does her work as well as anybody could do it and like most other english servants shes in a state of neverending thankfulness but as i can never understand a word she says except thank you very much i asked jone if he didnt think it would be a good thing for me to try to teach her a little english  now then said he thats the opening of a big subject wait until i fill my pipe and well discourse upon it it was just after luncheon and we was sitting in the summerhouse at the end of the garden looking out over the roses and pinks and all sorts of oldtimey flowers growing as thick as clover heads with an air as if it wasnt the least trouble in the world to them to flourish and blossom beyond the flowers was a little brook with the ducks swimming in it and beyond that was a field and on the other side of that field was a park belonging to the lord of the manor and scattered about the side of a green hill in the park was a herd of his lordships deer most of them was so lightcolored that i fancied i could almost see through them as if they was the little transparent bugs that crawl about on leaves that isnt a romantic idea to have about deers but i cant get rid of the notion whenever i see those little creatures walking about on the hills  at that time it was hardly raining at all just a little mist with the sun coming into the summerhouse every now and then making us feel very comfortable and contented  now said jone when he had got his pipe well started what i want to talk about is the amount of reformation we expect to do while were sojourning in the kingdom of great britain  reformation said i we didnt come here to reform anything  well said jone if were going to busy our minds with these peoples shortcomings and longgoings and dont try to reform them were just worrying ourselves and doing them no good and i dont think it will pay now for instance theres that rosycheeked hannah shes satisfied with her way of speaking english and miss pondar understands it and is satisfied with it and all the people around here are satisfied with it as for us we know when she comes and stands in the doorway and dimples up her cheeks and then makes those sounds that are more like drops of molasses falling on a gong than anything else i know of we know that she is telling us in her own way that the next meal whatever it is is ready and we go to it  yes said i and as i do most of my talking with miss pondar and as we shall be here for such a short time anyway it may be as well  what i say about hannah said jone interrupting me as soon as i began to speak about a short stay i have to say about everything else in england that doesnt suit us as long as hannah doesnt try to make us speak in her fashion i say let her alone of course we shall find a lot of things over here that we shall not approve ofwe knew that before we cameand when we find we cant stand their ways and manners any longer we can pack up and go home but so far as im concerned im getting along very comfortable so far  oh so am i i said to him and as to interfering with other peoples fashions i dont want to do it if i was to meet the most paganish of heathens entering his temple with suitable humbleness i wouldnt hurt his feelings on the subject of his religion unless i was a missionary and went about it systematic but if that heathen turned on me and jeered at me for attending our church at home and told me i ought to go down on my marrowbones before his brazen idols id whang him over the head with a fryingpan or anything else that came handy thats the sort of thing i cant stand as long as the people here dont snort and sniff at my ways i wont snort and sniff at theirs  well said jone that is a good rule but i dont know that its going to work altogether you see there are a good many people in this country and only two of us and it will be a lot harder for them to keep from sniffing and snorting than for us to do it so its my opinion that if we expect to get along in a goodhumored and friendly way which is the only decent way of living weve got to hold up our end of the business a little higher than we expect other people to hold up theirs  i couldnt agree altogether with jone about our trying to do better than other people but i said that as the british had been kind enough to make their country free to us we wouldnt look a gift horse in the mouth unless it kicked to which jone said i sometimes got my figures of speech hind part foremost but he knew what i meant  weve lived in our cottage two weeks and every morning when i get up and open our windows which has little panes set in strips of lead and hinges on one side so that it works like a door and look out over the brook and the meadows and the thatched roofs and see the peasant men with their short jackets and woollen caps and the lower part of their trousers tied round with twine if they dont happen to have leather leggings trudging to their work my soul is filled with welling emotions as i think that if queen elizabeth ever travelled along this way she must have seen these great old trees and perhaps some of these very houses and as to the people they must have been pretty much the same though differing a little in clothes i dare say but judging from hannah perhaps not very much in the kind of english they spoke  i declare that when jone and me walk about through the village and over the fields for there is a right of waymeaning a little paththrough most all of them and when we go into the old church with its yewtrees and its gravestones and its marble effigies of two of the old manor lords both stretched flat on their backs as large as life the gentleman with the end of his nose knocked off and with his feet crossed to show he was a crusader and the lady with her hands clasped in front of her as if she expected the generations who came to gaze on her tomb to guess what she had inside of them i feel like a character in a novel  i have kept a great many of my joyful sentiments to myself because jone is too well contented as it is and there is a great deal yet to be seen in england sometimes we hire a dogcart and a black horse named punch from the inn in the village and we take long drives over roads that are almost as smooth as bowling alleys the country is very hilly and every time we get to the top of a hill we can see spread about us for miles and miles the beautiful hills and vales and lordly residences and cottages and steeple tops looking as though they had been stuck down here and there to show where villages had been planted     letter number five   illustration  chedcombe  this morning when jone was out taking a walk and i was talking to miss pondar and getting her to teach me how to make devonshire clotted cream which we have for every meal putting it on everything it will go on into everything it will go into and eating it by itself when there is nothing it will go on or into and trying to find out why it is that whitings are always brought on the table with their tails stuck through their throats as if they had committed suicide by cutting their jugular veins in this fashion i saw coming along the road to our cottage a pretty little dogcart with two ladies in it the horse they drove was a pony and the prettiest creature i ever saw being formed like a fullsized horse only very small and with as much fire and spirit and gracefulness as could be got into an animal sixteen hands high i heard afterward that he came from exmoor which is about twelve miles from here and produces ponies and deers of similar size and swiftness they stopped at the door and one of them got out and came in miss pondar told me she wished to see me and that she was mrs locky of the bordley arms in the village  the innkeepers wife said i to which miss pondar said it was and i went into the parlor mrs locky was a handsomelooking lady and wearing as stylish clothes as if she was a duchess and extremely polite and respectful  she said she would have asked mrs shutterfield to come with her and introduce her but that lady was away from home and so she had come by herself to ask me a very great favor  when i begged her to sit down and name it she went on to say there had come that morning to the inn a very large party in a coachandfour that was making a trip through the country and as they didnt travel on sunday they wanted to stay at the bordley arms until monday morning  now said she that puts me to a dreadful lot of trouble because i havent room to accommodate them all and even if i could get rooms for them somewhere else they dont want to be separated but there is one of the best rooms at the inn which is occupied by an elderly gentleman and if i could get that room i could put two double beds in it and so accommodate the whole party now knowing that you had a pleasant chamber here that you dont use i thought i would make bold to come and ask you if you would lodge mr poplington until monday  what sort of a person is this mr poplington and is he willing to come here  oh i havent asked him yet said she but he is so extremely goodnatured that i know he will be glad to come here he has often asked me who lived in this extremely picturesque cottage  you must have an answer now said i  oh yes said she for if you cannot do me this favor i must go somewhere else and where to go i dont know  now i had begun to think that the one thing we wanted in this little home of ours was company and that it was a great pity to have that nice bedroom on the second floor entirely wasted with nobody ever in it so as far as i was concerned i would be very glad to have some pleasant person in the house at least for a day or two and i didnt believe jone would object at any rate it would put a stop at least for a little while to his eternally saying how corinne our daughter would enjoy that room and how nice it would be if we was to take this house for the rest of the season and send for her now corinnes as happy as she can be at her grandmothers farm and her school will begin before were ready to come home and what is more we didnt come here to spend all our time in one place  illustration the young lady who keeps the bar  while i was thinking of these things i was looking out of the window at the lady in the dogcart who was holding the reins she was as pretty as a picture and wore a great straw hat with lovely flowers in it as i had to give an answer without waiting for jone to come home and i didnt expect him until luncheon time i concluded to be neighborly and said we would take the gentleman to oblige her even if the arrangement didnt suit him or us it wouldnt matter much for that little time at which mrs locky was very grateful indeed and said she would have mr poplingtons luggage sent around that afternoon and that he would come later  as she got up to go i said to her is that young lady out there one of the party who came with the coach and four  oh no said mrs locky she lives with me she is the young lady who keeps the bar  i expect i opened my mouth and eyes pretty wide for i was never so astonished a young lady like that keeping the bar but i didnt want mrs locky to know how much i was surprised and so i said nothing about it  when they had gone and i had stood looking after them for about a minute i remembered i hadnt asked whether mr poplington would want to take his meals here or whether he would go to the inn for them to be sure she only asked me to lodge him but as the inn is more than half a mile from here he may want to be boarded but this will have to be found out when he comes and when jone comes home it will have to be found out what he thinks about my taking a lodger while hes out taking a walk     letter number six   chedcombe somersetshire  when jone came home and i told him a gentleman was coming to live with us he thought at first i was joking and when he found out that i meant what i said he looked very blue and stood with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ground considering  hes not going to take his meals here is he  i dont think he expects that i said for mrs locky only spoke of lodging  oh well said jone looking as if his clouds was clearing off a little i dont suppose it will matter to us if that room is occupied over sunday but i think the next time i go out for a stroll ill take you with me  i didnt go out that afternoon and sat on pins and needles until halfpast five oclock jone wanted me to walk with him but i wouldnt do it because i didnt want our lodger to come here and be received by miss pondar at halfpast five there came a cart with the gentlemans luggage as they call it here and i was glad jone wasnt at home there was an enormous leather portmanteau which looked as if it had been dragged by a boy too short to lift it from the ground half over the world a hatbox also of leather but not so draggy looking a bundle of canes and umbrellas a leather dressingcase and a flat round bathingtub i had the things taken up to the room as quickly as i could for if jone had seen them hed think the gentleman was going to bring his family with him  it was nine oclock and still broad daylight when mr poplington himself came carrying a fishingrod put up in parts in a canvas bag a fishbasket and a small valise he wore leather leggings and was about sixty years old but a wonderful good walker i thought when i saw him coming that he had no rheumatism whatever but i found out afterward that he had a little in one of his arms he had white hair and white sidewhiskers and a fine red face which made me think of a strawberry partly covered with devonshire clotted cream jone and i was sitting in the summerhouse he smoking his pipe and we both went to meet the gentleman he had a bluff way of speaking and said he was much obliged to us for taking him in and after saying that it was a warm evening a thing which i hadnt noticed he asked to be shown to his room i sent hannah with him and then jone and i went back to the summerhouse  i didnt know exactly why but i wasnt in as good spirits as i had been and when jone spoke he didnt make me feel any better  illustration i see signs of weakening in the social boom  it seems to me said he that i see signs of weakening in the social boom that man considers us exactly as we considered our lodginghouse keeper in london now it doesnt strike me that that sample person you was talking about who is a cross between a rich farmer and a poor gentleman would go into the lodginghouse business i couldnt help agreeing with jone and i didnt like it a bit the gentleman hadnt said anything or done anything that was out of the way but there was a benignant loftiness about him which grated on the inmost fibres of my soul  ill tell you what well do said i turning sharp on jone we wont charge him a cent thatll take him down and show him what we are well give him the room as a favor to mrs locky considering her in the light of a neighbor and one who sent us a cucumber  all right said jone i like that way of arranging the business up goes the social boom again  just as we was going up to bed miss pondar came to me and said that the gentleman had called down to her and asked if he could have a newlaid egg for his breakfast and she asked if she should send hannah early in the morning to see if she could get a perfectly fresh egg from one of the cottages i thought maam that perhaps you might object to buying things on sunday  i do i said does that mr poplington expect to have his breakfast here i only took him to lodge  oh maam said miss pondar they always takes their breakfasts where they has their rooms dinner and luncheon is different and he may expect to go to the inn for them  indeed said i i think he may and if he breakfasts here he can take what weve got if the eggs are not fresh enough for him he can try to get along with some bacon he cant expect that to be fresh  knowing that english people take their breakfast late jone and i got up early so as to get through before our lodger came down but bless me when we went to the front door to see what sort of a day it was we saw him coming in from a walk fine morning said he and in fact there was only a little drizzle of rain which might stop when the sun got higher and he stood near us and began to talk about the trout in the stream which to my utter amazement he called a river  do you take your license by the day or week he said to jone  license said jone i dont fish  really exclaimed mr poplington oh i see you are a cycler  no said jone im not that either im a pervader  really said the old gentleman what do you mean by that  i mean that i pervade the scenery sometimes on foot and sometimes in a trap thats my style of rural pleasuring  but you do fish at home i said to jone not wishing the english gentleman to think my husband was a city man who didnt know anything about sport  oh yes said jone i used to fish for perch and sunfish  sunfish said mr poplington i dont know that fish at all what sort of a fly do you use  i dont fish with any flies at all said jone i bait my hook with worms  mr poplingtons face looked as if he had poured liquid shoeblacking on his meat thinking it was worcestershire sauce fancy worms id never take a rod in my hands if i had to use worms never used a worm in my life theres no sort of science in worm fishing  theres double sport said jone for first youve got to catch your worm then again i hate shams if you have to catch fish theres no use cheating them into the bargain  cheat cried mr poplington if i had to catch a whale id fish for him with a fly but you americans are strange people worms indeed  we dont all use worms said jone theres lots of fly fishers in america and they use all sorts of flies if we are to believe all the californians tell us some of the artificial flies out there must be as big as crows  really said mr poplington looking hard at jone with a little twinkling in his eyes and when gentlemen fish who dont like to cheat the fishes what size of worms do they use  well said jone in the far west ive heard that the common black snake is the favorite bait hes six or seven feet long and fishermen that use him dont have to have any line hes bait and line all in one  mr poplington laughed i see you are fond of a joke said he and so am i but im also fond of my breakfast  im with you there said jone and we all went in  mr poplington was very pleasant and chatty and of course asked a great many questions about america nearly all english people ive met want to talk about our country and it seems to me that what they do know about it isnt any better considered as useful information than what they dont know but mr poplington has never been to america and so he knows more about us than those englishmen who come over to write books and only have time to run around the outside of things and get themselves tripped up on our ragged edges  he said he had met a good many americans and liked them but he couldnt see for the life of him why they do some things english people dont do and dont do things english people do do for instance he wondered why we dont drink tea for breakfast miss pondar had made it for him knowing hed want it and he wonders why americans drink coffee when such good tea as that was comes in their reach  now if i had considered mr poplington as a lodger it might have nettled me to have him tell me i didnt know what was good but remembering that we was giving him hospitality and not board and didnt intend to charge him a cent but was just taking care of him out of neighborly kindness i was rather glad to have him find a little fault because that would make me feel as if i was soaring still higher above him the next morning when i should tell him there was nothing to pay  so i took it all goodnatured and said to him well americans like to have the very best things that can be got out of every country were like bees flying over the whole world looking into every blossom to see what sweetness there is to be got out of it from the lily of france we sip their coffee from the national flower of india whatever it is we take their chutney sauce and as to those big apple tarts baked in a deep dish with a cup in the middle to hold up the upper crust and so full of apples and so delicious with devonshire clotted cream on them that if there was any one place in the world they could be had i believe my husband would want to go and live there forever they are what we extract from the rose of england  mr poplington laughed like anything at this but said there was a great many other things that he could show us and tell us about which would be very well worth while sipping from the rose of england  after breakfast he went to church with us and as we was coming homefor he didnt seem to have the least idea of going to the inn for his luncheonhe asked if we didnt find the services very different from those in america  yes said i they are about as different from quaker services as a squirting fountain is from a corked bottle the methodists and unitarians and reformed dutch and campbellites and hardshell baptists have different services too but in the episcopal churches things are all pretty much the same as they did this morning you forget sir that in our country there are religions to suit all sizes of minds we havent any national religion any more than we have a national flower  but you ought to have said he you ought to have an established church  you may be sure well have it said jone as soon as we agree as to which one it ought to be     letter number seven   chedcombe somersetshire  last sunday afternoon mr poplington asked us if we would not like to walk over to a ruined abbey about four miles away which he said was very interesting it seemed to me that four miles there and four miles back was a pretty long walk but i wanted to see the abbey and i wasnt going to let him think that a young american woman couldnt walk as far as an elderly english gentleman so i agreed and so did jone the abbey is a wonderful place and i never thought of being tired while wandering in the rooms and in the garden where the old monks used to live and preach and give food to the poor and keep house without womenwhich was pious enough but must have been untidy but the thing that surprised me the most was what mr poplington told us about the age of the place it was not built all at once and its part ancient and part modern and you neednt wonder madam that i was astonished when he said that the part called modern was finished just three years before america was discovered when i heard that i seemed to shrivel up as if my country was a newborn babe alongside of a bearded patriarch but i didnt stay shrivelled long for it cant be denied that a newborn babe has a good deal more to look forward to than a patriarch has  illustration at the abbey  it is amazing how many things in this part of the country wed never have thought of if it hadnt been for mr poplington at dinner he told us about exmoor and the lorna doone country and the wild deer hunting that can be had nowhere else in england and lots of other things that made me feel we must be up and doing if we wanted to see all we ought to see before we left chedcombe when i went upstairs i said to jone that mr poplington was a very different man from what i thought he was  hes just as nice as he can be and im going to charge him for his room and his meals and for everything hes had  jone laughed and asked me if that was the way i showed people i liked them  we intended to humble him by not charging him anything i said and make him feel he had been depending on our bounty but now i wouldnt hurt his feelings for the world and ill make out his bill in the morning myself women always do that sort of thing in england  as you asked me madam to tell you everything that happened on our travels ill go on about mr poplington after breakfast on monday morning he went over to the inn and said he would come back and pack up his things but when he did come back he told us that those coachandfour people had determined not to leave chedcombe that day but was going to stay and look at the sights in the neighborhood and that they would want the room for that night he said this had made him very angry because they had no right to change their minds that way after having made definite arrangements in which other people besides themselves was concerned and he had said so very plainly to the gentleman who seemed to be at the head of the party  i hope it will be no inconvenience to you madam he said to keep me another night  oh dear no said i and my husband was saying this morning that he wished you was going to stay with us the rest of our time here  really exclaimed mr poplington then ill do it ill go to the inn this minute and have the rest of my luggage brought over here if this is any punishment to mrs locky she deserves it for she shouldnt have told those people they could stay longer without consulting me  in less than an hour there came a van to our cottage with the rest of his luggage there must have been over a dozen boxes and packages besides things tied up and strapped and as i saw them being carried up one at a time i said to miss pondar that in our country wed have two or three big trunks which we could take about without any trouble  yes maam said she but i could see by her face that she didnt believe luggage would be luggage unless you could lug it but was too respectful to say so  when mr poplington got settled down in our spare room he blossomed out like a fullblown friend of the family and accordingly began to give us advice he said we should go as soon as we could and see exmoor and all that region of country and that if we didnt mind hed like to go with us to which we answered of course we should like that very much and asked him what he thought would be the best way to go so we had ever so much talk about that and although we all agreed it would be nicer not to take a public coach but travel private we didnt find it easy to decide as to the manner of travel we all agreed that a carriage and horses would be too expensive and jone was rather in favor of a dogcart for us if mr poplington would like to go on horseback but the old gentleman said it would be too much riding for him and if we took a dogcart hed have to take another one but this wouldnt be a very sociable way of travelling and none of us liked it  now exclaimed mr poplington striking his hand on the table ill tell you exactly how we ought to go through that countrywe ought to go on cycles  bicycles said i  tricycles if you like he answered but thats the way to do it itll be cheap and we can go as we like and stop when we like well be as free and independent as the stars and stripes and more so for they cant always flap when they like and stop flapping when they choose have you ever tried it madam  i replied that i had a little because my daughter had a tricycle and i had ridden on it for a short distance and after sundown but as for regular travel in the daytime i couldnt think of it  at this jone nearly took my breath away by saying that he thought that the bicycle idea was a capital one and that for his part hed like it better than any other way of travelling through a pretty country he also said he believed i could work a tricycle just as well as not and that if i got used to it i would think it fine  i stood out against those two men for about a half an hour and then i began to give in a little and think that it might be nice to roll along on my own little wheels over their beautiful smooth roads and stop and smell the hedges and pick flowers whenever i felt like it and so it ended in my agreeing to do the exmoor country on a tricycle while mr poplington and jone went on bicycles as to getting the machines mr poplington said he would attend to that there was people in london who hired them to excursionists and all he had to do was to send an order and they would be on hand in a day or two and so that matter was settled and he wrote to london i thought mr poplington was a little old for that sort of exercise but i found he had been used to doing a great deal of cycling in the part of the country where he lives and besides he isnt as old as i thought he was being not much over fifty the kind of air that keeps a country always green is wonderful in bringing out early red and white in a person  everything happens wonderfully well madam said he coming in after he had been to post his letter in a red iron box let into the side of the wesleyan chapel doesnt it now here were not able to start on our journey for two or three days and i have just been told that the great haymaking in the big meadow to the south of the village is to begin tomorrow they make the hay there only every other year and they have a grand time of it we must be there and you shall see some of our english country customs  we said wed be sure to be in for that sort of thing  i wish madam you could have seen that great hayfield it belongs to the lord of the manor and must have twenty or thirty acres in it theyve been three or four days cutting the grass on it with a machine and now theres been nearly two days with hardly any rain only now and then some drizzling and a good strong wind which they think here is better for the haymaking than sunshine though they dont object to a little sun all the people in the village who had legs good enough to carry them to that field went to help make hay it was a regular holiday and as hay is clean nearly everybody was dressed in good clothes early in the morning some twenty regular farm laborers began raking the hay at one end of the field stretching themselves nearly the whole way across it and as the day went on more and more people came men and women high and low all the young women and some of the older ones had rakes and the way they worked them was amazing to see but they turned over the hay enough to dry it as to schoolgirls and boys there was no end of them in the afternoon for school let out early some of them worked but most of them played and cut up monkeyshines on the hay even the little babies was brought on the field and nice soft beds made for them under the trees at one side  when jone saw the real farmwork going on with a chance for everybody to turn in to help his farmer blood boiled within him as if he was a warhorse and sniffed the smoke of battle and he got himself a rake and went to work like a goodfellow i never saw so many men at work in a hayfield at home but when i looked at jone raking i could see why it was it didnt take so many men to get in our hay as for me i raked a little but looked about a great deal more  near the middle of the field was two women working together raking as steadily as if they had been brought up to it one of these was young and even handsomer than miss dick which was the name of the bar lady to look at her made me think of what i had read of queen marie antoinette and her court ladies playing the part of milkmaids her straw hat was trimmed with delicate flowers and her white muslin dress and pale blue ribbons made her the prettiest picture i ever saw outofdoors i could not help asking mrs locky who she was and she told me that she was the chambermaid at the inn and the other was the cook when i heard this i didnt make any answer but just walked off a little way and began raking and thinking i have often wondered why it is that english servants are so different from those we have or to put it in a strictly confidential way between you and me madam why the chambermaid at the bordley arms as she is is so different from me as i used to be when i first lived with you now that young chambermaid with the pretty hat is as far as appearances go as good a woman as i am and if jone was a bachelor and intended to marry her i would think it was as good a match as if he married me but the difference between us two is that when i got to be the kind of woman i am i wasnt willing to be a servant and if i had always been the kind of young woman that chambermaid is i never would have been a servant  ive kept a sharp eye on the young women in domestic service over here having a fellowfeeling for them as you can well understand madam and since i have been in the country ive watched the poor folks and seen how they live and its just as plain to me as can be that the young women who are maids and waitresses over here are the kind who would have tried to be shopgirls and dressmakers and even schoolteachers in america and many of the servants we have would be working in the fields if they lived over here the fact is the english people dont go to other countries to get their servants their way is like a factory consuming its own smoke the surplus young women and there must always be a lot of them are used up in domestic service  now if an american poor girl is good enough to be a firstclass servant she wants to be something else sooner than go out to service she will work twice as hard in a shop or even go into a factory  i have talked a good deal about this to jone and he says im getting to be a philosopher but i dont think it takes much philosophizing to find out how this case stands if house service could be looked upon in the proper way it wouldnt take long for american girls who have to work for their living to find out that its a lot better to live with nice people and cook and wait on the table and do all those things which come natural to women the world over than to stand all day behind a counter under the thumb of a floorwalker or grind their lives out like slaves among a lot of steamengines and machinery the only reason the english have better house servants than we have is that here any girl who has to work is willing to be a house servant and very good house servants they are too     letter number eight   illustration  chedcombe  i will now finish telling you about the great haymaking day toward the end of the afternoon a lot of boys and girls began playing a game which seemed to belong to the hayfield each one of the bigger boys would twist up a rope of hay and run after a girl and when he had thrown it over her neck he could kiss her girls are girls the whole world over and it was funny to see how some of them would run like mad to get away from the boys and how dreadfully troubled they would be when they was caught and yet after they had been kissed and the boys had left them they would walk innocently back to the players as if they never dreamed that anybody would think of disturbing them  at five oclock everybodyfarm hands ladies gentlemen schoolchildren and alltook tea together some were seated at long tables made of planks with benches at the sides and others scattered all over the grass miss pondar and our maid hannah helped to serve the tea and sandwiches and i was glad to see that hannah wore her pointed white cap and her black dress for i had on my woollen travelling suit and i didnt want too much cartbeforethehorseness in my domestic establishment  after tea the work and the games began again and as i think it is always better for people to do what they can do best i turned in and helped clear away the teathings and after that i sat down by a female person in black silkand i am sure i didnt know whether she was the lady of the manor or somebody else until i heard some hwords come out in her talk and then i knew she was the latterand she told me ever so much about the people in the village and why the rector wasnt there on account of a dispute about the altarcloths and she was just beginning to tell me about the doctors wife sending her daughters to a school that was much too highpriced for his practice when i happened to look across the field and there with the bar lady at the inn with her hat trimmed with pink and the marie antoinette chambermaid with her hat trimmed with blue was jone and they was all three raking together as comfortable and confiding as if they had been singing hymns out of the same book  now i thought i had been sitting still long enough and so i snipped off the rest of the doctor story and got myself across that field with pretty long steps when i reached the happy three i didnt say anything but went round in front of them and stood there throwing a sarcastic and disdainful glance upon their farming jone stopped working and wiped his face with his handkerchief as if he was hot and tired but hadnt thought of it until just then and the two girls they stopped too  hes teaching us to rake maam said miss dick revolving her greengage eyes in my direction and really maam its wonderful to see how good he does it you americans are so awful clever  as for the one with the blue trimmings she said nothing but stood with her hands folded on her rake and her chiselled features steeped in a meek resignedness though much too high colored as though it had just been borne in upon her that this world is all a fleeting show for mans illusion given and such felicity as culling fragrant hay by the side of that manly form must een be foregone by her that i could have taken a handle of a rake and given her such a punch among her blue ribbons that her classic features would have frantically twined themselves around one resounding howlbut i didnt i simply remarked to jone with a statuesque rigidity that it was six oclock and i was going home to which he said he was going too and we went  illustration there with the bar lady and the marie antoinette chambermaid was jone  i thought said i as we proceeded with rapid steps across the field that you didnt come to england for the purpose of teaching the inhabitants  jone laughed a little that young lady put it rather strong he said she and her friend was merely trying to rake as i did i think they got on very well  indeed said ii expect with flashing eyebut the next time you go into the disciple business i recommend that you take boys who really need to know something about farming and not fineasfiddle young women that you might as well be balletdancing with as raking with for all the hankering after knowledge they have  oh said jone and that was all he did say which was very wise in him for considering my state of feelings his case was like a fishhook in your fingerthe more you pull and worry at it the harder it is to get out  that evening when i was quite cooled down and we was talking to mr poplington about the haymaking and the freeandeasy way in which everybody came together he was a good deal surprised that we should think that there was anything uncommon in that coming from a country where everybody was free and equal jone was smoking his pipe and when it draws well and hes had a good dinner and i havent anything particular to say he often likes to talk slow and preach little sermons  yes sir said he after considering the matter a little while according to the constitution of the united states we are all free and equal but theres a good many things the constitution doesnt touch on and one of them is the sorting out and sizing up of the population now you people over here are like the metal types that the printers use youve all got your letters on one end of you and you know just where you belong and if you happen to be knocked into pi and mixed all up in a pile it is easy enough to pick you out and put you all in your proper cases but its different with us according to the constitution were like a lot of carpettacks one just the same as another though in fact were not alike and it would not be easy if we got mixed up say in a hayfield to get ourselves all sorted out again according to the breadth of our heads and the sharpness of our points so we dont like to do too much mixing dont you see to which mr poplington said he didnt see and then i explained to him that what jone meant was that though in our country we was all equally free it didnt do for us to be as freely equal as the people are sometimes over here to which mr poplington said really but he didnt seem to be standing in the glaring sunlight of convincement but the shade is often pleasant to be in and he wound up by saying as he bid us goodnight that he thought it would be a great deal better for us if we had classes at all to have them marked out plain and stamped so that there could be no mistake to which i said that if we did that the most of the mistakes would come in the sorting which according to my reading of books and newspapers had happened to most countries that keep up aristocracies  i dont know that he heard all that i said for he was going upstairs with his candle at the time but when jone and me got upstairs in our own room i said to him and he always hears everything i say that in some ways the girls that we have for servants at home have some advantages over those we find here to which jone said yes and seemed to be sleepy     letter number nine   chedcombe  there was still another day of haymaking but we couldnt wait for that because our cycles had come from london and we was all anxious to be off and you would have laughed madam if you could have seen us start mr poplington went off well enough but jones bicycle seemed a little gay and hard to manage and he frisked about a good deal at starting but jone had bought a bicycle long ago when the things first came out and on days when the roads was good he used to go to the postoffice on it and he said that if a man had ever ridden on top of a wheel about six feet high he ought to be able to balance himself on the pair of small wheels which they use nowadays so after getting his long legs into working order he went very well though with a snaky movement at first and then i started  each one of us had a little handbag hung on our machine and mr poplington said we neednt take anything to eat for there was inns to be found everywhere in england hannah started me off nicely by pushing my tricycle until i got it going and miss pondar waved her handkerchief from the cottage door when hannah left me i went along rather slow at first but when i got used to the proper motion i began to do better and was very sure it wouldnt take me long to catch up with jone who was still wormfencing his way along the road when i got entirely away from the houses and began to smell the hedges and grassy banks so close to my nose and feel myself gliding along over the smooth white road my spirits began to soar like a bird and i almost felt like singing  the few people i met didnt seem to think it was anything wonderful for a woman to ride on a tricycle and i soon began to feel as proper as if i was walking on a sidewalk once i came very near tangling myself up with the legs of a horse who was pulling a cart i forgot that it was the proper thing in this country to turn to the left and not to the right but i gave a quick twist to my helm and just missed the cartwheel but it was a close scratch this turning to the right instead of to the left was a mistake jone made two or three times when he began to drive me in england but he got over it and since my grazing the cart its not likely i shall forget it as i breathed a sigh of relief after escaping this danger i took in a breath full of the scent of wild roses that nearly covered a bit of hedge and my spirits rose again  i had asked jone and mr poplington to go ahead because i knew i could do a great deal better if i worked along by myself for a while without being told what i ought to do and what i oughtnt to do there is nothing that bothers me so much as to have people try to teach me things when i am puzzling them out for myself but now i found that although they could not be far ahead i couldnt see them on account of the twists in the road and the high hedges and so i put on steam and went along at a fine rate sniffing the breeze like a charger of the battlefield before very long i came to a place where the road forked but the road to the left seemed like a lane leading to somebodys house so i kept on in what was plainly the main road which made a little turn where it forked looking out ahead of me to see if i could catch sight of the two men i could not see a sign of them but i did see that i was on the top of a long hill that seemed to lead on and down and on and down with no end to it  i had hardly started down this hill when my tricycle became frisky and showed signs of wanting to run and i got a little nervous for i didnt fancy going fast down a slope like that i put on the brake but i dont believe i managed it right for i seemed to go faster and faster and then as the machine didnt need any working i took my feet off the pedals with an idea i think though i cant now remember that i would get off and walk down the hill in an instant that thing took the bit in its teeth and away it went wildly tearing down hill i never was so much frightened in all my life i tried to get my feet back on the pedals but i couldnt do it and all i could do was to keep that flying tricycle in the middle of the road as far as i could see ahead there was not anything in the way of a wagon or a carriage that i could run into but there was such a stretch of slope that it made me fairly dizzy just as i was having a little bit of comfort from thinking there was nothing in the way a black woolly dog jumped out into the road some distance ahead of me and stood there barking my heart fell like a bucket into a well with the rope broken if i steered the least bit to the right or the left i believe i would have bounded over the hedge like a glass bottle from a railroad train and come down on the other side in shivers and splinters if i didnt turn i was making a beeline for the dog but i had no time to think what to do and in an instant that black woolly dog faded away like a reminiscence among the buzzing wheels of my tricycle i felt a little bump but was ignorant of further particulars  i was now going at what seemed like a speed of ninety or a hundred miles an hour with the wind rushing in between my teeth like water over a milldam and i felt sure that if i kept on going down that hill i should soon be whirling through space like a comet the only way i could think of to save myself was to turn into some level place where the thing would stop but not a crossroad did i pass but presently i saw a little house standing back from the road which seemed to hump itself a little at that place so as to be nearly level and over the edge of the hump it dipped so suddenly that i could not see the rest of the road at all  now thought i to myself if the gate of that house is open ill turn into it and no matter what i run into it would be better than going over the edge of that rise beyond and down the awful hill that must be on the other side of it as i swooped down to the little house and reached the level ground i felt i was going a little slower but not much however i steered my tricycle round at just the right instant and through the front gate i went like a flash  i was going so fast and my mind was so wound up on account of the necessity of steering straight that i could not pay much attention to things i passed but the scene that showed itself in front of me as i went through that little garden gate i could not help seeing and remembering from the gate to the door of the house was a path paved with flagstones the door was open and there must have been a low step before it back of the door was a hall which ran through the house and this was paved with flagstones the back door of the hall was open and outside of it was a sort of arbor with vines and on one side of this arbor was a bench with a young man and a young woman sitting on it holding each other by the hand and looking into each others eyes the arbor opened out on to a piece of green grass with flowers of mixed colors on the edges of it and at the back of this bit of lawn was a lot of clothes hung out on clotheslines of course i could not have seen all those things at once but they came upon me like a single picture for in one tick of a watch i went over that flagstone path and into that front door and through that house and out of that back door and past that young man and that young woman and head and heels both foremost at once dashed slambang into the midst of all that linen hanging out on the lines  illustration at last i did get on my feet  i heard the minglement of a groan and a scream and in an instant i was enveloped in a white wet cloud of sheets pillowcases tablecloths and underwear some of the things stuck so close to me and others i grabbed with such a wild clutch that nearly all the weeks wash lines and all came down on me wrapping me up like an apple in a dumplingbut i stopped there was not anything in this world that would have been better for me to run into than those lines full of wet clothes  where the tricycle went to i didnt know but i was lying on the grass kicking and trying to get up and to get my head free so that i could see and breathe at last i did get on my feet and throwing out my arms so as to shake off the sheets and pillowcases that were clinging all over me i shook some of the things partly off my face and with one eye i saw that couple on the bench but only for a second with a yell of horror and with a face whiter than the linen i was wrapped in that young man bounced from the bench dashed past the house made one clean jump over the hedge into the road and disappeared as for the young woman she just flopped over and went down in a faint on the floor  as soon as i could do it i got myself free from the clothesline and staggered out on the grass i was trembling so much i could scarcely walk but when i saw that young woman looking as if she was dead on the ground i felt i must do something and seeing a pail of water standing near by i held it over her face and poured it down on her a little at a time and it wasnt long before she began to squirm and then she opened her eyes and her mouth just at the same time so that she must have swallowed about as much water as she would have taken at a meal this brought her to and she began to cough and splutter and look around wildly and then i took her by the arm and helped her up on the bench  dont you want a little something to drink i said tell me where i can get you something  she didnt answer but began looking from one side to the other is he swallowed said she in a whisper with her eyes starting out of her head  swallowed said i who  davy said she  oh your young man said i he is all right unless he hurt himself jumping over the hedge i saw him run away just as fast as he could  and the spirit said she i looked hard at her  what has happened to you said i how did you come to faint  she was getting quieter but she still looked wildly out of her eyes and kept her back turned toward the bit of grass as if she was afraid to look in that direction  what happened to you said i again for i wanted to know what she thought about my sudden appearance it took some little time for her to get ready to answer and then she said  was you frightened lady did you have to come in here im sorry you found me swooned i dont know how long i was swooned davy and me was sitting here talking about having the banns called and it was a sorry talk lady for the vicar hes told me four times i should not marry davy because he says he is a radical but for all that davy and me wants the banns called all the same but not knowing how we was to have it done for the vicar hes so set against davy and davy he had just got done saying to me that he was going to marry me vicar or no vicar banns or no banns come what might when that very minute with an awful hiss something flashed in front of us dazzling my eyes so that i shut them and screamed and then when i opened them again there in the yard back of us was a great white spirit twice as high as the cow stable with one eye in the middle of its forehead turning around like a firework i dont remember anything after that and i dont know how long i was lying here when you came and found me lady but i know what it means there is a curse on our marriage and davy and me will never be man and wife and then she fell to groaning and moaning  i felt like laughing when i thought how much like a church ghost i must have looked standing there in solid white with my arms stretched out but the poor girl was in such a dreadful state of mind that i sat down beside her and began to comfort her by telling her just what had happened and that she ought to be very glad that i had found a place to turn into and had not gone on down the hill and dashed myself into little pieces at the bottom but it wasnt easy to cheer her up  oh davys gone said she hell never come back for fear of the curse hell be off with his uncle to sea ill never lay eyes on davy again  just at that moment i heard somebody calling my name and looking through the house i saw jone at the front door and two men behind him as i ran through the hall i saw that the two men with jone was mr poplington and a young fellow with a pale face and trembling legs  is this davy said i  yes said he  then go back to your young woman and comfort her i said which he did and when he had gone not madly rushing into his loved ones arms but shuffling along in a timid way as if he was afraid the ghost hadnt gone yet i asked jone how he happened to think i was here and he told me that he and mr poplington had taken the road to the left when they reached the fork because that was the proper one but they had not gone far before he thought i might not know which way to turn so they came back to the fork to wait for me but i had been closer behind them than they thought and i must have come to the fork before they turned back so after waiting a while and going back along the road without seeing me they thought that i must have taken the righthand road and they came that way going down the hill very carefully after a while jone found my hat in the road which up to that moment i had not missed and then he began to be frightened and they went on faster  they passed the little house and as they was going down the hill they saw ahead of them a man running as if something had happened so they let out their bicycles and soon caught up to him this was davy and when they stopped him and asked if anything was the matter he told them that a dreadful thing had come to pass he had been working in the garden of a house about half a mile back when suddenly there came an awful crash and a white animal sprang out of the house with a bit of a cotton mill fastened to its tail and then with a great peal of thunder it vanished and a white ghost rose up out of the ground with its arms stretching out longer and longer reaching to clutch him by the hair he was not afraid of anything living but he couldnt abide spirits so he laid down his spade and left the garden thinking he would go and see the sexton and have him come and lay the ghost  then jone went on to say that of course he could not make head or tail out of such a story as that but when he heard that an awful row had been kicked up in a garden he immediately thought that as like as not i was in it and so he and mr poplington ran back leaving their bicycles against the hedge and bringing the young man with them  then i told my story and mr poplington said it was a mercy i was not killed and jone didnt say much but i could see that his teeth was grinding  we all went into the back yard and there on the other side of the clothes which was scattered all over the ground we found my tricycle jammed into a lot of gooseberry bushes and when it was dragged out we found it was not hurt a bit davy and his young woman was standing in the arbor looking very sheepish especially davy for she had told him what it was that had scared him as we was going through the house jone taking my tricycle i stopped to say goodby to the girl  now that you see there has been no curse and no ghost said i i hope that you will soon have your banns called and that you and your young man will be married all right  thank you very much maam said she but im awful fearful about it davy may say what he pleases but my mother never will let me marry him if the vicars agen it and davy wouldnt have been here today if she hadnt gone to town and the vicars a hard man and a strong tory and hell always be agen it i fear  when i went out into the front yard i found mr poplington and jone sitting on a little stone bench for they was tired and i told them about that young woman and davy  humph said mr poplington i know the vicar of the parish he is the rev osmun green hes a good conservative and is perfectly right in trying to keep that poor girl from marrying a wretched radical  i looked straight at him and said  do you mean sir to put politics before matrimonial happiness  no i dont said he but a girl cant expect matrimonial happiness with a radical  i saw that jone was about to say something here but i got in ahead of him  i will tell you what it is sir said i if you think it is wrong to be a radical the best thing you can do is to write to your friend that vicar and advise him to get those two young people married as soon as possible for it is easy to see that she is going to rule the roost and if anybody can get his radicalistics out of him she will be the one to do it  mr poplington laughed and said that as the man looked as if he was a fit subject to be henpecked it might be a good way of getting another tory vote  but said he i should think it would go against your conscience being naturally opposed to the conservatives to help even by one vote  oh my conscience is all right said i when politics runs against the matrimonial altar i stand up for the altar  well said he ill think of it and we started off walking down the hill jone holding on to my tricycle  when we got to level ground with about two miles to go before we would stop for luncheon jone took a piece of thin rope out of his pockethe always carries some sort of cord in case of accidentsand he tied it to the back part of my machine  now said he im going to keep hold of the other end of this and perhaps your tricycle wont run away with you  i didnt much like going along this way as if i was a cow being taken to market but i could see that jone had been so troubled and frightened about me that i didnt make any objection and in fact after i got started it was a comfort to think there was a tie between jone and me that was stronger when hilly roads came into the question than even the matrimonial tie     letter number ten   chedcombe somersetshire  the place we stopped at on the first night of our cycle trip is named porlock and after the walking and the pushing and the strain on my mind when going down even the smallest hill for fear jones rope would give way i was glad to get there  the road into porlock goes down a hill the steepest i have seen yet and we all walked down holding our machines as if they had been fiery coursers this hill road twists and winds so you can only see part of it at a time and when we was about halfway down we heard a horn blowing behind us and looking around there came the mailcoach at full speed with four horses with a lot of people on top as this raging coach passed by it nearly took my breath away and as soon as i could speak i said to jone dont you ever say anything in america about having the roads made narrower so that it wont cost so much to keep them in order for in my opinion its often the narrow road that leadeth to destruction  when we got into the town and my mind really began to grapple with old porlock i felt as if i was sliding backward down the slope of the centuries and liked it as we went along mr poplington told us about everything and said that this queer little town was a fishing village and seaport in the days of the saxons and that king harold was once obliged to stop there for a while and that he passed his time making war on the neighbors  mr poplington took us to a tavern called the ship inn and i simply went wild over it it is two hundred years old and two stories high and everything i ever read about the hostelries of the past i saw there the queer little door led into a queer little passage paved with stone a pair of little stairs led out of this into another little room higher up and on the other side of the passage was a long mysterious hallway we had our dinner in a tiny parlor which reminded me of a chapter in one of those old books where they use f instead of s and where the first word of the next page is at the bottom of the one you are reading  there was a fireplace in the room with a window one side of it through which you could look into the street it was not cold but it had begun to rain hard and so i made the dampness an excuse for a fire  this is antique indeed i said when we were at the table  you are right there said mr poplington who was doing his best to carve a duck and was a little cross about it  when i sat before the fire that evening and jone was asleep on a settee of the days of yore and mr poplington had gone to bed being tired my soul went back to the olden time and looking out through the little window in the fireplace i fancied i could see william the conqueror and the king of the danes sneaking along the little street under the eaves of the thatched roofs until i was so worked up that i was on the point of shouting fly oh saxon when the door opened and the maid who waited on us at the table put her head in i took this for a sign that the curfew bell was going to ring and so i woke up jone and we went to bed  but all night long the heroes of the past flocked about me i had been reading a lot of history and i knew them all the minute my eyes fell upon them charlemagne and canute sat on the end of the bed while alfred the great climbed up one of the posts until he was stopped by hannibals legs who had them twisted about the post to keep himself steady when i got up in the morning i went downstairs into the little parlor and there was the maid down on her knees cleaning the hearth  what is your name i said to her  jane please said she  jane what said i  jane puddle please said she  i took a carvingknife from off the table and standing over her i brought it down gently on top of her head rise sir jane puddle said i to which the maid gave a smothered gasp andwould you believe it madamshe crept out of the room on her hands and knees the cook waited on us at breakfast and i truly believe that the landlord and his wife breathed a sigh of relief when we left the ship inn for their sordid souls had never heard of knighthood but knew all about assassination  illustration rise sir jane puddle  that morning we left porlock by a hill which compared with the one we came into it by was like the biggest pyramid of egypt by the side of a haycock i dont suppose in the whole civilized world there is a worse hill with a road on it than the one we went up by i was glad we had to go up it instead of down it though it was very hard to walk pushing the tricycle even when helped i believe it would have taken away my breath and turned me dizzy even to take one step face forward down such a hill and gaze into the dreadful depths below me and yet they drive coaches and fours down that hill at the top of the hill is this notice to cyclersthis hill is dangerous if i had thought of it i should have looked for the cyclers graves at the bottom of it  the reason i thought about this was that i had been reading about one of the mountains in switzerland which is one of the highest and most dangerous and with the poorest view where so many alpine climbers have been killed that there is a little graveyard nearly full of their graves at the foot of the mountain how they could walk through that graveyard and read the inscriptions on the tombstones and then go and climb that mountain is more than i can imagine  in walking up this hill and thinking that it might have been in front of me when my tricycle ran away i could not keep my mind away from the little graveyard at the foot of the swiss mountain     letter number eleven   illustration  chedcombe somersetshire  on the third day of our cycle trip we journeyed along a lofty road with the wild moor on one side and the tossing sea on the other and at night reached lynton it is a little town on a jutting crag and far down below it on the edge of the sea was another town named lynmouth and there is a car with a wire rope to it like an elevator which they call the lift which takes people up and down from one town to another  here we stopped at a house very different from the ship inn for it looked as if it had been built the day before yesterday everything was new and shiny and we had our supper at a long table with about twenty other people just like a boardinghouse some of their ways reminded me of the backwoods and i suppose there is nothing more modern than backwoodsism which naturally hasnt the least alloy of the past when the people got through with their cups of coffee or tea mostly the last two women went around the table one with a big bowl for us to lean back and empty our slops into and the other with the tea or coffee to fill up the cups a gentleman with a baldish head who was sitting opposite us began to be sociable as soon as he heard us speak to the waiters and asked questions about america after he got through with about a dozen of them he said  is it true as i have heard that what you call nativeborn americans deteriorate in the third generation  i had been answering most of the questions but now jone spoke up quick that depends says he on their original blood when americans are descended from englishmen they steadily improve generation after generation the baldish man smiled at this and said there was nothing like having good blood for a foundation but mr poplington laughed and said to me that jone had served him right  the country about lynton is wonderfully beautiful with rocks and valleys and velvet lawns running into the sea and woods and ancestral mansions and we spent the day seeing all this and also going down to lynmouth where the little ships lie high and dry on the sand when the tide goes out and the carts drive up to them and put goods on board and when the tide rises the ships sail away which is very convenient  i wanted to keep on along the coast but the others didnt and the next morning we started back to chedcombe by a roundabout way so that we might see exmoor and the country where lorna doone and john ridd cut up their didoes i must say i liked the story a good deal better before i saw the country where the things happened the mind of man is capable of soarings which nature weakens at when she sees what she is called upon to do if you want a real firstclass toothonedge doone valley the place to look for it is in the book we went rolling along on the smooth hard roads which are just as good here as if they was in london and all around us was stretched out the wild and desolate moors with the wind screaming and whistling over the heather nearly tearing the clothes off our backs while the rain beat down on us with a steady pelting and the ragged sheep stopped to look at us as if we was three witches and they was macbeths  the very thought that i was out in a wild storm on a desolate moor filled my soul with a sort of triumph and i worked my tricycle as if i was spurring my steed to battle the only thing that troubled me was the thought that if the water that poured off my mackintosh that day could have run into our cistern at home it would have been a glorious good thing jone did not like the fierce blast and the inspiriting rain but i knew hed stand it as long as mr poplington did and so i was content although if we had been overtaken by a covered wagon i should have trembled for the result  that night we stopped in the little village of simonsbath at somebodys arms after dinner mr poplington who knew some people in the place went out but jone and me went to bed as quick as we could for we was tired the next morning we was wakened by a tremendous pounding at the door i didnt know what to make of it for it was too early and too loud for hot water but we heard mr poplington calling to us and jone jumped up to see what he wanted  get up said he if you want to see a sight that you never saw before well start off immediately and breakfast at exford the hope of seeing a sight was enough to make me bounce at any time and i never dressed or packed a bag quicker than i did that morning and jone wasnt far behind me  when we got downstairs we found our cycles waiting ready at the door together with the stable man and the stable boy and the boys helper and the cook and the chambermaid and the waiters and the other servants waiting for their tips mr poplington seemed in a fine humor and he told us he had heard the night before that there was to be a stag hunt that day the first of the season in fact it was not one of the regular meets but what they called a bymeet and not known to everybody  we will go on to exford said he straddling his bicycle for though the meet isnt to be there theres where they keep the hounds and horses and if we make good speed we shall get there before they start out  the three of us travelled abreast mr poplington in the middle and on the way he told us a good deal about stag hunts what i remember best having to go so fast and having to mind my steering was that after the hunting season began they hunted stags until a certain dayi forget what it wasand then they let them alone and began to hunt the does and that after that particular day of the month when the stags heard the hounds coming they paid no attention to them knowing very well it was the does turn to be chased and that they would not be bothered and so they let the female members of their families take care of themselves which shows that ungentlemanliness extends itself even into nature  when we got to exford we left our cycles at the inn and followed mr poplington to the hunting stables which are near by i had not gone a dozen steps from the door before i heard a great barking and the next minute there came around the corner a pack of hounds they crossed the bridge over the little river and then they stopped we went up to them and while mr poplington talked to the men the whole of that pack of hounds gathered about us as gentle as lambs they were good big dogs white and brown the head huntsman who had them in charge told me there was thirty couple of them and i thought that sixty dogs was pretty heavy odds against one deer then they moved off as orderly as if they had been children in a kindergarten and we went to the stables and saw the horses and then the master of the hounds and a good many other gentlemen in red coats in all sorts of traps rode up and their hunters were saddled and the dogs barked and the men cracked their whips to keep them together and there was a bustle and liveliness to a degree i cant write about and jone and i never thought about going in to breakfast until all those horses some led and some ridden and the men and the hounds and even the dust from their feet had disappeared  i wanted to go see the hunt start off but mr poplington said it was two or three miles distant and out of our way and that wed better move on as soon as possible so as to reach chedcombe that night but he was glad he said that we had had a chance to see the hounds and the horses  as for himself i could see he was a little down in the mouth for he said he was very fond of hunting and that if he had known of this meet he would have been there with a horse and his hunting clothes i think he hoped somebody would lend him a horse but nobody did and not being able to hunt himself he disliked seeing other people doing what he could not of course jone and me could not go to the hunt by ourselves so after wed had our tea and toast and bacon we started off i will say here that when i was at the ship inn i had tea for my breakfast for i couldnt bring my mind to order coffeea drink the saxons must never have heard ofin such a place and since that we have been drinking it because jone said there was no use fighting against established drinks and that anyway he thought good tea was better than bad coffee     letter number twelve   chedcombe  as i said in my last letter we started out for chedcombe not abreast as we had been before but strung along the road and me and mr poplington pretty doleful being disappointed and not wanting to talk but as for jone he seemed livelier than ever and whistled a lot of tunes he didnt know i think it always makes him lively to get rid of seeing sights the sun was shining brightly and there was no reason to expect rain for two or three hours anyway and the country we passed through was so fine with hardly any houses and with great hills and woods and sometimes valleys far below the road with streams rushing and bubbling that after a while i began to feel better and i pricked up my tricycle and of course being followed by jone we left mr poplington whose melancholy seemed to have gotten into his legs a good way behind  we must have travelled two or three hours when all of a sudden i heard a noise afar and i drew up and listened the noise was the barking of dogs and it seemed to come from a piece of woods on the other side of the field which lay to the right of the road the next instant something shot out from under the trees and began going over the field in tenfoot hops i sat staring without understanding but when i saw a lot of brown and white spots bounce out of the wood and saw a long way back in the open field two redcoated men on horseback the truth flashed upon me that this was the hunt the creature in front was the stag who had chosen to come this way and the dogs and the horses was after him and i was here to see it all  almost before i got this all straight in my mind the deer was nearly opposite me on the other side of the field going the same way that we were in a second i clapped spurs into my tricycle and was off in front of me was a long stretch of down grade and over this i went as fast as i could work my pedals no brakes or holding back for me my blood was up for i was actually in a deer hunt and to my amazement and wild delight i found i was keeping up with the deer i was going faster than the men on horseback  hi hi i shouted and down i went with one eye on the deer and the other on the road every atom of my body tingling with fiery excitement when i began to go up the little slope ahead i heard jone puffing behind me  you will break your neck he shouted if you go down hill that way and getting close up to me he fastened his cord to my tricycle but i paid no attention to him or his advice  the stag the stag i cried as long as he keeps near the road we can follow him hi and having got up to the top of the next hill i made ready to go down as fast as i had gone before for we had fallen back a little and the stag was now getting ahead of us but it made me gnash my teeth to find that i could not go fast for jone held back with all his force and both feet on the ground i expect and i could not get on at all  let go of me i cried we shall lose the stag stop holding back but it wasnt any use jones heels must have been nearly rubbed off but he held back like a good fellow and i seemed to be moving along no faster than a worm i could not stand this my blood boiled and bubbled the deer was getting away from me and if it had been porlock hill in front of me i would have dashed on not caring whether the road was steep or level  a thought flashed across my mind and i clapped my hand into my pocket and jerked out a pair of scissors in an instant i was free the world and the stag was before me and i was flying along with a tornadolike swiftness that soon brought me abreast of the deer this perfectly splendid bounding creature was not far away from me on the other side of the hedge and as the field was higher than the road i could see him perfectly his legs worked so regular and springy except when he came to a cross hedge which he went over with a single clip and came down like india rubber on the other side that one might have thought he was measuring the grass and keeping an account of his jumps in his head  illustration in an instant i was free  for one instant i looked around for the hounds and i saw there was not more than half a dozen following him and i could only see the two hunters i had seen before and these was still a good way back as for jone i couldnt hear him at all and he must have been left far behind there was still the woods on the other side and the deer seemed to run to keep away from that and to cross the road and he came nearer and nearer until i fancied he kept an eye on me as if he was wondering if i was of any consequence and if i could hinder him from crossing the road and getting away into the valley below where there was a regular wilderness of woods and underbrush  if he does that i thought he will be gone in a minute and i shall lose him and the hunt will be over and for fear he would make for the hedge and jump over it not minding me i jerked out my handkerchief and shook it at him you cant imagine how this frightened him he turned sharp to the right dashed up the hill cleared a hedge and was gone i gave a gasp and a scream as i saw him disappear i believe i cried but i didnt stop and glad i was that i didnt for in less than a minute i had come to a cross lane which led in the very direction the deer had taken i turned into this lane and went on as fast as i could and i soon found that it led through a thick wood down in the hollow which i could not see into i heard a barking and shouting and i kept on just as fast as i could make that tricycle go where the lane led to or what i should ever come to i didnt think about i was hunting a stag and all i cared for was to feel my tricycle bounding beneath me  i may have gone a half a mile or two milesi have not an idea how far it waswhen suddenly i came to a place where there was green grass and rocks in an opening in the woods and what a sight i saw there was that beautiful grand red deer half down on his knees and perfectly quiet and there was one of the men in red coats coming toward him with a great knife in his hand and a little farther back was three or four dogs with another man still on horseback whipping them to keep them back though they seemed willing enough to lie there with their tongues out panting as the man with the knife came up to the deer the poor creature raised its eyes to him and didnt seem to mind whether he came or not it was trembling all over and fairly tired to death when the man got near enough he took hold of one of the deers horns and lifted up the hand with the knife in it but he didnt bring it down on that deers throat i can tell you madam for i was there and had him by the arm  he turned on me as if he had been struck by lightning  what do you mean he shouted let go my arm  dont you touch that deer said imy voice was so husky i could hardly speakdont you see its surrendered can you have the heart to cut that beautiful throat when he is pleading for mercy the mans eyes looked as if they would burst out of his head he gave me a pull and a push as if he would stick the knife into me and he actually swore at me but i didnt mind that  illustration if you was a man id break your head  you have got that poor creature now said i and thats enough keep it and tame it and bring it up with your children i didnt have time to say anything more and he didnt have time to answer for two of the dogs who had got a little of their wind back sprang up and made a jump at the stag and he having got a little of his wind back jerked his horn out of the hand of the man and giving a sort of side spring backward among the bushes and rocks away he went the dogs after him  the man with the knife rushed out into the lane and so did i and so did the man on horseback almost on top of me on the other side of the lane was a little gorge with rocks and trees and water at the bottom of it and i was just in time to see the stag spring over the lane and drop out of sight among the rocks and the moss and the vines  the man stood and swore at me regardless of my sex so violent was his rage  if you was a man id break your head he yelled  im glad im not said i for i wouldnt want my head broken but what troubles me is that im afraid that deer has broken his legs or hurt himself some way for i never saw anything drop on rocks in such a reckless manner and the poor thing so tired  the man swore again and said something about wishing somebody elses legs had been broken and then he shouted to the man on horseback to call off the dogs which was of no use for he was doing it already then he turned on me again  you are an american he shouted i might have known that no english woman would ever have done such a beastly thing as that  youre mistaken there i said there isnt a true english woman that lives who would not have done the same thing your mother  confound my mother yelled the man  all right said i thats all in your family and none of my business then he went off raging to where he had left his horse by a gatepost  the other man who was a good deal younger and more friendly came up to me and said he wouldnt like to be in my boots for i had spoiled a pretty piece of sport and then he went on and told me that it had been a bad hunt for instead of starting only one stag three or four of them had been started and they had had a bad time for the hounds and the hunters had been mixed up in a nasty way and at last when the master of the hounds and most every one else had gone off over dunkery hill and he didnt know whether they was after two stags or one he and his mate who was both whippersin had gone to turn part of the pack that had broken away and had found that these dogs was after another stag and so before they knew it they was in a hunt of their own and they would have killed that stag if it had not been for me and he said it was hard on his mate for he knew he had it in mind that he was going to kill the only stag of the day  he went on to say that as for himself he wasnt so sorry for this was sir skiddery henchballs land and when a stag was killed it belonged to the man whose land it died on he told me that the master of the hunt gets the head and the antlers and the huntsman some other part which i forget but the owner of the land no matter whether hes in the hunt or not gets the body of the stag theres a cottage not a mile down this lane said he with its thatch torn off and my sister and her children live there and sir skiddery turned them out on account of the rent and so im glad the old skinflint didnt get the venison and then he went off being called by the other man  i didnt know what time it was but it seemed as if it must be getting on into the afternoon and feeling that my deer hunt was over i thought i had better lose no time in hunting up jone so i followed on after the men and the dogs who was going to the main road but keeping a little back of them though for i didnt know what the older one might do if he happened to turn and see me  i was sure that jone had passed the little lane without seeing it so i kept on the way we had been going and got up all the speed i could though i must say i was dreadfully tired and even trembling a little for while i had been stag hunting i was so excited i didnt know how much work i was doing there was signposts enough to tell me the way to chedcombe and so i kept straight on up hill and down hill until at last i saw a man ahead on a bicycle which i soon knew to be mr poplington he was surprised enough at seeing me and told me my husband had gone ahead i didnt explain anything and it wasnt until we got nearly to chedcombe that we met jone he had been to chedcombe and was coming back  jone is a good fellow but hes got a will of his own and he said that this would be the end of my tricycle riding and that the next time we went out together on wheels hed drive i didnt tell him anything about the stag hunt then for he seemed to be in favor of doing all the talking himself but after dinner when we was all settled down quiet and comfortable i told him and mr poplington the story of the chase and they both laughed mr poplington the most     letter number thirteen   chedcombe somersetshire  it is now about a week since my stag hunt and jone and i have kept pretty quiet taking short walks and doing a good deal of reading in our garden whenever the sun shines into the little arbor there and mr poplington spends most of his time fishing he works very hard at this partly for the sake of his conscience i think for his bicycle trip made him lose three or four days he had taken a license for  it was day before yesterday that rheumatism showed itself certain and plain in jone i had been thinking that perhaps i might have it first but it wasnt so and it began in jone which though i dont want you to think me hardhearted madam was perhaps better for if it had not been for it it might have been hard to get him out of this comfortable little cottage where hed be perfectly content to stay until it was time for us to sail for america the beautiful greenness which spreads over the fields and hills and not only the leaves of trees and vines but down and around trunks and branches is charming to look at and never to be forgotten but when this moist greenness spreads itself to ones bones especially when it creeps up to the parts that work together then the soul of man longs for less picturesqueness and more easygoing joints jone says the english take their climate as they do their whiskey and he calls it climateandwater with a very little of the first and a good deal of the other  of course we must now leave chedcombe and when we talked to mr poplington about it he said there was two places the english went to for their rheumatism one was bath not far from here and the other was buxton up in the north as soon as i heard of bath i was on pins and needles to go there for in all the novelreading ive done which has been getting better and better in quality since the days when i used to read dime novels on the canalboat up to now when i like the best there is i could not help knowing lots about evelina and beau brummel and the pump room and the fine ladies and young bucks and it would have joyed my soul to live and move where all these people had been and where all these things had happened even if fictitiously  but mr poplington came down like a shower on my notions and said that bath was very warm and was the place where everybody went for their rheumatism in winter but that buxton was the place for the summer because it was on high land and cool this cast me down a good deal for if we could have gone where i could have steeped my soul in romanticness and at the same time jone could have steeped himself in warm mineral water there would not have been any time lost and both of us would have been happier but mr poplington stuck to it that it would ruin anybodys constitution to go to such a hot place in august and so i had to give it up  so tomorrow we start for buxton which from what i can make out must be a sort of invalid picnic ground i always did hate diseases and ailments even of the mildest when they go in caravan i like to take peoples sicknesses separate because then i feel i might do something to help but when they are bunched i feel as if it was sort of mean for me to go about cheerful and singing when other people was all grunting  but we are not going straight to buxton as i have often said jone is a good fellow and he told me last night if there was any bit of fancy scenery id like to stop on the way to the unromantic refuge hed be glad to give me the chance because he didnt suppose it would matter much if he put off his hot soaks for a few days it didnt take me long to name a place id like to stop atfor most of my reading lately has been in the guide books and i had crammed myself with the descriptions of places worth seeing that would take us at least two years to look atso i said i would like to go to the river wye which is said to be the most romantic stream in england and when that is said enough is said for me so jone agreed and we are going to do the wye on our way north  there is going to be an election here in a few days and this morning jone and me hobbled into the villagethat is he hobbled in body and i did in mind to think of his going along like a creaky wheelbarrow  everybody was agog about the election and we was looking at some placards posted against a wall when mr locky the innkeeper came along and after bidding us goodmorning he asked jone what party he belonged to im a home ruler said jone especially in the matter of tricycles mr locky didnt understand the last part of this speech but i did and he said i am glad you are not a tory sir if you will read that you will see what the tory party has done for us and he pointed out some lines at the bottom of a green placard and these was the words remember it was the tory party that lost us the united states of america  well said jone that seems like going a long way off to get some stones to throw at the tories but i feel inclined to heave a rock at them myself for the injury that party has done to america  to america said mr locky did the tories ever harm america  of course they did said jone they lost us england a very valuable country indeed and a great loss to any nation if it had not been for the tory party mr gladstone might now be in washington as a senator from middlesex  illustration im a home ruler  mr locky didnt understand one word of this and so he asked jone which leg his rheumatism was in and when jone told him it was his left leg he said it was a very curious thing but if you would take a hundred men in chedcombe there would be at least sixty with rheumatism in the left leg and perhaps not more than twenty with it in the right which was something the doctors never had explained yet  it is awfully hard to go away and leave this lovely little cottage with its roses and vines and miss pondar and all its sweetsmelling comforts and not only the cottage but the village and mrs locky and her husband at the bordley arms who couldnt have been kinder to us and more anxious to know what we wanted and what they could do the fact is that when english people do like americans they go at it with just as much vim and earnestness as if they was helping britannia to rule more waves  while i was feeling badly at leaving miss pondar your letter came dear madam and i must say it gave heavy hearts to jone and me to me especially as you can well understand i went off into the summerhouse and as i sat there thinking and reading the letter over again i do believe some tears came into my eyes and miss pondar who was working in the garden only a little way offfor if there is anything she likes to do it is to weed and fuss among the rosebushes and other flowers which she does whenever her other work gives her a chanceshe happened to look up and seeing that i was in trouble she came right to me like the good woman she is and asked me if i had heard bad news and if i would like a little gin and water  i said that i had had bad news but that i did not want any spirits and she said she hoped nothing had happened to any of my family and i told her not exactly but in looking back it seemed as if it was almost that way i thought i ought to tell her what had happened for i could see that she was really feeling for me and so i said poor lord edward is dead to be sure he was very old and i suppose we had not any right to think hed live even as long as he did and as he was nearly blind and had very poor use of his legs it was perhaps better that he should go but when i think of what friends we used to be before i was married i cant help feeling badly to think that he has gone that when i go back to america he will not show he is glad to see me home again which he would be if there wasnt another soul on the whole continent who felt that way  miss pondar was now standing up with her hands folded in front of her and her head bowed down as if she was walking behind a hearse with eight ostrich plumes on it lord edward she said in a melancholy respectful voice and will his remains be brought to england for interment  oh no said i not understanding what she was talking about i am sure he will be buried somewhere near his home and when i go back his grave will be one of the first places i will visit  a streak of bewilderment began to show itself in miss pondars melancholy respectfulness and she said of course when one lives in foreign parts one may die there but i always thought in cases like that they were brought home to their family vaults  it may seem strange for me to think of anything funny at a time like this but when miss pondar mentioned family vaults when talking of lord edward there came into my mind the jumps he used to make whenever he saw any of us coming home but i saw what she was driving at and the mistake she had made oh i said he was not a member of the british nobility he was a dog lord edward was his name i never loved any animal as i loved him  i suppose madam that you must sometimes have noticed one of the top candles of a chandelier when the room gets hot suddenly bending over and drooping and shedding tears of hot paraffine on the candles below and perhaps on the table and if you can remember what that overcome candle looked like you will have an idea of what miss pondar looked like when she found out lord edward was a dog i think that for one brief moment she hugged to her bosom the fond belief that i was intimate with the aristocracy and that a noble lord had he not departed this life would have been the first to welcome me home and that sheshe herselfwas in my service but the drop was an awful one i could see the throes of mortified disappointment in her back as she leaned over a bed of pinks pulling out young plants i am afraid as well as weeds when i looked at her i was sorry i let her know it was a dog i mourned she has tried so hard to make everything all right while we have been here that she might just as well have gone on thinking that it was a noble earl who died  tomorrow morning we shall have our last devonshire clotted cream for they tell me this is to be had only in the west of england and when i think of the beautiful hills and vales of this country i shall not forget that  of course we would not have time to stay here longer even if jone hadnt got the rheumatism but if he had to have it for which i am as sorry as anybody can be it is a lucky thing that he did have it just about the time that we ought to be going away anyhow and although i did not think when we came to england that we should ever go to buxton we are thankful that there is such a place to go to although for my part i cant help feeling disappointed that the season isnt such that we could go to bath and evelina and beau brummel     letter number fourteen   illustration  bell hotel gloucester  we came to this queer old english town not because it is any better than so many other towns but because mr poplington told us it was a good place for our headquarters while we was seeing the river wye and other things in the neighborhood this hotel is the best in the town and very well kept so that jone made his usual remark about its being a good place to stay in we are near the point where the four principal streets of the town called northgate eastgate southgate and westgate meet and if there was nothing else to see it would be worth while to stand there and look at so much englishism coming and going from four different quarters  there is another hotel here called the new inn that was recommended to us but i thought we would not want to go there for we came to see old england and i dont want to see its new and shiny things so we came to the bell as being more antique but i have since found out that the new inn was built in 1450 to accommodate the pilgrims who came to pay their respects to the tomb of edward ii in the fine old cathedral here but though i should like to live in a fourhundredand fortyyearold house we are very well satisfied where we are  two very good things come from gloucester for it is the wellspring of sunday schools and vaccination they keep here the horns of the cow that dr jenner first vaccinated from and not far from our hotel is the house of robert raikes this is an oldfashioned timber house and looks like a man wearing his skeleton outside of his skin we are sorry mr poplington couldnt come here with us for he could have shown us a great many things but he stayed at chedcombe to finish his fishing and he said he might meet us at buxton where he goes every year for his arm  to see the river wye you must go down it so with just one handbag we took the train for the little town of ross which is near the beginning of the navigable part of the riveri might almost say the wadeable part for i imagine the deepest soundings about ross are not more than half a yard we stayed all night at a hotel overlooking the valley of the little river and as the best way to see this wonderful stream is to go down it in a rowboat as soon as we reached ross we engaged a boat and a man for the next morning to take us to monmouth which would be about a days row and give us the best part of the river but i must say that when we looked out over the valley the prospect was not very encouraging for it seemed to me that if the sun came out hot it would dry up that river and jone might not be willing to wait until the next heavy rain  while we was at chedcombe i read the maid of sker because its scenes are laid in the bristol channel about the coast near where we was and over in wales and when the next morning we went down to the boat which we was going to take our days trip in and i saw the man who was to row us david llewellyn popped straight into my mind  this man was elderly with gray hair and a beard under his chin with a general air of water and fish he was goodnatured and sociable from the very beginning it seemed a shame that an old man should row two people so much younger than he was but after i had looked at him pulling at his oars for a little while i saw that there was no need of pitying him  it was a good day with only one or two drizzles in the morning and we had not gone far before i found that the wye was more of a river than i thought it was though never any bigger than a creek it was just about warm enough for a boat trip though the old man told us there had been a rime that morning which made me think of the ancient mariner the more the boatman talked and made queer jokes the more i wanted to ask him his name and i hoped he would say david llewellyn or at least david and as a sort of feeler i asked him if he had ever seen a coracle a corkle said he oh yes maam ive seen many a one and rowed in them  i couldnt wait any longer and so i asked him his name he stopped rowing and leaned on his oars and let the boat drift now said he if youve got a piece of paper and a pencil i wish you would listen careful and put down my name and if you ever know of any other people in your country coming to the river wye i wish you would tell them my name and say i am a boatman and can take them down the river better than anybody else thats on it my name is samivel jones be sure youve got that right pleasesamivel jones i was born on this river and i rowed on it with my father when i was a boy and i have rowed on it ever since and now i am sixtyfive years old do you want to know why this river is called the wye i will tell you wye means crooked so this river is called the wye because it is crooked wye the crooked river  there was no doubt about the old mans being right about the crookedness of the stream if you have ever noticed an ant running over the floor you will have an idea how the wye runs through this beautiful country if it comes to a hill it doesnt just pass it and let you see one side of it but it goes as far around it as it can and then goes back again and goes around some other hill or great rocky point or a clump of woods or anything else that travellers might like to see at one place called symonds yat it makes a curve so great that if we was to get out of our boat and walk across the land we would have to walk less than half a mile before we came to the river again but to row around the curve as we did we had to go five miles  every now and then we came to rapids i didnt count them but i think there must have been about one to every mile where the riverbed was full of rocks and where the water rushed furiously around and over them if we had been rowing ourselves we would have gone on shore and camped when we came to the first of these rapids for we wouldnt have supposed our little boat could go through those tumbling rushing waters but old samivel knew exactly how the narrow channel just deep enough sometimes for our boat to float without bumping the bottom runs and twists itself among the hidden rocks and hed stand up in the bow and push the boat this way and that until it slid into the quiet water again and he sat down to his oars after we had been through four or five of these we didnt feel any more afraid than if we had been sitting together on our own little back porch  as for the banks of this river they got more and more beautiful as we went on there was high hills with some castles woods and crags and grassy slopes and now and then a lordly mansion or two and great massive rocky walls bedecked with vines and moss rising high up above our heads and shutting us out from the world  jone and i was filled as full as our minds could hold with the romantic loveliness of the river and its banks and old samivel was so pleased to see how we liked itfor i believe he looked upon that river as his private propertythat he told us about everything we saw and pointed out a lot of things we wouldnt have noticed if it hadnt been for him as if he had been a man explaining a panorama and pointing out with a stick the notable spots as the canvas unrolled  the only thing in his show which didnt satisfy him was two very fine houses which had both of them belonged to noble personages in days gone by but which had been sold one to a man who had made his money in tea and the other to a man who had made money in cotton think of that said he cotton and tea and living in such mansions as them are once owned by lords they are both good men and gives a great deal to the poor and does all they can for the country but only think of it madam cotton and tea but all that happened a good while ago and the world is getting too enlightened now for such estates as them are to come to cotton and tea  sometimes we passed houses and little settlements but for the most part the country was as wild as undiscovered lands which being that to me i felt happier i am sure than columbus did when he first sighted floating weeds jone was a good deal wound up too for he had never seen anything so beautiful as all this we had our luncheon at a little inn where the bread was so good that for a time i forgot the scenery and then we went on passing through the forest of dean lonely and solemn with great oak and beech trees and robin hood and his merry men watching us from behind the bushes for all we knew whenever the river twists itself around as if to show us a new view old samivel would say now isnt that the prettiest thing youve seen yet and he got prouder and prouder of his river every mile he rowed  at one place he stopped and rested on his oars now then said he twinkling up his face as if he was really david llewellyn showing us a fish with its eyes bulged out with sticks to make it look fresh as we are out on a kind of a lark suppose we try a bit of a hecho and then he turned to a rocky valley on his left and in a voice like the man at the station calling out the trains he yelled hello there sir what are you doing there sir come out of that and when the words came back as if they had been balls batted against a wall he turned and looked at us as proud and grinny as if the rocks had been his own baby saying papa and mamma for visitors  not long after this we came to a place where there was a wide field on one side and a little way off we could see the top of a house among the trees a hedge came across the field to the river and near the bank was a big gate and on this gate sat two young women and down on the ground on the side of the hedge nearest to us was another young woman and not far from her was three black hogs two of them pointing their noses at her and grunting and the other was grunting around a place where those young women had been making sketches and drawings and punching his nose into the easels and portfolios on the ground the young woman on the grass was striking at the hogs with a stick and trying to make them go away which they wouldnt do and just as we came near she dropped the stick and ran and climbed up on the gate beside the others after which all the hogs went to rooting among the drawing things  as soon as samivel saw what was going on he stopped his boat and shouted to the hogs a great deal louder than he had shouted to the echo but they didnt mind any more than they had minded the girl with the stick cant we stop the boat i said and get out and drive off those hogs they will eat up all the papers and sketches  just put me ashore said jone and ill clear them out in no time and old samivel rowed the boat close up to the bank  but when jone got suddenly up on his feet there was such a twitch across his face that i said to him now just you sit down if you go ashore to drive off those hogs youll jump about so that youll bring on such a rheumatism you cant sleep  ill get out myself said samivel if i can find a place to fasten the boat to i cant run her ashore here and the current is strong  dont you leave the boat said i for the thought of jone and me drifting off and coming without him to one of those rapids sent a shudder through me and as the stern of the boat where i sat was close to the shore i jumped with jones stick in my hand before either of them could hinder me i was so afraid that jone would do it that i was very quick about it  the minute i left the boat jone got ready to come after me for he had no notion of letting me be on shore by myself but the boat had drifted off a little and old samivel said  that is a pretty steep bank to get up with the rheumatism on you ill take you a little farther down where i can ground the boat and you can get off more steadier  but this letter is getting as long as the river wye itself and i must stop it     letter number fifteen   bell hotel gloucester  as soon as i jumped on shore as i told you in my last and had taken a good grip on jones heavy stick i went for those hogs for i wanted to drive them off before jone came ashore for i didnt want him to think he must come  i have driven hogs and cows out of lots and yards often enough as you know yourself madam so i just stepped up to the biggest of them and hit him a whack across the head as he was rubbing his nose in among some papers with bits of landscapes on them as was enough to make him give up studying art for the rest of his life but would you believe it madam instead of running away he just made a bolt at me and gave me such a push with his head and shoulders he nearly knocked me over i never was so astonished for they looked like hogs that you might think could be chased out of a yard by a boy but i gave the fellow another crack on the back which he didnt seem to notice but just turned again to give me another push and at the same minute the two others stopped rooting among the paintboxes and came grunting at me  for the first time in my life i was frightened by hogs i struck at them as hard as i could and before i knew what i was about i flung down the stick made a rush for that gate and was on top of it in no time in company with the three other young women that was sitting there already  really said the one next to me i fancied you was going to be gored to atoms before our eyes whatever made you go to those nasty beasts  i looked at her quite severe getting my feet well up out of reach of the hogs if they should come near us  i saw you was in trouble miss and i came to help you my husband wanted to come but he has the rheumatism and i wouldnt let him  the other two young women looked at me as well as they could around the one that was near me and the one that was farthest off said  if the creatures could have been driven off by a woman we could have done it ourselves i dont know why you should think you could do it any better than we could  i must say madam that at that minute i was a little humbleminded for i dont mind confessing to you that the idea of one american woman plunging into a conflict that had frightened off three english women and coming out victorious had a good deal to do with my trying to drive away those hogs and now that i had come out of the little end of the horn just as the young women had i felt pretty small but i wasnt going to let them see that  i think that english hogs said i must be savager than american ones where i live there is not any kind of a hog that would not run away if i shook a stick at him the young woman at the other end of the gate now spoke again  everything british is braver than anything american said she and all you have done has been to vex those hogs and they are chewing up our drawing things worse than they did before  of course i fired up at this and said you are very much mistaken about americans but before i could say any more she went on to tell me that she knew all about americans she had been in america and such a place she could never have fancied  over there you let everybody trample over you as much as they please you have no conveniences one cannot even get a cab fancy not a cab to be had unless one pays enough for a drive in hyde park  i must say that the hogs charging down on me didnt astonish me any more than to find myself on top of a gate with a young woman charging on my country in this fashion and it was pretty hard on me to have her pitch into the cab question because jone and me had had quite a good deal to say about cabs ourselves comparing new york and london without any great fluttering of the stars and stripes but i wasnt going to stand any such talk as that and so i said  i know very well that our cab charges are high and it is not likely that poor people coming from other countries are able to pay them but as soon as our big cities get filled up with wretched halfstarved people with the children crying for bread at home and the father glad enough that hes able to get people to pay him a shilling for a drive and that hes not among the hundreds and thousands of miserable men who have not any work at all and go howling to hyde park to hold meetings for blood or bread then we will be likely to have cheap cabs as you have  how perfectly awful said the young woman nearest me but the one at the other end of the gate didnt seem to mind what i said but shifted off on another track  and then theres your horses tails said she anything nastier couldnt be fancied hundreds of them everywhere with long tails down to their heels as if they belong to heathens who had never been civilized  heathens said i if you call the arabians heathens who have the finest horses in the world and wouldnt any more think of cutting off their tails than they would think of cutting their legs off and if you call the cruel scoundrels who torture their poor horses by sawing their bones apart so as to get a little stuckup bob on behind like a motheaten paintbrushif you call them christians then i suppose youre right there is a law in some parts of our country against the wickedness of chopping off the tails of live horses and if you had such a law here youd be a good deal more christianlike than you are to say nothing of getting credit for decent taste  by this time i had forgotten all about what jone and i had agreed upon as to arguing over the differences between countries and i was just as peppery as a wasp the young woman at the other end of the gate was rather waspy too for she seemed to want to sting me wherever she could find a spot uncovered and now she dropped off her horses tails and began to laugh until her face got purple  you americans are so awfully odd she said you say you raise your corn and your plants instead of growing them it nearly makes me die laughing when i hear one of you americans say raise when you mean grow  now jone and me had some talk about growing and raising and the reasons for and against our way of using the words but i was ready to throw all this to the winds and was just about to tell the impudent young woman that we raised our plants just the same as we raised our children leaving them to do their own growing when the young woman in the middle of the three who up to this time hadnt said a word screamed out  illustration and with a screech i dashed at those hogs like a steam engine  oh dear oh dear hes pulled out my drawing of wilton bridge hell eat it up oh dear oh dear whatever shall i do  instead of speaking i turned quick and looked at the hogs and there sure enough one of them had rooted open a portfolio and had hold of the corners of a colored picture which from where i sat i could see was perfectly beautiful the sky and the trees and the water was just like what we ourselves had seen a little while ago and in about half a minute that hog would chew it up and swallow it  the young woman next to me had an umbrella in her hand i made a snatch at this and dropped off that gate like a shot i didnt stop to think about anything except that beautiful picture was on the point of being swallowed up and with a screech i dashed at those hogs like a steam engine when they saw me coming with my screech and the umbrella they didnt stop a second but with three great wiggles and three scared grunts they bolted as fast as they could go i picked up the picture of the bridge together with the portfolio and took them to the young woman who owned them as the hogs had gone all three of the women was now getting down from the gate  thank you very much she said for saving my drawings it was awfully good of you especially  oh you are welcome said i cutting her off short and handing the other young woman her umbrella i passed by the impudent one without so much as looking at her and on the other side of the hedge i saw jone coming across the grass i jerked open the gate not caring who it might swing against and walked to meet jone when i was near enough i called out to know what on earth had become of him that he had left me there so long by myself forgetting that i hadnt wanted him to come at all and he told me that he had had a hard time getting on shore because they found the banks very low and muddy and when he had landed he was on the wrong side of a hedge and had to walk a good way around it  i was troubled said he because i thought you might come to grief with the hogs  hogs said i so sarcastic that jone looked hard at me but i didnt tell him anything more till we was in the boat and then i just said right out what had happened jone couldnt help laughing  if i had known said he that you was on top of a gate discussing horses tails and cabs i wouldnt have felt in such a hurry to get to you  and you would have made a mistake if you hadnt i said for hogs are nothing to such a person as was on that gate  old samivel was rowing slow and looking troubled and i believe at that minute he forgot the river wye was crooked  that was really hard madam he said really hard on you but it was a woman and you have to excuse women now if they had been three englishmen sitting on that gate they would never have said such things to you knowing that you was a stranger in these parts and had come on shore to do them a service and now madam im glad to see you are beginning to take notice of the landscapes again just ahead of us is another bend and when we get around that youll see the prettiest picture youve seen yet this is a crooked river madam and thats how it got its name wye means crooked  after a while we came to a little church near the river bank and here samivel stopped rowing and putting his hands on his knees he laughed gayly  it always makes me laugh he said whenever i pass this spot it seems to me like such an awful good joke heres that church on this side of the river and away over there on the other side of the river is the rector and the congregation  and how do they get to church said i  in the summer time said he they come over with a ferryboat and a rope but in the winter when the water is frozen they cant get over at all manys the time ive lain in bed and laughed and laughed when i thought of this church on one side of the river and the whole congregation and the rector on the other side and not able to get over  toward the end of the day and when we had rowed nearly twenty miles we saw in the distance the town of monmouth where we was going to stop for the night  illustration in the winter when the water is frozen they cant get over  old samivel asked us what hotel we was going to stop at and when we told him the one we had picked out he said he could tell us a better one  if i was you he said id go to the eyengel we didnt know what this name meant but as the old man said he would take us there we agreed to go  i should think you would have a lonely time rowing back by yourself i said  rowing back said he why bless your soul lady there isnt nobody who could row this boat back agen that current and up them rapids we take the boats back with the pony we put the boat on a wagon and the pony pulls it back to ross and as for me i generally go back by the train it isnt so far from monmouth to ross by the road for the road is straight and the river winds and bends  the old man took us to the inn which he recommended and we found it was the angel it was a nice oldfashioned queer english house as far as i could see they was all women that managed it and it couldnt have been managed better and as far as i could see we was the only guests unless there was commercial gents who took themselves away without our seeing them  we was sorry to have old samivel leave us and we bid him a most friendly goodby and promised if we ever knew of anybody who wanted to go down the river wye we would recommend them to ask at ross for samivel jones to row them  we found the landlady of the angel just as good to us as if we had been her favorite niece and nephew she hired us a carriage the next day and we was driven out to raglan castle through miles and miles of green and sloping ruralness when we got there and rambled through those grand old ruins with the drawbridge and the tower and the courtyard my soul went straight back to the days of knights and ladies and prancing steeds and horns and hawks and pages and tournaments and wild revels and vaulted halls  the young man who had charge of the place seemed glad to see how much we liked it as is natural enough for everybody likes to see us pleased with the particular things they have on hand  you havent anything like this in your country said he but to this i said nothing for i was tired of always hearing people speak of my national denomination as if i was something in tin cans with a label pasted on outside but jone said it was true enough that we didnt have anything like it for if we had such a noble edifice we would have taken care of it and not let it go to rack and ruin in this way  jone has an idea that it dont show good sense to knock a bit of furniture about from garret to cellar until most of its legs are broken and its back cracked and its varnish all peeled off and then tie ribbons around it and hang it up in the parlor and kneel down to it as a relic of the past he says that people who have got old ruins ought to be very thankful that there is any of them left but its no use in them trying to fill up the missing parts with brag  we took the train and went to chepstow which is near the mouth of the wye and as the railroad ran near the river nearly all the way we had lots of beautiful views though of course it wasnt anything like as good as rowing along the stream in a boat the next day we drove to the celebrated tintern abbey and on the way the road passed two miles and a half of high stone wall which shut in a gentlemans place what he wanted to keep in or keep out by means of a wall like that we couldnt imagine but the place made me think of a lunatic asylum  the road soon became shady and beautiful running through woods along the river bank and under some great crags called the wyndcliffe and then we came to the abbey and got out  of all the beautiful highpointed archery of ancient times this ruined abbey takes the lead i expect youve seen it madam or read about it and i am not going to describe it but i will just say that jone who had rather objected to coming out to see any more old ruins which he never did fancy and only came because he wouldnt have me come by myself was so touched up in his soul by what he saw there and by wandering through this solemn and beautiful romance of bygone days he said he wouldnt have missed it for fifty dollars  we came back to gloucester today and tomorrow we are off for buxton as we are so near stratford and warwick and all that jone said wed better go there on our way but i wouldnt agree to it i am too anxious to get him skipping round like a colt as he used to to stop anywhere now and when we come back i can look at shakespeares tomb with a clearer conscience                                       london  after all the weather isnt the only changeable thing in this world and this letter which i thought i was going to send to you from gloucester is now being finished in london we was expecting to start for buxton but some money that jone had ordered to be sent from london two or three days before didnt come and he thought it would be wise for him to go and look after it so yesterday which was saturday we started off for london and came straight to the babylon hotel where we had been before  of course we couldnt do anything until monday and this morning when we got up we didnt feel in very good spirits for of all the doleful things i know of a sunday in london is the dolefullest the whole town looks as if it was the back door of what it was the day before and if you want to get any good out of it you feel as if you had to sneak in by an alley instead of walking boldly up the front steps  jone said wed better go to westminster abbey to church because he believed in getting the best there was when it didnt cost too much but i wouldnt do it  illustration who do you suppose we met mr poplington  no said i when i walk in that religious nave and into the hallowed precincts of the talented departed the stone passages are full of cloudy forms of chaucers addisons miltons dickenses and all those great ones of the past and i would hate to see the place filled up with a crowd of weekday lay people in their sunday clothes which would be enough to wipe away every feeling of romantic piety which might rise within my breast  as we didnt go to the abbey and was so long making up our minds where we should go it got too late to go anywhere and so we stayed in the hotel and looked out into a lonely and deserted street with the wind blowing the little leaves and straws against the tightshut doors of the forsaken houses as i stood by that window i got homesick and at last i could stand it no longer and i said to jone who was smoking and reading a paper  lets put on our hats and go out for a walk for i cant mope here another minute  so down we went and coming up the front steps of the front entrance who do you suppose we met mr poplington he was stopping at that hotel and was just coming home from church with his face shining like a sunset on account of the comfortableness of his conscience after doing his duty     letter number sixteen   buxton  when i mentioned mr poplington in my last letter in connection with the setting sun i was wrong he was like the rising orb of day and he filled london with effulgent light no sooner had we had a talk and we had told him all that had happened and finished up by saying what a doleful morning we had had than he clapped his hand on his knees and said ill tell you what we will do we will spend the afternoon among the landmarks and what we did was to take a fourwheeler and go around the old parts of london where mr poplington showed us a lot of soulawakening spots which no common stranger would be likely to find for himself  if you are ever steeped in the solemnness of a london sunday and you can get a jolly redfaced middleaged english gentleman who has made himself happy by going to church in the morning and is ready to make anybody else happy in the afternoon just stir him up in the mixture and then you will know the difference between codliver oil and champagne even if you have never tasted either of them the afternoon was piledupandpresseddown joyfulness for me and i seemed to be walking in a dream among the beings and the things that we only see in books  mr poplington first took us to the old watergate which was the river entrance to york house where lord bacon lived and close to the gate was the small house where peter the great and david copperfield lived though not at the same time and then we went to wills old coffeehouse where addison steele and a lot of other people of that sort used to go to drink and smoke before they was buried in westminster abbey and where charles and mary lamb lived afterward and where mary used to look out of the window to see the constables take the thieves to the old bailey near by then we went to tomallalones and saw the very grating at the head of the steps which led to the old graveyard where poor joe used to sweep the steps when lady dedlock came there and i held on to the very bars that the poor lady must have gripped when she knelt on the steps to die  not far away was the black jack tavern where jack sheppard and all the great thieves of the day used to meet and bless me i have read so much about jack sheppard that i could fairly see him jumping out of the window he always dropped from when the police came after that we saw the house where mr tulkinghorn lady dedlocks lawyer used to live and also the house where old krook was burned up by spontaneous combustion then we went to bolt court where old samuel johnson lived walked about and talked and then to another court where he lived when he wrote the dictionary and after that to the cheshire cheese inn where he and oliver goldsmith often used to take their meals together  then we saw st johns gate where the knights templars met and the yard of the court of chancery where little miss flite used to wait for the day of judgment and as we was coming home he showed us the church of st martinsinthefields where every other friday the bells are rung at five oclock in the afternoon most people not knowing what it is for but really because the famous nell gwynn who was far from being a churchwoman left a sum of money for having a merry peal of bells rung every friday until the end of the world i got so wound up by all this that i quite forgot jone and hardly thought of mr poplington except that he was telling me all these things and bringing back to my mind so much that i had read about though sometimes very little  when we got back to the hotel and had gone up to our room jone said to me  that was all very fine and interesting from top to toe but it does seem to me as if things were dreadfully mixed dr johnson and jack sheppard i suppose was all real and could live in houses but when it comes to david copperfields and lady dedlocks and little miss flites that wasnt real and never lived at all they was all talked about in just the same way and their favorite tramping grounds pointed out and i cant separate the real people from the fancy folk if weve got to have the same bosom heaving for the whole of them  jone said i they are all real every one of them if mr dickens had written history i expect hed put lady dedlock and miss flite and david copperfield into it and if the history writers had written stories they would have been sure to get dr johnson and lord bacon and peter the great into them and the people in the one kind of writing would have been just as real as the people in the other at any rate thats the way they are to me  on the monday after our landmark expedition with mr poplington which i shall never forget jone settled up his business matters and the next day we started for buxton and the rheumatism baths to our great delight mr poplington said he would go with us not all the way for he wanted to stop at a little place called rowsley where he would stay for a few days and then go on to buxton but we was very glad to have him with us during the greater part of the way and we all left the hotel in the same fourwheeler  when we got to the station jone got firstclass tickets for we have found out that if you want to travel comfortable in england and have porters attend to your baggage and find an empty carriage for you and have the guard come along and smile in the window and say hell try to let you have that carriage all to yourselves if hes ablethe ableness depending a good deal on what you give himand for everybody to do their best to make your journey pleasant you must travel first class mr poplington also bought a firstclass ticket for there was no seconds on this line as we was walking along by the platform jone and i gave a sort of a jump for there was a regular pullman car which made us think we might be at home we stopped and looked at it and then the guard who was standing by stepped up to us and touched his hat and asked us if we would like to take the pullman and when jone asked what the extra charge was he said nothing at all for firstclass passengers we didnt have to stop to think a minute but said right off that we would go in it but mr poplington would not come with us he said english people wasnt accustomed to that they wanted to be more private and although hed like to be with us he could not travel in a caravan like that and so he went off by himself and we got into the pullman  the guard said we could take any seats we pleased and when we got in we found there was only two or three people in it and we chose two nice armchairs hung up our wraps and made ourselves comfortable and cosey  we expected that the people who engaged seats would soon come crowding in but when the train started there was only four people besides ourselves in that beautiful car which was a firstclass one built in the united states with all sorts of comforts and conveniences there was a porter who laid himself out to make us happy and about one oclock we had a nice lunch on a little table which was set up between us with two waiters to attend to us and then jone went and had a smoke in a small room at one end of the car  we thought it was strange that there should be so few people travelling on this train but when we came to a town where we made a long stop jone got out to talk to mr poplington supposing it likely that hed have a carriage to himself but he was amazed to see that the train was jammed and crowded and he found mr poplington squeezed up in a carriage with seven other people four of them one side and four the other each row staring into the faces of the other some of them was eating bread and cheese out of paper parcels and a big fat man was reading a newspaper which he spread out so as to partly cover the two people sitting next to him and all of them seemed anxious to find some way of stretching their legs so as not to strike against the legs of somebody else  mr poplington was sitting by the window and jone couldnt help laughing when he said  is this what you call being private sir i think you would find a caravan more pleasant dont you want to come to the pullman with us there are plenty of seats there nice big armchairs that you can turn around and sit any way you like and look at people or not look at them just as you please and theres plenty of room to walk about and stretch yourself a little if you want to theres a smokingroom too that you can go to and leave whenever you like come and try it  thank you very much said mr poplington but i really couldnt do that i am not prejudiced at all and i have a good many democratic ideas but that is too much for me an englishmans house is his castle and when hes travelling his railway carriage is his house he likes privacy and dislikes publicity  this is a funny kind of privacy you have here said jone and how about your big clubs would you like to have them all divided up into little compartments with half a dozen men in each one generally strangers to each other  oh a club is a very different thing said mr poplington  jone was going to talk more about the comfort of the pullman cars but they began to shut the carriage doors and he had to come back to me  we like english railway carriages very well when we can have one to ourselves but if even one stranger gets in and has to sit looking at us for all the rest of the trip you dont feel anything like as private as if you was walking along a sidewalk in london  but jone and i both agreed we wouldnt find any fault with english people for not liking pullman cars so long as they put them on their trains for americans who do like them and one thing is certain that if our railroad conductors and brakesmen and porters was as polite and kind as they are in england tips or no tips wed be a great deal better off than we are  whenever we stopped at a station the people would come and look through the windows at us as if we was some sort of a travelling show i dont believe most of them had ever seen a comfortable room on wheels before the other people in our car was all men and looked as if they hadnt their families with them and was glad to get a little comfort on the sly when we got to rowsley we saw mr poplington on the platform running about collecting all his different bits of luggage and counting them to see that they was all there and then as we had a window open and was looking out he came and bid us goodby and when i asked him to he looked into our car  oh dear oh dear he said what a public apartment i could not travel like that you know goodby i will see you at buxton in a few days  illustration mr poplington looking for the luggage  we talked a good deal with mr poplington about the hotels of buxton and we had agreed to go to one called the old hall where we are now there was a good many reasons why we chose this house one being that it was not as expensive as some of the others though very nice and another which had a good deal of force with me was that mary queen of scots came here for her rheumatism and the room she used to have is still kept with some words she scratched with her diamond ring on the windowpane sometimes people coming to this hotel can get this room and i was mighty sorry we couldnt do it but it was taken if i could have actually lived and slept in a room which had belonged to the beautiful mary queen of scots i would have been willing to have just as much rheumatism as she had when she was here  of course modern rheumatisms are not as interesting as the rheumatisms people of the past ages had but from what i have seen of this town i think i am going to like it very much     letter number seventeen   illustration  buxton  when we were comfortably settled here jone went to see a doctor who is a nice kind old gentleman who looks as if he almost might have told mary queen of scots how hot she ought to have the water in her baths he charges four times as much as the others and has about a quarter as many patients which makes it all the same to him and a good deal better for the rheumatic ones who come to him for they have more time to go into particulars and if anything does good to a person who has something the matter with him its being able to go into particulars about it its often as good as medicine and always more comforting  we unpacked our trunks and settled ourselves down for a three weeks stay here for no matter how much rheumatism you have or how little youve got to take buxton and its baths in three weeks doses  besides taking the baths jone has to drink the waters and as i cannot do much else to help him i am encouraging him by drinking them too there are two places where you can get the lukewarm water that people come here to drink one is the public well where there is a pump free to everybody and the other is in the pumproom just across the street from the well where you pay a penny a glass for the same water which three doleful old women spend all their time pumping for visitors  illustration pomona encourages jonas  people are ordered to drink this water very carefully it must be done at regular times beginning with a little and taking more and more each day until you get to a full tumbler and then if it seems to be too strong for you you must take less so far as i can find out there is nothing particular about it except that it is lukewarm water neither hot enough nor cold enough to make it a pleasant drink it didnt seem to agree with jone at first but after he kept at it three or four days it began to suit him better so that he could take nearly a tumbler without feeling badly two or three times i felt it might be better for my health if i didnt drink it but i wanted to stand by jone as much as i could and so i kept on  we have been here a week now and this morning i found out that all the water we drink at this hotel is brought from the well of st ann where the public pump is and everybody drinks just as much of it as they want whenever they want to and they never think of any such thing as feeling badly or better than if it was common water the only difference is that it isnt quite as lukewarm when we get it here as it is at the well when i was told this i was real mad after all the measuring and fussing we had had when taking the water as a medicine and then drinking it just as we pleased at the table but the people here tell me that it is the gas in it which makes it medicinal and when that floats out it is just like common water that may be but if theres a pennys worth of gas in every tumbler of water sold in the pumproom there ought to be some sort of a canopy put over the town to catch what must escape in the pourings and pumpings for its too valuable to be allowed to get away if its the gas that does it a rheumatic man anchored in a balloon over buxton and having the gas coming up unmixed to him ought to be well in about two days  when jone told me his first bath was to be heated up to ninetyfour degrees i said to him that hed be boiled alive but he wasnt and when he came home he said he liked it everything is very systematic in the great bathinghouse the man who tends to jone hangs up his watch on a little stand on the edge of the bathtub and he stays in just so many minutes and when hes ready to come out he rings a bell and then hes wrapped up in about fourteen hot towels and sits in an armchair until hes dry jone likes all this and says so much about it that it makes me want to try it too though as there isnt any reason for it i havent tried them yet  this is an awfully queer oldfashioned town and must have been a good deal like bath in the days of evelina there is a long line of high buildings curved like a half moon which is called the crescent and at one end of this is a pumproom and at the other are the natural baths where the water is just as warm as when it comes out of the ground which is eightytwo degrees this is said to chill people but from what i remember about summer time i dont see how eightytwo degrees can be cold  opposite the crescent is a public park called the slopes and farther on there are great gardens with pavilions and a band of music every day and a theatre and a little river and tennis courts and all sorts of things for people who havent anything to do with their time which is generally the case with folks at rheumatic wateringplaces opposite to our hotel is a bowling court which they say has been there for hundreds of years and is just as hard and smooth as a boys slate the men who play bowls here are generally those who have got over the rheumatism of their youth and whose joints have not been very much stiffened up yet by old age the people who are yet too young for rheumatism and have come here with their families play tennis  the baths take such a little time not over six or seven minutes for them each day and every third day skipped that there is a good deal of time left on the hands of the people here and those who cant play tennis or bowl and dont want to spend the whole time in the pavilion listening to the music go about in bathchairs which so far as i can see are just as important as the baths i dont know whether you ever saw a bathchair madam but its a comfortable little cab on three wheels pulled by a man they take people everywhere and all the streets are full of them  as soon as i saw these nice little traps i said to jone now this is the very thing for you it hurts you to walk far and you want to see all over this town and one of these bathchairs will take you into lots of places where you couldnt go in a carriage  take me said jone i should say not you dont catch me being hauled about in one of those things as if i was in a sort of wheelbarrow ambulance being taken to the hospital with you walking along by my side like a trained nurse no indeed i have not gone so far as that yet  i told him this was all stuff and nonsense and if he wanted to get the good out of buxton hed better go about and see it and he couldnt go about if he didnt take a bathchair but all he said to that was that he could see it without going about and he was satisfied but that didnt count anything with me for the trouble with jone is that hes too easy satisfied  its true that there is a lot to be seen in buxton without going about the slopes are just across the street from the hotel and when it doesnt happen to be raining we can go and sit there on a bench and see lively times enough people are being trundled about in their bathchairs in every direction there is always a crowd at st anns well where the pump is all sorts of cabs and carts are being driven up and down just as fast as they can go for the streets are as smooth as floors and in the morning and evening there are about half a dozen coaches with four horses and drivers and hornblowers in red coats the horses prancing and whips cracking as they start out for country trips or come back again and as for the people on foot they just swarm like bees and rain makes no difference except that then they wear mackintoshes and when its fine they dont some of these people step along as brisk as if they hadnt anything the matter with them but a good many of them help out their legs with canes and crutches i begin to think i can tell how long a man has been at buxton by the number of sticks he uses  one day we was sitting on a bench in the slopes enjoying a bit of sunshine that had just come along when a middleaged man with a very high collar and a silk hat came and sat down by jone he spoke civilly to us and then went on to say that if ever we happened to take a house near liverpool hed be glad to supply us with coals because he was a coal merchant jone told him that if he ever did take a house near liverpool he certainly would give him his custom then the man gave us his card i come here every year he said for the rheumatism in my shoulder and if i meet anybody that lives near liverpool or is likely to i try to get his custom i like it here theres a good many otels in this town you can see a lot of them from here theres st anns thats a good house but they charge you a pound a day and then theres the old hall thats good enough too but nobody goes there except shopkeepers and clergymen of course i dont mean bishops they go to st anns  i wondered which the man would think jone was if he knew we was stopping at the old hall but i didnt ask him and only said that other people besides shopkeepers and clergymen went to the old hall for mary queen of scots used to stop at that house when she came to take the waters and her room was still there just as it used to be  mary queen of scots said he at the old hall  yes said i thats where she used to go that was her hotel  queen mary queen of the scots he said again well well i wouldnt have believed it but them scotch people always was closefisted now if it had been queen elizabeth she wouldnt have minded a pound a day and then after asking jone to excuse him for forgetting his manners and not asking where his rheumatism was and having got his answer he went away wondering i expect how mary queen of scots could have been so stingy  but although we could see so much sitting on benches i didnt give up jone and the bathchairs and day before yesterday i got the better of him now said i it is stupid for you to be sitting around in this way as if you was a statue of a public benefactor carved by subscription and set up in a park the only sensible thing for you to do is to take a bathchair and go around and see things and if you are afraid people will think you are being taken to a hospital you can put down the top of the thing and sit up straight and smoke your pipe patients in ambulances never smoke pipes and if you dont want me walking by your side like a trained nurse ill take another chair and be pulled along with you  the idea of a pipe and me being in another chair rather struck his fancy and he said he would consider it and so that afternoon we went to the hotel door and looked at the long line of bathchairs standing at the curbstone on the other side of the street with the men waiting for jobs the chairs was all pretty much alike and looked very comfortable but the men was as different as if they had been horses some looked gay and spirited and others tired and worn out as if they had belonged to sporting men and had been driven half to death and then again there was some that looked fat and lazy like the old horses on a farm that the women drive to town  jone picked out a good man who looked as if he was well broken and not afraid of locomotives and able to do good work in single harness when i got jone in the bathchair with the buggytop down and his pipe lighted and his hat cocked on one side a little so as to look as if he was doing the whole thing for a lark i called another chair not caring what sort of one it was and then we told the men to pull us around for a couple of hours leaving it to them to take us to agreeable spots which they said they would do  after we got started jone seemed to like it very well and we went pretty much all over the town sometimes stopping to look in at the shop windows for the sidewalks are so narrow that it is no trouble to see the things from the street then the men took us a little way out of the town to a place where there was a good view for us and a bench where they could go and sit down and rest i expect all the chair men that work by the hour manage to get to this place with a view as soon as they can  after they had had a good rest we started off to go home by a different route jones man was a good strong fellow and always took the lead but my puller was a different kind of a steed and sometimes i was left pretty far behind i had not paid much attention to the man at first only noticing that he was mighty slow but going back a good deal of the way was uphill and then all his imperfections came out plain and i couldnt help studying him if he had been a horse i should have said he was spavined and foundered with split frogs and tonsilitis but as he was a man it struck me that he must have had several different kinds of rheumatism and been sent to buxton to have them cured but not taking the baths properly or drinking the water at times when he ought not to have done it his rheumatisms had all run together and had become fixed and immovable how such a creaky person came to be a bathchair man i could not think but it may be that he wanted to stay in buxton for the sake of the loose gas which could be had for nothing and that bathchairing was all he could get to do  i pitied the poor old fellow who if he had been a horse would have been no more than fourteen hands high and as he went puffing along tugging and grunting as if i was a load of coal i felt as if i couldnt stand it another minute and i called out to him to stop it did seem as if he would drop before he got me back to the hotel and i bounced out in no time and then i walked in front of him and turned around and looked at him if it is possible for a human hackhorse to have spavins in two joints in each leg that man had them and he looked as if he couldnt remember what it was to have a good feed  he seemed glad to rest but didnt say anything standing and looking straight ahead of him like an old horse that has been stopped to let him blow he did look so dreadful feeble that i thought it would be a mercy to take him to some member of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and have him chloroformed look here said i you are not fit to walk get into that bathchair and ill pull you back to your stand  lady said he i couldnt do that if you dunno mind walking home and will pay me for the two hours all the same i will be right thankful for that im poorly today  get into the chair said i and ill pull you back id like to do it for i want some exercise  oh no no said he that would be a sin and besides i was engaged to pull you two hours and i must be paid for that  get into that chair i said and ill pay you for your two hours and give you a shilling besides  he looked at me for a minute and then he got into the chair and i shut him up  now lady said he you can pull me a little way if you want exercise and as soon as you are tired you can stop and ill get out but you must pay me the extra shilling all the same  all right said i and taking hold of the handle i started off it was real fun the bathchair rolled along beautifully and i dont believe the old man weighed much more than my corinne when i used to push her about in her baby carriage we were in a back street where there was hardly anybody and as for jone and his bathchair i could just see them ever so far ahead so i started to catch up and as the street was pretty level now i soon got going at a fine rate i hadnt had a bit of good exercise for a long time and this warmed me up and made me feel gay  illustration stop lady and ill get out  we was not very far behind jone when the man began to call to me in a sort of frightened fashion as if he thought i was running away stop lady he said we are getting near the gardens and the people will laugh at me stop lady and ill get out but i didnt feel a bit like stopping the idea had come into my head that it would be jolly to beat jone if i could pass him and sail on ahead for a little while then id stop and let my old man get out and take his bathchair home i didnt want it any more  just as i got close up behind jone and was about to make a rush past him his man turned into a side street of course i turned too and then i put on steam and giving a laugh as i turned around to look at jone i charged on intending to stop in a minute and have some fun in hearing what jone had to say about it but you may believe maam that i was amazed when i saw only a little way in front of me the bathchair stand where we had hired our machines and all the bathchair men were standing there with their mouths wide open staring at a woman running along the street pulling an old bathchair man in a bathchair for a second i felt like dropping the handle i held and making a rush for the front door of the hotel which was right ahead of me and then i thought as now i was in for it it would be a lot better to put a good face on the matter and not look as if i had done anything i was ashamed of and so i just slackened speed and came up in fine style at the door of the old hall four or five of the bathchair men came running across the street to know if anything had happened to the old party i was pulling and he got out looking as ashamed as if he had been whipped by his wife  its a lark mates said he the ladys to pay me two shillings extra for letting her pull me  two shillings said i i only promised you one  that would be for pulling me a little way he said but you pulled me all the way back and i couldnt do it for less than two shillings  jone now came up and got out quick  whats the meaning of all this pomona said he  meaning said i look at that dilapidated old bag of bones he wasnt fit to pull me and so i thought it would be fun to pull him but of course i didnt know when i turned the corner i would be here at the stand  jone paid the men including the two extra shillings and when we went up to our room he said the next time we go out in two bathchairs i am going to have a chain fastened to yours and ill have hold of the other end of it     letter number eighteen   buxton  i have begun to take the baths there really is so little to do in this place that i couldnt help it and so while jone was off tending to his hot soaks i thought i might as well try the thing myself at any rate it would fill up the time when i was alone i find i like this sort of bathing very much and i wish i had begun it before it reminds me of a kind of medicine for colds that you used to make for me madam when i first came to the canalboat it had lemons and sugar in it and it was so good i remember i used to think that i would like to go into a lingering consumption so that i could have it three times a day until i finally passed away like a lily on a snowbank  jones been going about a good deal in a bathchair and doesnt mind my walking alongside of him he says it makes him feel easier in his mind on the whole  mr poplington came two or three days ago and he is stopping at our hotel we three have hired a carriage together two or three times and have taken drives into the country once we went to an inn the cat and fiddle about five miles away on a high bit of ground called axe edge it is said to be the highest tavern in england and its lucky that it is for thats the only recommendation its got the sign in front of the house has on it a cat on its hindlegs playing a fiddle with a look on its face as if it was saying its pretty poor but its the best i can do for you  inside is another painting of a cat playing a fiddle and truly that one might be saying ha ha you thought that that picture on the sign was the worst picture you ever saw in your life but now you see how you are mistaken  up on that high place you get the rain fresher than you do in buxton because it hasnt gone so far through the air and its mixed with more chilly winds than anywhere else in england i should say but everybody is bound to go to the cat and fiddle at least once and we are glad we have been there and that it is over i like the places near the town a great deal better and some of them are very pretty one day we two and mr poplington took a ride on top of a stage to see haddon hall and chatsworth  haddon hall is to me like a dream of the past come true lots of other old places have seemed like dreams but this one was right before my eyes just as it always was of course you must have read all about it madam and i am not going to tell it over again but think of it a grand old baronial mansion part of it built as far back as the eleven hundreds and yet in good condition and fit to live in that is what i thought as i walked through its banqueting hall and courts and noble chambers why said i to jone in that kitchen our meals could be cooked at that table we could eat them in these rooms we could sleep in these gardens and courts we could roam we could actually live here we havent seen any other romance of the past that we could say that about and to this minute it puzzles me how any duke in this world could be content to own a house like this and not live in it but i suppose he thinks more of waterpipes and electric lights than he does of the memories of the past and timehallowed traditions  as for me if i had been dorothy vernon theres no man on earth not even jone that could make me run away from such a place as haddon hall they show the stairs down which she tripped with her lover when they eloped but if it had been me it would have been up those stairs i would have gone mr poplington didnt agree a bit with me about the joy of living in this enchanting old house and neither did jone i am sure although he didnt say so much but then they are both men and when it comes to soaring in the regions of romanticism you must not expect too much of men  after leaving haddon hall which i did backward the coach took us to chatsworth which is a different sort of a place altogether it is a grand palace at least it was built for one but now it is an enormous show place bright and clean and sleek and when we got there we saw hundreds of visitors waiting to go in they was taken through in squads of about fifty with a man to lead them which he did very much as if they was a drove of cattle  the man who led our squad made us step along lively and i must say that never having been in a drove before jone and i began to get restive long before we got through as for the show i like the british museum a great deal better there is ever so much more to see there and you have time to stop and look at things at chatsworth they charge you more give you less and treat you worse when it came to taking us through the grounds jone and i struck we left the gang we was with and being shown where to find a gate out of the place we made for that gate and waited until our coach was ready to take us back to buxton  it is a lot of fun going to the theatre here it doesnt cost much and the plays are good and generally funny and a rheumatic audience is a very jolly one the people seemed glad to forget their backs their shoulders and their legs and they are ready to laugh at things that are only half comic and keep up a lively chattering between the acts its fun to see them when the play is over the bathchairs that have come after some of them are brought right into the building and are drawn up just like carriages after the theatre the first time we went i wanted jone to stop a while and see if we didnt hear somebody call out mrs barchesters bathchair stops the way but he said i expected too much and would not wait  we sit about so much in the gardens which are lively when it is clear and not bad even in a little drizzle that weve got to know a good many of the people and although jones a good deal given to reading i like to sit and watch them and see what they are doing  when we first came here i noticed a goodlooking young woman who was hauled about in a bathchair generally with an open book in her lap which she never seemed to read much because she was always gazing around as if she was looking for something before long i found out what she was looking for for every day sooner or later generally sooner there came along a bathchair with a goodlooking young man in it he had a book in his lap too but he was never reading it when i saw him because he was looking for the young woman and as soon as they saw each other they began to smile and as they passed they always said something but didnt stop i wondered why they didnt give their pullers a rest and have a good talk if they knew each other but before long i noticed not very far behind the young ladys bathchair was always another bathchair with an old gentleman in it with a bottlenose after a while i found out that this was the young ladys father because sometimes he would call to her and have her stop and then she generally seemed to get some sort of a scolding  of course when i see anything of this kind going on i cant help taking one side or the other and as you may well believe madam i wouldnt be likely to take that of the old bottlenosed mans side i had not been noticing these people for more than two or three days when one morning when jone and me was sitting under an umbrella for there was a little more rain than common i saw these two young people in their bathchairs coming along side by side and talking just as hard as they could at first i was surprised but i soon saw how things was the old gentleman couldnt come out in the rain it was plain enough from the way these two young people looked at each other that they was in love and although it most likely hurt them just as much to come out into the rain as it would the old man love is allpowerful even over rheumatism  pretty soon the clouds cleared away without notice as they do in this country and it wasnt long before i saw away off the old mans bathchair coming along lively his bottlenose was sticking up in the air and he was looking from one side to the other as hard as he could the two lovers had turned off to the right and gone over a little bridge and i couldnt see them but by the way that old nose shook as it got nearer and nearer to me i saw they had reason to tremble though they didnt know it  when the old father reached the narrow path he did not turn down it but kept straight on and i breathed a sigh of deep relief but the next instant i remembered that the broad path turned not far beyond and that the little one soon ran into it and so it could not be long before the father and the lovers would meet i like to tell jone everything i am going to do when i am sure that hell agree with me that it is right but this time i could not bother with explanations and so i just told him to sit still for a minute for i wanted to see something and i walked after the young couple as fast as i could when i got to them for they hadnt gone very far i passed the young womans bathchair and then i looked around and i said to her i beg your pardon miss but there is an old gentleman looking for you but as i think he is coming round this way youll meet him if you keep on this path oh my said she unintentionally and then she thanked me very much and i went on and turned a corner and went back to jone and pretty soon the young mans bathchair passed us going toward the gate he looking threequarters happy and the other quarter disappointed as lovers are if they dont get the whole loaf  from that day until yesterday which was a full week i came into the gardens every morning sometimes even when jone didnt want to come because i wanted to see as much of this love business as i could for my own use in thinking of them i named the young man pomeroy and the young woman angelica and as for the father i called him snortfrizzle being the worst name i could think of at the time but i must wait until my next letter to tell you the rest of the story of the lovers and i am sure you will be as much interested in them as i was     letter number nineteen   illustration  buxton  i have a good many things to tell you for we leave buxton tomorrow but i will first finish the story of angelica and pomeroy i think the men who pulled the bathchairs of the lovers knew pretty much how things was going for whenever they got a chance they brought their chairs together and i often noticed them looking out for the old father and if they saw him coming they would move away from each other if they happened to be together  if snortfrizzles puller had been one of the regular bathchair men they might have made an agreement with him so that he would have kept away from them but he was a man in livery with a high hat who walked very regular like a highstepping horse and who it was plain enough to see never had anything to do with common bathchair men old snortfrizzle seemed to be smelling a rat more and morethat is if it is proper to liken cupid to such an animaland his nose seemed to get purpler and purpler i think he would always have kept close to angelicas chair if it hadnt been that he had a way of falling asleep and whenever he did this his man always walked very slow being naturally lazy two or three times i have seen snortfrizzle wake up shout to his man and make him trot around a clump of trees and into some narrow path where he thought his daughter might have gone  things began to look pretty bad for the old man had very strong suspicions about pomeroy and was so very wide awake when he was awake that i knew it couldnt be long before he caught the two together and then i didnt believe that angelica would ever come into these gardens again  it was yesterday morning that i saw old snortfrizzle with his chin down on his shirt bosom snoring so steady that his hat heaved being very slowly pulled along a shady walk and then i saw his daughter who was not far ahead of him turn into another walk which led down by the river i knew very well that she ought not to turn into that walk because it didnt in any way lead to the place where pomeroy was sitting in his bathchair behind a great clump of bushes and flowers with his face filled with the most lively emotions but overspread ever and anon by a cloudlet of despair on account of the approach of the noontide hour when angelica and snortfrizzle generally went home  illustration your brother is over there  the time was short and i believed that loves young dream must be put off until the next day if angelica could not be made aware where pomeroy was sitting or pomeroy where angelica was going so i got right up and made a short cut down a steep little path and sure enough i met her when i got to the bottom i beg your pardon very much miss said i but your brother is over there in the entrance to the cave and i think he has been looking for you my brother said she turning as red as her ribbons was blue oh thank you very much robertson you may take me that way  it wasnt long before i saw those two bathchairs alongside of each other and covered from general observation by masses of blooming shrubbery as i had been the cause of bringing them together i thought i had a right to look at them a little while as that would be the only reward id be likely to get and so i did it it was as i thought things was coming to a climax the bathchair men standing with much consideration with their backs to their vehicles and united for the time being by their clasped hands the lovers grew tender to a degree which i would have fain checked had i been nearer for fear of notice by passersby  but now my blood froze within my veins i would never have believed that a man in a high hat and livery a size too small for him could run but snortfrizzles man did and at a pace which ought to have been prohibited by law i saw him coming from an unsuspected quarter and swoop around that clump of flowers and foliage regardless of consequences i approached nearer there was loud voices there was exclamations there was a rattling of wheels there was the sundering of tender ties  in a moment pomeroy who had backed off but a little way began to speak but his voice was drowned in the thunder of snortfrizzles denunciations angelica wept and her head fell upon her lovely bosom and i am sure i heard her implore her man to remove her from the scene pomeroy remained his face firm his eyes undaunted but snortfrizzle shook his fist in unison with his nose and hurling an anathema at him followed his daughter probably to incarcerate her in her apartments  all was over and i returned to jone with a heavy heart and faltering step i could not but feel that i had brought about the sad end of this tender chapter in the lives of pomeroy and angelica if i had let them alone they would not have met and they would not have been discovered together i didnt tell jone what had happened because he does not always sympathize with me in my interest in others and for hours my heart was heavy  it was about a half an hour before dinner that day when i thought that a little walk might raise my spirits and i wandered into the gardens for which we each have a weekly ticket and there to my amazement not far from the gate i saw angelica in tears and her bathchair her man was not with her and she was alone when she saw me she looked at me for a minute and then she beckoned to me to come to her i flew there were but few people in the gardens and we was alone  madam said she i think you must be very kind i believe you knew that gentleman was not my brother he is not  my dear miss said ii was almost on the point of calling her angelicai knew that i know that he is something nearer and dearer than even a brother  she blushed yes said she you are right and we are in great trouble  oh what is it tell me quick what can i do to help you  my father is very angry said she and has forbidden me ever to see him again and he is going to take me home tomorrow but we have agreed to fly together today it is our only chance but he is not here oh dear i do not know what i shall do  where are you going to fly to said i  we want to take the edinburgh train this evening if there is one she said and we get off at carlisle and from there it is only a little way to gretna green  gretna green i cried oh i will help you i will help you why isnt the gentleman here and where has he gone  he has gone to see about the trains she said almost crying and i dont see what keeps him i could not get away until father went into his room to dress for dinner and as soon as he is ready he will call for me where can he be i have sent my man to look for him  oh ill go look for him you wait here i cried forgetting that she would have to and away i went  as i was hurrying out of the gates of the gardens i looked in the direction of the railroad station and there i saw pomeroy pulled by one bathchair man and the other one talking to him in twenty bounds i reached him go back for your young lady i cried to robertson angelicas man and bring her here on the run she sent me for you away went robertson and then i said to the astonished pomeroy sir there is no time for explanations your ladylove will be with you in a minute my husband and i are going to edinburgh tomorrow and i have looked up all the trains there is one which leaves here at twenty minutes past six if she comes soon you will have time to catch it have you your baggage ready  he looked at me as if he wondered who on earth i was but i am sure he saw my soul in my face and trusted me  yes he said she has a little bag in her bathchair and mine is here  here she comes said i and you must fly to the station  in a moment angelica was with us her face beaming with delight  oh thank you thank you she cried but i would not listen to her gratitude hurry i said or you will be too late joy go with you  they hastened off and i walked back to the gardens i looked at my watch and to my horror i saw it was five minutes past six fifteen minutes left yet fifteen minutes in which they might be overtaken i stopped for a moment irresolutely what should i do i thought of running after them to the station i thought in some way i might help thembuy their tickets or do something but while i was thinking i heard a rattle and down the street came the man in livery and snortfrizzles bottlenose like a volcano behind him the minute they reached me and there was nobody else in the street the old man shouted hi have you seen two bathchairs with a young man and a young woman in them  i was on the point of saying no but changed my mind like a flash did the young lady wear a hat with blue ribbons i asked  yes he roared which way did they go  and did the young man with her wear eyeglasses and a brown moustache  with her was he screamed snortfrizzle thats the rascal which way did they go tell me instantly  when i was a very little girl i knew an old woman who told me that if a person was really good at heart the holy angels would allow that person in the course of her life twelve fibs without charge provided they was told for the good of somebody and not to do harm now at such a moment as this i could not remember how many fibs of that kind i had left over to my credit but i knew there must be at least one and so i didnt hesitate a second they have gone to the cat and fiddle said i i heard them tell their bathchair men so as they urged them forward at the top of their speed they stopped for a second here sir and i heard the gentleman send a cabman for a clergyman post haste to meet them at the cat and fiddle  illustration to the cat and fiddle  if the sky had been lighted up by the eruption of snortfrizzles nose i should not have been surprised  the fools they cant cat and fiddle but they cant be half way there martin to the cat and fiddle  the man touched his hat but i couldnt do that sir i couldnt run to the cat and fiddle its long miles sir shall i get a carriage  carriage cried the old man and then he began to look about him  horror struck me perhaps they would go to the station for one just then a boy driving a pony and a grocery cart came up  there you are sir i cried hire that boy to tow you your butler can sit in the back of the cart and hold the handle of your bathchair it may take long to get a carriage and the cart will go much faster you may overtake them in a mile  old snortfrizzle never so much as thanked me or looked at me he yelled to the boy in the cart offered him ten shillings and sixpence to give him a tow and in less time than i could take to write it that flunky with a high hat was sitting in the tail of the cart the pony was going at full gallop and the old mans bathchair was spinning on behind it at a great rate  i did not leave that spotstanding statuelike and looking along both roadsuntil i heard the rumble of the departing train and then i repaired to the old hall my soul uplifted i found jone in an awful fluster about my being out so late but i do stay pretty late sometimes when i walk by myself and so he hadnt anything new to say     letter number twenty   edinburgh  we have been here five or six days now but the first thing i must write is the rest of the story of the lovers we left buxton the next day after their flight and i begged jone to stop at carlisle and let us make a little trip to gretna green i wanted to see the place that has been such a wellspring of matrimonial joys and besides i thought we might find pomeroy and angelica still there  i had not seen old snortfrizzle again but late that night i had heard a row in the hotel and i expect it was him back from the cat and fiddle whether he was inquiring for me or not i dont know or what he was doing or what he did  jone thought i had done a good deal of meddling in other peoples business but he agreed to go to gretna green and we got there in the afternoon i left jone to take a smoke at the station because i thought this was a business it would be better for me to attend to myself and i started off to look up the village blacksmith and ask him if he had lately wedded a pair but will you believe it madam i had not gone far on the main road of the village when a little ahead of me i saw two bathchairs coming toward me one of them pulled by robertson and the other by pomeroys man and in these two chairs was the happy lovers evidently mr and mrs their faces was filled with light enough to take a photograph and i could almost see their hearts swelling with transcendent joy i hastened toward them and in an instant our hands was clasped as if we had been old friends  they told me their tale they had reached the station in plenty of time and robertson had got a carriage for them and he and the other man had gone with them third class with the bathchairs in the goods carriages they had reached gretna green that morning and had been married two hours then i told my tale the eyes of both of them was dimmed with tears hers the most and again they clasped my hands poor father said angelica i hope he didnt go all the way to the cat and fiddle and that the night air didnt strike into his joints but he cannot separate us now and she looked confiding at the other bathchair  what are you going to do said i and they said they had just been making plans i saw though that their minds was in too exalted a state to do this properly for themselves and so i reflected a minute how long have you been in buxton  i have been there two weeks and two days said she and my husbandoh the effulgence that filled her countenance as she said thishas been there one day longer  then said i my advice to you is to go back to buxton and stay there five days until you both have taken the waters and the baths for the full three weeks it wont be much to bear the old gentlemans upbraiding for five days and then blessed with health and love you can depart no matter what you do afterward id stick it out at buxton for five days  well do it said they and then after more gratitude and congratulations we parted  and now i must tell you about ourselves when jone had been three weeks at buxton and done all the things he ought to do and hadnt done anything he oughtnt to do he hadnt any more rheumatism in him than a squirrel that jumps from bough to bough but will you believe it madam i had such a rheumatism in one side and one arm that it made me give little squeaks when i did up my back hair and it all came from my taking the baths when there wasnt anything the matter with me for i found out but all too late that while the waters of buxton will cure rheumatism in people thats got it they will bring it out in people who never had it at all we was told that we ought not to do anything in the bathing line without the advice of a doctor but those little tanks in the floors of the bathrooms all lined with tiles and filled with warm transparent water that you went down into by marble steps did seem so innocent that i didnt believe there was no need in asking questions about them jone wanted me to stay three weeks longer until i was cured but i wouldnt listen to that i was wild to get to scotland and as my rheumatism did not hinder me from walking i didnt mind what else it did  and there is another thing i must tell you one day when i was sitting by myself on the slopes waiting for jone about lunch time and with a reminiscence floating through my mind of the devonshire clotted cream of the past never perhaps to return i saw an elderly woman coming along and when she got near she stopped and spoke i knew her in an instant she was the old body we met at the babylon hotel who told us about the cottage at chedcombe i asked her to sit down beside me and talk because i wanted to tell her what good times we had had and how we liked the place but she said she couldnt as she was obliged to go on  and did you like chedcombe said she i hope you and your husband kept well  i said yes except jones rheumatism we felt splendid for my aches hadnt come on then and i was going on to gush about the lovely country she had sent us to but she didnt seem to want to listen  really said she and your husband had the rheumatism it was a wise thing for you to come here we english people have reason to be proud of our country if we have our banes we also have our antidotes and it isnt every country that can say that is it  illustration and did you like chedcombe  i wanted to speak up for america and tried to think of some good antidote with the proper banes attached but before i could do it she gave her head a little wag and said good morning nice weather isnt it and wobbled away it struck me that the old body was a little lofty and just then mr poplington who i hadnt noticed came up  really said he i didnt know you was acquainted with the countess  the which said i  the countess of mussleby said he that you was just talking to  countess i cried why thats the old person who recommended us to go to chedcombe  very natural said he for her to do that for her estates lie south of chedcombe and she takes a great interest in the villages around about and knows all the houses to let  i parted from him and wandered away a sadness stealing oer my soul gone with the recollections of the clotted cream was my visions of diamond tiaras tossing plumes and long folds of brocades and laces sweeping the marble floors of palaces if ever again i read a novel with a countess in it i shall see the edge of a yellow flannel petticoat and a pair of shoes like two horsehair bags which was the last that i saw of this thunderbolt into the middle of my visions of aristocracy  jone and me got to like buxton very much we met many pleasant people and as most of them had a chord in common we was friendly enough jone said it made him feel sad in the smokingroom to see the men hed got acquainted with get well and go home but thats a kind of sadness that all parties can bear up under pretty well  i havent said a word yet about scotland though we have been here a week but i really must get something about it into this letter i was saying to jone the other day that if i was to meet a king with a crown on his head i am not sure that i should know that king if i saw him again so taken up would i be with looking at his crown especially if it had jewels in it such as i saw in the regalia at the tower of london now edinburgh seems to strike me in very much the same way prince street is its crown and whenever i think of this city it will be of this magnificent street and the things that can be seen from it  it is a great thing for a street to have one side of it taken away and sunk out of sight so that there is a clear view far and wide and visitors can stand and look at nearly everything that is worth seeing in the whole town as if they was in the front seats of the balcony in a theatre and looking on the stage you know i am very fond of the theatre madam but i never saw anything in the way of what they call spectacular representation that came near edinburgh as seen from prince street  but as i said in one of my first letters i am not going to write about things and places that you can get much better description of in books and so i wont take up any time in telling how we stand at the window of our room at the royal hotel and look out at the old town standing like a forest of tall houses on the other side of the valley with the great castle perched up high above them and all the hills and towers and the streets all spread out below us with scotts monument right in front with everybody he ever wrote about standing on brackets which stick out everywhere from the bottom up to the very top of the monument which is higher than the tallest house and looks like a steeple without a church to it it is the most beautiful thing of the kind i ever saw and i have made out or think i have nearly every one of the figures thats carved on it  i think i shall like the scotch people very much but just now there is one thing about them that stands up as high above their other good points as the castle does above the rest of the city and that is the feeling they have for anybody who has done anything to make his fellowcountrymen proud of him a famous scotchman cannot die without being pretty promptly born again in stone or bronze and put in some open place with seats convenient for people to sit and look at him i like this glory ought to begin at home     letter number twentyone   edinburgh  jone being just as lively on his legs as he ever was in his life thanks to the waters of buxton and i having the rheumatism now only in my arm which i dont need to walk with we have gone pretty much all over edinburgh and a great place it is to walk in so far as variety goes some of the streets are so steep you have to go up steps if you are walking and about a mile around if you are driving i never get tired wandering about the old town with its narrow streets and awfully tall houses with family washes hanging out from every story  the closes are queer places they are very like little villages set into the town as if they was raisins in a pudding you get to them by alleys or tunnels and when you are inside you find a little neighborhood that hasnt anything more to do with the next close a block away than one country village has with another  we went to see john knoxs house and although mr knox was pretty hard on vanities and frivolities he didnt mind having a good house over his head with woodwork on the walls and ceilings that wasnt any more necessary than the back buttons on his coat  we have been reading hard since we have been in edinburgh and whenever mr knox and mary queen of scots come together i take marys side without asking questions i have no doubt mr knox was a good man but if meddling in other peoples business gave a person the right to have a monument the top of his would be the first thing travellers would see when they come near edinburgh  when we went to holyrood palace it struck me that mary queen of scots deserved a better house of course it wasnt built for her but i dont care very much for the other people who lived in it the rooms are good enough for an ordinary households use although the little room that she had her supper party in when rizzio was killed wouldnt be considered by jone and me as anything like big enough for our family to eat in but there is a general air about the place as if it belonged to a royal family that was not very well off and had to abstain from a good deal of grandeur  if mary queen of scots could come to life again i expect the scotch people would give her the best palace that money could buy for they have grown to think the world of her and her pictures blossom out all over edinburgh like daisies in a pasture field  the first morning after we got here i was as much surprised as if i had met mary queen of scots walking along prince street with a parasol over her head we were sitting in the readingroom of the hotel and on the other side of the room was a long desk at which people was sitting writing letters all with their backs to us one of these was a young man wearing a nice lightcolored sack coat with a shiny white collar sticking above it and his black derby hat was on the desk beside him when he had finished his letter he put a stamp on it and got up to mail it i happened to be looking at him and i believe i stopped breathing as i sat and stared under his coat he had on a little skirt of green plaid about big enough for my corinne when she was about five years old and then he didnt wear anything whatever until you got down to his long stockings and low shoes i was so struck with the feeling that he was an absentminded person that i punched jone and whispered to him to go quick and tell him jone looked at him and laughed and said that was the highland costume  now if that man had had his martial plaid wrapped around him and had worn a scottish cap with a feather in it and a long ribbon hanging down his back with his claymore girded to his side i wouldnt have been surprised for this is scotland and that would have been like the pictures i have seen of highlanders but to see a man with the upper half of him dressed like a clerk in a dry goods store and the lower half like a highland chief was enough to make a stranger gasp  illustration jone looked at him and said that was the highland costume  but since then i have seen a good many young men dressed that way i believe it is considered the tip of the fashion i havent seen any of the barelegged dandies yet with a high silk hat and an umbrella but i expect it wont be long before i meet one we often see the highland soldiers that belong to the garrison at the castle and they look mighty fine with their plaid shawls and their scarfs and their feathers but to see a man who looks as if one half of him belonged to london bridge and the other half to the highland moors does look to me like a pretty bad mixture  i am not so sure either that the whole highland dress isnt better suited to egypt where it doesnt often rain than to scotland last saturday we was at st giless church and the man who took us around told us we ought to come early next morning and see the military service which was something very fine and as jone gave him a shilling he said he would be on hand and watch for us and give us a good place where we could see the soldiers come in on sunday morning it rained hard but we was both at the church before eight oclock and so was a good many other people but the doors was shut and they wouldnt let us in they told us it was such a bad morning that the soldiers could not come out and so there would be no military service that day i dont know whether those fine fellows thought that the colors would run out of their beautiful plaids or whether they would get rheumatism in their knees but it did seem to me pretty hard that soldiers could not come out in the weather that lots of common citizens didnt seem to mind at all i was a good deal put out for i hate to get up early for nothing but there was no use saying anything and all we could do was to go home as all the other people with full suits of clothes did  jone and i have got so much more to see before we go home that it is very well we are both able to skip around lively of course there are ever and ever so many places that we want to go to but cant do it but i am bound to see the highlands and the country of the lady of the lake we have been reading up walter scott and i think more than i ever did that he is perfectly splendid while we was in edinburgh we felt bound to go and see melrose abbey and abbotsford i shall not say much about these two places but i will say that to go into sir walter scotts library and sit in the old armchair he used to sit in at the desk he used to write on and see his books and things around me gave me more a feeling of reverentialism than i have had in any cathedral yet  as for melrose abbey i could have walked about under those towering walls and lovely arches until the stars peeped out from the lofty vaults above but jone and the man who drove the carriage were of a different way of thinking and we left all too soon but one thing i did do i went to the grave of michael scott the wizard where once was shut up the book of awful mysteries with a lamp always burning by it though the flagstone was shut down tight on top of it and i got a piece of moss and a weed we dont do much in the way of carrying off such things but i want corinne to read the lady of the lake and then i shall give her that moss and that weed and tell where i got them i believe that in the way of romantics corinne is going to be more like me than like jone  tomorrow we go to the highlands and we shall leave our two big trunks in the care of the man in the red coat who is commanderinchief at the royal hotel and who said he would take as much care of them as if they was two glass jars filled with rubies and we believed him for he has done nothing but take care of us since we came to edinburgh and good care too     letter number twentytwo   illustration  kinloch rannoch  it happened that the day we went north was a very fine one and as soon as we got into the real highland country there was nothing to hinder me from feeling that my feet was on my native heath except that i was in a railway carriage and that i had no scotch blood in me but the joy of my soul was all the same there was an old gentleman got into our carriage at perth and when he saw how we was taking in everything our eyes could reach for jone is a good deal more fired up by travel than he used to bei expect it must have been the buxton waters that made the changehe began to tell us all about the places we were passing through there didnt seem to be a rock or a stream that hadnt a bit of history to it for that old gentleman to tell us about  we got out at a little town called struan and then we took a carriage and drove across the wild moors and hills for thirteen miles till we came to this village at the end of loch rannoch the wind blew strong and sharp but we knew what we had to expect and had warm clothes on and with the cool breeze and remembering scots wha ha wi wallace bled it made my blood tingle all the way  we are going to stay here at least a week we shall not try to do everything that can be done on scottish soil for we shall not stalk stags or shoot grouse and i have told jone that he may put on as many scotch bonnets and plaids as he likes but there is one thing he is not going to do and that is to go barekneed to which he answered he would never do that unless he could dip his knees into weak coffee so that they would be the same color as his face  there is a nice inn here with beautiful scenery all around and the lovely loch rannoch stretches away for eleven miles everything is just as scotch as it can be even the english people who come here put on knickerbockers and bonnets i have never been anywhere else where it is considered the correct thing to dress like the natives and i will say here that it is very few of the natives that wear kilts that sort of thing seems to be given up to the fancy highlanders  nearly all the talk at the inn is about shooting and fishing staghunting here is very different from what it is in england in more ways than one in the first place stags are not hunted with horses and hounds in the second place the sport is not free a gentleman here told jone that if a man wanted to shoot a stag on these moors it would cost him one rifle cartridge and six five pound notes and when jone did not understand what that meant the man went on and told him about how the deerstalking was carried on here he said that some of the big proprietors up here owned as much as ninety thousand acres of moorland and they let it out mostly to english people for hunting and fishing and if it is staghunting the tenant wants the price he pays is regulated by the number of stags he has the privilege of shooting each stag he is allowed to kill costs him thirty pounds so if he wants the pleasure of shooting thirty stags in the season his rent will be nine hundred pounds this he pays for the stagshooting but some kind of a house and about ten thousand acres are thrown in which he has a perfect right to sit down on and rest himself on but he cant shoot a grouse on it unless he pays extra for that and what is more if he happens to be a bad shot or breaks his leg and has to stay in the house and doesnt shoot his thirty stags he has got to pay for them all the same  when jone told me all this i said i thought a hundred and fifty dollars a pretty high price to pay for the right to shoot one deer but jone said i didnt consider all the rest the man got in the first place he had the right to get up very early in the morning in the gloom and drizzle and to trudge through the slop and the heather until he got far away from the neighborhood of any human being and then he could go up on some high piece of ground and take a spyglass and search the whole country round for a stag when he saw one way off in the distance snuffing the morning air or hunting for his breakfast among the heather he had the privilege of walking two or three miles over the moor so as to get that stag between the wind and himself so that it could not scent him or hear him then he had the glorious right to get his rifle all ready and steal and creep toward that stag to cut short his existence he has to be as careful and as sneaky as if he was a snake in the grass going behind little hills and down into gullies and sometimes almost crawling on his stomach where he goes over an open place and doing everything he can to keep that stag from knowing his end is near sometimes he follows his victim all day and the sun goes down before he has the glorious right of standing up and lodging a bullet in its unsuspecting heart so you see said jone he gets a lot for his hundred and fifty dollars  they do get a good deal more for their money than i thought they did said i but i wonder if those rich sportsmen ever think that if they would take the money that they pay for shooting thirty or forty stags in one season they might buy a rhinoceros which they could set up on a hill and shoot at every morning if they liked a game animal like that would last them for years and if they ever felt like it they could ask their friends to help them shoot without costing them anything  jone is pretty hard on sport with killing in it he does not mind eating meat but he likes to have the butcher do the killing but i reckon he is a little too tenderhearted but as for me i like sport of some kinds especially when you dont have your pity or your sympathies awakened by seeing your prey enjoying life when you are seeking to encompass his end of course by that i mean fishing  there are a good many trout in the lake and people can hire the privilege of fishing for them and i begged jone to let me go out in a boat and fish he was rather in favor of staying ashore and fishing in the little river but i didnt want to do that i wanted to go out and have some regular lake fishing at last jone agreed provided i would not expect him to have anything to do with the fishing of course i dont expect anything like that said i and it would be a good deal better for you to stay on shore the landlord says a gilly will go along to row the boat and attend to the lines and rods and all that and so there wont be any need for you at all and you can stay on shore with your book and watch if you like  and suppose you tumble overboard said jone  then you can swim out i said and perhaps wade a good deal of the way i dont suppose we need go far from the bank  jone laughed and said he was going too  very well said i but you have got to stay in the bow with your back to me and take an interesting book with you for it is a long time since i have done any fishing and i am not going to do it with two men watching me and telling me how i ought to do it and how i oughtnt to one will be enough  and that one wont be me said jone for fishing is not one of the branches i teach in my school  i would have liked it better if jone and me had gone alone he doing nothing but row but the landlord wouldnt let his boat that way and said we must take a gilly which as far as i can make out is a sort of sporting farmhand that is the way to do fishing in these parts  well we started and jone sat in the front with his back to me and the longlegged gilly rowed like a good fellow when we got to a good place to fish he stopped and took a fishingrod that was in pieces and screwed them together and fixed the line all right so that it would run along the rod to a little wheel near the handle and then he put on a couple of hooks with artificial flies on them which was so small i couldnt imagine how the fish could see them while he was doing all this i got a little fidgety because i had never fished except with a straight pole and line with a cork to it which would bob when the fish bit but this was altogether a different sort of a thing when it was all ready he handed me the pole and then sat down very polite to look at me  now if he had handed me the rod and then taken another boat and gone home perhaps i might have known what to do with the thing after a while but i must say that at that minute i didnt i held the rod out over the water and let the flies dangle down into it but do what i would they wouldnt sink there wasnt weight enough on them  you must throw your fly madam said the gilly always very polite let me give it a throw for you and then he took the rod in his hand and gave it a whirl and a switch which sent the flies out ever so far from the boat then he drew it along a little so that the flies skipped over the top of the water  illustration i didnt say anything and taking the pole in both hands i gave it a wild twirl over my head  i didnt say anything and taking the pole in both hands i gave it a wild twirl over my head and then it flew out as if i was trying to whip one of the leaders in a fourhorse team as i did this jone gave a jump that took him pretty near out of the boat for two flies swished just over the bridge of his nose and so close to his eyes as he was reading an interesting dialogue and not thinking of fish or even of me that he gave a jump sideways which if it hadnt been for the gilly grabbing him would have taken him overboard i was frightened myself and said to him that i had told him he ought not to come in the boat and it would have been a good deal better for him to have stayed on shore  he didnt say anything but i noticed he turned up his collar and pulled down his hat over his eyes and ears the gilly said that perhaps i had too much line out and so he took the rod and wound up a good deal of the line i liked this better because it was easier to whip out the line and pull it in again of course i would not be likely to catch fish so much nearer the boat but then we cant have everything in this world once i thought i had a bite and i gave the rod such a jerk that the line flew back against me and when i was getting ready to throw it out again i found that one of the little hooks had stuck fast in my thumb i tried to take it out with the other hand but it was awfully awkward to do because the rod wobbled and kept jerking on it the gilly asked me if there was anything the matter with the flies but i didnt want him to know what had happened and so i said oh no and turning my back on him i tried my best to get the hook out without his helping me for i didnt want him to think that the first thing i caught was myself after just missing my husbandhe might be afraid it would be his turn next you cannot imagine how bothersome it is to go fishing with a gilly to wait on you i would rather wash dishes with a sexton to wipe them and look for nicks on the edges  at lastand i dont know how it happenedi did hook a fish and the minute i felt him i gave a jerk and up he came i heard the gilly say something about playing but i was in no mood for play and if that fish had been shot up out of the water by a submarine volcano it couldnt have ascended any quicker than when i jerked it up then as quick as lightning it went whirling through the air struck the pages of jones book turning over two or three of them and then wiggled itself half way down jones neck between his skin and his collar while the loose hook swung around and nipped him in his ear  dont pull madam shouted the gilly and it was well he did for i was just on the point of giving an awful jerk to get the fish loose from jone jone gave a grab at the fish which was trying to get down his back and pulling him out threw him down but by doing this he jerked the other hook into his ear and then a yell arose such as i never before heard from jone i told you you ought not to come in this boat said i you dont like fishing and something is always happening to you  like fishing cried jone i should say not and he made up such a comical face that even the gilly who was very polite had to laugh as he went to take the hook out of his ear  when jone and the fish had been got off my line jone turned to me and said are you going to fish any more  not with you in the boat i answered and then he said he was glad to hear that and told the man he could row us ashore  i can assure you madam that fishing in a rather wobbly boat with a husband and a gilly in it is not to my taste and that was the end of our sporting experiences in scotland but it did not end the glorious times we had by that lake and on the moors  we hired a little pony trap and drove up to the other end of the lake and not far beyond that is the beginning of rannoch moor which the books say is one of the wildest and most desolate places in all europe so far as we went over the moor we found that this was truly so and i know that i at least enjoyed it ever so much more because it was so wild and desolate as far as we could see the moors stretched away in every direction covered in most places by heather now out of blossom but with great rocks standing out of the ground in some places and here and there patches of grass sometimes we could see four or five lochs at once some of them two or three miles long and down through the middle of the moor came the maddest and most harumscarum little river that could be imagined it actually seemed to go out of its way to find rocks to jump over just as if it was a young calf and some of the waterfalls were beautiful all around us was melancholy mountains all of them with ben for their first names except schiehallion which was the best shaped of any of them coming up to a point and standing by itself which was what i used to think mountains always did but now i know they run into each other so that you can hardly tell where one ends and the other begins  for three or four days we went out on these moors sometimes when the sun was shining and sometimes when there was a heavy rain and the wind blew gales and i think i liked this last kind of weather the best for it gave me an idea of lonely desolation which i never had in any part of the world i have ever been in before there is often not a house to be seen not even a crofters hut and we seldom met anybody sometimes i wandered off by myself behind a hillock or rocks where i could not even see jone and then i used to try to imagine how eve would have felt if she had early become a widow and to put myself in her place there was always clouds in the sky sometimes dark and heavy ones coming down to the very peaks of the mountains and not a tree was to be seen except a few rowan trees or bushes close to the river but by the side of lock rannoch on our way back to the village we passed along the edge of a fine old forest called the black woods of rannoch there are only three of these ancient forests left in scotland and some of the trees in this one are said to be eight hundred years old  illustration pomona drinking it in  the last time we was out on the rannoch moor there was such a savage and driving wind and the rain came down in such torrents that my mackintosh was blown nearly off of me and i was wet from my head to my heels but i would have stayed out hours longer if jone had been willing and i never felt so sorry to leave these grampian hills where i would have been glad to have had my father feed his flocks and where i might have wandered away my childhood barefooted over the heather singing scotch songs and drinking in deep draughts of the pure mountain air instead ofbut no matter  tomorrow we leave the highlands but as we go to follow the shallop of the lady of the lake i should not repine     letter number twentythree   illustration  oban scotland  it would seem to be the easiest thing in the world when looking on the map to go across the country from loch rannoch over to katrine and all those celebrated parts but we found we could not go that way and so we went back to edinburgh and made a fresh start we stopped one night at the royal hotel and there we found a letter from mr poplington we had left him at buxton and he said he was not going to scotland this season but would try to see us in london before we sailed  he is a good man and he wrote this letter on purpose to tell me that he had had a letter from his friend the clergyman in somersetshire who had forbidden the young woman whose wash my tricycle had run into to marry her lover because he was a radical this letter was in answer to one mr poplington wrote to him in which he gave the minister my reasons for thinking that the best way to convert the young man from radicalism was to let him marry the young woman who would be sure to bring him around to her way of thinking whatever that might be  i didnt care about the radicalism all i wanted was to get the two married and then it would not make the least difference to me what their politics might be if they lived properly and was sober and industrious and kept on loving each other i didnt believe it would make much difference to them it was a long letter that the clergyman wrote but the point of it was that he had concluded to tell the young woman that she might marry the fellow if she liked and that she must do her best to make him a good conservative which of course she promised to do when i read this i clapped my hands for who could have suspected that i should have the good luck to come to this country to spend the summer and make two matches before i left it  when we left edinburgh to gradually wend our way to this place which is on the west coast of scotland the first town we stopped at was stirling where the scotch kings used to live of course we went to the castle which stands on the rocks high above the town but before we started to go there jone inquired if the place was a ruin or not and when he was told it was not and that soldiers lived there he said it was all right and we went he now says he must positively decline to visit any more houses out of repair he is tired of them and since he has got over his rheumatism he feels less like visiting ruins than he ever did i tell him the ruins are not any more likely to be damp than a good many of the houses that people live in but this didnt shake him and i suppose if we come to any more vinecovered and shattered remnants of antiquity i shall be obliged to go over them by myself  the castle is a great place which i wouldnt have missed for the world but the spot that stirred my soul the most was in a little garden as high in the air as the top of a steeple where we could look out over the battlefield of bannockburn besides this we could see the mountains of benlomond benvenue benaan benledi and ever so much scottish landscape spreading out for miles upon miles there is a little hole in the wall here called the ladies lookout where the ladies of the court could sit and see what was going on in the country below without being seen themselves but i stood up and took in everything over the top of the wall  i dont know whether i told you that the mountains of scotland are bens and the mouths of rivers are abers and islands are inches walking about the streets of stirling and i didnt have time to see half as much as i wanted to i came to the shop of a flesher i didnt know what it was until i looked into the window and saw that it was a butcher shop  i like a language just about as foreign as the scotch is there are a good many words in it that people not scotch dont understand but that gives a person the feeling that she is travelling abroad which i want to have when i am abroad then on the other hand there are not enough of them to hinder a traveller from making herself understood so it is natural for me to like it ever so much better than french in which when i am in it i simply sink to the bottom if no helping hand is held out to me  i had some trouble with jone that night at the hotel because he had a novel which he had been reading for i dont know how long and which he said he wanted to get through with before he began anything else but now i told him he was going to enter on the wonderful country of the lady of the lake and that he ought to give up everything else and read that book because if he didnt go there with his mind prepared the scenery would not sink into his soul as it ought to he was of the opinion that when my romantic feeling got on top of the scenery it would be likely to sink into his soul as deep as he cared to have it without any preparation but that sort of talk wouldnt do for me i didnt want to be gliding oer the smooth waters of loch katrine and have him asking me who the girl was who rowed her shallop to the silver strand and the end of it was that i made him sit up until a quarter of two oclock in the morning while i read the lady of the lake to him i had read it before and he had not but i hadnt got a quarter through before he was just as willing to listen as i was to read and when i got through i was in such a glow that jone said he believed that all the blood in my veins had turned to hot scotch  i didnt pay any attention to this and after going to the window and looking out at the gaelic moon which was about half full and rolling along among the clouds i turned to jone and said jone lets sing scots wha ha before we go to bed  if we do roar out that thing said jone they will put us out on the curbstone to spend the rest of the night  lets whisper it then said i the spirit of it is all i want i dont care for the loudness  id be willing to do that said jone if i knew the tune and a few of the words  oh bother said i and when i got into bed i drew the clothes over my head and sang that brave song all to myself doing it that way the words and tune didnt matter at all but i felt the spirit of it and that was all i wanted and then i went to sleep  the next morning we went to callander by train and there we took a coach for trossachs it is hardly worth while to say we went on top because the coaches here havent any inside to them except a hole where they put the baggage we drove along a beautiful road with mountains and vales and streams and the driver told us the name of everything that had a name which he couldnt help very well being asked so constant by me but i didnt feel altogether satisfied for we hadnt come to anything quotable and i didnt like to have jone sit too long without something happening to stir up some of the lady of the lake which i had pumped into his mind the day before and so keep it fresh  before long however the driver pointed out the ford of coilantogle the instant he said this i half jumped up and seizing jone by the arm i cried dont you remember this is the place where the knight of snowdoun james fitzjames fought roderick dhu and then without caring who else heard me i burst out with      his back against a rock he bore       and firmly placed his foot before       come one come all this rock shall fly       from its firm base as soon as i  no madam said the driver politely touching his hat that was a mile farther on this place is      and here his course the chieftain staid       threw down his target and his plaid  you are right said i and then i began again      then each at once his falchion drew       each on the ground his scabbard threw       each lookd to sun and stream and plain       as what they neer might see again       then foot and point and eye opposed       in dubious strife they darkly closed  i didnt repeat any more of the poem though everybody was listening quite respectful without thinking of laughing and as for jone i could see by the way he sat and looked about him that his tinder had caught my spark but i knew that the thing for me to do here was not to give out but take in and so to speak in figures i drank in the whole of lake vannachar as we drove along its lovely marge until we came to the other end and the driver said we would now go over the brigg of turk at this up i jumped and said      and when the brigg of turk was won       the headmost horseman rode alone  i had sense enough not to quote the next two lines because when i had read them to jone he said that it was a shame to use a horse that way  we now came to loch achray at the other end of which is the trossachs where we stopped for the night and when the driver told me the mountain we saw before us was benvenue i repeated the lines      the hunter marked that mountain high       the lone lakes western boundary       and deemd the stag must turn to bay       where that huge rampart barrd the way  at last we reached the trossachs hotel which stands near the wild ravines filled with bristling woods where the stag was lost with the lovely lake in front and benvenue towering up on the other side i was so excited i could scarcely eat and no wonder because for the greater part of the day i had breathed nothing but the spirit of scotts poetry i forgot to say that from the time we left callander until we got to the hotel the rain poured down steadily but that didnt make any difference to me a human being soaked with the lady of the lake is rainproof     letter number twentyfour   edinburgh  i was sorry to stop my last letter right in the middle of the lady of the lake country but i couldnt get it all in and the fact is i cant get all i want to say in any kind of a letter the things i have seen and want to write about are crowded together like the scottish mountains  on the day after we got to trossachs hotel and i dont know any place i would rather spend weeks at than there jone and i walked through the darksome glen where the stag      soon lost to hound and hunters ken      in the deep trossachs wildest nook      his solitary refuge took  and then we came out on the farfamed loch katrine there was a little steamboat there to take passengers to the other end where a coach was waiting but it wasnt time for that to start and we wandered on the banks of that songgilded piece of water it didnt lie before us like one burnished sheet of living gold as it appeared to james fitzjames but my soul could supply the sunset if i chose there too was the island of the fair ellen and beneath our very feet was the silver strand to which she rowed her shallop i am sorry to say there isnt so much of the silver strand as there used to be because in this world as i have read and as i have seen the spirit of realistics is always crowding and trampling on the toes of the romantics and the people of glasgow have actually laid waterpipes from their town to this lovely lake and now they turn the faucets in their back kitchens and out spouts the tide which kissed      with whispering sound and slow      the beach of pebbles bright as snow  this wouldnt have been so bad because the lake has enough and to spare of its limpid wave but in order to make their waterworks the glasgow people built a dam and that has raised the lake a good deal higher so that it overflows ever so much of the silver strand but i can pick out the real from a scene like that as i can pick out and throw away the seeds of an orange and gazing oer that enchanted scene i felt like the knight of snowdoun himself when he first beheld the lake and said      how blithely might the bugle horn      chide on the lake the lingering morn  and then i went on with the lines until i came to      blithe were it then to wander here      but nowbeshrew yon nimble deer  youd better beshrew that steamboat bell said jone and away we went and just caught the boat realistics come in very well sometimes when they take the form of legs  the steamboat took us over nearly the whole of lake katrine and i must say that i was so busy fitting verses to scenery that i dont remember whether it rained or the sun shone when we left the boat we took a coach to inversnaid on loch lomond and as we rode along it made my heart almost sink to feel that i had to leave my poetry behind me for i didnt know any that suited this region but when we got in sight of loch lomond a scotch girl who was on the seat behind me and had several friends with her began to sing a song about lomond of which i only remember you take the high road and ill take the low road and ill get to scotland afore you  i am sure i must have scotch blood in me for when i heard that song it wound up my feelings to such a pitch that i believe if that girl had been near enough i should have given her a hug and a kiss as for jone he seemed to be nearly as much touched as i was though not in the same way of course  we took a boat on loch lomond to ardlui another little town and then we drove nine miles to the railroad this was through a wild and solemn valley and by the side of a rushing river full of waterfalls and deep and diresome pools when we reached the railroad we found a train waiting and we took it and went to oban which we reached about six oclock even this railroad trip was delightful for we went by the great lake awe with another rushing river and mountains and black precipices we had a carriage all to ourselves until an old lady got in at a station and she hadnt been sitting in her corner more than ten minutes before she turned to me and said  you havent any lakes like this in your country i suppose  now i must say that in the heated condition i had been in ever since i came into scotland a speech like that was like a squirt of cold water into a thing full of steam for a couple of seconds my boiling stopped but my fires was just as blazing as ever and i felt as if i could turn them on that old woman and shrivel her up for plastering her comparisons on me at such a time  of course we havent anything just like this i said but it takes all sorts of scenery to make up a world  thats very true isnt it said she but really one couldnt expect in america such a lake as that such mountains such grandeur  now i made up my mind if she was going to keep up this sort of thing jone and me would change carriages when we stopped at the next station for comparisons are very different from poetry and if you try to mix them with scenery you make a mess that is not fit for a christian but i thought first i would give her a word back  i have seen today i said the loveliest scenery i ever met with but weve got grand cañons in america where you could put the whole of that scenery without crowding and where it wouldnt be much noticed by spectators so busy would they be gazing at the surrounding wonders  fancy said she  i dont want to say anything said i against what i have seen today and i dont want to think of anything else while i am looking at it but this i will say that landscape with scott is very different from landscape without him  that is very true isnt it said she and then she stopped making comparisons and i looked out of the window  oban is a very pretty place on the coast but we never should have gone there if it had not been the place to start from for staffa and iona when i was only a girl i saw pictures of fingals cave and i have read a good deal about it since and it is one of the spots in the world that i have been longing to see but i feel like crying when i tell you madam that the next morning there was such a storm that the boat for staffa didnt even start and as the people told us that the storm would most likely last two or three days and that the sea for a few days more would be so rough that staffa would be out of the question we had to give it up and i was obliged to fall back from the reality to my imagination jone tried to comfort me by telling me that he would be willing to bet ten to one that my fancy would soar a mile above the real thing and that perhaps it was very well i didnt see old fingals cave and so be disappointed  perhaps it is a good thing said i that you didnt go and that you didnt get so seasick that you would be ready to renounce your countrys flag and embrace mormonism if such things would make you feel better but that is the only thing that is good about it and i have a cloud on my recollection which shall never be lifted until corinne is old enough to travel and we come here with her  but although the storm was so bad it was not bad enough to keep us from making our water trip to glasgow for the boat we took did not have to go out to sea it was a wonderfully beautiful passage we made among the islands and along the coast with the great mountains on the mainland standing up above everything else after a while we got to the crinan canal which is in reality a short cut across the field it is nine miles long and not much wider than a goodsized ditch but it saves more than a hundred miles of travel around an island we was on a sort of a toy steamboat which went its way through the fields and bushes and grass so close we could touch them and as there was eleven locks where the boat had to stop we got out two or three times and walked along the banks to the next lock that being the kind of a ride jone likes he blessed buxton at the other end of the canal we took a bigger steamboat which carried us to glasgow  in the morning it hailed which afterward turned to rain but in the afternoon there was only showers now and then so that we spent most of the time on deck on this boat we met a very nice englishman and his wife and when they had heard us speak to each other they asked us if we had ever been in this part of the world before and when we said we hadnt they told us about the places we passed if we had been an english couple who had never been there before they wouldnt have said a word to us  as we got near the clyde the gentleman began to talk about shipbuilding and pretty soon i saw in his face plain symptoms that he was going to have an attack of comparison making i have seen so much of this disorder that i can nearly always tell when it is coming on a person in about a minute the disease broke out on him and he began to talk about the differences between american and english ships he told jone and me about a steamship that was built out in san francisco which shook three thousand bolts out of herself on her first voyage it seemed to me that that was a good deal like a codfish shaking his bones out through swimming too fast i couldnt help thinking that that steamship must have had a lot of bolts so as to have enough left to keep her from scattering herself over the bottom of the ocean  i expected jone to say something in behalf of his countrys ships but he didnt seem to pay much attention to the boat story so i took up the cudgels myself and i said to the gentleman that all nations no matter how good they might be at shipbuilding sometimes made mistakes and then to make a good impression on him i whanged him over the head with the great eastern and asked him if there ever was a vessel that was a greater failure than that  he said yes yes the great eastern was not a success and then he stopped talking about ships  when we got fairly into the clyde and near glasgow the scene was wonderful it was nearly night and the great fires of the factories lit up the sky and we saw on the stocks a great ship being built  we stayed in glasgow one day and jone was delighted with it because he said it was like an american city now on principle i like american cities but i didnt come to scotland to see them and the greatest pleasure i had in glasgow was standing with a tumbler of water in my hand repeating to myself as much of the lady of the lake as i could remember     letter number twentyfive   london  here we are in this wonderful town where if you cant see everything you want to see you can generally see a sample of it even if your fad happens to be the ancientnesses of egypt we are at the babylon hotel where we shall stay until it is time to start for southampton where we shall take the steamer for home what we are going to do between here and southampton i dont know yet but i do know that jone is all on fire with joy because he thinks his journeys are nearly over and i am chilled with grief when i think that my journeys are nearly over  we left edinburgh on the train called the flying scotsman and it deserved its name i suppose that in the days of wallace and bruce and rob roy the scots must often have skipped along in a lively way but i am sure if any of them had ever invaded england at the rate we went into it the british lion would soon have been living on thistles instead of roses  the speed of this train was sometimes a mile a minute i think and i am sure i was never on any railroad in america where i was given a shorter time to get out for something to eat than we had at york jone and i are generally pretty quick about such things but we had barely time to get back to our carriage before that flying scotsman went off like a streak of lightning  on the way we saw a part of york minster and had a splendid view of durham cathedral standing high in the unreachablethat is as far as i was concerned peterborough cathedral we also saw the outside of and i felt like a boy looking in at a confectioners window with no money to buy anything it wasnt money that i wanted it was time and we had very little of that left  the next day after we reached london i set out to attend to a piece of business that i didnt want jone to know anything about my business was to look up my family pedigree it seemed to me that it would be a shame if i went away from the home of my ancestors without knowing something about those ancestors and about the links that connected me with them so i determined to see what i could do in the way of making up a family tree  by good luck jone had some business to attend to about money and rooms on the steamer and so forth and so i could start out by myself without his even asking me where i was going now of course it would be a natural thing for a person to go and seek out his ancestors in the ancient village from which they sprang and to read their names on the tombstones in the venerable little church but as i didnt know where this village was of course i couldnt go to it but in london is the place where you can find out how to find out such things  illustration a person who was a familytreeman  as far back as when we was in chedcombe i had had a good deal of talk with miss pondar about ancestors and families i told her that my forefathers came from this country which i was very sure of judging from my feelings but as i couldnt tell her any particulars i didnt go into the matter very deep but i did say there was a good many points that i would like to set straight and asked her if she knew where i could find out something about english family trees she said she had heard there was a big heraldry office in london but if i didnt want to go there she knew of a person who was a familytreeman he had an office in london and his business was to go around and tend to trees of that kind which had been neglected and to get them into shape and good condition she gave me his address and i had kept the thing quiet in my mind until now  i found the familytreeman whose name was brandish in a small room not too clean over a shop not far from st pauls churchyard he had another business which related to patent poison for flies and at first he thought i had come to see him about that but when he found out i wanted to ask him about my family tree his face brightened up  when i told mr brandish my business the first thing he asked me was my family name of course i had expected this and i had thought a great deal about the answer i ought to give in the first place i didnt want to have anything to do with my fathers name i never had anything much to do with him because he died when i was a little baby and his name had nothing hightoned about it and it seemed to me to belong to that kind of a family that you would be better satisfied with the less you looked up its beginnings but my mothers family was a different thing nobody could know her without feeling that she had sprung from good roots it might have been from the stump of a tree that had been cut down but the roots must have been of no common kind to send up such a shoot as she was it was from her that i got my longings for the romantic  she used to tell me a good deal about her father who must have been a wonderful man in many ways what she told me was not like a sketch of his life which i wish it had been but mostly anecdotes of what he said and did so it was my mothers ancestral tree i determined to find and without saying whether it was on my mothers or fathers side i was searching for ancestors i told mr brandish that dork was the family name  dork said he a rather uncommon name isnt it was your father the eldest son of a family of that name  now i was hoping he wouldnt say anything about my father  no sir said i it isnt that line that i am looking up it is my mothers her name was dork before she was married  really now i see said he you have the paternal line all correct and you want to look up the line on the other side that is very common it is so seldom that one knows the line of ancestors on ones maternal side dork then was the name of your maternal grandfather  it struck me that a maternal grandfather must be a grandmother but i didnt say so  can you tell me said he whether it was he who emigrated from this country to america or whether it was his father or his grandfather  now i hadnt said anything about the united states for i had learned there was no use in wasting breath telling english people i had come from america so i wasnt surprised at his question but i couldnt answer it  i cant say much about that i said until i have found out something about the english branches of the family  very good said he we will look over the records and he took down a big book and turned to the letter d he ran his finger down two or three pages and then he began to shake his head  dork said he there doesnt seem to be any dork but here is dorkminster now if that was your family name wed have it all here no doubt you know all about that family its a grand old family isnt it isnt it possible that your grandfather or one of his ancestors may have dropped part of the name when he changed his residence to america  now i began to think hard there was some reason in what the familytreeman said i knew very well that the same family name was often different in different countries changes being made to suit climates and people  minster has a religious meaning hasnt it said i  yes madam said he it relates to cathedrals and that sort of thing  now so far as i could remember none of the things my mother had ever told me about her father was in any ways related to religion they was mostly about horses and although there is really no reason for the disconnection between horses and religion especially when you consider the hymns with heavenly chariots in them must have had horses it didnt seem to me that my grandfather could have made it a point of being religious and perhaps he mightnt have cared for the cathedral part of his name and so might have dropped it for convenience in signing probably being generally in a hurry judging from what my mother had told me i said as much to mr brandish and he answered that he thought it was likely enough and that that sort of thing was often done  now then said he let us look into the dorkminster line and trace out your connection with that from what place did your ancestors come  it seemed to me that he was asking me a good deal more than he was telling me and i said to him that is what i want to find out what is the family home of the dorkminsters  oh they were a great hampshire family said he for five hundred years they lived on their estates in hampshire the first of the name was sir william dorkminster who came over with the conqueror and most likely was given those estates for his services then we go on until we come to the duke of dorkminster who built a castle and whose brother henry was made bishop and founded an abbey which i am sorry to say doesnt now exist being totally destroyed by oliver cromwell  you cannot imagine how my blood leaped and surged within me as i listened to those words william the conqueror an ancestral abbey a duke is the family castle still standing said i  it fell into ruins said he during the reign of charles i and even its site is now uncertain the park having been devoted to agricultural purposes the fourth duke of dorkminster was to have commanded one of the ships which destroyed the spanish armada but was prevented by a mortal fever which cut him off in his prime he died without issue and the estates passed to the culverhams of wilts  did that cut off the line said i very quick  oh no said the familytree man the line went on one of the dukes younger sisters must have married a man on condition that he took the old family name which is often done and her descendants must have emigrated somewhere for the name no longer appears in hampshire but probably not to america for that was rather early for english emigration  do you suppose said i that they went to scotland  very likely said he after thinking a minute that would be probable enough have you reason to suppose that there was a scotch branch in your family  yes said i for it would have been positively wrong in me to say that the feelings that i had for the scotch hadnt any meaning at all  now then said mr brandish there you are madam there is a line all the way down from the conqueror to the end of the sixteenth century scarcely one mans lifetime before the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock  i now began to calculate in my mind i was thirty years old my mother most likely was about as old when i was born that made sixty years then my grandfather might have been forty when my mother was born and there was a century as for my greatgrandfather and his parents i didnt know anything about them of course there must have been such persons but i didnt know where they came from or where they went to  i can go back a century said i but that doesnt begin to meet the end of the line you have marked out theres a gap of about two hundred years  oh i dont think i would mind that said mr brandish gaps of that kind are constantly occurring in family trees in fact if we was to allow gaps of a century or so to interfere with the working out of family lines it would cut off a great many noble ancestries from families of high position especially in the colonies and abroad i beg you not to pay any attention to that madam  my nerves was tingling with the thought of the spanish armada and perhaps bannockburn which then made me wish i had known all this before i went to stirling but which battle now as i write i know must have been fought a long time before any of the dorks went to scotland and i expect my eyes flashed with family pride for do what i would i couldnt sit calm and listen to what i was hearing but after all that two hundred years did weigh upon my mind if you make a family tree for me said i you will have to cut off the trunk and begin again somewhere up in the air  oh no said he we dont do that we arrange the branches so that they overlap each other and the dotted lines which indicate the missing portions are not noticed then after further investigation and more information the dots can be run together and the tree made complete and perfect  of course i had nothing more to say and he promised to send me the tree the next morning though of course requesting me to pay him in advance which was the rule of the office and you would be amazed madam if you knew how much that tree cost i got it the next morning but i havent shown it to jone yet i am proud that i own it and i have thrills through me whenever my mind goes back to its norman roots but i am bound to say that family trees sometimes throw a good deal of shade over their owners especially when they have gaps in them which seems contrary to nature but is true to fact     letter number twentysix   southwestern hotel southampton  tomorrow our steamer sails and this is the last letter i write on english soil and although i havent done half that i wanted to there are ever so many things i have done that i cant write you about  i had seen so few cathedrals that on the way down here i was bound to see at least one good one and so we stopped at winchester it was while walking under the arches of that venerable pile that the thought suddenly came to me that we were now in hampshire and that perhaps in this cathedral might be some of the tombs of my ancestors without saying what i was after i began at one of the doors and i went clean around that enormous church and read every tablet in the walls and on the floor  once i had a shock there was a good many small tombs with roofs over them and statues of people buried within lying on top of the tombs and some of them had their faces and clothes colored so as to make them look almost as natural as life they was mostly bishops and had been lying there for centuries while looking at these i came to a tomb with an opening low down on the side of it and behind some iron bars there lay a stone figure that made me fairly jump he was on his back with hardly any clothes on and was actually nothing but skin and bones his mouth was open as if he was gasping for his last breath i never saw such an awful sight and as i looked at the thing my blood began to run cold and then it froze the freezing was because i suddenly thought to myself that this might be a dorkminster and that that horrible object was my ancestor i was actually afraid to look at the inscription on the tombstone for fear that this was so for if it was i knew that whenever i should think of my family tree this bag of bones would be climbing up the trunk or sitting on one of the branches but i must know the truth and trembling so that i could scarcely read i stooped down to look at the inscription and find out who that dreadful figure had been it was not a dorkminster and my spirits rose  illustration this might be a dorkminster  we got here three days ago and we have made a visit to the isle of wight we went straight down to the southern coast and stopped all night at the little town of bonchurch it was very lovely down there with roses and other flowers blooming outofdoors as if it was summer although it is now getting so cold everywhere else but what pleased me most was to stand at the top of a little hill and look out over the waters of the english channel and feel that not far out of eyeshot was the beautiful land of france with its lower part actually touching italy  you know madam that when we was here before we was in france and a happy woman was i to be there although so much younger than now i couldnt properly enjoy it but even then france was only part of the road to italy which alas we never got to some day however i shall float in a gondola and walk amid the ruins of ancient rome and if jone is too sick of travel to go with me it may be necessary for corinne to see the world and i shall take her  now i must finish this letter and bid goodby to beautiful britain which has made us happy and treated us well in spite of some comparisons in which we was expected to be on the wrong side but which hurt nobody and which i dont want even to think of at such a moment as this     letter number twentyseven   new york  i send you this madam to let you know that we arrived here safely yesterday afternoon and that we are going today to jones mothers farm where corinne is  i liked sailing from southampton because when i start to go to a place i like to go and when we went home before and had to begin by going all the way up to liverpool by land and then coming all the way back again by water and after a couple of days of this to stop at queenstown and begin the real voyage from there i did not like it although it was a good deal of fun seeing the bumboat women come aboard at queenstown and telescope themselves into each other as they hurried up the ladder to get on deck and sell us things  we had a very good voyage with about enough rolling to make the dining saloon look like some of the churches weve seen abroad on weekdays where there was services regular but mighty small congregations  when we got in sight of my native shore england scotland and even the longedfor italy with her palaces and gondolas faded from my mind and my every fibre tingled with pride and patriotism we reached our dock about six oclock in the afternoon and i could scarcely stand still so anxious was i to get ashore there was a train at eight which reached rockbridge at halfpast nine and there we could take a carriage and drive to the farm in less than an hour and then corinne would be in my arms so you may imagine my state of mindcorinne before bedtime but a cloud blacker than the heaviest fog came down upon me for while we was standing on the deck expecting every minute to land a man came along and shouted at the top of his voice that no baggage could be examined by the customhouse officers after six oclock and the passengers could take nothing ashore with them but their handbags and must come back in the morning and have their baggage examined when i heard this my soul simply boiled within me i looked at jone and i could see he was boiling just as bad  jone said i dont say a word to me  i am not going to say a word said he and he didnt all our belongings was in our trunks jone didnt carry any handbag and i had only a little one which had in it three newspapers which we bought from the pilot a toothbrush a spool of thread and some needles and a pair of scissors with one point broken off with these things we had to go to a hotel and spend the night and in the morning we had to go back to have our trunks examined which as there was nothing in them to pay duty on was waste time for all parties no matter when it was done  illustration jone didnt carry any handbag and i had only a little one  that night when i was lying awake thinking about this welcome to our native land i dont say that i hauled down the stars and stripes but i did put them at half mast when we arrived in england we got ashore about twelve oclock at night but there was the customhouse officers as civil and obliging as any people could be ready to tend to us and pass us on and when i thought of them and afterward of the lordly hirelings who met us here i couldnt help feeling what a glorious thing it would be to travel if you could get home without coming back  jone tried to comfort me by telling me that we ought to be very glad we dont like this sort of thing in many foreign countries said he people are a good deal nagged by their governments and they like it we dont like it so haul up your flag  i hauled it up and its flying now from the tiptop of my tallest mast in an hour our train starts and i shall see corinne before the sun goes down
