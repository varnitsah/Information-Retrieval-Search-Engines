which mrs horace hignett had rented for her stay in new york rays of golden sunlight peeped in like the foremost spies of some advancing army it was a fine summer morning the hands of the dutch clock in the hall pointed to thirteen minutes past nine those of the ormolu clock in the sittingroom to eleven minutes past ten those of the carriage clock on the bookshelf to fourteen minutes to six in other words it was exactly eight and mrs hignett acknowledged the fact by moving her head on the pillow opening her eyes and sitting up in bed she always woke at eight precisely  was this mrs hignett the mrs hignett the worldfamous writer on theosophy the author of the spreading light what of the morrow and all the rest of that wellknown series im glad you asked me yes she was she had come over to america on a lecturing tour  about this time there was a good deal of suffering in the united states for nearly every boat that arrived from england was bringing a fresh swarm of british lecturers to the country novelists poets scientists philosophers and plain ordinary bores some herd instinct seemed to affect them all simultaneously it was like one of those great race movements of the middle ages men and women of widely differing views on religion art politics and almost every other subject on this one point the intellectuals of great britain were singleminded that there was easy money to be picked up on the lectureplatforms of america and that they might just as well grab it as the next person  mrs hignett had come over with the first batch of immigrants for spiritual as her writings were there was a solid streak of business sense in this woman and she meant to get hers while the getting was good she was half way across the atlantic with a complete itinerary booked before ninety per cent of the poets and philosophers had finished sorting out their clean collars and getting their photographs taken for the passport  she had not left england without a pang for departure had involved sacrifices more than anything else in the world she loved her charming home windles in the county of hampshire for so many years the seat of the hignett family windles was as the breath of life to her its shady walks its silver lake its noble elms the old grey stone of its wallsthese were bound up with her very being she felt that she belonged to windles and windles to her unfortunately as a matter of cold legal accuracy it did not she did but hold it in trust for her son eustace until such time as he should marry and take possession of it himself there were times when the thought of eustace marrying and bringing a strange woman to windles chilled mrs hignett to her very marrow happily her firm policy of keeping her son permanently under her eye at home and never permitting him to have speech with a female below the age of fifty had averted the peril up till now  eustace had accompanied his mother to america it was his faint snores which she could hear in the adjoining room as having bathed and dressed she went down the hall to where breakfast awaited her she smiled tolerantly she had never desired to convert her son to her own earlyrising habits for apart from not allowing him to call his soul his own she was an indulgent mother eustace would get up at halfpast nine long after she had finished breakfast read her correspondence and started her duties for the day  breakfast was on the table in the sittingroom a modest meal of rolls porridge and imitation coffee beside the pot containing this hellbrew was a little pile of letters mrs hignett opened them as she ate the majority were from disciples and dealt with matters of purely theosophical interest there was an invitation from the butterfly club asking her to be the guest of honour at their weekly dinner there was a letter from her brother mallabysir mallaby marlowe the eminent london lawyersaying that his son sam of whom she had never approved would be in new york shortly passing through on his way back to england and hoping that she would see something of him altogether a dull mail mrs hignett skimmed through it without interest setting aside one or two of the letters for eustace who acted as her unpaid secretary to answer later in the day  she had just risen from the table when there was a sound of voices in the hall and presently the domestic staff a gaunt irish lady of advanced years entered the room  maam there was a gentleman  mrs hignett was annoyed her mornings were sacred  didnt you tell him i was not to be disturbed  i did not i loosed him into the parlour the staff remained for a moment in melancholy silence then resumed he says hes your nephew his names marlowe  mrs hignett experienced no diminution of her annoyance she had not seen her nephew sam for ten years and would have been willing to extend the period she remembered him as an untidy small boy who once or twice during his school holidays had disturbed the cloistral peace of windles with his beastly presence however blood being thicker than water and all that sort of thing she supposed she would have to give him five minutes she went into the sittingroom and found there a young man who looked more or less like all other young men though perhaps rather fitter than most he had grown a good deal since she had last met him as men so often do between the ages of fifteen and twentyfive and was now about six feet in height about forty inches round the chest and in weight about thirteen stone he had a brown and amiable face marred at the moment by an expression of discomfort somewhat akin to that of a cat in a strange alley  hullo aunt adeline he said awkwardly  well samuel said mrs hignett  there was a pause mrs hignett who was not fond of young men and disliked having her mornings broken into was thinking that he had not improved in the slightest degree since their last meeting and sam who imagined that he had long since grown to mans estate and put off childish things was embarrassed to discover that his aunt still affected him as of old that is to say she made him feel as if he had omitted to shave and in addition to that had swallowed some drug which had caused him to swell unpleasantly particularly about the hands and feet  jolly morning said sam perseveringly  so i imagine i have not yet been out  thought id look in and see how you were  that was very kind of you the morning is my busy time but  yes that was very kind of you  there was another pause  how do you like america said sam  i dislike it exceedingly  yes well of course some people do prohibition and all that personally it doesnt affect me i can take it or leave it alone i like america myself said sam ive had a wonderful time everybodys treated me like a rich uncle ive been in detroit you know and they practically gave me the city and asked me if id like another to take home in my pocket never saw anything like it i might have been the missing heir i think americas the greatest invention on record  and what brought you to america said mrs hignett unmoved by this rhapsody  oh i came over to play golf in a tournament you know  surely at your age said mrs hignett disapprovingly you could be better occupied do you spend your whole time playing golf  oh no i play cricket a bit and shoot a bit and i swim a good lot and i still play football occasionally  i wonder your father does not insist on your doing some useful work  he is beginning to harp on the subject rather i suppose i shall take a stab at it sooner or later father says i ought to get married too  he is perfectly right  i suppose old eustace will be getting hitched up one of these days said sam  mrs hignett started violently  why do you say that  eh  what makes you say that  oh well hes a romantic sort of fellow writes poetry and all that  there is no likelihood at all of eustace marrying he is of a shy and retiring temperament and sees few women he is almost a recluse  sam was aware of this and had frequently regretted it he had always been fond of his cousin in that halfamused and rather patronising way in which men of thews and sinews are fond of the weaker brethren who run more to pallor and intellect and he had always felt that if eustace had not had to retire to windles to spend his life with a woman whom from his earliest years he had always considered the empress of the washouts much might have been made of him both at school and at oxford eustace had beenif not a sportat least a decidedly cheery old bean sam remembered eustace at school breaking gas globes with a slipper in a positively rollicking manner he remembered him at oxford playing up to him manfully at the piano on the occasion when he had done that imitation of frank tinney which had been such a hit at the trinity smoker yes eustace had had the makings of a pretty sound egg and it was too bad that he had allowed his mother to coop him up down in the country miles away from anywhere  eustace is returning to england on saturday said mrs hignett she spoke a little wistfully she had not been parted from her son since he had come down from oxford and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour that however was out of the question it was imperative that while she was away he should be at windles nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flowerbeds scratch the polished floors and forget to cover up the canary at night he sails on the atlantic  thats splendid said sam im sailing on the atlantic myself ill go down to the office and see if we cant have a stateroom together but where is he going to live when he gets to england  where is he going to live why at windles of course where else  but i thought you were letting windles for the summer  mrs hignett stared  letting windles she spoke as one might address a lunatic what put that extraordinary idea into your head  i thought father said something about your letting the place to some american  nothing of the kind  it seemed to sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently even snappishly in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake he could not know that the subject of letting windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate mrs hignett people had certainly asked her to let windles in fact people had pestered her there was a rich fat man an american named bennett whom she had met just before sailing at her brothers house in london invited down to windles for the day mr bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price not content with this he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean and had not given up the struggle even when she reached new york she had not been in america two days when there had arrived a mr mortimer bosom friend of mr bennett carrying on the matter where the other had left off for a whole week mr mortimer had tried to induce her to reconsider her decision and had only stopped because he had had to leave for england himself to join his friend and even then the thing had gone on indeed this very morning among the letters on mrs hignetts table the buff envelope of a cable from mr bennett had peeped out nearly spoiling her breakfast no wonder then that sams allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of the spreading light momentarily to lose her customary calm  nothing will induce me ever to let windles she said with finality and rose significantly sam perceiving that the audience was at an endand glad of italso got up  well i think ill be going down and seeing about that stateroom he said  certainly i am a little busy just now preparing notes for my next lecture  of course yes mustnt interrupt you i suppose youre having a great time gassing awayi meanwell goodbye  goodbye  mrs hignett frowning for the interview had ruffled her and disturbed that equable frame of mind which is so vital to the preparation of lectures on theosophy sat down at the writingtable and began to go through the notes which she had made overnight she had hardly succeeded in concentrating herself when the door opened to admit the daughter of erin once more  maam there was a gentleman  this is intolerable cried mrs hignett did you tell him that i was busy  i did not i loosed him into the diningroom  is he a reporter from one of the newspapers  he is not he has spats and a tallshaped hat his name is bream mortimer  bream mortimer  yes maam he handed me a bit of a kyard but i dropped it being slippy from the dishes  mrs hignett strode to the door with a forbidding expression this as she had justly remarked was intolerable she remembered bream mortimer he was the son of the mr mortimer who wanted windles this visit could only have to do with the subject of windles and she went into the diningroom in a state of cold fury determined to squash the mortimer family in the person of their new york representative once and for all  good morning mr mortimer  bream mortimer was tall and thin he had small bright eyes and a sharply curving nose he looked much more like a parrot than most parrots do it gave strangers a momentary shock of surprise when they saw bream mortimer in restaurants eating roast beef they had the feeling that he would have preferred sunflower seeds  morning mrs hignett  please sit down  bream mortimer looked as though he would rather have hopped on to a perch but he sat down he glanced about the room with gleaming excited eyes  mrs hignett i must have a word with you alone  you are having a word with me alone  i hardly know how to begin  then let me help you it is quite impossible i will never consent  bream mortimer started  then you have heard about it  i have heard about nothing else since i met mr bennett in london mr bennett talked about nothing else your father talked about nothing else and now cried mrs hignett fiercely you come and try to reopen the subject once and for all nothing will alter my decision no money will induce me to let my house  but i didnt come about that  you did not come about windles  good lord no  then will you kindly tell me why you have come  bream mortimer seemed embarrassed he wriggled a little and moved his arms as if he were trying to flap them  you know he said im not a man who butts into other peoples affairs he stopped  no said mrs hignett  bream began again  im not a man who gossips with valets  no  im not a man who  mrs hignett was never a very patient woman  let us take all your negative qualities for granted she said curtly i have no doubt that there are many things which you do not do let us confine ourselves to issues of definite importance what is it if you have no objection to concentrating your attention on that for a moment that you wish to see me about  this marriage  what marriage  your sons marriage  my son is not married  no but hes going to be at eleven oclock this morning at the little church round the corner  mrs hignett stared  are you mad  well im not any too well pleased im bound to say admitted mr mortimer you see darn it all im in love with the girl myself  who is this girl  have been for years im one of those silent patient fellows who hang around and look a lot but never tell their love  who is this girl who has entrapped my son  ive always been one of those men who  mr mortimer with your permission we will take your positive qualities also for granted in fact we will not discuss you at all you come to me with this absurd story  not absurd honest fact i had it from my valet who had it from her maid  will you please tell me who is the girl my misguided son wishes to marry  i dont know that id call him misguided said mr mortimer as one desiring to be fair i think hes a right smart picker shes such a corking girl you know we were children together and ive loved her for years ten years at least but you know how it issomehow one never seems to get in line for a proposal i thought i saw an opening in the summer of nineteentwelve but it blew over im not one of these smooth dashing chaps you see with a great line of talk im not  if you will kindly said mrs hignett impatiently postpone this essay in psychoanalysis to some future occasion i shall be greatly obliged i am waiting to hear the name of the girl my son wishes to marry  havent i told you said mr mortimer surprised thats odd i havent its funny how one doesnt do the things one thinks one does im the sort of man  what is her name   the sort of man who  what is her name  bennett  bennett wilhelmina bennett the daughter of mr rufus bennett the redhaired girl i met at lunch one day at your fathers house  thats it youre a great guesser i think you ought to stop the thing  i intend to  fine  the marriage would be unsuitable in every way miss bennett and my son do not vibrate on the same plane  thats right ive noticed it myself  their auras are not the same colour  if ive thought that once said bream mortimer ive thought it a hundred times i wish i had a dollar for every time ive thought it not the same colour thats the whole thing in a nutshell  i am much obliged to you for coming and telling me of this i shall take immediate steps  thats good but whats the procedure its getting late shell be waiting at the church at eleven  eustace will not be there  you think you can fix it  eustace will not be there repeated mrs hignett  bream mortimer hopped down from his chair  well youve taken a weight off my mind  a mind i should imagine scarcely constructed to bear great weights  ill be going havent had breakfast yet too worried to eat breakfast relieved now this is where three eggs and a rasher of ham get cut off in their prime i feel i can rely on you  you can  then ill say goodbye  goodbye  i mean really goodbye im sailing for england on saturday on the atlantic  indeed my son will be your fellowtraveller  bream mortimer looked somewhat apprehensive  you wont tell him that i was the one who spilled the beans  i beg your pardon  you wont wise him up that i threw a spanner into the machinery  i do not understand you  you wont tell him that i crabbed his act  gave the thing away  gummed the game  i shall not mention your chivalrous intervention  chivalrous said bream mortimer a little doubtfully i dont know that id call it absolutely chivalrous of course alls fair in love and war well im glad youre going to keep my share in the business under your hat it might have been awkward meeting him on board  you are not likely to meet eustace on board he is a very indifferent sailor and spends most of his time in his cabin  thats good saves a lot of awkwardness well goodbye  goodbye when you reach england remember me to your father  he wont have forgotten you said bream mortimer confidently he did not see how it was humanly possible for anyone to forget this woman she was like a celebrated chewinggum the taste lingered  mrs hignett was a woman of instant and decisive action even while her late visitor was speaking schemes had begun to form in her mind like bubbles rising to the surface of a rushing river by the time the door had closed behind bream mortimer she had at her disposal no fewer than seven all good it took her but a moment to select the best and simplest she tiptoed softly to her sons room rhythmic snores greeted her listening ears she opened the door and went noiselessly in     chapter ii  gallant rescue by welldressed young man   § 1  the white star liner atlantic lay at her pier with steam up and gangway down ready for her trip to southampton the hour of departure was near and there was a good deal of mixed activity going on sailors fiddled about with ropes junior officers flitted to and fro whitejacketed stewards wrestled with trunks probably the captain though not visible was also employed on some useful work of a nautical nature and not wasting his time men women boxes rugs dogs flowers and baskets of fruits were flowing on board in a steady stream  the usual drove of citizens had come to see the travellers off there were men on the passengerlist who were being seen off by fathers by mothers by sisters by cousins and by aunts in the steerage there was an elderly jewish lady who was being seen off by exactly thirtyseven of her late neighbours in rivington street and two men in the second cabin were being seen off by detectives surely the crowning compliment a great nation can bestow the cavernous customs sheds were congested with friends and relatives and sam marlowe heading for the gangplank was only able to make progress by employing all the muscle and energy which nature had bestowed upon him and which during the greater part of his life he had developed by athletic exercise however after some minutes of silent endeavour now driving his shoulder into the midriff of some obstructing male now courteously lifting some stout female off his feet he had succeeded in struggling to within a few yards of his goal when suddenly a sharp pain shot through his right arm and he spun round with a cry  it seemed to sam that he had been bitten and this puzzled him for new york crowds though they may shove and jostle rarely bite  he found himself face to face with an extraordinarily pretty girl  she was a redhaired girl with the beautiful ivory skin which goes with red hair her eyes though they were under the shadow of her hat and he could not be certain he diagnosed as green or may be blue or possibly grey not that it mattered for he had a catholic taste in feminine eyes so long as they were large and bright as were the specimens under his immediate notice he was not the man to quibble about a point of colour her nose was small and on the very tip of it there was a tiny freckle her mouth was nice and wide her chin soft and round she was just about the height which every girl ought to be her figure was trim her feet tiny and she wore one of those dresses of which a man can say no more than that they look pretty well all right  nature abhors a vacuum samuel marlowe was a susceptible young man and for many a long month his heart had been lying empty all swept and garnished with welcome on the mat this girl seemed to rush in and fill it she was not the prettiest girl he had ever seen she was the third prettiest he had an orderly mind one capable of classifying and docketing girls but there was a subtle something about her a sort of howshalloneputit which he had never encountered before he swallowed convulsively his welldeveloped chest swelled beneath its covering of blue flannel and invisible stripe at last he told himself he was in love really in love and at first sight too which made it all the more impressive he doubted whether in the whole course of history anything like this had ever happened before to anybody oh to clasp this girl to him and  but she had bitten him in the arm that was hardly the right spirit that he felt constituted an obstacle  oh im so sorry she cried  well of course if she regretted her rash act after all an impulsive girl might bite a man in the arm in the excitement of the moment and still have a sweet womanly nature  the crowd seems to make pinkyboodles so nervous  sam might have remained mystified but at this juncture there proceeded from a bundle of rugs in the neighbourhood of the girls lower ribs a sharp yapping sound of such a calibre as to be plainly audible over the confused noise of mamies who were telling sadies to be sure and write of bills who were instructing dicks to look up old joe in paris and give him their best and of all the fruitboys candyboys magazineboys americanflagboys and telegraph boys who were honking their wares on every side  i hope he didnt hurt you much youre the third person hes bitten today she kissed the animal in a loving and congratulatory way on the tip of his black nose not counting waiters at the hotel of course she added and then she was swept from him in the crowd and he was left thinking of all the things he might have saidall those graceful witty ingratiating things which just make a bit of difference on these occasions  he had said nothing not a sound exclusive of the first sharp yowl of pain had proceeded from him he had just goggled a rotten exhibition perhaps he would never see this girl again she looked the sort of girl who comes to see friends off and doesnt sail herself and what memory of him would she retain she would mix him up with the time when she went to visit the deafanddumb hospital   § 2  sam reached the gangplank showed his ticket and made his way through the crowd of passengers passengers friends stewards junior officers and sailors who infested the deck he proceeded down the main companionway through a rich smell of indiarubber and mixed pickles as far as the dining saloon then turned down the narrow passage leading to his stateroom  staterooms on ocean liners are curious things when you see them on the chart in the passengeroffice with the gentlemanly clerk drawing rings round them in pencil they seem so vast that you get the impression that after stowing away all your trunks you will have room left over to do a bit of entertainingpossibly an informal dance or something when you go on board you find that the place has shrunk to the dimensions of an undersized cupboard in which it would be impossible to swing a cat and then about the second day out it suddenly expands again for one reason or another the necessity for swinging cats does not arise and you find yourself quite comfortable  sam balancing himself on the narrow projecting ledge which the chart in the passengeroffice had grandiloquently described as a lounge began to feel the depression which marks the second phase he almost wished now that he had not been so energetic in having his room changed in order to enjoy the company of his cousin eustace it was going to be a tight fit eustaces bag was already in the cabin and it seemed to take up the entire fairway still after all eustace was a good sort and would be a cheerful companion and sam realised that if the girl with the red hair was not a passenger on the boat he was going to have need of diverting society  a footstep sounded in the passage outside the door opened  hullo eustace said sam  eustace hignett nodded listlessly sat down on his bag and emitted a deep sigh he was a small fragilelooking young man with a pale intellectual face dark hair fell in a sweep over his forehead he looked like a man who would write vers libre as indeed he did  hullo he said in a hollow voice  sam regarded him blankly he had not seen him for some years but going by his recollections of him at the university he had expected something cheerier than this in fact he had rather been relying on eustace to be the life and soul of the party the man sitting on the bag before him could hardly have filled that role at a gathering of russian novelists  what on earths the matter said sam  the matter eustace hignett laughed mirthlessly oh nothing nothing much nothing to signify only my hearts broken he eyed with considerable malignity the bottle of water in the rack above his head a harmless object provided by the white star company for clients who might desire to clean their teeth during the voyage  if you would care to hear the story he said  go ahead  it is quite short  thats good  soon after i arrived in america i met a girl  talking of girls said sam with enthusiasm ive just seen the only one in the world that really amounts to anything it was like this i was shoving my way through the mob on the dock when suddenly  shall i tell you my story or will you tell yours  oh sorry go ahead  eustace hignett scowled at the printed notice on the wall informing occupants of the stateroom that the name of their steward was j b midgeley  she was an extraordinarily pretty girl  so was mine i give you my honest word i never in all my life saw such  of course if you prefer that i postponed my narrative said eustace coldly  oh sorry carry on  she was an extraordinarily pretty girl  what was her name  wilhelmina bennett she was an extraordinarily pretty girl and highly intelligent i read her all my poems and she appreciated them immensely she enjoyed my singing my conversation appeared to interest her she admired my  i see you made a hit now get on with the story  dont bustle me said eustace querulously  well you know the voyage only takes eight days  ive forgotten where i was  you were saying what a devil of a chap she thought you what happened i suppose when you actually came to propose you found she was engaged to some other johnny  not at all i asked her to be my wife and she consented we both agreed that a quiet wedding was what we wantedshe thought her father might stop the thing if he knew and i was dashed sure my mother wouldso we decided to get married without telling anybody by now said eustace with a morose glance at the porthole i ought to have been on my honeymoon everything was settled i had the licence and the parsons fee i had been breaking in a new tie for the wedding  and then you quarrelled  nothing of the kind i wish you would stop trying to tell me the story im telling you what happened was this somehowi cant make out howmother found out and then of course it was all over she stopped the thing  sam was indignant he thoroughly disliked his aunt adeline and his cousins meek subservience to her revolted him  stopped it i suppose she said now eustace you mustnt and you said very well mother and scratched the fixture  she didnt say a word she never has said a word as far as that goes she might never have heard anything about the marriage  then how do you mean she stopped it  she pinched my trousers  pinched your trousers  eustace groaned all of them the whole bally lot she gets up long before i do and she must have come into my room and cleaned it out while i was asleep when i woke up and started to dress i couldnt find a single damned pair of bags in the whole place i looked everywhere finally i went into the sittingroom where she was writing letters and asked if she had happened to see any anywhere she said she had sent them all to be pressed she said she knew i never went out in the morningsi dont as a ruleand they would be back at lunchtime a fat lot of use that was i had to be at the church at eleven well i told her i had a most important engagement with a man at eleven and she wanted to know what it was and i tried to think of something but it sounded pretty feeble and she said i had better telephone to the man and put it off i did it too rang up the first number in the book and told some fellow i had never seen in my life that i couldnt meet him because i hadnt any trousers he was pretty peeved judging from what he said about my being on the wrong number and mother listening all the time and i knowing that she knewsomething told me that she knewand she knowing that i knew she knew i tell you it was awful  and the girl  she broke off the engagement apparently she waited at the church from eleven till onethirty and then began to get impatient she wouldnt see me when i called in the afternoon but i got a letter from her saying that what had happened was all for the best as she had been thinking it over and had come to the conclusion that she had made a mistake she said something about my not being as dynamic as she had thought i was she said that what she wanted was something more like lancelot or sir galahad and would i look on the episode as closed  did you explain about the trousers  yes it seemed to make things worse she said that she could forgive a man anything except being ridiculous  i think youre well out of it said sam judicially she cant have been much of a girl  i feel that now but it doesnt alter the fact that my life is ruined i have become a womanhater its an infernal nuisance because practically all the poetry i have ever written rather went out of its way to boost women and now ill have to start all over again and approach the subject from another angle women when i think how mother behaved and how wilhelmina treated me i wonder there isnt a law against them what mighty ills have not been done by woman who wast betrayed the capitol  in washington said sam puzzled he had heard nothing of this but then he generally confined his reading of the papers to the sporting page  in rome you ass ancient rome  oh as long ago as that  i was quoting from thomas otways orphan i wish i could write like otway he knew what he was talking about who wast betrayed the capitol a woman who lost marc anthony the world a woman who was the cause of a long ten years war and laid at last old troy in ashes woman destructive damnable deceitful woman  well of course he may be right in a way as regards some women i mean but the girl i met on the dock  dont said eustace hignett if you have anything bitter and derogatory to say about women say it and i will listen eagerly but if you merely wish to gibber about the ornamental exterior of some dashed girl you have been fool enough to get attracted by go and tell it to the captain or the ships cat or j b midgeley do try to realise that i am a soul in torment i am a ruin a spent force a man without a future what does life hold for me love i shall never love again my work i havent any i think i shall take to drink  talking of that said sam i suppose they open the bar directly we pass the threemile limit how about a small one  eustace shook his head gloomily  do you suppose i pass my time on board ship in gadding about and feasting directly the vessel begins to move i go to bed and stay there as a matter of fact i think it would be wisest to go to bed now dont let me keep you if you want to go on deck  it looks to me said sam as if i had been mistaken in thinking that you were going to be a ray of sunshine on the voyage  ray of sunshine said eustace hignett pulling a pair of mauve pyjamas out of the kitbag im going to be a volcano  sam left the stateroom and headed for the companion he wanted to get on deck and ascertain if that girl was still on board about now the sheep would be separating from the goats the passengers would be on deck and their friends returning to the shore a slight tremor in the boards on which he trod told him that this separation must have already taken place the ship was moving he ran lightly up the companion was she on board or was she not the next few minutes would decide he reached the top of the stairs and passed out on to the crowded deck and as he did so a scream followed by confused shouting came from the rail nearest the shore he perceived that the rail was black with people hanging over it they were all looking into the water  samuel marlowe was not one of those who pass aloofly by when there is excitement toward if a horse fell down in the street he was always among those present and he was never too busy to stop and stare at a blank window on which were inscribed the words watch this space in short he was one of natures rubbernecks and to dash to the rail and shove a fat man in a tweed cap to one side was with him the work of a moment he had thus an excellent view of what was going ona view which he improved the next instant by climbing up and kneeling on the rail  there was a man in the water a man whose upper section the only one visible was clad in a blue jersey he wore a bowler hat and from time to time as he battled with the waves he would put up a hand and adjust this more firmly on his head a dressy swimmer  scarcely had he taken in this spectacle when marlowe became aware of the girl he had met on the dock she was standing a few feet away leaning out over the rail with wide eyes and parted lips like everybody else she was staring into the water  as sam looked at her the thought crossed his mind that here was a wonderful chance of making the most tremendous impression on this girl what would she not think of a man who reckless of his own safety dived in and went boldly to the rescue and there were men no doubt who would be chumps enough to do it he thought as he prepared to shift back to a position of greater safety  at this moment the fat man in the tweed cap incensed at having been jostled out of the front row made his charge he had but been crouching the better to spring now he sprang his full weight took sam squarely in the spine there was an instant in which that young man hung as it were between sea and sky then he shot down over the rail to join the man in the blue jersey who had just discovered that his hat was not on straight and had paused to adjust it once more with a few skilful touches of the finger   § 3  in the brief interval of time which marlowe had spent in the stateroom chatting with eustace about the latters bruised soul some rather curious things had been happening above not extraordinary perhaps but curious these must now be related a story if it is to grip the reader should i am aware go always forward it should march it should leap from crag to crag like the chamois of the alps if there is one thing i hate it is a novel which gets you interested in the hero in chapter one and then cuts back in chapter two to tell you all about his grandfather nevertheless at this point we must go back a space we must return to the moment when having deposited her pekinese dog in her stateroom the girl with the red hair came out again on deck this happened just about the time when eustace hignett was beginning his narrative  the girl went to the rail and gazed earnestly at the shore there was a rattle as the gangplank moved inboard and was deposited on the deck the girl uttered a little cry of dismay then suddenly her face brightened and she began to wave her arm to attract the attention of an elderly man with a red face made redder by exertion who had just forced his way to the edge of the dock and was peering up at the passengerlined rail  the boat had now begun to move slowly out of its slip backing into the river it was now that the man on the dock sighted the girl she gesticulated at him he gesticulated at her he produced a handkerchief swiftly tied up a bundle of currency bills in it backed to give himself room and then with all the strength of his arm hurled the bills in the direction of the deck the handkerchief with its precious contents shot in a graceful arc towards the deck fell short by a good six feet and dropped into the water where it unfolded like a lily sending twentydollar bills tendollar bills fivedollar bills and an assortment of ones floating out over the wavelets  it was at this moment that mr oscar swenson one of the thriftiest souls who ever came out of sweden perceived that the chance of a lifetime had arrived for adding substantially to his little savings by profession he was one of those men who eke out a precarious livelihood by rowing dreamily about the waterfront in skiffs he was doing so now and as he sat meditatively in his skiff having done his best to give the liner a good send off by paddling round her in circles the pleading face of a twentydollar bill peered up at him mr swenson was not the man to resist the appeal he uttered a sharp bark of ecstasy pressed his bowler hat firmly upon his brow and dived in a moment later he had risen to the surface and was gathering up money with both hands  he was still busy with this congenial task when a tremendous splash at his side sent him under again and rising for a second time he observed with not a little chagrin that he had been joined by a young man in a blue flannel suit with an invisible stripe  svensk exclaimed mr swenson or whatever it is that natives of sweden exclaim in moments of justifiable annoyance he resented the advent of this newcomer he had been getting along fine and had had the situation well in hand to him sam marlowe represented competition and mr swenson desired no competitors in his treasureseeking enterprise he travels thought mr swenson the fastest who travels alone  sam marlowe had a touch of the philosopher in him he had the ability to adapt himself to circumstances it had been no part of his plans to come whizzing down off the rail into this singularly souplike water which tasted in equal parts of oil and dead rats but now that he was here he was prepared to make the best of the situation swimming it happened was one of the things he did best and somewhere among his belongings at home was a tarnished pewter cup which he had won at school in the saving life competition he knew exactly what to do you get behind the victim and grab him firmly under his arms and then you start swimming on your back a moment later the astonished mr swenson who being practically amphibious had not anticipated that anyone would have the cool impertinence to try to save him from drowning found himself seized from behind and towed vigorously away from a tendollar bill which he had almost succeeded in grasping the spiritual agony caused by this assault rendered him mercifully dumb though even had he contrived to utter the rich swedish oaths which occurred to him his remarks could scarcely have been heard for the crowd on the dock was cheering as one man they had often paid good money to see far less gripping sights in the movies they roared applause the liner meanwhile continued to move stodgily out into midriver  the only drawback to these lifesaving competitions at school considered from the standpoint of fitting the competitors for the problems of afterlife is that the object saved on such occasions is a leather dummy and of all things in this world a leather dummy is perhaps the most placid and phlegmatic it differs in many respects from an emotional swedish gentleman six foot high and constructed throughout of steel and indiarubber who is being lugged away from cash which he has been regarding in the light of a legacy indeed it would be hard to find a respect in which it does not differ so far from lying inert in sams arms and allowing himself to be saved in a quiet and orderly manner mr swenson betrayed all the symptoms of one who feels that he has fallen among murderers mr swenson much as he disliked competition was ready to put up with it provided that it was fair competition this pulling your rival away from the loot so that you could grab it yourselfthus shockingly had the man misinterpreted sams motiveswas another thing altogether and his stout soul would have none of it he began immediately to struggle with all the violence at his disposal his large hairy hands came out of the water and swung hopefully in the direction where he assumed his assailants face to be  sam was not unprepared for this display his researches in the art of lifesaving had taught him that your drowning man frequently struggles against his best interests in which case cruel to be kind one simply stunned the blighter he decided to stun mr swenson though if he had known that gentleman more intimately and had been aware that he had the reputation of possessing the thickest head on the waterfront he would have realised the magnitude of the task friends of mr swenson in convivial moments had frequently endeavoured to stun him with bottles boots and bits of lead piping and had gone away depressed by failure sam ignorant of this attempted to do the job with clenched fist which he brought down as smartly as possible on the crown of the others bowler hat  it was the worst thing he could have done mr swenson thought highly of his hat and this brutal attack upon it confirmed his gloomiest apprehensions now thoroughly convinced that the only thing to do was to sell his life dearly he wrenched himself round seized his assailant by the neck twined his arms about his middle and accompanied him below the surface  by the time he had swallowed his first pint and was beginning his second sam was reluctantly compelled to come to the conclusion that this was the end the thought irritated him unspeakably this he felt was just the silly contrary way things always happened why should it be he who was perishing like this why not eustace hignett now there was a fellow whom this sort of thing would just have suited brokenhearted eustace hignett would have looked on all this as a merciful release  he paused in his reflections to try to disentangle the more prominent of mr swensons limbs from about him by this time he was sure that he had never met anyone he disliked so intensely as mr swensonnot even his aunt adeline the man was a human octopus sam could count seven distinct legs twined round him and at least as many arms it seemed to him that he was being done to death in his prime by a solid platoon of swedes he put his whole soul into one last effort  something seemed to give  he was free pausing only to try to kick mr swenson in the face sam shot to the surface something hard and sharp prodded him in the head then something caught the collar of his coat and finally spouting like a whale he found himself dragged upwards and over the side of a boat  the time which sam had spent with mr swenson below the surface had been brief but it had been long enough to enable the whole floating population of the north river to converge on the scene in scows skiffs launches tugs and other vessels the fact that the water in that vicinity was crested with currency had not escaped the notice of these navigators and they had gone to it as one man first in the race came the tug reuben s watson the skipper of which following a famous precedent had taken his little daughter to bear him company it was to this fact that marlowe really owed his rescue women often have a vein of sentiment in them where men can only see the hard business side of a situation and it was the skippers daughter who insisted that the family boathook then in use as a harpoon for spearing dollar bills should be devoted to the less profitable but humaner end of extricating the young man from a watery grave  the skipper had grumbled a bit at first but had given wayhe always spoiled the girlwith the result that sam found himself sitting on the deck of the tug engaged in the complicated process of restoring his faculties to the normal in a sort of dream he perceived mr swenson rise to the surface some feet away adjust his bowler hat and after one long look of dislike in his direction swim off rapidly to intercept a five which was floating under the stern of a nearby skiff  sam sat on the deck and panted he played on the boards like a public fountain at the back of his mind there was a flickering thought that he wanted to do something a vague feeling that he had some sort of an appointment which he must keep but he was unable to think what it was meanwhile he conducted tentative experiments with his breath it was so long since he had last breathed that he had lost the knack of it  well aincher wet said a voice  the skippers daughter was standing beside him looking down commiseratingly of the rest of the family all he could see was the broad blue seats of their trousers as they leaned hopefully over the side in the quest for wealth  yes sir you sure are wet gee i never seen anyone so wet i seen wet guys but i never seen anyone so wet as you yessir youre certainly wet  i am wet admitted sam  yessir youre wet wets the word all right good and wet thats what you are  its the water said sam his brain was still clouded he wished he could remember what that appointment was thats what has made me wet  its sure made you wet all right agreed the girl she looked at him interestedly wotcha do it for she asked  do it for  yes wotcha do it for wotcha do a brodie for offn that ship i didnt see it myself but pa says you come walloping down offn the deck like a sack of potatoes  sam uttered a sharp cry he had remembered  where is she  wheres who  the liner  shes off down the river i guess she was swinging round the last i seen of her  shes not gone  sure shes gone wotcha expect her to do shes gotta get over to the other side aint she certnly shes gone she looked at him interested do you want to be on board her  of course i do  then for the love of pete wotcha doin walloping offn her like a sack of potatoes  i slipped i was pushed or something sam sprang to his feet and looked wildly about him i must get back isnt there any way of getting back  well you could ketch up with her at quarantine out in the bay shell stop to let the pilot off  can you take me to quarantine  the girl glanced doubtfully at the seat of the nearest pair of trousers  well we could she said but pas kind of set in his ways and right now hes fishing for dollar bills with the boat hook hes apt to get sorta mad if hes interrupted  ill give him fifty dollars if hell put me on board  got it on you inquired the nymph coyly she had her share of sentiment but she was her fathers daughter and inherited from him the business sense  here it is he pulled out his pocket book the book was dripping but the contents were only fairly moist  pa said the girl  the trouserseat remained where it was deaf to its childs cry  pa cummere wantcha  the trousers did not even quiver but this girl was a girl of decision there was some nautical implement resting in a rack convenient to her hand it was long solid and constructed of one of the harder forms of wood deftly extracting this from its place she smote her inattentive parent on the only visible portion of him he turned sharply exhibiting a red bearded face  pa this genman wants to be took aboard the boat at quarantine hell give you fifty berries  the wrath died out of the skippers face like the slow turning down of a lamp the fishing had been poor and so far he had only managed to secure a single twodollar bill in a crisis like the one which had so suddenly arisen you cannot do yourself justice with a boathook  fifty berries  fifty seeds the girl assured him are you on  queen said the skipper simply you said a mouthful  twenty minutes later sam was climbing up the side of the liner as it lay towering over the tug like a mountain his clothes hung about him clammily he squelched as he walked  a kindlylooking old gentleman who was smoking a cigar by the rail regarded him with open eyes  my dear sir youre very wet he said  sam passed him with a cold face and hurried through the door leading to the companion way  mummie why is that man wet cried the clear voice of a little child  sam whizzed by leaping down the stairs  good lord sir youre very wet said a steward in the doorway of the dining saloon  you are wet said a stewardess in the passage  sam raced for his stateroom he bolted in and sank on the lounge in the lower berth eustace hignett was lying with closed eyes he opened them languidly then stared  hullo he said i say youre wet   § 4  sam removed his clinging garments and hurried into a new suit he was in no mood for conversation and eustace hignetts frank curiosity jarred upon him happily at this point a sudden shivering of the floor and a creaking of woodwork proclaimed the fact that the vessel was under way again and his cousin turning peagreen rolled over on his side with a hollow moan sam finished buttoning his waistcoat and went out  he was passing the inquiry bureau on the cdeck striding along with bent head and scowling brow when a sudden exclamation caused him to look up and the scowl was wiped from his brow as with a sponge for there stood the girl he had met on the dock with her was a superfluous young man who looked like a parrot  oh how are you asked the girl breathlessly  splendid thanks said sam  didnt you get very wet  i did get a little damp  i thought you would said the young man who looked like a parrot directly i saw you go over the side i said to myself that fellows going to get wet  there was a pause  oh said the girl may imr  marlowe  mr marlowe mr bream mortimer  sam smirked at the young man the young man smirked at sam  nearly got left behind said bream mortimer  yes nearly  no joke getting left behind  no  have to take the next boat lose a lot of time said mr mortimer driving home his point  the girl had listened to these intellectual exchanges with impatience she now spoke again  oh bream  hello  do be a dear and run down to the saloon and see if its all right about our places for lunch  it is all right the table steward said so  yes but go and make certain  all right  he hopped away and the girl turned to sam with shining eyes  oh mr marlowe you oughtnt to have done it really you oughtnt you might have been drowned but i never saw anything so wonderful it was like the stories of knights who used to jump into lions dens after gloves  yes said sam a little vaguely the resemblance had not struck him it seemed a silly hobby and rough on the lions too  it was the sort of thing sir lancelot or sir galahad would have done but you shouldnt have bothered really its all right now  oh its all right now  yes id quite forgotten that mr mortimer was to be on board he has given me all the money i shall need you see it was this way i had to sail on this boat in rather a hurry fathers head clerk was to have gone to the bank and got some money and met me on board and given it to me but the silly old man was late and when he got to the dock they had just pulled in the gangplank so he tried to throw the money to me in a handkerchief and it fell into the water but you shouldnt have dived in after it  oh well said sam straightening his tie with a quiet brave smile he had never expected to feel grateful to that obese bounder who had shoved him off the rail but now he would have liked to seek him out and shake him by the hand  you really are the bravest man i ever met  oh no  how modest you are but i suppose all brave men are modest  i was only too delighted at what looked like a chance of doing you a service  it was the extraordinary quickness of it that was so wonderful i do admire presence of mind you didnt hesitate for a second you just shot over the side as though propelled by some irresistible force  it was nothing nothing really one just happens to have the knack of keeping ones head and acting quickly on the spur of the moment some people have it some havent  and just think as bream was saying  it is all right said mr mortimer reappearing suddenly i saw a couple of the stewards and they both said it was all right so its all right  splendid said the girl oh bream  hello  do be an angel and run along to my stateroom and see if pinkyboodles is quite comfortable  bound to be  yes but do go he may be feeling lonely chirrup to him a little  chirrup  yes to cheer him up  oh all right  run along  mr mortimer ran along he had the air of one who feels that he only needs a peaked cap and a uniform two sizes too small for him to be a properly equipped messenger boy  and as bream was saying resumed the girl you might have been left behind  that said sam edging a step closer was the thought that tortured me the thought that a friendship so delightfully begun  but it hadnt begun we have never spoken to each other before now  have you forgotten on the dock  sudden enlightenment came into her eyes  oh you are the man poor pinkyboodles bit  the lucky man  her face clouded  poor pinky is feeling the motion of the boat a little its his first voyage  i shall always remember that it was pinky who first brought us together would you care for a stroll on deck  not just now thanks i must be getting back to my room to finish unpacking after lunch perhaps  i will be there by the way you know my name but  oh mine she smiled brightly its funny that a persons name is the last thing one thinks of asking mine is bennett  bennett  wilhelmina bennett my friends she said softly as she turned away call me billie     chapter iii  sam paves the way   for some moments sam remained where he was staring after the girl as she flitted down the passage he felt dizzy mental acrobatics always have an unsettling effect and a young man may be excused for feeling a little dizzy when he is called upon suddenly and without any warning to readjust all his preconceived views on any subject listening to eustace hignetts story of his blighted romance sam had formed an unflattering opinion of this wilhelmina bennett who had broken off her engagement simply because on the day of the marriage his cousin had been short of the necessary wedding garment he had indeed thought a little smugly how different his goddess of the red hair was from the object of eustace hignetts affections and now they had proved to be one and the same it was disturbing it was like suddenly finding the vampire of a fivereel feature film turn into the heroine  some men on making the discovery of this girls identity might have felt that providence had intervened to save them from a disastrous entanglement this point of view never occurred to samuel marlowe the way he looked at it was that he had been all wrong about wilhelmina bennett eustace he felt had been to blame throughout if this girl had maltreated eustaces finer feelings then her reason for doing so must have been excellent and praiseworthy  after all  poor old eustace  quite a good fellow no doubt in many ways  but coming down to brass tacks what was there about eustace that gave him any claim to monopolise the affections of a wonderful girl where in a word did eustace hignett get off he made a tremendous grievance of the fact that she had broken off the engagement but what right had he to go about the place expecting her to be engaged to him eustace hignett no doubt looked upon the poor girl as utterly heartless marlowe regarded her behaviour as thoroughly sensible she had made a mistake and realising this at the eleventh hour she had had the force of character to correct it he was sorry for poor old eustace but he really could not permit the suggestion that wilhelmina bennetther friends called her billiehad not behaved in a perfectly splendid way throughout it was women like wilhelmina bennettbillie to her intimateswho made the world worth living in  her friends called her billie he did not blame them it was a delightful name and suited her to perfection he practised it a few times billie  billie  billie it certainly ran pleasantly off the tongue billie bennett very musical billie marlowe still better we noticed among those present the charming and popular mrs billie marlowe  a consuming desire came over him to talk about the girl to someone obviously indicated as the party of the second part was eustace hignett if eustace was still capable of speechand after all the boat was hardly rolling at allhe would enjoy a further chat about his ruined life besides he had another reason for seeking eustaces society as a man who had been actually engaged to marry this supreme girl eustace hignett had an attraction for sam akin to that of some great public monument he had become a sort of shrine he had taken on a glamour sam entered the stateroom almost reverentially with something of the emotions of a boy going into his first dime museum  the exhibit was lying on his back staring at the roof of the berth by lying absolutely still and forcing himself to think of purely inland scenes and objects he had contrived to reduce the green in his complexion to a mere tinge but it would be paltering with the truth to say that he felt debonair he received sam with a wan austerity  sit down he said dont stand there swaying like that i cant bear it  why we arent out of the harbour yet surely you arent going to be seasick already  i can issue no positive guarantee perhaps if i can keep my mind off it i have had good results for the last ten minutes by thinking steadily of the sahara there said eustace hignett with enthusiasm is a place for you that is something like a spot miles and miles of sand and not a drop of water anywhere  sam sat down on the lounge  youre quite right the great thing is to concentrate your mind on other topics why not for instance tell me some more about your unfortunate affair with that girlbillie bennett i think you said her name was  wilhelmina bennett where on earth did you get the idea that her name was billie  i had a notion that girls called wilhelmina were sometimes billie to their friends  i never called her anything but wilhelmina but i really cannot talk about it the recollection tortures me  thats just what you want its the counterirritation principle persevere and youll soon forget that youre on board ship at all  theres something in that admitted eustace reflectively its very good of you to be so sympathetic and interested  my dear fellow  anything that i can do  where did you meet her first for instance  at a dinner eustace hignett broke off abruptly he had a good memory and he had just recollected the fish they had served at that dinnera flabby and exhausted looking fish half sunk beneath the surface of a thick white sauce  and what struck you most forcibly about her at first her lovely hair i suppose  how did you know she had lovely hair  my dear chap i naturally assumed that any girl with whom you fell in love would have nice hair  well you are perfectly right as it happens her hair was remarkably beautiful it was red  like autumn leaves with the sun on them said marlowe ecstatically  hignett started  what an extraordinary thing that is an absolutely exact description her eyes were a deep blue  or rather green  blue  green there is a shade of green that looks blue  what the devil do you know about the colour of her eyes demanded eustace heatedly am i telling you about her or are you telling me  my dear old man dont get excited dont you see i am trying to construct this girl in my imagination to visualise her i dont pretend to doubt your special knowledge but after all green eyes generally do go with red hair and there are all shades of green there is the bright green of meadow grass the dull green of the uncut emerald the faint yellowish green of your face at the present moment  dont talk about the colour of my face now youve gone and reminded me just when i was beginning to forget  awfully sorry stupid of me get your mind off it againquick what were we saying oh yes this girl i always think it helps one to form a mental picture of people if one knows something about their tasteswhat sort of things they are interested in their favourite topics of conversation and so on this miss bennett now what did she like talking about  oh all sorts of things  yes but what  well for one thing she was very fond of poetry it was that which first drew us together  poetry sams heart sank a little he had read a certain amount of poetry at school and once he had won a prize of three shillings and sixpence for the last line of a limerick in a competition in a weekly paper but he was selfcritic enough to know that poetry was not his long suit still there was a library on board the ship and no doubt it would be possible to borrow the works of some standard bard and bone them up from time to time any special poet  well she seemed to like my stuff you never read my sonnetsequence on spring did you  no what other poets did she like besides you  tennyson principally said eustace hignett with a reminiscent quiver in his voice the hours we have spent together reading the idylls of the king  the which of what inquired sam taking a pencil from his pocket and shooting out a cuff  the idylls of the king my good man i know you have a soul which would be considered inadequate by a common earthworm but you have surely heard of tennysons idylls of the king  oh those why my dear old chap tennysons idylls of the king well i should say have i heard of tennysons idylls of the king well really i suppose you havent a copy with you on board by any chance  there is a copy in my kit bag the very one we used to read together take it and keep it or throw it overboard i dont want to see it again  sam prospected among the shirts collars and trousers in the bag and presently came upon a moroccobound volume he laid it beside him on the lounge  little by little bit by bit he said i am beginning to form a sort of picture of this girl thiswhat was her name again bennettthis miss bennett you have a wonderful knack of description you make her seem so real and vivid tell me some more about her she wasnt keen on golf by any chance i suppose  i believe she did play the subject came up once and she seemed rather enthusiastic why  well id much sooner talk to a girl about golf than poetry  you are hardly likely to be in a position to have to talk to wilhelmina bennett about either i should imagine  no theres that of course i was thinking of girls in general some girls bar golf and then its rather difficult to know how to start the conversation but tell me were there any topics which got on this miss bennetts nerves if you know what i mean it seems to me that at one time or another you may have said something that offended her i mean it seems curious that she should have broken off the engagement if you had never disagreed or quarrelled about anything  well of course there was always the matter of that dog of hers she had a dog you know a snappy brute of a pekinese if there was ever any shadow of disagreement between us it had to do with that dog i made rather a point of it that i would not have it about the home after we were married  i see said sam he shot his cuff once more and wrote on it dogconciliate yes of course that must have wounded her  not half so much as he wounded me he pinned me by the ankle the day before wewilhelmina and i i meanwere to have been married it is some satisfaction to me in my broken state to remember that i got home on the little beast with considerable juiciness and lifted him clean over the chesterfield  sam shook his head reprovingly  you shouldnt have done that he said he extended his cuff and added the words vitally important to what he had just written it was probably that which decided her  well i hate dogs said eustace hignett querulously i remember wilhelmina once getting quite annoyed with me because i refused to step in and separate a couple of the brutes absolute strangers to me who were fighting in the street i reminded her that we were all fighters nowadays that life itself was in a sense a fight but she wouldnt be reasonable about it she said that sir galahad would have done it like a shot i thought not we have no evidence whatsoever that sir galahad was ever called upon to do anything half as dangerous and anyway he wore armour give me a suit of mail reaching well down over the ankles and i will willingly intervene in a hundred dog fights but in thin flannel trousers no  sam rose his heart was light he had never of course supposed that the girl was anything but perfect but it was nice to find his high opinion of her corroborated by one who had no reason to exhibit her in a favourable light he understood her point of view and sympathised with it an idealist how could she trust herself to eustace hignett how could she be content with a craven who instead of scouring the world in the quest for deeds of derringdo had fallen down so lamentably on his first assignment there was a specious attractiveness about poor old eustace which might conceivably win a girls heart for a time he wrote poetry talked well and had a nice singing voice but as a partner for life  well he simply wouldnt do that was all there was to it he simply didnt add up right the man a girl like wilhelmina bennett required for a husband was somebody entirely different  somebody felt samuel marlowe much more like samuel marlowe  swelled almost to bursting point with these reflections he went on deck to join the anteluncheon promenade he saw billie almost at once she had put on one of those nice sacky sportcoats which so enhance feminine charms and was striding along the deck with the breeze playing in her vivid hair like the female equivalent of a viking beside her walked young mr bream mortimer  sam had been feeling a good deal of a fellow already but at the sight of her welcoming smile his selfesteem almost caused him to explode what magic there is in a girls smile it is the raisin which dropped in the yeast of male complacency induces fermentation  oh there you are mr marlowe  oh there you are said bream mortimer with a slightly different inflection  i thought id like a breath of fresh air before lunch said sam  oh bream said the girl  hello  do be a darling and take this great heavy coat of mine down to my stateroom will you i had no idea it was so warm  ill carry it said bream  nonsense i wouldnt dream of burdening you with it trot along and put it on the berth it doesnt matter about folding it up  all right said bream moodily  he trotted along there are moments when a man feels that all he needs in order to be a delivery wagon is a horse and a driver bream mortimer was experiencing such a moment  he had better chirrup to the dog while hes there dont you think suggested sam he felt that a resolute man with legs as long as breams might well deposit a cloak on a berth and be back under the halfminute  oh yes bream  hello  while youre down there just chirrup a little more to poor pinky he does appreciate it so  bream disappeared it is not always easy to interpret emotion from a glance at a mans back but breams back looked like that of a man to whom the thought has occurred that given a couple of fiddles and a piano he would have made a good hired orchestra  how is your dear little dog by the way inquired sam solicitously as he fell into step by her side  much better now thanks ive made friends with a girl on boarddid you ever hear her namejane hubbardshes a rather wellknown biggame hunter and she fixed up some sort of a mixture for pinky which did him a world of good i dont know what was in it except worcester sauce but she said she always gave it to her mules in africa when they had the botts  its very nice of you to speak so affectionately of poor pinky when he bit you  animal spirits said sam tolerantly pure animal spirits i like to see them but of course i love all dogs  oh do you so do i  i only wish they didnt fight so much im always stopping dogfights  i do admire a man who knows what to do at a dogfight im afraid im rather helpless myself there never seems anything to catch hold of she looked down have you been reading what is the book  the book oh this its a volume of tennyson  are you fond of tennyson  i worship him said sam reverently  those he glanced at his cuffthose idylls of the king i do not like to think what an ocean voyage would be if i had not my tennyson with me  we must read him together he is my favourite poet  we will there is something about tennyson  yes isnt there ive felt that myself so often  some poets are whales at epics and all that sort of thing while others call it a day when theyve written something that runs to a couple of verses but where tennyson had the bulge was that his long game was just as good as his short he was great off the tee and a marvel with his chipshots  that sounds as though you play golf  when i am not reading tennyson you can generally find me out on the links do you play  i love it how extraordinary that we should have so much in common you seem to like all the things i like we really ought to be great friends  he was pausing to select the best of three replies when the lunch bugle sounded  oh dear she cried i must rush but we shall see one another again up here afterwards  we will said sam  well sit and read tennyson  fine eryou and i and mortimer  oh no bream is going to sit down below and look after poor pinky  does hedoes he know he is  not yet said billie im going to tell him at lunch     chapter iv  sam clicks   § 1  it was the fourth morning of the voyage of course when this story is done in the movies they wont be satisfied with a bald statement like that they will have a spoken title or a cutback subcaption or whatever they call the thing in the low dens where motionpicture scenariolizards do their dark work which will run        and so calm and golden the days went by each fraught with hope      and youth and sweetness linking two young hearts in silken fetters      forged by the laughing lovegod   and the males in the audience will shift their chewing gum to the other cheek and take a firmer grip of their companions hands and the man at the piano will play everybody wants a key to my cellar or something equally appropriate very soulfully and slowly with a wistful eye on the halfsmoked cigarette which he has parked on the lowest octave and intends finishing as soon as the picture is over but i prefer the plain frank statement that it was the fourth day of the voyage that is my story and i mean to stick to it  samuel marlowe muffled in a bathrobe came back to the stateroom from his tub his manner had the offensive jauntiness of the man who has had a cold bath when he might just as easily have had a hot one he looked out of the porthole at the shimmering sea he felt strong and happy and exuberant  it was not merely the spiritual pride induced by a cold bath that was uplifting this young man the fact was that as he towelled his glowing back he had suddenly come to the decision that this very day he would propose to wilhelmina bennett yes he would put his fortune to the test to win or lose it all true he had only known her for four days but what of that  nothing in the way of modern progress is more remarkable than the manner in which the attitude of your lover has changed concerning proposals of marriage when samuel marlowes grandfather had convinced himself after about a year and a half of respectful aloofness that the emotion which he felt towards samuel marlowes grandmothertobe was love the fashion of the period compelled him to approach the matter in a roundabout way first he spent an evening or two singing sentimental ballads she accompanying him on the piano and the rest of the family sitting on the sidelines to see that no rough stuff was pulled having noted that she drooped her eyelashes and turned faintly pink when he came to the theeonly thee bit he felt a mild sense of encouragement strong enough to justify him in taking her sister aside next day and asking if the object of his affections ever happened to mention his name in the course of conversation further pourparlers having passed with her aunt two more sisters and her little brother he felt that the moment had arrived when he might send her a volume of shelley with some of the passages marked in pencil a few weeks later he interviewed her father and obtained his consent to the paying of his addresses and finally after writing her a letter which began madam you will not have been insensible to the fact that for some time past you have inspired in my bosom feelings deeper than those of ordinary friendship he waylaid her in the rosegarden and brought the thing off  how different is the behaviour of the modern young man his courtship can hardly be called a courtship at all his methods are those of sir w s gilberts alphonso        alphonso who for cool assurance all creation licks      he up and said to emily who has cheek enough for six      miss emily i love you will you marry say the word      and emily said certainly alphonso like a bird   sam marlowe was a warm supporter of the alphonso method he was a bright young man and did not require a year to make up his mind that wilhelmina bennett had been set apart by fate from the beginning of time to be his bride he had known it from the moment he saw her on the dock and all the subsequent strolling reading talking soupdrinking teadrinking and shuffleboardplaying which they had done together had merely solidified his original impression he loved this girl with all the force of a fiery naturethe fiery nature of the marlowes was a byword in bruton street berkeley squareand something seemed to whisper that she loved him at any rate she wanted somebody like sir galahad and without wishing to hurl bouquets at himself he could not see where she could possibly get anyone liker sir galahad than himself so wind and weather permitting samuel marlowe intended to propose to wilhelmina bennett this very day  he let down the trick basin which hung beneath the mirror and collecting his shaving materials began to lather his face  i am the bandolero sang sam blithely through the soap i am i am the bandolero yes yes i am the bandolero  the untidy heap of bedclothes in the lower berth stirred restlessly  oh god said eustace hignett thrusting out a tousled head  sam regarded his cousin with commiseration horrid things had been happening to eustace during the last few days and it was quite a pleasant surprise each morning to find that he was still alive  feeling bad again old man  i was feeling all right replied hignett churlishly until you began the farmyard imitations what sort of a day is it  glorious the sea  dont talk about the sea  sorry the sun is shining brighter than it has ever shone in the history of the race why dont you get up  nothing will induce me to get up  well go a regular buster and have an egg for breakfast  eustace hignett shuddered he eyed sam sourly you seem devilish pleased with yourself this morning he said censoriously  sam dried the razor carefully and put it away he hesitated then the desire to confide in somebody got the better of him  the fact is he said apologetically im in love  in love eustace hignett sat up and bumped his head sharply against the berth above him has this been going on long  ever since the voyage started  i think you might have told me said eustace reproachfully i told you my troubles why did you not let me know that this awful thing had come upon you  well as a matter of fact old man during these last few days i had a notion that your mind was so to speak occupied elsewhere  who is she  oh a girl i met on board  dont do it said eustace hignett solemnly as a friend i entreat you not to do it take my advice as a man who knows women and dont do it  dont do what  propose to her i can tell by the glitter in your eye that you are intending to propose to this girlprobably this morning  not this morningafter lunch i always think one can do oneself more justice after lunch  dont do it women are the devil whether they marry you or jilt you do you realise that women wear black evening dresses that have to be hooked up in a hurry when you are late for the theatre and that out of sheer wanton malignity the hooks and eyes on those dresses are also made black do you realise  oh ive thought it all out  and take the matter of children how would you like to become the fatherand a mere glance around you will show you that the chances are enormously in favour of such a thing happeningof a boy with spectacles and protruding front teeth who asks questions all the time out of six small boys whom i saw when i came on board four wore spectacles and had teeth like rabbits the other two were equally revolting in different styles how would you like to become the father  there is no need to be indelicate said sam stiffly a man must take these chances  give her the miss in baulk pleaded hignett stay down here for the rest of the voyage you can easily dodge her when you get to southampton and if she sends messages say youre ill and cant be disturbed  sam gazed at him revolted more than ever he began to understand how it was that a girl with ideals had broken off her engagement with this man he finished dressing and after a satisfying breakfast went on deck   § 2  it was as he had said a glorious morning the sample which he had had through the porthole had not prepared him for the magic of it the ship swam in a vast bowl of the purest blue on an azure carpet flecked with silver it was a morning which impelled a man to great deeds a morning which shouted to him to chuck his chest out and be romantic the sight of billie bennett trim and gleaming in a pale green sweater and white skirt had the effect of causing marlowe to alter the programme which he had sketched out proposing to this girl was not a thing to be put off till after lunch it was a thing to be done now and at once the finest efforts of the finest cooks in the world could not put him in better form than he felt at present  good morning miss bennett  good morning mr marlowe  isnt it a perfect day  wonderful  it makes all the difference on board ship if the weather is fine  yes doesnt it  how strange it is that the great emotional scenes of history one of which is coming along almost immediately always begin in this prosaic way shakespeare tries to conceal the fact but there can be little doubt that romeo and juliet edged into their balcony scene with a few remarks on the pleasantness of the morning  shall we walk round said billie  sam glanced about him it was the time of day when the promenade deck was always full passengers in cocoons of rugs lay on chairs waiting in a dull trance till the steward should arrive with the eleven oclock soup others more energetic strode up and down from the point of view of a man who wished to reveal his most sacred feelings to a beautiful girl the place was practically a tube station during the rush hour  its so crowded he said lets go on to the upper deck  all right you can read to me go and fetch your tennyson  sam felt that fortune was playing into his hands his fourdays acquaintance with the bard had been sufficient to show him that the man was there forty ways when it came to writing about love you could open his collected works almost anywhere and shut your eyes and dab down your finger on some redhot passage a proposal of marriage is a thing which it is rather difficult to bring neatly into the ordinary run of conversation it wants leading up to but if you once start reading poetry especially tennysons almost anything is apt to give you your cue he bounded lightheartedly into the stateroom waking eustace hignett from an uneasy dose  now what said eustace  wheres that copy of tennyson you gave me i left itah here it is well see you later  wait what are you going to do  oh that girl i told you about said sam making for the door she wants me to read tennyson to her on the upper deck  tennyson  yes  on the upper deck  yes  this is the end said eustace hignett turning his face to the wall  sam raced up the companionway as far as it went then going out on deck climbed a flight of steps and found himself in the only part of the ship which was ever even comparatively private the main herd of passengers preferred the promenade deck two layers below  he threaded his way through a maze of boats ropes and curiousshaped steel structures which the architect of the ship seemed to have tacked on at the last moment in a spirit of sheer exuberance above him towered one of the funnels before him a long slender mast he hurried on and presently came upon billie sitting on a garden seat backed by the white roof of the smokeroom beside this was a small deck which seemed to have lost its way and strayed up here all by itself it was the deck on which one could occasionally see the patients playing an odd game with long sticks and bits of woodnot shuffleboard but something even lower in the mental scale this morning however the devotees of this pastime were apparently under proper restraint for the deck was empty  this is jolly he said sitting down beside the girl and drawing a deep breath of satisfaction  yes i love this deck its so peaceful  its the only part of the ship where you can be reasonably sure of not meeting stout men in flannels and nautical caps an ocean voyage always makes me wish that i had a private yacht  it would be nice  a private yacht repeated sam sliding a trifle closer we would sail about visiting desert islands which lay like jewels in the heart of tropic seas  we  most certainly we it wouldnt be any fun if you were not there  thats very complimentary  well it wouldnt im not fond of girls as a rule  oh arent you  no said sam decidedly it was a point which he wished to make clear at the outset not at all fond my friends have often remarked upon it a palmist once told me that i had one of those rare spiritual natures which cannot be satisfied with substitutes but must seek and seek till they find their soulmate when other men all round me were frittering away their emotions in idle flirtations which did not touch their deeper natures i was  i was  well i wasnt if you see what i mean  oh you wasnt  werent  no some day i knew i should meet the only girl i could possibly love and then i would pour out upon her the storedup devotion of a lifetime lay an unblemished heart at her feet fold her in my arms and say at last  how jolly for her like having a circus all to oneself  well yes said sam after a momentary pause  when i was a child i always thought that that would be the most wonderful thing in the world  the most wonderful thing in the world is love a pure and consuming love a love which  oh hello said a voice  all through this scene right from the very beginning of it sam had not been able to rid himself of a feeling that there was something missing the time and the place and the girlthey were all present and correct nevertheless there was something missing some familiar object which seemed to leave a gap he now perceived that what had caused the feeling was the complete absence of bream mortimer he was absent no longer he was standing in front of them with one leg his head lowered as if he were waiting for someone to scratch it sams primary impulse was to offer him a nut  oh hello bream said billie  hullo said sam  hello said bream mortimer here you are  there was a pause  i thought you might be here said bream  yes here we are said billie  yes were here said sam  there was another pause  mind if i join you said bream  nno said billie  nno said sam  no said billie again no  that is to say  oh no no at all  there was a third pause  on second thoughts said bream i believe ill take a stroll on the promenade deck if you dont mind  they said they did not mind bream mortimer having bumped his head twice against overhanging steel ropes melted away  who is that fellow demanded sam wrathfully  hes the son of fathers best friend  sam started somehow this girl had always been so individual to him that he had never thought of her having a father  we have known each other all our lives continued billie father thinks a tremendous lot of bream i suppose it was because bream was sailing by her that father insisted on my coming over on this boat im in disgrace you know i was cabled for and had to sail at a few days notice i  oh hello  why bream said billie looking at him as he stood on the old spot in the same familiar attitude with rather less affection than the son of her fathers best friend might have expected i thought you said you were going down to the promenade deck  i did go down to the promenade deck and id hardly got there when a fellow whos getting up the ships concert tomorrow night nobbled me to do something for it i said i could only do conjuring tricks and juggling and so on and he said all right do conjuring tricks and juggling then he wanted to know if i knew anyone else who would help i came up to ask you he said to sam if you would do something  no said sam i wont  hes got a man whos going to lecture on deepsea fish and a couple of women who both want to sing the rosary but hes still a turn or two short sure you wont rally round  quite sure  oh all right bream mortimer hovered wistfully above them its a great morning isnt it  yes said sam  oh bream said billie  hello  do be a pet and go and talk to jane hubbard im sure she must be feeling lonely i left her all by herself down on the next deck  a look of alarm spread itself over breams face  jane hubbard oh say have a heart  shes a very nice girl  shes so darned dynamic she looks at you as if you were a giraffe or something and she would like to take a pot at you with a rifle  nonsense run along get her to tell you some of her biggame hunting experiences they are most interesting  bream drifted sadly away  i dont blame miss hubbard said sam  what do you mean  looking at him as if she wanted to pot at him with a rifle i should like to do it myself  oh dont lets talk about bream read me some tennyson  sam opened the book very willingly infernal bream mortimer had absolutely shot to pieces the spell which had begun to fall on them at the beginning of their conversation only by reading poetry it seemed to him could it be recovered and when he saw the passage at which the volume had opened he realised that his luck was in good old tennyson he was all right he had the stuff you could rely on him every time  he cleared his throat        oh let the solid ground        not fail beneath my feet      before my life has found        what some have found so sweet      then let come what come may        what matter if i go mad      i shall have had my day       let the sweet heavens endure        not close and darken above me      before i am quite quite sure        that there is one to love me   this was absolutely topping it was like diving off a springboard he could see the girl sitting with a soft smile on her face her eyes big and dreamy gazing out over the sunlit sea he laid down the book and took her hand  there is something he began in a low voice which i have been trying to say ever since we met something which i think you must have read in my eyes  her head was bent she did not withdraw her hand  until this voyage began he went on i did not know what life meant and then i saw you it was like the gate of heaven opening youre the dearest girl i ever met and you can bet ill never forget he stopped im not trying to make it rhyme he said apologetically billie dont think me silly  i mean  if you had the merest notion dearest  i dont know whats the matter with me  billie darling you are the only girl in the world i have been looking for you for years and years and i have found you at last my soulmate surely this does not come as a surprise to you that is i mean you must have seen that ive been keen theres that damned walt mason stuff again his eyes fell on the volume beside him and he uttered an exclamation of enlightenment its those poems he cried ive been boning them up to such an extent that theyve got me doing it too what im trying to say is will you marry me  she was drooping towards him her face was very sweet and tender her eyes misty he slid an arm about her waist she raised her lips to his   § 3  suddenly she drew herself away a cloud on her face  darling she said ive a confession to make  a confession you nonsense  i cant get rid of a horrible thought i was wondering if this will last  our love dont be afraid that it will fade  i mean  why its so vast its bound to last  that is to say of course it will  she traced a pattern on the deck with her shoe  im afraid of myself you see once beforeand it was not so very long agoi thought i had met my ideal but  sam laughed heartily  are you worrying about that absurd business of poor old eustace hignett  she started violently  you know  of course he told me himself  do you know him where did you meet him  ive known him all my life hes my cousin as a matter of fact we are sharing a stateroom on board now  eustace is on board oh this is awful what shall i do when i meet him  oh pass it off with a light laugh and a genial quip just say oh here you are or something you know the sort of thing  it will be terrible  not a bit of it why should you feel embarrassed he must have realised by now that you acted in the only possible way it was absurd his ever expecting you to marry him i mean to say just look at it dispassionately  eustace  poor old eustace  and you the princess and the swineherd  does mr hignett keep pigs she asked surprised  i mean that poor old eustace is so far below you darling that with the most charitable intentions one can only look on his asking you to marry him in the light of a record exhibition of pure nerve a dear good fellow of course but hopeless where the sterner realities of life are concerned a man who cant even stop a dogfight in a world which is practically one seething mass of fighting dogs how could you trust yourself to such a one nobody is fonder of eustace hignett than i am but  well i mean to say  i see what you mean he really wasnt my ideal  not by a mile  she mused her chin in her hand  of course he was quite a dear in a lot of ways  oh a splendid chap said sam tolerantly  have you ever heard him sing i think what first attracted me to him was his beautiful voice he really sings extraordinarily well  a slight but definite spasm of jealousy afflicted sam he had no objection to praising poor old eustace within decent limits but the conversation seemed to him to be confining itself too exclusively to one subject  yes he said oh yes ive heard him sing not lately he does drawingroom ballads and all that sort of thing still i suppose  have you ever heard him sing my love is like a glowing tulip that in an oldworld garden grows  i have not had that advantage replied sam stiffly but anyone can sing a drawingroom ballad now something funny something that will make people laugh something that really needs putting across  thats a different thing altogether  do you sing that sort of thing  people have been good enough to say  then said billie decidedly you must certainly do something at the ships concert tomorrow the idea of your trying to hide your light under a bushel i will tell bream to count on you he is an excellent accompanist he can accompany you  yes but  well i dont know said sam doubtfully he could not help remembering that the last time he had sung in public had been at a housesupper at school seven years before and that on that occasion somebody whom it was a lasting grief to him that he had been unable to identify had thrown a pat of butter at him  of course you must sing said billie ill tell bream when i go down to lunch what will you sing  weller  well im sure it will be wonderful whatever it is you are so wonderful in every way you remind me of one of the heroes of old  sams discomposure vanished in the first place this was much more the sort of conversation which he felt the situation indicated in the second place he had remembered that there was no need for him to sing at all he could do that imitation of frank tinney which had been such a hit at the trinity smoker he was on safe ground there he knew he was good he clasped the girl to him and kissed her sixteen times   § 4  billie bennett stood in front of the mirror in her stateroom dreamily brushing the glorious red hair that fell in a tumbled mass about her shoulders on the lounge beside her swathed in a businesslike grey kimono jane hubbard watched her smoking a cigarette  jane hubbard was a splendid specimen of bronzed strapping womanhood her whole appearance spoke of the open air and the great wide spaces and all that sort of thing she was a thoroughly wholesome manly girl about the same age as billie with a strong chin and an eye that had looked leopards squarely in the face and caused them to withdraw abashed into the undergrowth or whereever it is that leopards withdraw when abashed one could not picture jane hubbard flirting lightly at garden parties but one could picture her very readily arguing with a mutinous native bearer or with a firm touch putting sweetness and light into the soul of a refractory mule boadicea in her girlhood must have been rather like jane hubbard  she smoked contentedly she had rolled her cigarette herself with one hand a feat beyond the powers of all but the very greatest she was pleasantly tired after walking eightyfive times round the promenade deck soon she would go to bed and fall asleep the moment her head touched the pillow but meanwhile she lingered here for she felt that billie had something to confide in her  jane said billie have you ever been in love  jane hubbard knocked the ash off her cigarette  not since i was eleven she said in her deep musical voice he was my musicmaster he was fortyseven and completely bald but there was an appealing weakness in him which won my heart he was afraid of cats i remember  billie gathered her hair into a molten bundle and let it run through her fingers  oh jane she exclaimed surely you dont like weak men i like a man who is strong and brave and wonderful  i cant stand brave men said jane it makes them so independent i could only love a man who would depend on me in everything sometimes when i have been roughing it out in the jungle she went on rather wistfully i have had my dreams of some gentle clinging man who would put his hand in mine and tell me all his poor little troubles and let me pet and comfort him and bring the smiles back to his face im beginning to want to settle down after all there are other things for a woman to do in this life besides travelling and biggame hunting i should like to go into parliament and if i did that i should practically have to marry i mean i should have to have a man to look after the social end of life and arrange parties and receptions and so on and sit ornamentally at the head of my table i cant imagine anything jollier than marriage under conditions like that when i came back a bit done up after a long sitting at the house he would mix me a whiskyandsoda and read poetry to me or prattle about all the things he had been doing during the day why it would be ideal  jane hubbard gave a little sigh her fine eyes gazed dreamily at a smoke ring which she had sent floating towards the ceiling  jane said billie i believe youre thinking of somebody definite who is he  the biggame huntress blushed the embarrassment which she exhibited made her look manlier than ever  i dont know his name  but there is really someone  yes  how splendid tell me about him  jane hubbard clasped her strong hands and looked down at the floor  i met him on the subway a couple of days before i left new york you know how crowded the subway is at the rush hour i had a seat of course but this poor little fellowso goodlooking my dear he reminded me of the pictures of lord byronwas hanging from a strap and being jerked about till i thought his poor little arms would be wrenched out of their sockets and he looked so unhappy as though he had some secret sorrow i offered him my seat but he wouldnt take it a couple of stations later however the man next to me got out and he sat down and we got into conversation there wasnt time to talk much i told him i had been downtown fetching an elephantgun which i had left to be mended he was so prettily interested when i showed him the mechanism we got along famously butoh well it was just another case of ships that pass in the nightim afraid ive been boring you  oh jane you havent you see  you see im in love myself  i had an idea you were said her friend looking at her critically youve been refusing your oats the last few days and thats a sure sign is he that fellow thats always around with you and who looks like a parrot  bream mortimer good gracious no cried billie indignantly as if i should fall in love with bream  when i was out in british east africa said miss hubbard i had a bird that was the living image of bream mortimer i taught him to whistle annie laurie and to ask for his supper in three native dialects eventually he died of the pip poor fellow well if it isnt bream mortimer who is it  his name is marlowe hes tall and handsome and very stronglooking he reminds me of a greek god  ugh said miss hubbard  jane were engaged  no said the huntress interested when can i meet him  ill introduce you tomorrow im so happy  thats fine  and yet somehow said billie plaiting her hair do you ever have presentiments i cant get rid of an awful feeling that somethings going to happen to spoil everything  what could spoil everything  well i think him so wonderful you know suppose he were to do anything to blur the image i have formed of him  oh he wont you said he was one of those strong men didnt you they always run true to form they never do anything except be strong  billie looked meditatively at her reflection in the glass  you know i thought i was in love once before jane  yes  we were going to be married and i had actually gone to the church and i waited and waited and he didnt come and what do you think had happened  what  his mother had stolen his trousers  jane hubbard laughed heartily  its nothing to laugh at said billie seriously it was a tragedy i had always thought him romantic and when this happened the scales seemed to fall from my eyes i saw that i had made a mistake  and you broke off the engagement  of course  i think you were hard on him a man cant help his mother stealing his trousers  no but when he finds theyre gone he can phone to the tailor for some more or borrow the janitors or do something but he simply stayed where he was and didnt do a thing just because he was too much afraid of his mother to tell her straight out that he meant to be married that day  now that said miss hubbard is just the sort of trait in a man which would appeal to me i like a nervous shrinking man  i dont besides it made him seem so ridiculous andi dont know why it isi cant forgive a man for looking ridiculous thank goodness my darling sam couldnt look ridiculous even if he tried hes wonderful jane he reminds me of a knight of the round table you ought to see his eyes flash  miss hubbard got up and stretched herself with a yawn  well ill be on the promenade deck after breakfast tomorrow if you can arrange to have him flash his eyes thensay between ninethirty and teni shall be delighted to watch them     chapter v  persecution of eustace   good god cried eustace hignett  he stared at the figure which loomed above him in the fading light which came through the porthole of the stateroom the hour was seventhirty and he had just woken from a troubled doze full of strange nightmares and for the moment he thought that he must still be dreaming for the figure before him could have walked straight into any nightmare and no questions asked then suddenly he became aware that it was his cousin samuel marlowe as in the historic case of father in the pigstye he could tell him by his hat but why was he looking like that was it simply some trick of the uncertain light or was his face really black and had his mouth suddenly grown to six times its normal size and become a vivid crimson  sam turned he had been looking at himself in the mirror with a satisfaction which to the casual observer his appearance would not have seemed to justify hignett had not been suffering from a delusion his cousins face was black and even as he turned he gave it a dab with a piece of burnt cork and made it blacker  hullo you awake he said and switched on the light  eustace hignett shied like a startled horse his friends profile seen dimly had been disconcerting enough full face he was a revolting object nothing that eustace hignett had encountered in his recent dreamsand they had included such unusual fauna as elephants in top hats and running shortshad affected him so profoundly sams appearance smote him like a blow it seemed to take him straight into a different and a dreadful world  what  what  what he gurgled  sam squinted at himself in the glass and added a touch of black to his nose  how do i look  eustace hignett began to fear that his cousins reason must have become unseated he could not conceive of any really sane man looking like that being anxious to be told how he looked  are my lips red enough its for the ships concert you know it starts in halfanhour though i believe im not on till the second part speaking as a friend would you put a touch more black round the ears or are they all right  curiosity replaced apprehension in hignetts mind  what on earth are you doing performing at the ships concert  oh they roped me in it got about somehow that i was a valuable man and they wouldnt take no sam deepened the colour of his ears as a matter of fact he said casually my fiancée made rather a point of my doing something  a sharp yelp from the lower berth proclaimed the fact that the significance of the remark had not been lost on eustace  your fiancée  the girl im engaged to didnt i tell you about that yes im engaged  eustace sighed heavily  i feared the worst tell me who is she  didnt i tell you her name  no  curious i must have forgotten he hummed an airy strain as he blackened the tip of his nose its rather a curious coincidence really her name is bennett  she may be a relation  thats true of course girls do have relations  what is her first name  that is another rather remarkable thing its wilhelmina  wilhelmina  of course there must be hundreds of girls in the world called wilhelmina bennett but still it is a coincidence  what colour is her hair demanded eustace hignett in a hollow voice her hair what colour is it  her hair now let me see you ask me what colour is her hair well you might call it auburn  or russet  or you might call it titian  never mind what i might call it is it red  red why yes that is a very good description of it now that you put it to me like that it is red  has she a trick of grabbing at you suddenly when she gets excited like a kitten with a ball of wool  yes yes she has  eustace hignett uttered a sharp cry  sam he said can you bear a shock  ill have a dash at it  brace up  im ready  the girl you are engaged to is the same girl who promised to marry me  well well said sam  there was a silence  awfully sorry of course and all that said sam  dont apologise to me said eustace my poor old chap my only feeling towards you is one of the purest and profoundest pity he reached out and pressed sams hand i regard you as a toad beneath the harrow  well i suppose thats one way of offering congratulations and cheery good wishes  and on top of that went on eustace deeply moved you have got to sing at the ships concert  why shouldnt i sing at the ships concert  my dear old man you have many worthy qualities but you must know that you cant sing you cant sing for nuts i dont want to discourage you but long ago as it is you cant have forgotten what an ass you made of yourself at that housesupper at school seeing you up against it like this i regret that i threw a lump of butter at you on that occasion though at the time it seemed the only course to pursue  sam started  was it you who threw that bit of butter  it was  i wish id known you silly chump you ruined my collar  ah well its seven years ago you would have had to send it to the wash anyhow by this time but dont let us brood on the past let us put our heads together and think how we can get you out of this terrible situation  i dont want to get out of it i confidently expect to be the hit of the evening  the hit of the evening you singing  im not going to sing im going to do that imitation of frank tinney which i did at the trinity smoker you havent forgotten that you were at the piano taking the part of the conductor of the orchestra what a riot i waswe were i say eustace old man i suppose you dont feel well enough to come up now and take your old part you could do it without a rehearsal you remember how it went hullo ernest hullo frank why not come along  the only piano i will ever sit at will be one firmly fixed on a floor that does not heave and wobble under me  nonsense the boats as steady as a rock now the seas like a millpond  nevertheless thanking you for your suggestion no  oh well then i shall have to get on as best i can with that fellow mortimer weve been rehearsing all the afternoon and he seems to have the hang of the thing but he wont be really right he has no pep no vim still if you wont  well i think ill be getting along to his stateroom i told him i would look in for a last rehearsal  the door closed behind sam and eustace hignett lying on his back gave himself up to melancholy meditation he was deeply disturbed by his cousins sad story he knew what it meant being engaged to wilhelmina bennett it was like being taken aloft in a balloon and dropped with a thud on the rocks  his reflections were broken by the abrupt opening of the door sam rushed in eustace peered anxiously out of his berth there was too much burnt cork on his cousins face to allow of any real registering of emotion but he could tell from his manner that all was not well  whats the matter  sam sank down on the lounge  the bounder has quit  the bounder what bounder  there is only one bream mortimer curse him there may be others whom thoughtless critics rank as bounders but he is the only man really deserving of the title he refuses to appear he has walked out on the act he has left me flat i went into his stateroom just now as arranged and the man was lying on his bunk groaning  i thought you said the sea was like a millpond  it wasnt that hes perfectly fit but it seems that the silly ass took it into his head to propose to billie just before dinnerapparently hes loved her for years in a silent selfeffacing wayand of course she told him that she was engaged to me and the thing upset him to such an extent that he says the idea of sitting down at a piano and helping me give an imitation of frank tinney revolts him he says he intends to spend the evening in bed reading schopenhauer i hope it chokes him  but this is splendid this lets you out  what do you mean lets me out  why now you wont be able to appear oh you will be thankful for this in years to come  wont i appear wont i dashed well appear do you think im going to disappoint that dear girl when she is relying on me i would rather die  but you cant appear without a pianist  ive got a pianist  you have  yes a little undersized shrimp of a fellow with a green face and ears like waterwings  i dont think i know him  yes you do hes you  me  yes you you are going to sit at the piano tonight  im sorry to disappoint you but its impossible i gave you my views on the subject just now  youve altered them  i havent  well you soon will and ill tell you why if you dont get up out of that damned berth youve been roosting in all your life im going to ring for j b midgeley and im going to tell him to bring me a bit of dinner in here and im going to eat it before your eyes  but youve had dinner  well ill have another i feel just ready for a nice fat pork chop  stop stop  a nice fat pork chop with potatoes and lots of cabbage repeated sam firmly and i shall eat it here on this very lounge now how do we go  you wouldnt do that said eustace piteously  i would and will  but i shouldnt be any good at the piano ive forgotten how the thing used to go  you havent done anything of the kind i come in and say hullo ernest and you say hullo frank and then you help me tell the story about the pullman car a child could do your part of it  perhaps there is some child on board  no i want you i shall feel safe with you weve done it together before  but honestly i really dont think  it isnt as if  sam rose and extended a finger towards the bell  stop stop cried eustace hignett ill do it  sam withdrew his finger  good he said weve just got time for a rehearsal while youre dressing hullo ernest  hullo frank said eustace hignett brokenly as he searched for his unfamiliar trousers     chapter vi  scene at a ships concert   ships concerts are given in aid of the seamens orphans and widows and after one has been present at a few of them one seems to feel that any rightthinking orphan or widow would rather jog along and take a chance of starvation than be the innocent cause of such things they open with a long speech from the master of the ceremoniesso long as a rule that it is only the thought of what is going to happen afterwards that enables the audience to bear it with fortitude this done the amateur talent is unleashed and the grim work begins  it was not till after the all too brief intermission for rest and recuperation that the newlyformed team of marlowe and hignett was scheduled to appear previous to this there had been dark deeds done in the quiet saloon the lecturer on deepsea fish had fulfilled his threat and spoken at great length on a subject which treated by a master of oratory would have palled on the audience after ten or fifteen minutes and at the end of fifteen minutes this speaker had only just got past the haddocks and was feeling his way tentatively through the shrimps the rosary had been sung and there was an uneasy doubt as to whether it was not going to be sung again after the intervalthe latest rumour being that the second of the rival lady singers had proved adamant to all appeals and intended to fight the thing out on the lines she had originally chosen if they put her in irons  a young man had recited gunga din and wilfully misinterpreting the gratitude of the audience that it was over for a desire for more had followed it with fuzzywuzzy his sisterthese things run in familieshad sung my little gray home in the westrather sombrely for she had wanted to sing the rosary and with the same obtuseness which characterised her brother had come back and rendered plantation songs the audience was now examining its programmes in the interval of silence in order to ascertain the duration of the sentence still remaining unexpired  it was shocked to read the following        7 a little imitations marlowe   all over the saloon you could see fair women and brave men wilting in their seats imitation the word as keats would have said was like a knell many of these people were old travellers and their minds went back wincingly as one recalls forgotten wounds to occasions when performers at ships concerts had imitated whole strings of dickens characters or with the assistance of a few hats and a little false hair had endeavoured to portray napoleon bismarck shakespeare and other of the famous dead in this printed line on the programme there was nothing to indicate the nature or scope of the imitation which this s marlowe proposed to inflict upon them they could only sit and wait and hope that it would be short  there was a sinking of hearts as eustace hignett moved down the room and took his place at the piano a pianist this argued more singing the more pessimistic began to fear that the imitation was going to be one of those imitations of wellknown opera artistes which though rare do occasionally add to the horrors of ships concerts they stared at hignett apprehensively there seemed to be something ominous in the mans very aspect his face was very pale and set the face of one approaching a task at which his humanity shudders they could not know that the pallor of eustace hignett was due entirely to the slight tremor which even on the calmest nights the engines of an ocean liner produce in the flooring of a dining saloon and to that faint yet welldefined smell of cooked meats which clings to a room where a great many people have recently been eating a great many meals a few beads of cold perspiration were clinging to eustace hignetts brow he looked straight before him with unseeing eyes he was thinking hard of the sahara  so tense was eustaces concentration that he did not see billie bennett seated in the front row billie had watched him enter with a little thrill of embarrassment she wished that she had been content with one of the seats at the back but jane hubbard had insisted on the front row she always had a frontrow seat at witch dances in africa and the thing had become a habit  in order to avoid recognition for as long as possible billie now put up her fan and turned to jane she was surprised to see that her friend was staring eagerly before her with a fixity almost equal to that of eustace under her breath she muttered an exclamation of surprise in one of the lesserknown dialects of northern nigeria  billie she whispered sharply  what is the matter jane  who is that man at the piano do you know him  as a matter of fact i do said billie his name is hignett why  its the man i met on the subway she breathed a sigh poor little fellow how miserable he looks  at this moment their conversation was interrupted eustace hignett pulling himself together with a painful effort raised his hands and struck a crashing chord and as he did so there appeared through the door at the far end of the saloon a figure at the sight of which the entire audience started convulsively with the feeling that a worse thing had befallen them than even they had looked for  the figure was richly clad in some scarlet material its face was a grisly black and below the nose appeared what seemed a horrible gash it advanced towards them smoking a cigar  hullo ernest it said  and then it seemed to pause expectantly as though desiring some reply dead silence reigned in the saloon  hullo ernest  those nearest the pianoand nobody more quickly than jane hubbardnow observed that the white face of the man on the stool had grown whiter still his eyes gazed out glassily from under his damp brow he looked like a man who was seeing some ghastly sight the audience sympathised with him they felt like that too  in all human plans there is ever some slight hitch some little miscalculation which just makes all the difference a moments thought should have told eustace hignett that a halfsmoked cigar was one of the essential properties to any imitation of the eminent mr tinney but he had completely overlooked the fact the cigar came as an absolute surprise to him and it could not have affected him more powerfully if it had been a voice from the tomb he stared at it pallidly like macbeth at the ghost of banquo it was a strong lively young cigar and its curling smoke played lightly about his nostrils his jaw fell his eyes protruded he looked for a long moment like one of those deepsea fishes concerning which the recent lecturer had spoken so searchingly then with the cry of a stricken animal he bounded from his seat and fled for the deck  there was a rustle at billies side as jane hubbard rose and followed him jane was deeply stirred even as he sat looking so pale and piteous at the piano her big heart had gone out to him and now in his moment of anguish he seemed to bring to the surface everything that was best and manliest in her nature thrusting aside with one sweep of her powerful arm a steward who happened to be between her and the door she raced in pursuit  sam marlowe had watched his cousins dash for the open with a consternation so complete that his senses seemed to have left him a general deserted by his men on some stricken field might have felt something akin to his emotion of all the learned professions the imitation of mr frank tinney is the one which can least easily be carried through singlehanded the man at the piano the leader of the orchestra is essential he is the lifeblood of the entertainment without him nothing can be done  for an instant sam stood there gaping blankly then the open door of the saloon seemed to beckon an invitation he made for it reached it passed through it that concluded his efforts in aid of the seamens orphans and widows  the spell which had lain on the audience broke this imitation seemed to them to possess in an extraordinary measure the one quality which renders amateur imitations tolerable that of brevity they had seen many amateur imitations but never one as short as this the saloon echoed with their applause  it brought no balm to samuel marlowe he did not hear it he had fled for refuge to his stateroom and was lying in the lower berth chewing the pillow a soul in torment     chapter vii  sundered hearts   there was a tap at the door sam sat up dizzily he had lost all count of time  whos that  i have a note for you sir  it was the level voice of j b midgeley the steward the stewards of the white star line besides being the civillest and most obliging body of men in the world all have soft and pleasant voices a white star steward waking you up at sixthirty to tell you that your bath is ready when you wanted to sleep on till twelve is the nearest human approach to the nightingale  a what  a note sir  sam jumped up and switched on the light he went to the door and took the note from j b midgeley who his mission accomplished retired in an orderly manner down the passage sam looked at the letter with a thrill he had never seen the handwriting before but with the eye of love he recognised it it was just the sort of hand he would have expected billie to write round and smooth and flowing the writing of a warmhearted girl he tore open the envelope  please come up to the top deck i want to speak to you  sam could not disguise it from himself that he was a little disappointed i dont know if you see anything wrong with the letter but the way sam looked at it was that for a first loveletter it might have been longer and perhaps a shade warmer and without running any risk of writers cramp she might have signed it  however these were small matters no doubt the dear girl had been in a hurry and so forth the important point was that he was going to see her when a mans afraid sings the bard a beautiful maid is a cheering sight to see and the same truth holds good when a man has made an exhibition of himself at a ships concert a womans gentle sympathy that was what samuel marlowe wanted more than anything else at the moment that he felt was what the doctor ordered he scrubbed the burnt cork off his face with all possible speed and changed his clothes and made his way to the upper deck it was like billie he felt to have chosen this spot for their meeting it would be deserted and it was hallowed for them both by sacred associations  she was standing at the rail looking out over the water the moon was quite full out on the horizon to the south its light shone on the sea making it look like the silver beach of some distant fairy island the girl appeared to be wrapped in thought and it was not till the sharp crack of sams head against an overhanging stanchion announced his approach that she turned  oh is that you  yes  youve been a long time  it wasnt an easy job explained sam getting all that burnt cork off youve no notion how the stuff sticks you have to use butter  she shuddered  dont  but i did you have to with burnt cork  dont tell me these horrible things her voice rose almost hysterically i never want to hear the words burnt cork mentioned again as long as i live  i feel exactly the same sam moved to her side darling he said in a low voice it was like you to ask me to meet you here i know what you were thinking you thought that i should need sympathy you wanted to pet me to smooth my wounded feelings to hold me in your arms and tell me that as we loved each other what did anything else matter  i didnt  you didnt  no i didnt  oh you didnt i thought you did he looked at her wistfully i thought he said that possibly you might have wished to comfort me i have been through a great strain i have had a shock  and what about me she demanded passionately havent i had a shock  he melted at once  have you had a shock too poor little thing sit down and tell me all about it  she looked away from him her face working  cant you understand what a shock i have had i thought you were the perfect knight  yes isnt it  isnt what  i thought you said it was a perfect night  i said i thought you were the perfect knight  oh ah  a sailor crossed the deck a dim figure in the shadows went over to a sort of raised summerhouse with a brass thingummy in it fooled about for a moment and went away again sailors earn their money easily  yes said sam when he had gone  i forget what i was saying  something about my being the perfect knight  yes i thought you were  thats good  but youre not  no  no  oh  silence fell sam was feeling hurt and bewildered he could not understand her mood he had come up expecting to be soothed and comforted and she was like a petulant iceberg cynically he recalled some lines of poetry which he had had to write out a hundred times on one occasion at school as a punishment for having introduced a white mouse into chapel        oh woman in our hours of ease      unsomething something something please      when tiddlyumpty umpty brow      a something something something thou   he had forgotten the exact words but the gist of it had been that woman however she might treat a man in times of prosperity could be relied on to rally round and do the right thing when he was in trouble how little the poet had known woman  why not he said huffily  she gave a little sob  i put you on a pedestal and i find you have feet of clay you have blurred the image which i formed of you i can never think of you again without picturing you as you stood in that saloon stammering and helpless  well what can you do when your pianist runs out on you  you could have done something the words she had spoken only yesterday to jane hubbard came back to her i cant forgive a man for looking ridiculous oh what what she cried induced you to try to give an imitation of bert williams  sam started stung to the quick  it wasnt bert williams it was frank tinney  well how was i to know  i did my best said sam sullenly  that is the awful thought  i did it for your sake  i know it gives me a horrible sense of guilt she shuddered again then suddenly with the nervous quickness of a woman unstrung thrust a small black golliwog into his hand take it  whats this  you bought it for me yesterday at the barbers shop it is the only present which you have given me take it back  i dont want it i shouldnt know what to do with it  you must take it she said in a low voice it is a symbol  a what  a symbol of our broken love  i dont see how you make that out its a golliwog  i can never marry you now  what good heavens dont be absurd  i cant  oh go on have a dash at it he said encouragingly though his heart was sinking  she shook her head  no i couldnt  oh hang it all  i couldnt im a very strange girl  youre a very silly girl  i dont see what right you have to say that she flared  i dont see what right you have to say you cant marry me and try to load me up with golliwogs he retorted with equal heat  oh cant you understand  no im dashed if i can  she looked at him despondently  when i said i would marry you you were a hero to me you stood to me for everything that was noble and brave and wonderful i had only to shut my eyes to conjure up the picture of you as you dived off the rail that morning now her voice trembled if i shut my eyes now i can only see a man with a hideous black face making himself the laughing stock of the ship how could i marry you haunted by that picture  but good heavens you talk as though i made a habit of blacking up you talk as though you expected me to come to the altar smothered in burnt cork  i shall always think of you as i saw you tonight she looked at him sadly theres a bit of black still on your left ear  he tried to take her hand but she drew it away he fell back as if struck  so this is the end he muttered  yes its partly on your ear and partly on your cheek  so this is the end he repeated  you had better go below and ask your steward to give you some more butter  he laughed bitterly  well i might have expected it i might have known what would happen eustace warned me eustace was right he knows womenas i do now women what mighty ills have not been done by woman who wast betrayed the whatsitsname a woman who lost  lost  who lost  whoerand so on a woman so all is over there is nothing to be said but goodbye  no  goodbye then miss bennett  goodbye said billie sadly iim sorry  dont mention it  you do understand dont you  you have made everything perfectly clear  i hopei hope you wont be unhappy  unhappy sam produced a strangled noise from his larynx like the cry of a shrimp in pain unhappy ha ha im not unhappy whatever gave you that idea im smiling im laughing i feel ive had a merciful escape oh ha ha  its very unkind and rude of you to say that  it reminds me of a moving picture i saw in new york it was called saved from the scaffold  oh  im not unhappy what have i got to be unhappy about what on earth does any man want to get married for i dont give me my gay bachelor life my uncle charlie used to say its better luck to get married than it is to be kicked in the head by a mule but he was a man who always looked on the bright side goodnight miss bennett and goodbyefor ever  he turned on his heel and strode across the deck from a white heaven the moon still shone benignantly down mocking him he had spoken bravely the most captious critic could not but have admitted that he had made a good exit but already his heart was aching  as he drew near to his stateroom he was amazed and disgusted to hear a high tenor voice raised in song proceeding from behind the closed door        i feeer naw faw in sheeining arrmor        though his lance be sharrrp ander keen      but i feeer i feeer the glahmour        therough thy derrooping lashes seen      i feeer i feeer the glahmour   sam flung open the door wrathfully that eustace hignett should still be alive was badhe had pictured him hurling himself overboard and bobbing about a pleasing sight in the wake of the vessel that he should be singing was an outrage remorse sam felt should have stricken eustace hignett dumb instead of which here he was comporting himself like a blasted linnet it was all wrong the man could have no conscience whatever  well he said sternly so there you are  eustace hignett looked up brightly even beamingly in the brief interval which had elapsed since sam had seen him last an extraordinary transformation had taken place in this young man his wan look had disappeared his eyes were bright his face wore that beastly selfsatisfied smirk which you see in pictures advertising certain makes of finemesh underwear if eustace hignett had been a fullpage drawing in a magazine with my dear fellow i always wear sigsbees superfine featherweight printed underneath him he could not have looked more pleased with himself  hullo he said i was wondering where you had got to  never mind said sam coldly where i had got to where did you get to and why you poor miserable worm he went on in a burst of generous indignation what have you to say for yourself what do you mean by dashing away like that and killing my little entertainment  awfully sorry old man i hadnt foreseen the cigar i was bearing up tolerably well till i began to sniff the smoke then everything seemed to go blacki dont mean you of course you were black alreadyand i got the feeling that i simply must get on deck and drown myself  well why didnt you demanded sam with a strong sense of injury i might have forgiven you then but to come down here and find you singing  a soft light came into eustace hignetts eyes  i want to tell you all about that he said  its the most astonishing story a miracle you might almost call it makes you believe in fate and all that kind of thing a week ago i was on the subway in new york  he broke off while sam cursed him the subway and the city of new york in the order named  my dear chap what is the matter  what is the matter ha  something is the matter persisted eustace hignett i can tell it by your manner something has happened to disturb and upset you i know you so well that i can pierce the mask what is it tell me  ha ha  you surely cant still be brooding on that concert business why thats all over i take it that after my departure you made the most colossal ass of yourself but why let that worry you these things cannot affect one permanently  cant they let me tell you that as a result of that concert my engagement is broken off  eustace sprang forward with outstretched hand  not really how splendid accept my congratulations this is the finest thing that could possibly have happened these are not idle words as one who has been engaged to the girl himself i speak feelingly you are well out of it sam  sam thrust aside his hand had it been his neck he might have clutched it eagerly but he drew the line at shaking hands with eustace hignett  my heart is broken he said with dignity  that feeling will pass giving way to one of devout thankfulness i know ive been there after all  wilhelmina bennett  what is she a rag and a bone and a hank of hair  she is nothing of the kind said sam revolted  pardon me said eustace firmly i speak as an expert i know her and i repeat she is a rag and a bone and a hank of hair  she is the only girl in the world and owing to your idiotic behaviour i have lost her  you speak of the only girl in the world said eustace blithely if you want to hear about the only girl in the world i will tell you a week ago i was on the subway in new york  im going to bed said sam brusquely  all right ill tell you while youre undressing  i dont want to listen  a week ago said eustace hignett i will ask you to picture me seated after some difficulty in a carriage in the new york subway i got into conversation with a girl with an elephant gun  sam revised his private commination service in order to include the elephant gun  she was my soulmate proceeded eustace with quiet determination i didnt know it at the time but she was she had grave brown eyes a wonderful personality and this elephant gun  did she shoot you with it  shoot me what do you mean why no  the girl must have been a fool said sam bitterly the chance of a lifetime and she missed it where are my pyjamas  i havent seen your pyjamas she talked to me about this elephant gun and explained its mechanism she told me the correct part of a hippopotamus to aim at how to make a nourishing soup out of mangoes and what to do when bitten by a borneo wiresnake you can imagine how she soothed my aching heart my heart if you recollect was aching at the momentquite unnecessarily if i had only knownbecause it was only a couple of days since my engagement to wilhelmina bennett had been broken off well we parted at sixtysixth street and strange as it may seem i forgot all about her  do it again  tell it again  good heavens no forget all about her again  nothing said eustace hignett gravely could make me do that our souls have blended our beings have called to one another from their deepest depths saying there are your pyjamas over in the corner  saying you are mine how could i forget her after that well as i was saying we parted little did i know that she was sailing on this very boat but just now she came to me as i writhed on the deck  did you writhe asked sam with a flicker of moody interest  i certainly did  thats good  but not for long  thats bad  she came to me and healed me sam that girl is an angel  switch off the light when youve finished  she seemed to understand without a word how i was feeling there are some situations which do not need words she went away and returned with a mixture of some description in a glass i dont know what it was it had worcester sauce in it she put it to my lips she made me drink it she said it was what she always used in africa for bullcalves with the staggers well believe me or believe me not  are you asleep  yes  believe me or believe me not in under two minutes i was not merely freed from the nausea caused by your cigar i was smoking myself i was walking the deck with her without the slightest qualm i was even able to look over the side from time to time and comment on the beauty of the moon on the water i have said some mordant things about women since i came on board this boat i withdraw them unreservedly they still apply to girls like wilhelmina bennett but i have ceased to include the whole sex in my remarks jane hubbard has restored my faith in woman sam sam  what  i said that jane hubbard had restored my faith in woman  oh all right  eustace hignett finished undressing and got into bed with a soft smile on his face he switched off the light there was a long silence broken only by the distant purring of the engines  at about twelvethirty a voice came from the lower berth  sam  what is it now  there is a sweet womanly strength about her sam she was telling me she once killed a panther with a hatpin  sam groaned and tossed on his mattress  silence fell again  at least i think it was a panther said eustace hignett at a quarter past one either a panther or a puma     chapter viii  sir mallaby offers a suggestion   § 1  a week after the liner atlantic had docked at southampton sam marlowe might have been observedand was observed by various of the residentssitting on a bench on the esplanade of that rising wateringplace bingleyonthesea in sussex all wateringplaces on the south coast of england are blots on the landscape but though i am aware that by saying it i shall offend the civic pride of some of the othersnone are so peculiarly foul as bingleyonthesea the asphalte on the bingley esplanade is several degrees more depressing than the asphalte on other esplanades the swiss waiters at the hotel magnificent where sam was stopping are in a class of bungling incompetence by themselves the envy and despair of all the other swiss waiters at all the other hotels magnificent along the coast for dreariness of aspect bingleyonthesea stands alone the very waves that break on its shingle seem to creep up the beach reluctantly as if it revolted them to have to come to such a place  why then was sam marlowe visiting this ozoneswept gehenna why with all the rest of england at his disposal had he chosen to spend a week at breezy blighted bingley  simply because he had been disappointed in love  nothing is more curious than the myriad ways in which reaction from an unfortunate loveaffair manifests itself in various men no two males behave in the same way under the spur of female fickleness archilochum for instance according to the roman writer proprio rabies armavit iambo it is no good pretending out of politeness that you know what that means so i will translate rabieshis groucharmavitarmedarchilochumarchilochusiambowith the iambicpropriohis own invention in other words when the poet archilochus was handed his hat by the lady of his affections he consoled himself by going off and writing satirical verse about her in a new metre which he had thought up immediately after leaving the house that was the way the thing affected him  on the other hand we read in a recent issue of a london daily paper that john simmons 31 a meatsalesman was accused of assaulting an officer while in the discharge of his duty at the same time using profane language whereby the officer went in fear of his life constable riggs deposed that on the evening of the eleventh instant while he was on his beat prisoner accosted him and after offering to fight him for fourpence drew off his right boot and threw it at his head accused questioned by the magistrate admitted the charge and expressed regret pleading that he had had words with his young woman and it had upset him  neither of these courses appealed to samuel marlowe he had sought relief by slinking off alone to the hotel magnificent at bingleyonthesea it was the same spirit which has often moved other men in similar circumstances to go off to the rockies to shoot grizzlies  to a certain extent the hotel magnificent had dulled the pain at any rate the service and cooking there had done much to take his mind off it his heart still ached but he felt equal to going to london and seeing his father which of course he ought to have done seven days before  he rose from his benchhe had sat down on it directly after breakfastand went back to the hotel to inquire about trains an hour later he had begun his journey and two hours after that he was at the door of his fathers office  the offices of the oldestablished firm of marlowe thorpe prescott winslow and appleby are in ridgeways inn not far from fleet street the brass plate let into the woodwork of the door is misleading reading it you get the impression that on the other side quite a covey of lawyers await your arrival the name of the firm leads you to suppose that there will be barely standingroom in the office you picture thorpe jostling you aside as he makes for prescott to discuss with him the latest case of demurrer and winslow and appleby treading on your toes deep in conversation on replevin but these legal firms dwindle the years go by and take their toll snatching away here a prescott there an appleby till before you know where you are you are down to your last lawyer the only surviving member of the firm of marlowe thorpewhat i said beforewas at the time with which this story deals sir mallaby marlowe son of the original founder of the firm and father of the celebrated blackface comedian samuel of that ilk and the outer office where callers were received and parked till sir mallaby could find time for them was occupied by a single clerk  when sam opened the door this clerk john peters by name was seated on a high stool holding in one hand a halfeaten sausage in the other an extraordinarily large and powerfullooking revolver at the sight of sam he laid down both engines of destruction and beamed he was not a particularly successful beamer being hampered by a cast in one eye which gave him a truculent and sinister look but those who knew him knew that he had a heart of gold and were not intimidated by his repellent face between sam and himself there had always existed terms of great cordiality starting from the time when the former was a small boy and it had been john peters mission to take him now to the zoo now to the train back to school  why mr samuel  hullo peters  we were expecting you back a week ago  oh i had something to see to before i came to town said sam carelessly  so you got back safe said john peters  safe why of course  peters shook his head  i confess that when there was this delay in your coming here i sometimes feared something might have happened to you i recall mentioning it to the young lady who recently did me the honour to promise to become my wife  ocean liners arent often wrecked nowadays  i was thinking more of the brawls on shore americas a dangerous country but perhaps you were not in touch with the underworld  i dont think i was  ah said john peters significantly  he took up the revolver gave it a fond and almost paternal look and replaced it on the desk  what on earth are you doing with that thing asked sam  mr peters lowered his voice  im going to america myself in a few days time mr samuel its my annual holiday and the guvnors sending me over with papers in connection with the people v schultz and bowen its a big case over there a client of ours is mixed up in it an american gentleman i am to take these important papers to his legal representative in new york so i thought it best to be prepared  the first smile that he had permitted himself for nearly two weeks flitted across sams face  what on earth sort of place do you think new york is he asked its safer than london  ah but what about the underworld ive seen these american films that they send over here mr samuel did you ever see wolves of the bowery there was a man in that in just my position carrying important papers and what they didnt try to do to him no im taking no chances mr samuel  i should have said you were lugging that thing about with you  mr peters seemed wounded  oh i understand the mechanism perfectly and i am becoming a very fair shot i take my little bite of food in here early and go and practise at the rupert street rifle range during my lunch hour youd be surprised how quickly one picks it up when i get home of a night i try how quickly i can draw you have to draw like a flash of lightning mr samuel if youd ever seen a film called twogunthomas youd realise that you havent time to wait loitering about  mr peters picked up a speakingtube and blew down it  mr samuel to see you sir mallaby yes sir very good will you go right in mr samuel  sam proceeded to the inner office and found his father dictating into the attentive ear of miss milliken his elderly and respectable stenographer replies to his morning mail  sir mallaby marlowe was a dapper little man with a round cheerful face and a bright eye his morning coat had been cut by londons best tailor and his trousers perfectly creased by a sedulous valet a pink carnation in his buttonhole matched his healthy complexion his golf handicap was twelve his sister mrs horace hignett considered him worldly  dear sirswe are in receipt of your favour and in reply beg to state that nothing will induce us  will induce us  where did i put that letter ah nothing will induce us  oh tell em to go to blazes miss milliken  very well sir mallaby  thats that ready messrs brigney goole and butterworth what infernal names these people have sirson behalf of our client  oh hullo sam  good morning father  take a seat im busy but ill be finished in a moment where was i miss milliken  on behalf of our client  oh yes on behalf of our client mr wibblesley eggshaw where these people get their names im hanged if i know your poor mother wanted to call you hyacinth sam you may not know it but in the nineties when you were born children were frequently christened hyacinth well i saved you from that  his attention now diverted to his son sir mallaby seemed to remember that the latter had just returned from a long journey and that he had not seen him for many weeks he inspected him with interest  very glad youre back sam so you didnt win  no i got beaten in the semifinals  american amateurs are a very hot lot the best ones i suppose you were weak on the greens i warned you about that youll have to rub up your putting before next year  at the idea that any such mundane pursuit as practising putting could appeal to his broken spirit now sam uttered a bitter laugh it was as if dante had recommended some lost soul in the inferno to occupy his mind by knitting jumpers  well you seem to be in great spirits said sir mallaby approvingly its pleasant to hear your merry laugh again isnt it miss milliken  extremely exhilarating agreed the stenographer adjusting her spectacles and smiling at sam for whom there was a soft spot in her heart  a sense of the futility of life oppressed sam as he gazed in the glass that morning he had thought not without a certain gloomy satisfaction how remarkably pale and drawn his face looked and these people seemed to imagine that he was in the highest spirits his laughter which had sounded to him like the wailing of a demon struck miss milliken as exhilarating  on behalf of our client mr wibblesley eggshaw said sir mallaby swooping back to duty once more we beg to state that we are prepared to accept service  what time did you dock this morning  i landed nearly a week ago  a week ago then what the deuce have you been doing with yourself why havent i seen you  ive been down at bingleyonthesea  bingley what on earth were you doing at that godforsaken place  wrestling with myself said sam with simple dignity  sir mallabys agile mind had leaped back to the letter which he was answering  we should be glad to meet you wrestling eh well i like a boy to be fond of manly sports still life isnt all athletics dont forget that life is real life is  how does it go miss milliken  miss milliken folded her hands and shut her eyes her invariable habit when called upon to recite  life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal dust thou art to dust returnest was not spoken of the soul art is long and time is fleeting and our hearts though stout and brave still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the grave lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footsteps on the sands of time let us then  said miss milliken respectfully  be up and doing  all right all right all right said sir mallaby i dont want it all life is real life is earnest sam i want to speak to you about that when ive finished answering these letters where was i we should be glad to meet you at any time if you will make an appointment bingleyonthesea good heavens why bingleyonthesea why not margate while you were about it  margate is too bracing i did not wish to be braced bingley suited my mood it was grey and dark and it rained all the time and the sea slunk about in the distance like some baffled beast  he stopped becoming aware that his father was not listening sir mallabys attention had returned to the letter  oh whats the good of answering the dashed thing at all said sir mallaby brigney goole and butterworth know perfectly well that theyve got us in a cleft stick butterworth knows it better than goole and brigney knows it better than butterworth this young fool eggshaw sam admits that he wrote the girl twentythree letters twelve of them in verse and twentyone specifically asking her to marry him and he comes to me and expects me to get him out of it the girl is suing him for ten thousand  how like a woman  miss milliken bridled reproachfully at this slur on her sex sir mallaby took no notice of it whatever   if you will make an appointment when we can discuss the matter without prejudice get those typed miss milliken have a cigar sam miss milliken tell peters as you go out that i am occupied with a conference and can see nobody for half an hour  when miss milliken had withdrawn sir mallaby occupied ten seconds of the period which he had set aside for communion with his son in staring silently at him  im glad youre back sam he said at length i want to have a talk with you you know its time you were settling down ive been thinking about you while you were in america and ive come to the conclusion that ive been letting you drift along very bad for a young man youre getting on i dont say youre senile but youre not twentyone any longer and at your age i was working like a beaver youve got to remember that life isdash it ive forgotten it again he broke off and puffed vigorously into the speaking tube miss milliken kindly repeat what you were saying just now about life yes yes thats enough he put down the instrument yes life is real life is earnest he said gazing at sam seriously and the grave is not our goal lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime in fact its time you took your coat off and started work  i am quite ready father  you didnt hear what i said exclaimed sir mallaby with a look of surprise i said it was time you began work  and i said i was quite ready  bless my soul youve changed your views a trifle since i saw you last  i have changed them altogether  long hours of brooding among the red plush settees in the lounge of the hotel magnificent at bingleyonthesea had brought about this strange even morbid attitude of mind in samuel marlowe work he had decided was the only medicine for his sick soul here he felt in this quiet office far from the tumult and noise of the world in a haven of torts and misdemeanours and vic i cap 3s and all the rest of it he might find peace at any rate it was worth taking a stab at it  your trip has done you good said sir mallaby approvingly the sea air has given you some sense im glad of it it makes it easier for me to say something else that ive had on my mind for a good while sam its time you got married  sam barked bitterly his father looked at him with concern  swallow some smoke the wrong way  i was laughing explained sam with dignity  sir mallaby shook his head  i dont want to discourage your high spirits but i must ask you to approach this matter seriously marriage would do you a world of good sam it would brace you up you really ought to consider the idea i was two years younger than you are when i married your poor mother and it was the making of me a wife might make something of you  impossible  i dont see why she shouldnt theres lots of good in you my boy though you may not think so  when i said it was impossible said sam coldly i was referring to the impossibility of the possibility i mean that it was impossible that i could possibly  in other words father i can never marry my heart is dead  your what  my heart  dont be a fool theres nothing wrong with your heart all our family have had hearts like steamengines probably you have been feeling a sort of burning knock off cigars and that will soon stop  you dont understand me i mean that a woman has treated me in a way that has finished her whole sex as far as i am concerned for me women do not exist  you didnt tell me about this said sir mallaby interested when did this happen did she jilt you  yes  in america was it  on the boat  sir mallaby chuckled heartily  my dear boy you dont mean to tell me that youre taking a shipboard flirtation seriously why youre expected to fall in love with a different girl every time you go on a voyage youll get over this in a week youd have got over it by now if you hadnt gone and buried yourself in a depressing place like bingleyonthesea  the whistle of the speakingtube blew sir mallaby put the instrument to his ear  all right he turned to sam i shall have to send you away now sam man waiting to see me goodbye by the way are you doing anything tonight  no  not got a wrestling match on with yourself or anything like that well come to dinner at the house seventhirty dont be late  sam went out as he passed through the outer office miss milliken intercepted him  oh mr sam  yes  excuse me but will you be seeing sir mallaby again today  im dining with him tonight  then would youi dont like to disturb him now when he is busywould you mind telling him that i inadvertently omitted a stanza it runs said miss milliken closing her eyes trust no future howeer pleasant let the dead past bury its dead act act in the living present heart within and god oerhead thank you so much good afternoon   § 2  sam reaching bruton street at a quarter past seven was informed by the butler who admitted him that his father was dressing and would be down in a few minutes the butler an old retainer of the marlowe family who if he had not actually dandled sam on his knees when an infant had known him as a small boy was delighted to see him again  missed you very much mr samuel we all have he said affectionately as he preceded him to the drawingroom  yes said sam absently  very much indeed sir i happened to remark only the other day that the place didnt seem the same without your happy laugh its good to see you back once more looking so well and merry  sam stalked into the drawingroom with the feeling that comes to all of us from time to time that it is hopeless to struggle the whole damned circle of his acquaintance seemed to have made up their minds that he had not a care in the world so what was the use he lowered himself into a deep armchair and lit a cigarette  presently the butler reappeared with a cocktail on a tray sam drained it and scarcely had the door closed behind the old retainer when an abrupt change came over the whole outlook it was as if he had been a pianola and somebody had inserted a new record looking well and happy he blew a smoke ring well if it came to that why not why shouldnt he look well and happy what had he got to worry about he was a young man fit and strong in the springtide of life just about to plunge into an absorbing business why should he brood over a sentimental episode which had ended a little unfortunately he would never see the girl again if anything in this world was certain that was she would go her way and he his samuel marlowe rose from his chair a new man to greet his father who came in at that moment fingering a snowy white tie  sam started at his parents splendour in some consternation  great scot father are you expecting a lot of people i thought we were dining alone  thats all right my boy a dinnerjacket is perfectly in order we shall be quite a small party six in all you and i a friend of mine and his daughter a friend of my friends friend and my friends friends son  surely thats more than six  no  it sounded more  six said sir mallaby firmly he raised a shapely hand with the fingers outspread count em for yourself he twiddled his thumb number onebennett  who cried sam  bennett rufus bennett hes an american over here for the summer havent i ever mentioned his name to you hes a great fellow always thinking hes at deaths door but keeps up a fine appetite ive been his legal representative in london for years then sir mallaby twiddled his first fingertheres his daughter wilhelmina who has just arrived in england a look of enthusiasm came into sir mallabys face sam my boy i dont intend to say a word about miss wilhelmina bennett because i think theres nothing more prejudicial than singing a persons praises in advance i merely remark that i fancy you will appreciate her ive only met her once and then only for a few minutes but what i say is if theres a girl living whos likely to make you forget whatever fool of a woman you may be fancying yourself in love with at the moment that girl is wilhelmina bennett the others are bennetts friend henry mortimer also an americana big lawyer i believe on the other sideand his son bream i havent met either of them they ought to be here any moment now he looked at his watch ah i think that was the front door yes i can hear them on the stairs     chapter ix  rough work at a dinner table   § 1  after the first shock of astonishment sam marlowe had listened to his fathers harangue with a growing indignation which towards the end of the speech had assumed proportions of a cold fury if there is one thing the which your highspirited young man resents it is being the toy of fate he chafes at the idea that fate had got it all mapped out for him fate thought sam had constructed a cheap mushy sentimental fivereel film scenario and without consulting him had had the cool cheek to cast him for one of the puppets he seemed to see fate as a thin female with a soppy expression and pincenez sniffing a little as she worked the thing out he could picture her glutinous satisfaction as she reread her scenario and gloated over its surefire qualities there was not a flaw in the construction it started off splendidly with a romantic meeting had em guessing halfway through when the hero and heroine quarrelled and partedapparently for ever and now the stage was all set for the reconciliation and the slow fadeout on the embrace to bring this last scene about fate had had to permit herself a slight coincidence but she did not jib at that what we call coincidences are merely the occasions when fate gets stuck in a plot and has to invent the next situation in a hurry  sam marlowe felt sulky and defiant this girl had treated him shamefully and he wanted to have nothing more to do with her if he had had his wish he would never have met her again fate in her interfering way had forced this meeting on him and was now complacently looking to him to behave in a suitable manner well he would show her in a few seconds now billie and he would be meeting he would be distant and polite he would be cold and aloof he would chill her to the bone and rip a hole in the scenario six feet wide  the door opened and the room became full of bennetts and mortimers   § 2  billie looking as marlowe could not but admit particularly pretty headed the procession following her came a large redfaced man whose buttons seemed to creak beneath the strain of their duties after him trotted a small thin pale semibald individual who wore glasses and carried his nose raised and puckered as though some faintly unpleasant smell were troubling his nostrils the fourth member of the party was dear old bream  there was a confused noise of mutual greetings and introductions and then bream got a good sight of sam and napped forward with his right wing outstretched  why hello said bream  how are you mortimer said sam coldly  what do you know my son exclaimed sir mallaby  came over in the boat together said bream  capital said sir mallaby old friends eh miss bennett he turned to billie who had been staring wideeyed at her late fiancé let me present my son sam sam this is miss bennett  how do you do said sam  how do you do said billie  bennett youve never met my son i think  mr bennett peered at sam with protruding eyes which gave him the appearance of a rather unusually stout prawn  how are you he asked with such intensity that sam unconsciously found himself replying to a question which does not as a rule call for any answer  very well thanks  mr bennett shook his head moodily you are lucky to be able to say so very few of us can assert as much i can truthfully say that in the last fifteen years i have not known what it is to enjoy sound health for a single day marlowe he proceeded swinging ponderously round on sir mallaby like a liner turning in the river i assure you that at twentyfive minutes past four this afternoon i was very nearly convinced that i should have to call you up on the phone and cancel this dinner engagement when i took my temperature at twenty minutes to six at this point the butler appeared at the door announcing that dinner was served  sir mallaby marlowes dinner table which like most of the furniture in the house had belonged to his deceased father and had been built at a period when people liked things big and solid was a good deal too spacious to be really ideal for a small party a white sea of linen separated each diner from the diner opposite and created a forced intimacy with the person seated next to him billie bennett and sam marlowe as a consequence found themselves if not exactly in a solitude of their own at least sufficiently cut off from their kind to make silence between them impossible westward mr mortimer had engaged sir mallaby in a discussion on the recent case of ouseley v ouseley figg mountjoy mosebysmith and others which though too complicated to explain here presented points of considerable interest to the legal mind to the east mr bennett was relating to bream the more striking of his recent symptoms billie felt constrained to make at least an attempt at conversation  how strange meeting you here she said  sam who had been crumbling bread in an easy and debonair manner looked up and met her eye its expression was one of cheerful friendliness he could not see his own eye but he imagined and hoped that it was cold and forbidding like the surface of some bottomless mountain tarn  i beg your pardon  i said how strange meeting you here i never dreamed sir mallaby was your father  i knew it all along said sam and there was an interval caused by the maid insinuating herself between them and collecting his soup plate he sipped sherry and felt a sombre selfsatisfaction he had he considered given the conversation the right tone from the start cool and distant out of the corner of his eye he saw billie bite her lip he turned to her again now that he had definitely established the fact that he and she were strangers meeting by chance at a dinnerparty he was in a position to go on talking  and how do you like england miss bennett  billies eye had lost its cheerful friendliness a somewhat feline expression had taken its place  pretty well she replied  you dont like it  well the way i look at it is this its no use grumbling one has got to realise that in england one is in a savage country and one should simply be thankful one isnt eaten by the natives  what makes you call england a savage country demanded sam a staunch patriot deeply stung  what would you call a country where you cant get ice central heating cornonthecob or bathrooms my father and mr mortimer have just taken a house down on the coast and theres just one niggly little bathroom in the place  is that your only reason for condemning england  oh no it has other drawbacks  such as  well englishmen for instance young englishmen in particular english young men are awful idle rude conceited and ridiculous  marlowe refused hock with a bitter intensity which nearly startled the old retainer who had just offered it to him into dropping the decanter  how many english young men have you met  billie met his eye squarely and steadily well now that i come to think of it not many in fact very few as a matter of fact only  only  well very few said billie yes she said meditatively i suppose i really have been rather unjust i should not have condemned a class simply because  i mean i suppose there are young englishmen who are not rude and ridiculous  i suppose there are american girls who have hearts  oh plenty  ill believe that when i meet one  sam paused cold aloofness was all very well but this conversation was developing into a vulgar brawl the ghosts of dead and gone marlowes all noted for their courtesy to the sex seemed to stand beside his chair eyeing him reprovingly his work they seemed to whisper was becoming raw it was time to jerk the interchange of thought back into the realm of distant civility  are you making a long stay in london miss bennett  no not long we are going down to the country almost immediately i told you my father and mr mortimer had taken a house there  you will enjoy that  im sure i shall mr mortimers son bream will be there that will be nice  why said sam backsliding  there was a pause  he isnt rude and ridiculous eh said sam gruffly  oh no his manners are perfect and he has such a natural dignity she went on looking affectionately across the table at the heir of the mortimers who finding mr bennetts medical confidences a trifle fatiguing was yawning broadly and absently balancing his wine glass on a fork  besides said billie in a soft and dreamy voice we are engaged to be married   § 3  sam didnt care of course we who have had the privilege of a glimpse into his iron soul know that he was not in the least upset by the newsjust surprised he happened to be raising his glass at the moment and he registered a certain amount of restrained emotion by snapping the stem in half and shooting the contents over the tablecloth but that was all  good heavens sam ejaculated sir mallaby aghast his wine glasses were an old and valued set  sam blushed as red as the stain on the cloth  awfully sorry father dont know how it happened  something must have given you a shock suggested billie kindly  the old retainer rallied round with napkins and sir mallaby who was just about to dismiss the affair with the polished ease of a good host suddenly became aware of the activities of bream that young man on whose dreamy calm the accident had made no impression whatever had successfully established the equilibrium of the glass and the fork and was now cautiously inserting beneath the latter a section of a roll the whole forming a charming picture in still life  if that glass is in your way said sir mallaby as soon as he had hitched up his drooping jaw sufficiently to enable him to speak he was beginning to feel that he would be lucky if he came out of this dinnerparty with a mere remnant of his precious set  oh sir mallaby said billie casting an adoring glance at the juggler you neednt be afraid that bream will drop it he isnt clumsy he is wonderful at that sort of thing simply wonderful i think its so splendid said billie when men can do things like that im always trying to get bream to do some of his tricks for people but hes so modest he wont  refreshingly different sir mallaby considered from the average drawingroom entertainer  yes said billie emphatically i think the most terrible thing in the world is a man who tries to entertain when he cant did i tell you about the man on board ship father at the ships concert oh it was the most awful thing you ever saw everybody was talking about it she beamed round the table and there was a note of fresh girlish gaiety in her voice this man got up to do an imitation of somebodynobody knows to this day who it was meant to beand he came into the saloon and directly he saw the audience he got stage fright he just stood there gurgling and not saying a word and then suddenly his nerve failed him altogether and he turned and tore out of the room like a rabbit he absolutely ran and he hadnt said a word it was the most ridiculous exhibition ive ever seen  the anecdote went well of course there will always be a small minority in any audience which does not appreciate a funny story and there was one in the present case but the bulk of the company roared with laughter  do you mean cried sir mallaby choking the poor idiot just stood there dumb  well he made a sort of yammering noise said billie but that only made him look sillier  deuced good chuckled sir mallaby  funniest thing i ever heard in my life gurgled mr bennett swallowing a digestive capsule  may have been halfwitted suggested mr mortimer  sam leaned across the table with a stern set face he meant to change the conversation if he had to do it with a crowbar  i hear you have taken a house in the country mr mortimer he said  yes said mr mortimer he turned to sir mallaby we have at last succeeded in persuading your sister mrs hignett to let us rent her house for the summer  sir mallaby gasped  windles you dont mean to tell me that my sister has let you have windles  mr mortimer nodded triumphantly  yes i had completely resigned myself to the prospect of spending the summer in some other house when yesterday i happened to run into your nephew young eustace hignett on the street and he said he was just coming round to see me about that very thing to cut a long story short he said that it would be all right and that we could have the house mr mortimer took a sip of burgundy hes a curious boy young hignett very nervous in his manner  chronic dyspepsia said mr bennett authoritatively i can tell it at a glance  is windles a very lovely place sir mallaby asked billie  charming quite charming not large of course as country houses go not a castle i mean with hundreds of acres of park land but nice and compact and comfortable and very picturesque  we do not require a large place said mr mortimer we shall be quite a small party bennett and myself wilhelmina bream  dont forget said billie that you have promised to invite jane hubbard down there  ah yes wilhelminas friend miss hubbard she is coming that will be all except young hignett himself  hignett cried mr bennett  mr hignett exclaimed billie  there was an almost imperceptible pause before mr mortimer spoke again and for an instant the demon of embarrassment hovered unseen but present above the dinner table mr bennett looked sternly at billie billie turned a shade pinker and gazed at the tablecloth bream started nervously even mr mortimer seemed robbed for a moment of his legal calm  i forgot to tell you that he said yes one of the stipulationsto which i personally was perfectly willing to agreewas that eustace hignett was to remain on the premises during our tenancy such a clause in the agreement was i am quite aware unusual and had the circumstances been other than they were i would have had a good deal to say about it but we wanted the place and we couldnt get it except by agreeing so i agreed im sure you will think that i acted rightly bennett considering the peculiar circumstances  well said mr bennett reluctantly i certainly did want that house  and we couldnt have had it otherwise said mr mortimer so that is all there is to it  well it need make no difference to you said sir mallaby i am sure you will find my nephew eustace most unobtrusive he may even be an entertaining companion i believe he has a nice singing voice with that and the juggling of our friend here and my sisters late husbands orchestrion you will have no difficulty in amusing yourselves during the evenings you remember the orchestrion sam said sir mallaby on whom his sons silence had been weighing rather heavily for some time  yes said sam and returned to the silence once more  the late mr hignett had it put in he was very fond of music its a thing you turn on by pressing a button in the wall continued sir mallaby how you stop it i dont know when i was down there last it never seemed to stop you mustnt miss the orchestrion  i certainly shall said mr bennett decidedly music of that description happens to be the one thing which jars unendurably on my nerves my nervous system is thoroughly out of tune  so is the orchestrion said sir mallaby i remember once when i was down there  i hope you will come down there again sir mallaby said mr mortimer during our occupancy of the house and you too he said addressing sam  i am afraid said sam frigidly that my time will be very much occupied for the next few months thank you very much he added after a moments pause  sams going to work said sir mallaby  yes said sam with dark determination work is the only thing in life that matters  oh come sam said sir mallaby at your age i used to think love was fairly important too  love said sam he jabbed at his soufflé with a spoon you could see by the scornful way he did it that he did not think much of love   § 4  sir mallaby the last cigar of the night between his lips broke a silence which had lasted a quarter of an hour the guests had gone and he and sam were alone together  sam he said do you know what i think  no said sam  sir mallaby removed his cigar and spoke impressively ive been turning the whole thing over in my mind and the conclusion i have come to is that there is more in this windles business than meets the eye ive known your aunt adeline all my life and i tell you it isnt in that woman to change her infernal pigheaded mind especially about letting her house she is a monomaniac on that subject if you want to know my opinion i am quite certain that your cousin eustace has let the place to these people without her knowledge and intends to pocket the cheque and not say a word about it what do you think  eh said sam absently  i said what do you think  what do i think about what  about eustace hignett and windles  what about them  sir mallaby regarded him disprovingly im hanged if i know whats the matter with you tonight sam you seem to have unhitched your brain and left it in the umbrella stand you hadnt a word to say for yourself all through dinner you might have been a trappist monk and with that delightful girl miss bennett there too she must have thought you infernally dull  im sorry  its no good being sorry now the mischiefs done she has gone away thinking you an idiot do you realise said sir mallaby warmly that when she told that extremely funny story about the man who made such a fool of himself on board the ship you were the only person at the table who was not amused she must have thought you had no sense of humour  sam rose i think ill be going he said good night  a man can bear just so much     chapter x  trouble at windles   § 1  mr rufus bennett stood at the window of the drawingroom of windles looking out from where he stood he could see all those natural and artificial charms which had made the place so desirable to him when he first beheld them immediately below flower beds bright with assorted blooms pressed against the ivied stone wall of the house beyond separated from these by a gravel pathway a smooth lawn whose green and silky turf rivalled the lawns of oxford colleges stretched to a picturesque shrubbery not so dense as to withhold altogether from the eye of the observer an occasional silvery glimpse of the lake that lay behind it to the left through noble trees appeared a white suggestion of old stable yards while to the right bordering on the drive as it swept round to a distant gate nothing less than a fragment of a ruined castle reared itself against a background of firs  it had been this sensational fragment of old england which had definitely captured mr bennett on his first visit to the place he could not have believed that the time would ever come when he could gaze on it without any lightening of the spirits  the explanation of his gloom was simple in addition to looking at the flower beds the lawn the shrubbery the stable yard and the castle mr bennett was also looking at the fifth heavy shower that had fallen since breakfast this was the third afternoon of his tenancy the first day it had rained all the time the second day it had rained from eight till twelvefifteen from twelvethirty till four and from five till eleven and on this the third day there had been no intermission longer than ten minutes it was a trying summer even the writers in the daily papers seemed mildly surprised and claimed that england had seen finer julys mr bennett who had lived his life in a country of warmth and sunshine the thing affected in much the same way as the early days of the flood must have affected noah a first startled resentment had given place to a despair too militant to be called resignation and with the despair had come a strong distaste for his fellow human beings notably and in particular his old friend mr mortimer who at this moment broke impatiently in on his meditations  come along bennett its your deal its no good looking at the rain looking at it wont stop it  mr mortimers nerves also had become a little frayed by the weather  mr bennett returned heavily to the table where with mr mortimer as partner he was playing one more interminable rubber of bridge against bream and billie he was sick of bridge but there was nothing else to do  mr bennett sat down with a grunt and started to deal halfway through the operation the sound of rather stertorous breathing began to proceed from beneath the table mr bennett glanced agitatedly down and curled his legs round his chair  i have fourteen cards said mr mortimer thats the third time youve misdealt  i dont care how many cards youve got said mr bennett with heat that dog of yours is sniffing at my ankles  he looked malignantly at a fine bulldog which now emerged from its cover and sitting down beamed at the company he was a sweettempered dog handicapped by the outward appearance of a canine plugugly murder seemed the mildest of the desires that lay behind that rugged countenance as a matter of fact what he wanted was cake his name was smith and mr mortimer had bought him just before leaving london to serve the establishment as a watchdog  he wont hurt you said mr mortimer carelessly  you keep saying that replied mr bennett pettishly how do you know hes a dangerous beast and if i had had any notion that you were buying him i would have had something to say about it  whatever you might have said would have made no difference i am within my legal rights in purchasing a dog you have a dog at least wilhelmina has  yes and pinkyboodles gets on splendidly with smith said billie ive seen them playing together  mr bennett subsided he was feeling thoroughly misanthropic he disliked everybody with perhaps the exception of billie for whom a faint paternal fondness still lingered he disliked mr mortimer he disliked bream and regretted that billie had become engaged to him though for years such an engagement had been his dearest desire he disliked jane hubbard now out walking in the rain with eustace hignett and he disliked eustace  eustace he told himself he disliked rather more than any of the others he resented the young mans presence in the house and he resented the fact that being in the house he should go about pale and haggard as though he were sickening for something mr bennett had the most violent objection to associating with people who looked as though they were sickening for something  he got up and went to the window the rain leaped at the glass like a frolicking puppy it seemed to want to get inside and play with mr bennett   § 2  mr bennett slept late on the following morning he looked at his watch on the dressing table when he got up and found that it was past ten taking a second look to assure himself that he had really slumbered to this unusual hour he suddenly became aware of something bright and yellow resting beside the watch and paused transfixed like robinson crusoe staring at the footprint in the sand if he had not been in england he would have said that it was a patch of sunshine  mr bennett stared at the yellow blob with the wistful mistrust of a traveller in a desert who has been taken in once or twice by mirages it was not till he had pulled up the blind and was looking out on a garden full of brightness and warmth and singing birds that he definitely permitted himself to accept the situation  it was a superb morning it was as if some giant had uncorked a great bottle full of the distilled scent of grass trees flowers and hay mr bennett rang the bell joyfully and presently there entered a grave thin intellectuallooking man who looked like a duke only more respectable this was webster mr bennetts valet he carried in one hand a small mug of hot water reverently as if it were a present of jewellery  good morning sir  morning webster said mr bennett rather late eh  it is replied webster precisely a little late sir i would have awakened you at the customary hour but it was miss bennetts opinion that a rest would do you good  mr bennetts sense of wellbeing deepened what more could a man want in this world than fine weather and a dutiful daughter  she did eh  yes sir she desired me to inform you that having already breakfasted she proposed to drive mr mortimer and mr bream mortimer into southampton in the car mr mortimer senior wished to buy a panama hat  a panama hat exclaimed mr bennett  a panama hat sir  mr bennetts feeling of satisfaction grew still greater it was a fine day he had a dutiful daughter and he was going to see henry mortimer in a panama hat providence was spoiling him  the valet withdrew like a duke leaving the royal presence not actually walking backwards but giving the impression of doing so and mr bennett having decanted the mug of water into the basin began to shave himself  having finished shaving he opened the drawer in the bureau where lay his white flannel trousers here at last was a day worthy of them he drew them out and as he did so something gleamed pinkly up at him from a corner of the drawer his salmoncoloured bathingsuit  mr bennett started he had not contemplated such a thing but after all why not there was the lake shining through the trees a mere fifty yards away what could be more refreshing he shed his pyjamas and climbed into the bathingsuit and presently looking like the sun on a foggy day he emerged from the house and picked his way with gingerly steps across the smooth surface of the lawn  at this moment from behind a bush where he had been thriftily burying a yesterdays bone smith the bulldog waddled out on to the lawn he drank in the exhilarating air through an upturned nose which his recent excavations had rendered somewhat muddy then he observed mr bennett and moved gladly towards him he did not recognise mr bennett for he remembered his friends principally by their respective bouquets so he cantered silently across the turf to take a sniff at him he was halfway across the lawn when some of the mud which he had inhaled when burying the bone tickled his lungs and he paused to cough  mr bennett whirled round and then with a sharp exclamation picked up his pink feet from the velvet turf and began to run smith after a momentary pause of surprise lumbered after him wheezing contentedly this man he felt was evidently one of the right sort a merry playfellow  mr bennett continued to run but already he had begun to pant and falter when he perceived looming upon his left the ruins of that ancient castle which had so attracted him on his first visit on that occasion it had made merely an aesthetic appeal to mr bennett now he saw in a flash that its practical merits also were of a sterling order he swerved sharply took the base of the edifice in his stride clutched at a jutting stone flung his foot at another and just as his pursuer arrived and sat panting below pulled himself on to a ledge where he sat with his feet hanging well out of reach the bulldog smith gazed up at him expectantly the game was a new one to smith but it seemed to have possibilities he was a dog who was always perfectly willing to try anything once  mr bennett now began to address himself in earnest to the task of calling for assistance his physical discomfort was acute insects some winged some without wings butthrough natures wonderful law of compensationequipped with a number of extra pairs of legs had begun to fit out exploring expeditions over his body they roamed about him as if he were some newly opened recreation ground strolled in couples down his neck and made up jolly family parties on his bare feet and then first dropping like the gentle dew upon the place beneath then swishing down in a steady flood it began to rain again  it was at this point that mr bennetts manly spirit broke and time ceased to exist for him  aeons later a voice spoke from below  hullo said the voice  mr bennett looked down the stalwart form of jane hubbard was standing beneath him gazing up from under a tam oshanter cap smith the bulldog gambolled about her shapely feet  whatever are you doing up there said jane i say do you know if the car has come back  no it has not  ive got to go to the doctors poor little mr hignett is ill oh well ill have to walk come along smith she turned towards the drive smith caracoling at her side  mr bennett though free now to move remained where he was transfixed that sinister word ill held him like a spell eustace hignett was ill he had thought all along that the fellow was sickening for something confound him  whats the matter with him bellowed mr bennett after jane hubbards retreating back  eh queried jane stopping  whats the matter with hignett  i dont know  is it infectious  i expect so  great heavens cried mr bennett and lowering himself cautiously to the ground squelched across the dripping grass  in the hall webster the valet dry and dignified was tapping the barometer with the wrist action of an ambassador knocking on the door of a friendly monarch  a sharp downpour sir he remarked  have you been in the house all the time demanded mr bennett  yes sir  didnt you hear me shouting  i did fancy i heard something sir  then why the devil didnt you come to me  i supposed it to be the owls sir a bird very frequent in this locality they make a sort of harsh hooting howl sir i have sometimes wondered said webster pursuing a not uninteresting train of thought whether that might be the reason of the name  before mr bennett could join him in the region of speculation into which he had penetrated there was a grinding of brakes on the gravel outside and the wettest motor car in england drew up at the front door   § 3  from windles to southampton is a distance of about twenty miles and the rain had started to fall when the car an open one lacking even the poor protection of a cape hood had accomplished half the homeward journey for the last ten miles mr mortimer had been nursing a sullen hatred for all created things and when entering the house he came upon mr bennett hopping about in the hall endeavouring to detain him and tell him some long and uninteresting story his venom concentrated itself upon his erstwhile friend  oh get out of the way he snapped shaking off the others hand cant you see im wet  wet wet mr bennetts voice quivered with selfpity so am i wet  father dear said billie reprovingly you really oughtnt to have come into the house after bathing without drying yourself youll spoil the carpet  ive not been bathing im trying to tell you  hullo said bream with amiable innocence coming in at the tailend of the party been having a jolly bathe  mr bennett danced with silent irritation and striking a bare toe against the leg of a chair seized his left foot and staggered into the arms of webster who had been preparing to drift off to the servants hall linked together the two proceeded across the carpet in a movement which suggested in equal parts the careless vigour of the cakewalk and the grace of the oldfashioned mazurka  what the devil are you doing you fool cried mr bennett  nothing sir and i should be glad if you would accept my weeks notice replied webster calmly  whats that  my notice sir to take effect at the expiration of the current week i cannot acquiesce in being cursed and sworn at  oh go to blazes  very good sir webster withdrew like a plenipotentiary who has been handed his papers on the declaration of war and mr bennett sprang to intercept mr mortimer who had slipped by and was making for the stairs  mortimer  oh what is it  that infernal dog of yours i insist on your destroying it  whats it been doing  the savage brute chased me all over the garden and kept me sitting up on that damned castle the whole of the morning  father darling interposed billie pausing on her way up the stairs you mustnt get excited you know its bad for you i dont expect poor old smith meant any harm she added pacifically as she disappeared in the direction of the landing  of course he didnt snapped mr mortimer hes as quiet as a lamb  i tell you he chased me from one end of the garden to the other i had to run like a hare  the unfortunate bream whose sense of the humorous was simple and childlike was not proof against the picture thus conjured up  ck giggled bream helplessly ck ck ck  mr bennett turned on him oh it strikes you as funny does it well let me tell you that if you think you can laugh at me withwitherwith one hand andandmarry my daughter with the other youre wrong you can consider your engagement at an end  oh i say ejaculated bream abruptly sobered  mortimer bawled mr bennett once more arresting the other as he was about to mount the stairs do you or do you not intend to destroy that dog  i do not  i insist on your doing so he is a menace  he is nothing of the kind on your own showing he didnt even bite you once and every dog is allowed one bite by law the case of wilberforce v bayliss covers that point thoroughly  i dont care about the case of wilberforce and bayliss  you will find that you have to it is a legal precedent  there is something about a legal precedent which gives pause to the angriest man mr bennett felt as every layman feels when arguing with a lawyer as if he were in the coils of a python  say mr bennett began bream at his elbow  get out snarled mr bennett  yes but say  the green baize door at the end of the hall opened and webster appeared  i beg your pardon sir said webster but luncheon will be served within the next few minutes possibly you may wish to make some change of costume  bring me my lunch on a tray in my room said mr bennett i am going to bed  very good sir  but say mr bennett resumed bream  grrh replied his exprospectivefatherinlaw and bounded up the stairs like a portion of the sunset which had become detached from the main body   § 4  even into the blackest days there generally creeps an occasional ray of sunshine and there are few crises of human gloom which are not lightened by a bit of luck it was so with mr bennett in his hour of travail there were lobsters for lunch and his passion for lobsters had made him the talk of three new york clubs he was feeling a little happier when billie came in to see how he was getting on  hullo father had a nice lunch  yes said mr bennett cheering up a little at the recollection there was nothing wrong with the lunch  how little we fallible mortals know even as he spoke a tiny fragment of lobster shell which had been working its way silently into the tip of his tongue was settling down under the skin and getting ready to cause him the most acute mental distress which he had ever known  the lunch said mr bennett was excellent lobsters he licked his lips appreciatively  and talking of lobsters he went on i suppose that boy bream has told you that i have broken off your engagement  yes  you dont seem very upset said mr bennett who was in the mood for a dramatic scene and felt a little disappointed  oh ive become a fatalist on the subject of my engagements  i dont understand you  well i mean they never seem to come to anything billie gazed wistfully at the counterpane do you know father im beginning to think that im rather impulsive i wish i didnt do silly things in such a hurry  i dont see where the hurry comes in as regards that mortimer boy you took ten years to make up your mind  i was not thinking of bream another man  great heavens are you still imagining yourself in love with young hignett  oh no i can see now that i was never in love with poor eustace i was thinking of a man i got engaged to on the boat  mr bennett sat bolt upright in bed and stared incredulously at his surprising daughter his head was beginning to swim  of course ive misunderstood you he said theres a catch somewhere and i havent seen it but for a moment you gave me the impression that you had promised to marry some man on the boat  i did  but mr bennett was doing sums on his fingers do you mean to tell me he demanded having brought out the answer to his satisfaction do you mean to tell me that you have been engaged to three men in three weeks  yes said billie in a small voice  great godfrey er  no only three  mr bennett sank back on to his pillow with a snort  the trouble is continued billie one does things and doesnt know how one is going to feel about it afterwards you can do an awful lot of thinking afterwards father  im doing a lot of thinking now said mr bennett with austerity you oughtnt to be allowed to go around loose  well it doesnt matter i shall never get engaged again i shall never love anyone again  dont tell me you are still in love with this boat man  billie nodded miserably i didnt realise it till we came down here but as i sat and watched the rain it suddenly came over me that i had thrown away my lifes happiness it was as if i had been offered a wonderful jewel and had refused it i seemed to hear a voice reproaching me and saying you have had your chance it will never come again  dont talk nonsense said mr bennett  billie stiffened she had thought she had been talking rather well  mr bennett was silent for a moment then he started up with an exclamation the mention of eustace hignett had stirred his memory whats young hignett got wrong with him he asked  mumps  mumps good god not mumps mr bennett quailed ive never had mumps one of the most infectious  this is awful oh heavens why did i ever come to this lazarhouse cried mr bennett shaken to his depths  there isnt the slightest danger father dear dont be silly if i were you i should try to get a good sleep you must be tired after this morning  sleep if i only could said mr bennett and did so five minutes after the door had closed  he awoke half an hour later with a confused sense that something was wrong he had been dreaming that he was walking down fifth avenue at the head of a military brass band clad only in a bathing suit as he sat up in bed blinking in the dazed fashion of the halfawakened the band seemed to be playing still there was undeniably music in the air the room was full of it it seemed to be coming up through the floor and rolling about in chunks all round his bed  mr bennett blinked the last fragments of sleep out of his system and became filled with a restless irritability there was only one instrument in the house which could create this infernal dinthe orchestrion in the drawingroom immediately above which he recalled his room was situated  he rang the bell for webster  is mr mortimer playing thatthat damned gasengine in the drawingroom  yes sir tostis goodbye a charming air sir  go and tell him to stop it  very good sir  mr bennett lay in bed and fumed presently the valet returned the music still continued to roll about the room  i am sorry to have to inform you sir said webster that mr mortimer declines to accede to your request  oh he said that did he  that is the gist of his remarks sir  very good then give me my dressinggown  webster swathed his employer in the garment indicated and returned to the kitchen where he informed the cook that in his opinion the guvnor was not a force and that if he were a betting man he would put his money in the forthcoming struggle on consul the almosthumanby which affectionate nickname mr mortimer senior was generally alluded to in the servants hall  mr bennett meanwhile had reached the drawingroom and found his former friend lying at full length on a sofa smoking a cigar a full dozen feet away from the orchestrion which continued to thunder out its dirge on the passing of summer  will you turn that infernal thing off said mr bennett  no said mr mortimer  now now now said a voice  jane hubbard was standing in the doorway with a look of calm reproof on her face  we cant have this you know said jane hubbard youre disturbing my patient  she strode without hesitation to the instrument explored its ribs with a firm finger pushed something and the orchestrion broke off in the middle of a bar then walking serenely to the door she passed out and closed it behind her  the baser side of his nature urged mr bennett to triumph over the vanquished  now what about it he said ungenerously  interfering girl mumbled mr mortimer chafing beneath defeat ive a good mind to start it again  i dare you whooped mr bennett reverting to the phraseology of his vanished childhood go on i dare you  ive a perfect legal right oh well he said there are lots of other things i can do  what do you mean exclaimed mr bennett alarmed  never mind said mr mortimer taking up a book  mr bennett went back to bed in an uneasy frame of mind  he brooded for half an hour and at the expiration of that period rang for webster and requested that billie should be sent to him  i want you to go to london he said when she appeared i must have legal advice i want you to go and see sir mallaby marlowe tell him that henry mortimer is annoying me in every possible way and sheltering himself behind his knowledge of the law so that i cant get at him ask sir mallaby to come down here and if he cant come himself tell him to send someone who can advise me his son would do if he knows anything about the business  oh im sure he does  eh how do you know  well i mean he looks as if he does said billie hastily he looks so clever  i didnt notice it myself well hell do if sir mallabys too busy to come himself i want you to go up tonight so that you can see him first thing tomorrow morning you can stop the night at the savoy ive sent webster to look out a train  theres a splendid train in about an hour ill take that  its giving you a lot of trouble said mr bennett with belated consideration  oh no said billie im only too glad to be able to do this for you father dear     chapter xi  mr bennett has a bad night   the fragment of a lobstershell which had entered mr bennetts tongue at twenty minutes to two in the afternoon was still in occupation at halfpast eleven that night when that persecuted gentleman blew out his candle and endeavoured to compose himself for a nights slumber its unconscious host had not yet been made aware of its presence he had a vague feeling that the tip of his tongue felt a little sore but his mind was too engrossed with the task of keeping a lookout for the preliminary symptoms of mumps to have leisure to bestow much attention on this phenomenon the discomfort it caused was not sufficient to keep him awake and presently he turned on his side and began to fill the room with a rhythmical snoring  how pleasant if one could leave him sothe good man taking his rest facts however are facts and having crept softly from mr bennetts side with the feeling that at last everything is all right with him we are compelled to return three hours later to discover that everything is all wrong it is so dark in the room that our eyes can at first discern nothing then as we grow accustomed to the blackness we perceive him sitting bolt upright in bed staring glassily before him while with the first finger of his right hand he touches apprehensively the tip of his protruding tongue  at this point mr bennett lights his candleone of the charms of windles was the oldworld simplicity of its lighting systemand we are enabled to get a better view of him  mr bennett sat in the candlelight with his tongue out and the first beads of a chilly perspiration bedewing his forehead it was impossible for a man of his complexion to turn pale but he had turned as pale as he could panic gripped him a man whose favourite reading was medical encyclopædias he needed no doctor to tell him that this was the end fate had dealt him a knockout blow his number was up and in a very short while now people would be speaking of him in the past tense and saying what a pity it all was  a man in mr bennetts position experiences strange emotions and many of them in fact there are scores of writers who reckless of the cost of white paper would devote two chapters at this point to an analysis of the unfortunate mans reflections and be glad of the chance it is sufficient however merely to set on record that there was no stint whatever are the emotions of a man in such a position mr bennett had them he had them all one after another some of them twice he went right through the list from soup to nuts until finally he reached remorse and having reached remorse he allowed that to monopolise him  in his early days when he was building up his fortune mr bennett had frequently done things to his competitors in wall street which would not have been tolerated in the purer atmosphere of a lumbercamp and if he was going to be remorseful about anything he might well have started by being remorseful about that but it was on his most immediate past that his wistful mind lingered he had quarrelled with his lifelong friend henry mortimer he had broken off his daughters engagement with a deserving young man he had spoken harsh words to his faithful valet the more mr bennett examined his conduct the deeper the iron entered into his soul  fortunately none of his acts were irreparable he could undo them he could make amends the small hours of the morning are not perhaps the most suitable time for making amends but mr bennett was too remorseful to think of that do it now had ever been his motto so he started by ringing the bell for webster  the same writers who would have screamed with joy at the chance of dilating on mr bennetts emotions would find a congenial task in describing the valets thoughtprocesses when the bell roused him from a refreshing sleep at a few minutes after three am however by the time he entered his employers room he was his own calm self again  good morning sir he remarked equably i fear that it will be the matter of a few minutes to prepare your shaving water i was not aware said webster in manly apology for having been found wanting that you intended rising so early  webster said mr bennett im a dying man  indeed sir  a dying man repeated mr bennett  very good sir which of your suits would you wish me to lay out  mr bennett had the feeling that something was going wrong with the scene  webster he said this morning we had an unfortunate misunderstanding im sorry  pray dont mention it sir  i was to blame webster you have been a faithful servant you have stuck to me webster through thick and thin said mr bennett who had half persuaded himself by this time that the other had been in the family for years instead of having been engaged at a registryoffice a little less than a month ago through thick and thin repeated mr bennett  i have endeavoured to give satisfaction sir  i want to reward you webster  thank you very much sir  take my trousers  webster raised a deprecating hand  no no sir thanking you exceedingly i couldnt really you will need them sir and i assure you i have an ample supply  take my trousers repeated mr bennett and feel in the righthand pocket there is some money there  im sure im very much obliged sir said webster beginning for the first time to feel that there was a bright side he embarked upon the treasurehunt the sum is sixteen pounds eleven shillings and threepence sir  keep it  thank you very much sir would there be anything further sir  why no said mr bennett feeling dissatisfied nevertheless there had been a lack of the deepest kind of emotion in the interview and his yearning soul resented it why no  goodnight sir  stop a moment which is mr mortimers room  mr mortimer senior sir it is at the further end of this passage on the left facing the main staircase goodnight sir i am extremely obliged i will bring you your shavingwater when you ring  mr bennett left alone mused for awhile then rising from his bed put on his dressinggown took his candle and went down the passage  in a less softened mood the first thing mr bennett would have done on crossing the threshold of the door facing the staircase would have been to notice resentfully that mr mortimer with his usual astuteness had collared the best bedroom in the house the soft carpet gave out no sound as mr bennett approached the wide and luxurious bed the light of the candle fell on the back of a semibald head mr mortimer was sleeping with his face buried in the pillow it cannot have been good for him but that was what he was doing from the portion of the pillow in which his face was buried strange gurgles proceeded like the distant rumble of an approaching train on the underground  mortimer said mr bennett  the train stopped at a station to pick up passengers and rumbled on again  henry said mr bennett and nudged his sleeping friend in the small of the back  leave it on the mat mumbled mr mortimer stirring slightly and uncovering one corner of his mouth  mr bennett began to forget his remorse in a sense of injury he felt like a man with a good story to tell who can get nobody to listen to him he nudged the other again more vehemently this time mr mortimer made a noise like a gramophone when the needle slips moved restlessly for a moment then sat up staring at the candle  rabbits rabbits rabbits said mr mortimer and sank back again he had begun to rumble before he touched the pillow  what do you mean rabbits said mr bennett sharply  the not unreasonable query fell on deaf ears mr mortimer was already entering a tunnel  much too pink he murmured as the pillow engulfed him  what steps mr bennett would have taken at this juncture one cannot say probably he would have given the thing up in despair and retired for it is weary work forgiving a sleeping man but as he bent above his slumbering friend a drop of warm grease detached itself from the candle and fell into mr mortimers exposed ear the sleeper wakened  what what what he exclaimed bounding up whos that  its merufus said mr bennett henry im dying  drying  dying  mr mortimer yawned cavernously the mists of sleep were engulfing him again  eight rabbits sitting on the lawn he muttered but too pink much too pink  and as if considering he had borne his full share in the conversation and that no more could be expected of him he snuggled down into the pillow again  mr bennetts sense of injury became more acute for a moment he was strongly tempted to try the restorative effects of candlegrease once more but just as he was on the point of succumbing a shooting pain as if somebody had run a redhot needle into his tongue reminded him of his situation a dying man cannot pass his last hours dropping candlegrease into peoples ears after all it was perhaps a little late and there would be plenty of time to become reconciled to mr mortimer tomorrow his task now was to seek out bream and bring him the glad news of his renewed engagement  he closed the door quietly and proceeded upstairs breams bedroom he knew was the one just off the next landing he turned the handle quietly and went in having done this he coughed  drop that pistol said the voice of jane hubbard immediately with quiet severity ive got you covered  mr bennett had no pistol but he dropped the candle it would have been a nice point to say whether he was more perturbed by the discovery that he had got into the wrong room and that room a ladys or by the fact that the lady whose wrong room it was had pointed what appeared to be a small cannon at him over the foot of the bed it was not as a matter of fact a cannon but the elephant gun which miss hubbard carried with her everywherea girls best friend  my dear young lady he gasped  on the five occasions during recent years on which men had entered her tent with the object of murdering her jane hubbard had shot without making inquiries what strange feminine weakness it was that had caused her to utter a challenge on this occasion she could not have said probably it was due to the enervating effects of civilisation she was glad now that she had done so for being awake and in full possession of her faculties she perceived that the intruder whoever he was had no evil intentions  who is it she asked  i dont know how to apologise  thats all right lets have a light a match flared in the darkness miss hubbard lit her candle and gazed at mr bennett with quiet curiosity walking in your sleep she inquired  no no  not so loud youll wake mr hignett hes next door thats why i took this room in case he was restless in the night  i want to see bream mortimer said mr bennett  hes in my old room two doors along the passage what do you want to see him about  i wish to inform him that he may still consider himself engaged to my daughter  oh well i dont suppose hell mind being woken up to hear that but whats the idea  its a long story  thats all right lets make a night of it  i am a dying man i awoke an hour ago with a feeling of acute pain  miss hubbard listened to the story of his symptoms with interest but without excitement  what nonsense she said at the conclusion  i assure you  id like to bet its nothing serious at all  my dear young lady said mr bennett piqued i have devoted a considerable part of my life to medical study  i know thats the trouble people oughtnt to be allowed to read medical books  well we need not discuss it said mr bennett stiffly he resented being dragged out of the valley of the shadow of death by the scruff of his neck like this a dying man has his dignity to think of i will leave you now and go and see young mortimer he clung to a hope that bream mortimer at least would receive him fittingly goodnight  but wait a moment  mr bennett left the room unheeding he was glad to go jane hubbard irritated him  his expectation of getting more satisfactory results from bream was fulfilled it took some time to rouse that young man from a slumber almost as deep as his fathers but once roused he showed a gratifying appreciation of the gravity of affairs joy at one half of his visitors news competed with consternation and sympathy at the other half he thanked mr bennett profusely showed a fitting concern on learning of his terrible situation and evinced a practical desire to help by offering him a bottle of liniment which he had found useful for gnatstings declining this though not ungratefully mr bennett withdrew and made his way down the passage again with something approaching a glow in his heart the glow lasted till he had almost reached the landing when it was dissipated by a soft but compelling voice from the doorway of miss hubbards room  come here said miss hubbard she had put on a blue bathrobe and looked like a pugilist about to enter the ring  well said mr bennett coldly coming nevertheless  im going to have a look at that tongue of yours said jane firmly its my opinion that youre making a lot of fuss over nothing  mr bennett drew himself up as haughtily as a fat man in a dressinggown can but the effect was wasted on his companion who had turned and gone into her room  come in here she said  tougher men than mr bennett had found it impossible to resist the note of calm command in that voice but for all that he reproached himself for his weakness in obeying  sit down said jane hubbard  she indicated a low stool beside the dressingtable  put your tongue out she said as mr bennett still under her strange influence lowered himself on to the stool further out thats right keep it like that  ouch exclaimed mr bennett bounding up  dont make such a noise youll wake mr hignett sit down again  i  sit down  mr bennett sat down miss hubbard extended once more the hand holding the needle which had caused his outcry he winced away from it desperately  baby said miss hubbard reprovingly why i once sewed eighteen stitches in a native bearers head and he didnt make half the fuss youre making now keep quite still  mr bennett didfor perhaps the space of two seconds then he leaped from his seat once more it was a tribute to the forceful personality of the fair surgeon if one were needed that the squeal he uttered was a subdued one he was just about to speakhe had framed the opening words of a strong protestwhen suddenly he became aware of something in his mouth something small and hard he removed it and examined it as it lay on his finger it was a minute fragment of lobstershell and at the same time he became conscious of a marked improvement in the state of his tongue the swelling had gone  i told you so said jane hubbard placidly what is it  itit appears to be a piece of  lobstershell and we had lobster for lunch goodnight  halfway down the stairs it suddenly occurred to mr bennett that he wanted to sing he wanted to sing very loud and for quite some time he restrained the impulse and returned to bed but relief such as his was too strong to keep bottled up he wanted to tell someone all about it he needed a confidant  webster the valet awakened once again by the ringing of his bell sighed resignedly and made his way downstairs  did you ring sir  webster cried mr bennett its all right im not dying after all im not dying after all webster  very good sir said webster will there be anything further     chapter xii  the lurid past of jno peters   thats right said sir mallaby marlowe work while youre young sam work while youre young he regarded his sons bent head with affectionate approval whats the book today  widgery on nisi prius evidence said sam without looking up  capital said sir mallaby highly improving and as interesting as a novelsome novels theres a splendid bit on i think page two hundred and fiftyfour where the hero finds out all about copyhold and customary estates its a wonderfully powerful situation it appearsbut i wont spoil it for you mind you dont skip to see how it all comes out in the end sir mallaby suspended conversation while he addressed an imaginary ball with the mashie which he had taken out of his golfbag for this was the day when he went down to walton heath for his weekly foursome with three old friends his tubby form was clad in tweed of a violent nature with knickerbockers and stockings sam  well  sam a man at the club showed me a new grip the other day instead of overlapping the little finger of the right hand oh by the way sam  yes  i should lock up the office today if i were you or anxious clients will be coming in and asking for advice and youll find yourself in difficulties i shall be gone and peters is away on his holiday youd better lock the outer door  all right said sam absently he was finding widgery stiff reading he had just got to the bit about raptu haeredis whichas of course you know is a writ for taking away an heir holding in socage  sir mallaby looked at his watch  well ill have to be going see you later sam  goodbye  sir mallaby went out and sam placing both elbows on the desk and twining his fingers in his hair returned with a frown of consternation to his grappling with widgery for perhaps ten minutes the struggle was an even one then gradually widgery got the upper hand sams mind numbed by constant batterings against the stony ramparts of legal phraseology weakened faltered and dropped away and a moment later his thoughts as so often happened when he was alone darted off and began to circle round the image of billie bennett  since they had last met at sir mallabys dinnertable sam had told himself perhaps a hundred times that he cared nothing about billie that she had gone out of his life and was dead to him but unfortunately he did not believe it a man takes a deal of convincing on a point like this and sam had never succeeded in convincing himself for more than two minutes at a time it was useless to pretend that he did not still love billie more than ever because he knew he did and now as the truth swept over him for the hundred and first time he groaned hollowly and gave himself up to the grey despair which is the almost inseparable companion of young men in his position  so engrossed was he in his meditation that he did not hear the light footstep in the outer office and it was only when it was followed by a tap on the door of the inner office that he awoke with a start to the fact that clients were in his midst he wished that he had taken his fathers advice and locked up the office probably this was some frightful bore who wanted to make his infernal will or something and sam had neither the ability nor the inclination to assist him  was it too late to escape perhaps if he did not answer the knock the blighter might think there was nobody at home but suppose he opened the door and peeped in a spasm of napoleonic strategy seized sam he dropped silently to the floor and concealed himself under the desk napoleon was always doing that sort of thing  there was another tap then as he had anticipated the door opened sam crouched like a hare in its form held his breath it seemed to him that he was going to bring this delicate operation off with success he felt he had acted just as napoleon would have done in a similar crisis and so no doubt he had to a certain extent only napoleon would have seen to it that his boots and about eighteen inches of trousered legs were not sticking out plainly visible to all who entered  good morning said a voice  sam thrilled from the top of his head to the soles of his feet it was the voice which had been ringing in his ears through all his waking hours  are you busy mr marlowe asked billie addressing the boots  sam wriggled out from under the desk like a disconcerted tortoise  dropped my pen he mumbled as he rose to the surface  he pulled himself together with an effort that was like a physical exercise he stared at billie dumbly then recovering speech he invited her to sit down and seated himself at the desk  dropped my pen he gurgled again  yes said billie  fountainpen babbled sam with a broad nib  yes  a broad gold nib went on sam with the painful exactitude which comes only from embarrassment or the early stages of intoxication  really said billie and sam blinked and told himself resolutely that this would not do he was not appearing to advantage it suddenly occurred to him that his hair was standing on end as the result of his struggle with widgery he smoothed it down hastily and felt a trifle more composed the old fighting spirit of the marlowes now began to assert itself to some extent he must make an effort to appear as little of a fool as possible in this girls eyes and what eyes they were golly like stars like two bright planets in  however that was neither here nor there he pulled down his waistcoat and became cold and businesslikethe dry young lawyer  erhow do you do miss bennett he said with a question in his voice raising his eyebrows in a professional way he modelled this performance on that of lawyers he had seen on the stage and wished he had some snuff to take or something to tap against his front teeth miss bennett i believe  the effect of the question upon billie was disastrous she had come to this office with beating heart prepared to end all misunderstandings to sob on her soulmates shoulder and generally make everything up but at this inane exhibition the fighting spirit of the bennettswhich was fully as militant as that of the marlowesbecame roused she told herself that she had been mistaken in supposing that she still loved this man she was a proud girl and refused to admit herself capable of loving any man who looked at her as if she was something that the cat had brought in she drew herself up stiffly  yes she replied how clever of you to remember me  i have a good memory  how nice so have i  there was a pause during which billie allowed her gaze to travel casually about the room sam occupied the intermission by staring furtively at her profile he was by now in a thoroughly overwrought condition and the thumping of his heart sounded to him as if workmen were mending the street outside how beautiful she looked with that red hair peeping out beneath her hat and however  is there anything i can do for you he asked in the sort of voice widgery might have used sam always pictured widgery as a small man with bushy eyebrows a thin face and a voice like a rusty file  well i really wanted to see sir mallaby  my father has been called away on important business to walton heath cannot i act as his substitute  do you know anything about the law  do i know anything about the law echoed sam amazed do i know why i was reading my widgery on nisi prius evidence when you came in  oh were you said billie interested do you always read on the floor  i told you i dropped my pen said sam coldly  and of course you couldnt read without that well as a matter of fact this has nothing to do with nisiwhat you said  i have not specialised exclusively on nisi prius evidence i know the law in all its branches  then what would you do if a man insisted on playing the orchestrion when you wanted to get to sleep  the orchestrion  yes  the orchestrion eh ah hm said sam  you still havent made it quite clear said billie  i was thinking  oh if you want to think  tell me the facts said sam  well mr mortimer and my father have taken a house together in the country  i knew that  what a memory you have said billie kindly well for some reason or other they have quarrelled and now mr mortimer is doing everything he can to make father uncomfortable yesterday afternoon father wanted to sleep and mr mortimer started this orchestrion just to annoy him  i thinkim not quite surei think thats a tort said sam  a what  either a tort or a malfeasance  why you do know something about it after all cried billie startled into a sort of friendliness in spite of herself and at the words and the sight of her quick smile sams professional composure reeled on its foundations he had half risen with the purpose of springing up and babbling of the passion that consumed him when the chill reflection came to him that this girl had once said that she considered him ridiculous if he let himself go would she not continue to think him ridiculous he sagged back into his seat and at that moment there came another tap on the door which opening revealed the sinister face of the holidaymaking peters  good morning mr samuel said jno peters good morning miss milliken oh  he vanished as abruptly as he had appeared he perceived that what he had taken at first glance for the stenographer was a client and that the junior partner was engaged on a business conference he left behind him a momentary silence  what a horriblelooking man said billie breaking it with a little gasp jno peters often affected the opposite sex like that at first sight  i beg your pardon said sam absently  what a dreadfullooking man he quite frightened me  for some moments sam sat without speaking if this had not been one of his napoleonic mornings no doubt the sudden arrival of his old friend mr peters whom he had imagined at his home in putney packing for his trip to america would have suggested nothing to him as it was it suggested a great deal he had had a brainwave and for fully a minute he sat tingling under its impact he was not a young man who often had brainwaves and when they came they made him rather dizzy  who is he asked billie he seemed to know you and who she demanded after a slight pause is miss milliken  sam drew a deep breath  its rather a sad story he said his name is john peters he used to be clerk here  but he isnt any longer  no sam shook his head we had to get rid of him  i dont wonder a man looking like that  it wasnt that so much said sam the thing that annoyed father was that he tried to shoot miss milliken  billie uttered a cry of horror  he tried to shoot miss milliken  he did shoot herthe third time said sam warming to his work only in the arm fortunately he added but my father is rather a stern disciplinarian and he had to go i mean we couldnt keep him after that  good gracious  she used to be my fathers stenographer and she was thrown a good deal with peters it was quite natural that he should fall in love with her she was a beautiful girl with rather your own shade of hair peters is a man of volcanic passions and when after she had given him to understand that his love was returned she informed him one day that she was engaged to a fellow at ealing west he went right off his onioni mean he became completely distraught i must say that he concealed it very effectively at first we had no inkling of his condition till he came in with the pistol and after that  well as i say we had to dismiss him a great pity for he was a good clerk still it wouldnt do it wasnt only that he tried to shoot miss milliken the thing became an obsession with him and we found that he had a fixed idea that every redhaired woman who came into the office was the girl who had deceived him you can see how awkward that made it red hair is so fashionable nowadays  my hair is red whispered billie pallidly  yes i noticed it myself i told you it was much the same shade as miss millikens its rather fortunate that i happened to be here with you when he came  but he may be lurking out there still  i expect he is said sam carelessly yes i suppose he is would you like me to go and send him away all right  butbut is it safe  sam uttered a light laugh  i dont mind taking a risk or two for your sake he said and sauntered from the room closing the door behind him billie followed him with worshipping eyes  jno peters rose politely from the chair in which he had seated himself for the more comfortable perusal of the copy of home whispers which he had brought with him to refresh his mind in the event of the firm being too busy to see him immediately he was particularly interested in the series of chats with young mothers  hullo peters said sam want anything  very sorry to have disturbed you mr samuel i just looked in to say goodbye i sail on saturday and my time will be pretty fully taken up all the week i have to go down to the country to get some final instructions from the client whose important papers i am taking over im sorry to have missed your father mr samuel  yes this is his golf day ill tell him you looked in  is there anything i can do before i go  do  welljno peters coughed tactfullyi see that you are engaged with a client mr samuel and i was wondering if any little point of law had arisen with which you did not feel yourself quite capable of coping in which case i might perhaps be of assistance  oh that lady said sam that was miss millikens sister  indeed i didnt know miss milliken had a sister  no said sam  she is not very like her in appearance  no this one is the beauty of the family i believe a very bright intelligent girl i was telling her about your revolver just before you came in and she was most interested its a pity you havent got it with you now to show to her  oh but i have it i have mr samuel said peters opening a small handbag and taking out a hymnbook half a pound of mixed chocolates a tongue sandwich and the pistol in the order named i was on my way to the rupert street range for a little practice i should be glad to show it to her  well wait here a minute or two said sam ill have finished talking business in a moment  he returned to the inner office  well cried billie  eh oh hes gone said sam i persuaded him to go away he was a little excited poor fellow and now let us return to what we were talking about you say he broke off with an exclamation and glanced at his watch good heavens i had no idea of the time i promised to run up and see a man in one of the offices in the next court he wants to consult me on some difficulty which has arisen with one of his clients rightly or wrongly he values my advice can you spare me for a short while i shant be more than ten minutes  certainly  here is something you may care to look at while im gone i dont know if you have read it widgery on nisi prius evidence most interesting  he went out jno peters looked up from his home whispers  you can go in now said sam  certainly mr samuel certainly  sam took up the copy of home whispers and sat down with his feet on the desk he turned to the serial story and began to read the synopsis  in the inner room billie who had rejected the mental refreshment offered by widgery and was engaged on making a tour of the office looking at the portraits of whiskered men whom she took correctly to be the thorpes prescotts winslows and applebys mentioned on the contentsbill outside was surprised to hear the door open at her back she had not expected sam to return so instantaneously  nor had he done so it was not sam who entered it was a man of repellent aspect whom she recognised instantly for jno peters was one of those men who once seen are not easily forgotten he was smiling a cruel cunning smileat least she thought he was mr peters himself was under the impression that his face was wreathed in a benevolent simper and in his hand he bore the largest pistol ever seen outside a motionpicture studio  how do you do miss milliken he said     chapter xiii  shocks all round   billie had been standing near the wall inspecting a portrait of the late mr josiah appleby of which the kindest thing one can say is that one hopes it did not do him justice she now shrank back against this wall as if she were trying to get through it the edge of the portraits frame tilted her hat out of the straight but in this supreme moment she did not even notice it  erhow do you do she said  if she had not been an exceedingly pretty girl one would have said that she spoke squeakily the fighting spirit of the bennetts though it was considerable fighting spirit had not risen to this emergency it had ebbed out of her leaving in its place a cold panic she had seen this sort of thing in the moviesthere was one series of pictures the dangers of diana where something of the kind had happened to the heroine in every reelbut she had not anticipated that it would ever happen to her and consequently she had not thought out any plan for coping with such a situation a grave error in this world one should be prepared for everything or where is one  ive brought the revolver said mr peters  soso i see said billie  mr peters nursed the weapon affectionately in his hand he was rather a shy man with women as a rule but what sam had told him about her being interested in his revolver had made his heart warm to this girl  i was just on my way to have a little practice at the range he said then i thought i might as well look in here  i supposei suppose youre a good shot quavered billie  i seldom miss said jno peters  billie shuddered then reflecting that the longer she engaged this maniac in conversation the more hope there was of sam coming back in time to save her she essayed further smalltalk  itsits very ugly  oh no said mr peters hurt  billie perceived that she had said the wrong thing  very deadlylooking i meant she corrected herself hastily  it may have deadly work to do miss milliken said mr peters  conversation languished again billie had no further remarks to make of immediate interest and mr peters was struggling with a return of the deplorable shyness which so handicapped him in his dealings with the other sex after a few moments he pulled himself together again and as his first act was to replace the pistol in the pocket of his coat billie became conscious of a faint stirring of relief  the great thing said jno peters is to learn to draw quickly like this he added producing the revolver with something of the smoothness and rapidity with which billie in happier moments had seen bream mortimer take a bowl of gold fish out of a tall hat everything depends on getting the first shot the first shot miss milliken is vital  suddenly billie had an inspiration it was hopeless she knew to try to convince this poor demented creature obsessed with his idée fixe that she was not miss milliken denial would be a waste of time and might even infuriate him into precipitating the tragedy it was imperative that she should humour him and while she was humouring him it suddenly occurred to her why not do it thoroughly  mr peters she cried you are quite mistaken  i beg your pardon said jno peters with not a little asperity nothing of the kind  you are  i assure you i am not quickness in the draw is essential  you have been misinformed  well i had it direct from the man at the rupert street range said mr peters stiffly and if you have ever seen a picture called twogun thomas  mr peters cried billie desperately he was making her head swim with his meaningless ravings mr peters hear me i am not married to a man at ealing west  mr peters betrayed no excitement at the information this girl seemed for some reason to consider her situation an extraordinary one but many women he was aware were in a similar position in fact he could not at the moment think of any of his feminine acquaintances who were married to men at ealing west  indeed he said politely  wont you believe me exclaimed billie wildly  why certainly certainly said jno peters  thank god said billie im not even engaged its all been a terrible mistake  when two people in a small room are speaking on two distinct and different subjects and neither knows what on earth the other is driving at there is bound to be a certain amount of mental confusion but at this point jno peters though still not wholly equal to the intellectual pressure of the conversation began to see a faint shimmer of light behind the clouds in a nebulous kind of way he began to understand that the girl had come to consult the firm about a breachofpromise action some unknown man at ealing west had been trifling with her hearthardened lawyers clerk as he was that poignant cry im not even engaged had touched mr petersand she wished to start proceedings mr peters felt almost in his depth again he put the revolver in his pocket and drew out a notebook  i should be glad to hear the facts he said with professional courtesy in the absence of the guvnor  i have told you the facts  this man at ealing west said mr peters moistening the point of his pencil he wrote you letters proposing marriage  no no no  at any rate said mr peters disappointed but hopeful he made love to you before witnesses  never never there is no man at ealing west there never was a man at ealing west  it was at this point that jno peters began for the first time to entertain serious doubts of the girls mental balance the most elementary acquaintance with the latest census told him that there were any number of men at ealing west the place was full of them would a sane woman have made an assertion to the contrary he thought not and he was glad that he had the revolver with him she had done nothing as yet actively violent but it was nice to feel prepared he took it out and laid it nonchalantly in his lap  the sight of the weapon acted on billie electrically she flung out her hands in a gesture of passionate appeal and played her last card  i love you she cried she wished she could have remembered his first name it would have rounded off the sentence neatly in such a moment she could hardly call him mr peters you are the only man i love  my gracious goodness ejaculated mr peters and nearly fell over backwards to a naturally shy man this sudden and wholly unexpected declaration was disconcerting and the clerk was moreover engaged he blushed violently and yet even in that moment of consternation he could not check a certain thrill no man thinks he is as plain as he really is but jno peters had always come fairly near to a correct estimate of his charms and it had always seemed to him that in inducing his fiancée to accept him he had gone some he now began to wonder if he were not really rather a devil of a chap after all there must be precious few men going about capable of inspiring devotion like this on the strength of about six and a half minutes casual conversation  calmer thoughts succeeded this little flicker of complacency the girl was mad that was the fact of the matter he got up and began to edge towards the door mr samuel would be returning shortly and he ought to be warned  so thats all right isnt it said billie  oh quite quite said mr peters erthank you very much  i thought you would be pleased said billie relieved but puzzled for a man of volcanic passions as sam marlowe had described him he seemed to be taking the thing very calmly she had anticipated a strenuous scene  oh its a great compliment mr peters assured her  at this point sam came in interrupting the conversation at a moment when it had reached a somewhat difficult stage he had finished the instalment of the serial story in home whispers and looking at his watch he fancied that he had allowed sufficient time to elapse for events to have matured along the lines which his imagination had indicated  the atmosphere of the room seemed to him as he entered a little strained billie looked pale and agitated mr peters looked rather agitated too sam caught billies eye it had an unspoken appeal in it he gave an imperceptible nod a reassuring nod the nod of a man who understood all and was prepared to handle the situation  come peters he said in a deep firm quiet voice laying a hand on the clerks arm its time that you went  yes indeed mr samuel yes yes indeed  ill see you out said sam soothingly and led him through the outer office and on to the landing outside well good luck peters he said as they stood at the head of the stairs i hope you have a pleasant trip why whats the matter you seem upset  that girl mr samuel i really thinkreally she cannot be quite right in her head  nonsense nonsense said sam firmly shes all right well goodbye  goodbye mr samuel  when did you say you were sailing  next saturday mr samuel but i fear i shall have no opportunity of seeing you again before then i have packing to do and i have to see this gentleman down in the country  all right then well say goodbye now goodbye peters mind you have a good time in america ill tell my father you called  sam watched him out of sight down the stairs then turned and made his way back to the inner office billie was sitting limply on the chair which jno peters had occupied she sprang to her feet  has he really gone  yes hes gone this time  was hewas he violent  a little said sam a little but i calmed him down he looked at her gravely thank god i was in time  oh you are the bravest man in the world cried billie and burying her face in her hands burst into tears  there there said sam there there come come its all right now there there there  he knelt down beside her he slipped one arm round her waist he patted her hands  there there there he said  i have tried to draw samuel marlowe so that he will live on the printed page i have endeavoured to delineate his character so that it will be as an open book and if i have succeeded in my task the reader will by now have become aware that he was a young man with the gall of an army mule his conscience if he had ever had one had become atrophied through long disuse he had given this sensitive girl the worst fright she had had since a mouse had got into her bedroom at school he had caused jno peters to totter off to the rupert street range making low bleating noises and did he care no all he cared about was the fact that he had erased for ever from billies mind that undignified picture of himself as he had appeared on the boat and substituted another which showed him brave resourceful gallant all he cared about was the fact that billie so cold ten minutes before had just allowed him to kiss her for the fortysecond time if you had asked him he would have said that he had acted for the best and that out of evil cometh good or some sickening thing like that that was the sort of man samuel marlowe was  his face was very close to billies who had cheered up wonderfully by this time and he was whispering his degraded words of endearment into her ear when there was a sort of explosion in the doorway  great godfrey exclaimed mr rufus bennett gazing on the scene from this point of vantage and mopping with a large handkerchief a scarlet face which as the result of climbing three flights of stairs had become slightly soluble great heavens above number four     chapter xiv  strong remarks by a father   mr bennett advanced shakily into the room and supported himself with one hand on the desk while with the other he still plied the handkerchief on his overheated face much had occurred to disturb him this morning on top of a broken night he had had an affecting reconciliation scene with mr mortimer at the conclusion of which he had decided to take the first train to london in the hope of intercepting billie before she reached sir mallabys office on her mission of war the local trainservice kept such indecently early hours that he had been compelled to bolt his breakfast and in the absence of billie the only member of the household who knew how to drive the car to walk to the station a distance of nearly two miles the last hundred yards of which he had covered at a rapid gallop under the erroneous impression that an express whose smoke he had seen in the distance was the train he had come to catch arrived on the platform he had had a trying wait followed by a slow journey to waterloo the cab which he had taken at waterloo had kept him in a lively state of apprehension all the way to the savoy owing to an apparent desire to climb over motoromnibuses when it could not get round them at the savoy he found that billie had already left which had involved another voyage through the london traffic under the auspices of a driver who appeared to be either blind or desirous of committing suicide he had three flights of stairs to negotiate and finally arriving at the office he had found his daughter in the circumstances already described  why father said billie i didnt expect you  as an explanation of her behaviour this might no doubt have been considered sufficient but as an excuse for it mr bennett thought it inadequate and would have said so had he had enough breath this physical limitation caused him to remain speechless and to do the best he could in the way of stern fatherly reproof by puffing like a seal after a long dive in search of fish  having done this he became aware that sam marlowe was moving towards him with outstretched hand it took a lot to disconcert sam and he was the calmest person present he gave evidence of this in a neat speech he did not in so many words congratulate mr bennett on the piece of luck which had befallen him but he tried to make him understand by his manner that he was distinctly to be envied as the prospective fatherinlaw of such a one as himself  i am delighted to see you mr bennett said sam you could not have come at a more fortunate moment you see for yourself how things are there is no need for a long explanation you came to find a daughter mr bennett and you have found a son  and he would like to see the man thought sam who could have put it more cleverly and pleasantly and tactfully than that  what are you talking about said mr bennett recovering breath i havent got a son  i will be a son to you i will be the prop of your declining years  what the devil do you mean my declining years demanded mr bennett with asperity  he means when they do decline father dear said billie  of course of course said sam when they do decline not till then of course i wouldnt dream of it but once they do decline count on me and i should like to say for my part he went on handsomely what an honour i think it to become the soninlaw of a man like mr bennett bennett of new york he added spaciously not so much because he knew what he meant for he would have been the first to admit that he did not but because it sounded well  oh said mr bennett you do do you  mr bennett sat down he put away his handkerchief which had certainly earned a rest then he fastened a baleful stare upon his newlydiscovered son it was not the sort of look a proud and happy fatherinlawtobe ought to have directed at a prospective relative it was not as a matter of fact the sort of look which anyone ought to have directed at anybody except possibly an exceptionally prudish judge at a criminal in the dock convicted of a more than usually atrocious murder billie not being in the actual line of fire only caught the tail end of it but it was enough to create a misgiving  oh father you arent angry  angry  you cant be angry  why cant i be angry declared mr bennett with that sense of injury which comes to selfwilled men when their whims are thwarted why the devil shouldnt i be angry i am angry i come here and find you likelike this and you seem to expect me to throw my hat in the air and give three rousing cheers of course im angry you are engaged to be married to an excellent young man of the highest character one of the finest young men i have ever known  oh well said sam straightening his tie modestly its awfully good of you  but thats all over father  whats all over  you told me yourself that you had broken off my engagement to bream  welleryes i did said mr bennett a little taken aback that isto a certain extentso but he added with restored firmness its on again  but i dont want to marry bream  naturally said sam naturally quite out of the question in a few days well all be roaring with laughter at the very idea  it doesnt matter what you want a girl who gets engaged to a dozen men in three weeks  it wasnt a dozen  well fourfivesixyou cant expect me not to lose count i say a girl who does that does not know what she wants and older and more prudent heads must decide for her you are going to marry bream mortimer  all wrong all wrong said sam with a reproving shake of the head all wrong shes going to marry me  mr bennett scorched him with a look compared with which his earlier effort had been a loving glance  wilhelmina he said go into the outer office  but father sam saved my life  go into the outer office and wait for me there  there was a lunatic in here  there will be another if you dont go  he had a pistol  go into the outer office  i shall always love you sam said billie pausing mutinously at the door  i shall always love you said sam cordially  nobody can keep us apart  theyre wasting their time trying  youre the most wonderful man in the world  there never was another girl like you  get out bellowed mr bennett on whose equanimity this lovescene which i think beautiful was jarring profoundly now sir he said to sam as the door closed  yes lets talk it over calmly said sam  i will not talk it over calmly  oh come you can do it if you try in the first place whatever put this silly idea into your head about that sweet girl marrying bream mortimer  bream mortimer is the son of henry mortimer  i know said sam and while it is no doubt unfair to hold that against him its a point you cant afford to ignore henry mortimer you and i have henry mortimers number we know what henry mortimer is like a man who spends his time thinking up ways of annoying you you cant seriously want to have the mortimer family linked to you by marriage  henry mortimer is my oldest friend  that makes it all the worse fancy a man who calls himself your friend treating you like that  the misunderstanding to which you allude has been completely smoothed over my relations with mr mortimer are thoroughly cordial  well have it your own way personally i wouldnt trust a man like that and as for letting my daughter marry his son  i have decided once and for all  if youll take my advice you will break the thing off  i will not take your advice  i wouldnt expect to charge you for it explained sam reassuringly i give it you as a friend not as a lawyer sixandeightpence to others free to you  will you understand that my daughter is going to marry bream mortimer what are you giggling about  it sounds so silly the idea of anyone marrying bream mortimer i mean  let me tell you he is a thoroughly estimable young man  and there you put the whole thing in a nutshell your daughter is a girl of spirit she would hate to be tied for life to an estimable young man  she will do as i tell her  sam regarded him sternly  have you no regard for her happiness  i am the best judge of what is best for her  if you ask me said sam candidly i think youre a rotten judge  i did not come here to be insulted  i like that you have been insulting me ever since you arrived what right have you to say that im not fit to marry your daughter  i did not say that  youve implied it and youve been looking at me as if i were a leper or something the pure food committee had condemned why thats what i ask you said sam warming up this he fancied was the way widgery would have tackled a troublesome client why answer me that  i  sam rapped sharply on the desk  be careful sir be very careful he knew that this was what lawyers always said of course there is a difference in position between a miscreant whom you suspect of an attempt at perjury and the father of the girl you love whose consent to the match you wish to obtain but sam was in no mood for these nice distinctions he only knew that lawyers told people to be very careful so he told mr bennett to be very careful  what do you mean be very careful said mr bennett  im dashed if i know said sam frankly the question struck him as a mean attack he wondered how widgery would have met it probably by smiling quietly and polishing his spectacles sam had no spectacles he endeavoured however to smile quietly  dont laugh at me roared mr bennett  im not laughing at you  you are  im not im smiling quietly  well dont then said mr bennett he glowered at his young companion i dont know why im wasting my time talking to you the position is clear to the meanest intelligence i have no objection to you personally  come this is better said sam  i dont know you well enough to have any objection to you or any opinion of you at all this is only the second time i have ever met you in my life  mark you said sam i think i am one of those fellows who grow on people  as far as i am concerned you simply do not exist you may be the noblest character in london or you may be wanted by the police i dont know and i dont care it doesnt matter to me you mean nothing in my life i dont know you  you must persevere said sam you must buckle to and get to know me dont give the thing up in this halfhearted way everything has to have a beginning stick to it and in a week or two you will find yourself knowing me quite well  i dont want to know you  you say that now but wait  and thank goodness i have not got to exploded mr bennett ceasing to be calm and reasonable with a suddenness which affected sam much as though half a pound of gunpowder had been touched off under his chair for the little i have seen of you has been quite enough kindly understand that my daughter is engaged to be married to another man and that i do not wish to see or hear anything of you again i shall try to forget your very existence and i shall see to it that wilhelmina does the same youre an impudent scoundrel sir an impudent scoundrel i dont like you i dont wish to see you again if you were the last man in the world i wouldnt allow my daughter to marry you if that is quite clear i will wish you good morning  mr bennett thundered out of the room and sam temporarily stunned by the outburst remained where he was gaping a few minutes later life began to return to his palsied limbs it occurred to him that mr bennett had forgotten to kiss him goodbye and he went into the outer office to tell him so but the outer office was empty sam stood for a moment in thought then he returned to the inner office and picking up a timetable began to look out trains to the village of windlehurst in hampshire the nearest station to his aunt adelines charming oldworld house windles     chapter xv  drama at a country house   as i read over the last few chapters of this narrative i see that i have been giving the reader rather too jumpy a time to almost a painful degree i have excited his pity and terror and though that is what aristotle says one ought to do i feel that a little respite would not be out of order the reader can stand having his emotions tortured up to a certain point after that he wants to take it easy for a bit it is with pleasure therefore that i turn now to depict a quiet peaceful scene in domestic life it wont last longthree minutes perhaps by a good stopwatchbut that is not my fault my task is to record facts as they happened  the morning sunlight fell pleasantly on the garden of windles turning it into the green and amber paradise which nature had intended it to be a number of the local birds sang melodiously in the undergrowth at the end of the lawn while others more energetic hopped about the grass in quest of worms bees mercifully ignorant that after they had worked themselves to the bone gathering honey the proceeds of their labour would be collared and consumed by idle humans buzzed industriously to and fro and dived head foremost into flowers winged insects danced sarabands in the sunshine in a deckchair under the cedartree billie bennett with a sketchingblock on her knee was engaged in drawing a picture of the ruined castle beside her curled up in a ball lay her pekinese dog pinkyboodles beside pinkyboodles slept smith the bulldog in the distant stableyard unseen but audible a boy in shirtsleeves was washing the car and singing as much as a treacherous memory would permit of a popular sentimental ballad  you may think that was all you may suppose that nothing could be added to deepen the atmosphere of peace and content not so at this moment mr bennett emerged from the french windows of the drawingroom clad in white flannels and buckskin shoes supplying just the finishing touch that was needed  mr bennett crossed the lawn and sat down beside his daughter smith the bulldog raising a sleepy head breathed heavily but mr bennett did not quail since their last unfortunate meeting relations of distant but solid friendship had come to exist between pursuer and pursued sceptical at first mr bennett had at length allowed himself to be persuaded of the mildness of the animals nature and the essential purity of his motives and now it was only when they encountered each other unexpectedly round sharp corners that he ever betrayed the slightest alarm so now while smith slept on the grass mr bennett reclined in the chair it was the nearest thing modern civilisation has seen to the lion lying down with the lamb  sketching said mr bennett  yes said billie for there were no secrets between this girl and her father at least not many she occasionally omitted to tell him some such trifle as that she had met samuel marlowe on the previous morning in a leafy lane and intended to meet him again this afternoon but apart from that her mind was an open book  its a great morning said mr bennett  so peaceful said billie  the eggs you get in the country in england said mr bennett suddenly striking a lyrical note are extraordinary i had three for breakfast this morning which defied competition simply defied competition they were large and brown and as fresh as newmown hay  he mused for a while in a sort of ecstasy  and the hams he went on the ham i had for breakfast was what i call ham i dont know when ive had ham like that i suppose its something they feed the pigs on he concluded in soft meditation and he gave a little sigh life was very beautiful  silence fell broken only by the snoring of smith billie was thinking of sam and of what sam had said to her in the lane yesterday of his cleancut face and the look in his eyesso vastly superior to any look that ever came into the eyes of bream mortimer she was telling herself that her relations with sam were an idyll for being young and romantic she enjoyed this freshet of surreptitious meetings which had come to enliven the stream of her life it was pleasant to go warily into deep lanes where forbidden love lurked she cast a swift sideglance at her fatherthe unconscious ogre in her fairystory what would he say if he knew but mr bennett did not know and consequently continued to meditate peacefully on ham  they had sat like this for perhaps a minutetwo happy mortals lulled by the gentle beauty of the daywhen from the window of the drawingroom there stepped out a whitecapped maid and one may just as well say at onceand have done with itthat this is the point where the quiet peaceful scene in domestic life terminates with a jerk and pity and terror resume work at the old stand  the maidher name not that it matters was susan and she was engaged to be married though the point is of no importance to the second assistant at greens grocery stores in windlehurstapproached mr bennett  please sir a gentleman to see you  eh said mr bennett torn from a dream of large pink slices edged with breadcrumbed fat  a gentleman to see you sir in the drawingroom he says you are expecting him  of course yes to be sure  mr bennett heaved himself out of the deckchair beyond the french windows he could see an indistinct form in a grey suit and remembered that this was the morning on which sir mallaby marlowes clerkwho was taking those schultz and bowen papers for him to americahad written that he would call today was friday no doubt the man was sailing from southampton tomorrow  he crossed the lawn entered the drawingroom and found mr jno peters with an expression on his illfavoured face which looked like one of consternation of uneasiness even of alarm  morning mr peters said mr bennett very good of you to run down take a seat and ill just go through the few notes i have made about the matter  mr bennett exclaimed jno peters maymay i speak  what do you mean eh what something to say what is it  mr peters cleared his throat awkwardly he was feeling embarrassed at the unpleasantness of the duty which he had to perform but it was a duty and he did not intend to shrink from performing it ever since gazing appreciatively through the drawingroom windows at the charming scene outside he had caught sight of the unforgettable form of billie seated in her chair with the sketchingblock on her knee he had realised that he could not go away in silence leaving mr bennett ignorant of what he was up against  one almost inclines to fancy that there must have been a curse of some kind on this house of windles certainly everybody who entered it seemed to leave his peace of mind behind him jno peters had been feeling notably happy during his journey in the train from london and the subsequent walk from the station the splendour of the morning had soothed his nerves and the faint wind that blew inshore from the sea spoke to him hearteningly of adventure and romance there was a jar of potpourri on the drawingroom table and he had derived considerable pleasure from sniffing at it in short jno peters was in the pink without a care in the world until he had looked out of the window and seen billie  mr bennett he said i dont want to do anybody any harm and if you know all about it and she suits you well and good but i think it is my duty to inform you that your stenographer is not quite right in her head i dont say shes dangerous but she isnt compos she decidedly is not compos mr bennett  mr bennett stared at his wellwisher dumbly for a moment the thought crossed his mind that if ever there was a case of the pot calling the kettle black this was it his opinion of jno peters sanity went down to zero  what are you talking about my stenographer what stenographer  it occurred to mr peters that a man of the others wealth and business connections might well have a troupe of these useful females he particularised  i mean the young lady out in the garden there to whom you were dictating just now the young lady with the writingpad on her knee  what what mr bennett spluttered do you know who that is he exclaimed  oh yes indeed said jno peters i have only met her once when she came into our office to see mr samuel but her personality and appearance stamped themselves so forcibly on my mind that i know i am not mistaken i am sure it is my duty to tell you exactly what happened when i was left alone with her in the office we had hardly exchanged a dozen words mr bennett whenhere jno peters modest to the core turned vividly pinkwhen she told meshe told me that i was the only man she loved  mr bennett uttered a loud cry  sweet spirits of nitre what  those were her exact words  five ejaculated mr bennett in a strangled voice by the great horn spoon number five  mr peters could make nothing of this exclamation and he was deterred from seeking light by the sudden action of his host who bounding from his seat with a vivacity of which one would not have believed him capable charged to the french window and emitted a bellow  wilhelmina  billie looked up from her sketchingblock with a start it seemed to her that there was a note of anguish of panic in that voice what her father could have found in the drawingroom to be frightened at she did not know but she dropped her block and hurried to his assistance  what is it father  mr bennett had retired within the room when she arrived and going in after him she perceived at once what had caused his alarm there before her looking more sinister than ever stood the lunatic peters and there was an ominous bulge in his right coatpocket which to her excited senses betrayed the presence of the revolver what jno peters was as a matter of fact carrying in his right coatpocket was a bag of mixed chocolates which he had purchased in windlehurst but billies eyes though bright had no xray quality her simple creed was that if jno peters bulged at any point that bulge must be caused by a pistol she screamed and backed against the wall her whole acquaintance with jno peters had been one constant backing against walls  dont shoot she cried as mr peters absentmindedly dipped his hand into the pocket of his coat oh please dont shoot  what the deuce do you mean said mr bennett irritably wilhelmina this man says that you told him you loved him  yes i did and i do really really mr peters i do  suffering cats  mr bennett clutched at the back of his chair  but youve only met him once he added almost pleadingly  you dont understand father dear said billie desperately ill explain the whole thing later when  father ejaculated jno peters feebly did you say father  of course i said father  this is my daughter mr peters  my daughter i mean your daughter areare you sure  of course im sure do you think i dont know my own daughter  but she called me mr peters  well its your name isnt it  but if sheif this young lady is your daughter how did she know my name  the point seemed to strike mr bennett he turned to billie  thats true tell me wilhelmina when did you and mr peters meet  why inin sir mallaby marlowes office the morning you came there and found me when i was talking to sam  mr peters uttered a subdued gargling sound he was finding this scene oppressive to a not very robust intellect  hemr samueltold me your name was miss milliken he said dully  billie stared at him  mr marlowe told you my name was miss milliken she repeated  he told me that you were the sister of the miss milliken who acts as stenographer for the guvfor sir mallaby and sent me in to show you my revolver because he said you were interested and wanted to see it  billie uttered an exclamation so did mr bennett who hated mysteries  what revolver which revolver whats all this about a revolver have you a revolver  why yes mr bennett it is packed now in my trunk but usually i carry it about with me everywhere in order to take a little practice at the rupert street range i bought it when sir mallaby told me he was sending me to america because i thought i ought to be preparedbecause of the underworld you know  a cold gleam had come into billies eyes her face was pale and hard if sam marloweat that moment carolling blithely in his bedroom at the blue boar in windlehurst washing his hands preparatory to descending to the coffeeroom for a bit of cold lunchcould have seen her the song would have frozen on his lips which one might mention as showing that there is always a bright side would have been much appreciated by the travelling gentleman in the adjoining room who had had a wild night with some other travelling gentlemen and was then nursing a rather severe headache separated from sams penetrating baritone only by the thickness of a wooden wall  billie knew all and terrible though the fact is as an indictment of the male sex when a woman knows all there is invariably trouble ahead for some man there was trouble ahead for samuel marlowe billie now in possession of the facts had examined them and come to the conclusion that sam had played a practical joke on her and she was a girl who strongly disapproved of practical humour at her expense  that morning i met you at sir mallabys office mr peters she said in a frosty voice mr marlowe had just finished telling me a long and convincing story to the effect that you were madly in love with a miss milliken who had jilted you and that this had driven you off your head and that you spent your time going about with a pistol trying to shoot every redhaired woman you saw because you thought they were miss milliken naturally when you came in and called me miss milliken and brandished a revolver i was very frightened i thought it would be useless to tell you that i wasnt miss milliken so i tried to persuade you that i was and hadnt jilted you after all  good gracious said mr peters vastly relieved and yetfor always there is bitter mixed with the sweeta shade disappointed theneryou dont love me after all  no said billie i am engaged to bream mortimer and i love him and nobody else in the world  the last portion of her observation was intended for the consumption of mr bennett rather than that of mr peters and he consumed it joyfully he folded billie in his ample embrace  i always thought you had a grain of sense hidden away somewhere he said paying her a striking tribute i hope now that weve heard the last of all this foolishness about that young hound marlowe  you certainly have i dont want ever to see him again i hate him  you couldnt do better my dear said mr bennett approvingly and now run away mr peters and i have some business to discuss  a quarter of an hour later webster the valet sunning himself in the stableyard was aware of the daughter of his employer approaching him  webster said billie she was still pale her face was still hard and her eyes still gleamed coldly  miss said webster politely throwing away the cigarette with which he had been refreshing himself  will you do something for me  i should be more than delighted miss  billie whisked into view an envelope which had been concealed in the recesses of her dress  do you know the country about here well webster  within a certain radius not unintimately miss i have been for several enjoyable rambles since the fine weather set in  do you know the place where there is a road leading to havant and another to cosham its about a mile down  i know the spot well miss  well straight in front of you when you get to the signpost there is a little lane  i know it miss said webster with a faint smile twice had he escorted miss trimblett billies maid thither a delightfully romantic spot what with the overhanging trees the wealth of blackberry bushes the varied wildflowers  yes never mind about the wildflowers now i want you after lunch to take this note to a gentleman you will find sitting on the gate at the bottom of the lane  sitting on the gate miss yes miss  or leaning against it you cant mistake him he is rather tall and  oh well there isnt likely to be anybody else there so you cant make a mistake give him this will you  certainly miss erany message  any what  any verbal message miss  no certainly not you wont forget will you webster  on no account whatever miss shall i wait for an answer  there wont be any answer said billie setting her teeth for an instant oh webster  miss  i can rely on you to say nothing to anybody  most undoubtedly miss most undoubtedly  does anybody know anything about a feller named s marlowe inquired webster entering the kitchen dont all speak at once s marlowe ever heard of him  he paused for a reply but nobody had any information to impart  because theres something jolly well up our miss b is sending me with notes for him to the bottom of lanes  and her engaged to young mr mortimer said the scullerymaid shocked the way they go on chronic said the scullerymaid  dont you go getting alarmed and dont you added webster go shoving your oar in when your social superiors are talking ive had to speak to you about that before my remarks were addressed to mrs withers here  he indicated the cook with a respectful gesture  yes heres the note mrs withers of course if you had a steamy kettle handy in about half a moment we could  but no perhaps its wiser not to risk it and come to that i dont need to unstick the envelope to know whats inside here its the raspberry maam or ive lost all my power to read the human female countenance very cold and proudlooking she was i dont know who this s marlowe is but i do know one thing in this hand i hold the instrument thats going to give it him in the neck proper right in the neck or my name isnt montagu webster  well said mrs withers comfortably pausing for a moment from her labours think of that  the way i look at it said webster is that theres been some sort of understanding between our miss b and this s marlowe and shes thought better of it and decided to stick to the man of her parents choice shes chosen wealth and made up her mind to hand the humble suitor the mitten there was a rather similar situation in cupid or mammon that nosegay novelette i was reading in the train coming down here only that ended different for my part id be better pleased if our miss b would let the cash go and obey the dictates of her own heart but these modern girls are all alike all out for the stuff they are oh well its none of my affair said webster stifling a not unmanly sigh for beneath that immaculate shirtfront there beat a warm heart montagu webster was a sentimentalist     chapter xvi  webster friend in need   at halfpast two that afternoon full of optimism and cold beef gaily unconscious that webster with measured strides was approaching ever nearer with the note that was to give it him in the neck proper samuel marlowe dangled his feet from the top bar of the gate at the end of the lane and smoked contentedly as he waited for billie to make her appearance he had had an excellent lunch his pipe was drawing well and all nature smiled the breeze from the sea across the meadows tickled pleasantly the back of his head and sang a soothing song in the long grass and raggedrobins at his feet he was looking forward with a roseate glow of anticipation to the moment when the white flutter of billies dress would break the green of the foreground how eagerly he would jump from the gate how lovingly he would  the elegant figure of webster interrupted his reverie sam had never seen webster before and it was with no pleasure that he saw him now he had come to regard this lane as his own private property and he resented trespassers he tucked his legs under him and scowled at webster under the brim of his hat  the valet advanced towards him with the air of an affable executioner stepping daintily to the block  mr marlowe sir he inquired politely  sam was startled he could making nothing of this  eh what  have i the pleasure of addressing mr s marlowe  yes thats my name  mine is webster sir i am mr bennetts personal gentlemans gentleman miss bennett entrusted me with this note to deliver to you sir  sam began to grasp the position for some reason or other the dear girl had been prevented from coming this afternoon and she had written to explain and relieve his anxiety it was like her it was just the sweet thoughtful thing he would have expected her to do his contentment with the existing scheme of things returned the sun shone out again and he found himself amiably disposed towards the messenger  fine day he said as he took the note  extremely sir said webster outwardly unemotional inwardly full of a grave pity  it was plain to him that there had been no previous little rift to prepare the young man for the cervical operation which awaited him and he edged a little nearer in order to be handy to catch sam if the shock knocked him off the gate  as it happened it did not having read the opening words of the note sam rocked violently but his feet were twined about the lower bars and this saved him from overbalancing webster stepped back relieved  the note fluttered to the ground webster picking it up and handing it back was enabled to get a glimpse of the first two sentences they confirmed his suspicions the note was hot stuff assuming that it continued as it began it was about the warmest thing of its kind that pen had ever written webster had received one or two heated epistles from the sex in his timeyour man of gallantry can hardly hope to escape these unpleasantnessesbut none had got off the mark quite so swiftly and with quite so much frigid violence as this  thanks said sam mechanically  not at all sir you are very welcome  sam resumed his reading a cold perspiration broke out on his forehead his toes curled and something seemed to be crawling down the small of his back his heart had moved from its proper place and was now beating in his throat he swallowed once or twice to remove the obstruction but without success a kind of pall had descended on the landscape blotting out the sun  of all the rotten sensations in this world the worst is the realisation that a thousandtoone chance has come off and caused our wrongdoing to be detected there had seemed no possibility of that little ruse of his being discovered and yet here was billie in full possession of the facts it almost made the thing worse that she did not say how she had come into possession of them this gave sam that feeling of selfpity that sense of having been illused by fate which makes the bringing home of crime so particularly poignant  fine day he muttered he had a sort of subconscious feeling that it was imperative to keep engaging webster in light conversation  yes sir weather still keeps up agreed the valet suavely  sam frowned over the note he felt injured sending a fellow notes didnt give him a chance if she had come in person and denounced him it would not have been an agreeable experience but at least it would have been possible then to have pleaded and cajoled andand all that sort of thing but what could he do now it seemed to him that his only possible course was to write a note in reply begging her to see him he explored his pockets and found a pencil and a scrap of paper for some moments he scribbled desperately then he folded the note  will you take this to miss bennett he said holding it out  webster took the missive because he wanted to read it later at his leisure but he shook his head  useless i fear sir he said gravely  what do you mean  i am afraid it would effect little or nothing sir sending our miss b notes she is not in the proper frame of mind to appreciate them i saw her face when she handed me the letter you have just read and i assure you sir she is not in a malleable mood  you seem to know a lot about it  i have studied the sex sir said webster modestly  i mean about my business confound it you seem to know all about it  why yes sir i think i may say that i have grasped the position of affairs and if you will permit me to say so sir you have my respectful sympathy  dignity is a sensitive plant which nourishes only under the fairest conditions sams had perished in the bleak east wind of billies note in other circumstances he might have resented this intrusion of a stranger into his most intimate concerns his only emotion now was one of dull but distinct gratitude the four winds of heaven blew chilly upon his raw and unprotected soul and he wanted to wrap it up in a mantle of sympathy careless of the source from which he borrowed that mantle if webster felt disposed as he seemed to indicate to comfort him let the thing go on at that moment sam would have accepted condolences from a coalheaver  i was reading a storyone of the nosegay novelettes i do not know if you are familiar with the series sirin which much the same situation occurred it was entitled cupid or mammon the heroine lady blanche trefusis forced by her parents to wed a wealthy suitor despatches a note to her humble lover informing him it cannot be i believe it often happens like that sir  youre all wrong said sam its not that at all  indeed sir i supposed it was  nothing like it ii  sams dignity on its deathbed made a last effort to assert itself  i dont know what its got to do with you  precisely sir said webster with dignity just as you say good afternoon sir  he swayed gracefully conveying a suggestion of departure without moving his feet the action was enough for sam dignity gave an expiring gurgle and passed away regretted by all  dont go he cried  the idea of being left alone in this infernal lane without human support overpowered him moreover webster had personality he exuded it already sam had begun to cling to him in spirit and rely on his support  dont go  certainly not if you do not wish it sir  webster coughed gently to show his appreciation of the delicate nature of the conversation he was consumed with curiosity and his threatened departure had been but a pretence a team of horses could not have moved webster at that moment  might i ask then what  theres been a misunderstanding said sam at least there was but now there isnt if you see what i mean  i fear i have not quite grasped your meaning sir  well iiplayed a sort ofyou might almost call it a sort of trick on miss bennett with the best motives of course  of course sir  and shes found out i dont know how shes found out but she has so there you are  of what nature would the trick be sir a species of ruse sirsome kind of innocent deception  well it was like this  it was a complicated story to tell and sam a prey to conflicting emotions told it badly but such was the almost superhuman intelligence of webster that he succeeded in grasping the salient points indeed he said that it reminded him of something of much the same kind in the nosegay novelette all for her where the hero anxious to win the esteem of the lady of his heart had bribed a tramp to simulate an attack upon her in a lonely road  the principles the same said webster  well what did he do when she found out  she did not find out sir all ended happily and never had the weddingbells in the old village church rung out a blither peal than they did at the subsequent union  sam was thoughtful  bribed a tramp to attack her did he  yes sir she had never thought much of him till that moment sir very cold and haughty she had been his social status being considerably inferior to her own but when she cried for help and he dashed out from behind a hedge well it made all the difference  i wonder where i could get a good tramp said sam meditatively  webster shook his head  i really would hardly recommend such a procedure sir  no it would be difficult to make a tramp understand what you wanted  sam brightened  ive got it you pretend to attack her and ill  i couldnt sir i couldnt really i should jeopardise my situation  oh come be a man  no sir i fear not theres a difference between handing in your resignationi was compelled to do that only recently owing to a few words i had with the guvnor though subsequently prevailed upon to withdraw iti say theres a difference between handing in your resignation and being given the sack and thats what would happenwithout a character whats more and lucky if it didnt mean a prison cell no sir i could not contemplate such a thing  then i dont see that theres anything to be done said sam morosely  oh i shouldnt say that sir said webster encouragingly its simply a matter of finding the way the problem confronting usyou i should say  us said sam most decidedly us  thank you very much sir i would not have presumed but if you say so the problem confronting us as i envisage it resolves itself into this you have offended our miss b and she has expressed a disinclination ever to see you again how then is it possible in spite of her attitude to recapture her esteem  exactly said sam  there are several methods which occur to one  they dont occur to me  well for example you might rescue her from a burning building as in true as steel  set fire to the house eh said sam reflectively yes there might be something in that  i would hardly advise such a thing said webster a little hastilyflattered at the readiness with which his disciple was taking his advice yet acutely alive to the fact that he slept at the top of the house himself a little drastic if i may say so it might be better to save her from drowning as in the earls secret  ah but where could she drown  well there is a lake in the grounds  excellent said sam terrific i knew i could rely on you say no more the whole things settled you take her out rowing on the lake and upset the boat i plunge in i suppose you can swim  no sir  oh well never mind youll manage somehow i expect cling to the upturned boat or something i shouldnt wonder theres always a way yes thats the plan when is the earliest you could arrange this  i fear such a course must be considered out of the question sir it really wouldnt do  i cant see a flaw in it  well in the first place it would certainly jeopardise my situation  oh hang your situation you talk as if you were prime minister or something you can easily get another situation a valuable man like you said sam ingratiatingly  no sir said webster firmly from boyhood up ive always had a regular horror of the water i cant so much as go paddling without an uneasy feeling  the image of webster paddling was arresting enough to occupy sams thoughts for a moment it was an inspiring picture and for an instant uplifted his spirits then they fell again  well i dont see what there is to be done he said gloomily its no good my making suggestions if you have some frivolous objection to all of them  my idea said webster would be something which did not involve my own personal and active cooperation sir if it is all the same to you i should prefer to limit my assistance to advice and sympathy i am anxious to help but i am a man of regular habits which i do not wish to disturb did you ever read footpaths of fate in the nosegay series sir ive only just remembered it and it contains the most helpful suggestion of the lot there had been a misunderstanding between the heroine and the herotheir names have slipped my mind though i fancy his was cyriland she had told him to hop it  to what  to leave her for ever sir and what do you think he did  how the deuce do i know  he kidnapped her little brother sir to whom she was devoted kept him hidden for a bit and then returned him and in her gratitude all was forgotten and forgiven and never  i know never had the bells of the old village church  rung out a blither peal exactly sir well there if you will allow me to say so you are sir you need seek no further for a plan of action  miss bennett hasnt got a little brother  no sir but she has a dog and is greatly attached to it  sam stared from the expression on his face it was evident that webster imagined himself to have made a suggestion of exceptional intelligence it struck sam as the silliest he had ever heard  you mean i ought to steal her dog  precisely sir  but good heavens have you seen that dog  the one to which i allude is a small brown animal with a fluffy tail  yes and a bark like a steamsiren and in addition to that about eightyfive teeth all sharper than razors i couldnt get within ten feet of that dog without its lifting the roof off and if i did it would chew me into small pieces  i had anticipated that difficulty sir in footpaths of fate there was a nurse who assisted the hero by drugging the child  by jove said sam impressed  he rewarded her said webster allowing his gaze to stray nonchalantly over the countryside liberally very liberally  if you mean that you expect me to reward you if you drug the dog said sam dont worry let me bring this thing off and you can have all ive got and my cufflinks as well come now this is really beginning to look like something speak to me more of this matter where do we go from here  i beg your pardon sir  i mean whats the next step in the scheme oh lord sams face fell the light of hope died out of his eyes its all off it cant be done how could i possibly get into the house i take it that the little brute sleeps in the house  that need constitute no obstacle sir no obstacle at all the animal sleeps in a basket in the hall perhaps you are familiar with the interior of the house sir  i havent been inside it since i was at school im mr hignetts cousin you know  indeed sir i wasnt aware mr hignett has the mumps poor gentleman  has he said sam not particularly interested i used to stay with him he went on during the holidays sometimes but ive practically forgotten what the place is like inside i remember the hall vaguely fireplace at one side one or two suits of armour standing about a sort of windowledge near the front door  precisely sir it is close beside that windowledge that the animals basket is situated if i administer a slight soporific  yes but you havent explained yet how i am to get into the house in the first place  quite easily sir i can admit you through the drawingroom windows while dinner is in progress  fine  you can then secrete yourself in the cupboard in the drawingroom perhaps you recollect the cupboard to which i refer sir  no i dont remember any cupboard as a matter of fact when i used to stay at the house the drawingroom was barred mrs hignett wouldnt let us inside it for fear we should smash her china is there a cupboard  immediately behind the piano sir a nice roomy cupboard i was glancing into it myself in a spirit of idle curiosity only the other day it contains nothing except a few knickknacks on an upper shelf you could lock yourself in from the interior and be quite comfortably seated on the floor till the household retired to bed  when would that be  they retire quite early sir as a rule by halfpast ten the coast is generally clear at that time i would suggest that i came down and knocked on the cupboard door to notify you that all was well  sam was glowing with frank approval  you know youre a mastermind he said enthusiastically  youre very kind sir  one of the lads by jove said sam and not the worst of them i dont want to flatter you but theres a future for you in crime if you cared to go in for it  i am glad that you appreciate my poor efforts sir then we will regard the scheme as passed and approved  i should say we would its a bird  very good sir  ill be round at about a quarter to eight will that be right  admirable sir  and i say about that soporific dont overdo it dont go killing the little beast  oh no sir  well said sam you cant say its not a temptation and you know what you napoleons of the underworld are     chapter xvii  a crowded night   § 1  if there is one thing more than another which weighs upon the mind of a storyteller as he chronicles the events which he has set out to describe it is the thought that the reader may be growing impatient with him for straying from the main channel of his tale and devoting himself to what are after all minor developments this story for instance opened with mrs horace hignett the worldfamous writer on theosophy going over to america to begin a lecturingtour and no one realises more keenly than i do that i have left mrs hignett flat i have thrust that great thinker into the background and concentrated my attention on the affairs of one who is both her mental and her moral inferior samuel marlowe i seem at this point to see the readera great brute of a fellow with beetling eyebrows and a jaw like the ram of a battleship the sort of fellow who is full of determination and will stand no nonsenserising to remark that he doesnt care what happened to samuel marlowe and that what he wants to know is how mrs hignett made out on her lecturingtour did she go big in buffalo did she have em tearing up the seats in schenectady was she a riot in chicago and a cyclone in st louis those are the points on which he desires information or give him his money back  i cannot supply the information and before you condemn me let me hastily add that the fault is not mine but that of mrs hignett herself the fact is she never went to buffalo schenectady saw nothing of her she did not get within a thousand miles of chicago nor did she penetrate to st louis for the very morning after her son eustace sailed for england in the liner atlantic she happened to read in the paper one of those abridged passengerlists which the journals of new york are in the habit of printing and got a nasty shock when she saw that among those whose society eustace would enjoy during the voyage was miss wilhelmina bennett daughter of j rufus bennett of bennett mandelbaum and co and within five minutes of digesting this information she was at her desk writing out telegrams cancelling all her engagements ironsouled as this woman was her fingers trembled as she wrote she had a vision of eustace and the daughter of j rufus bennett strolling together on moonlit decks leaning over rails damp with seaspray and in short generally starting the whole trouble all over again  in the height of the tourist season it is not always possible for one who wishes to leave america to spring on to the next boat a long mornings telephoning to the offices of the cunard and the white star brought mrs hignett the depressing information that it would be a full week before she could sail for england that meant that the inflammable eustace would have over two weeks to conduct an uninterrupted wooing and mrs hignetts heart sank till suddenly she remembered that so poor a sailor as her son was not likely to have had leisure for any strolling on the deck during the voyage on the atlantic  having realised this she became calmer and went about her preparations for departure with an easier mind the danger was still great but there was a good chance that she might be in time to intervene she wound up her affairs in new york and on the following wednesday boarded the nuronia bound for southampton  the nuronia is one of the slowest of the cunard boats it was built at a time when delirious crowds used to swoon on the dock if an ocean liner broke the record by getting across in nine days it rolled over to cherbourg dallied at that picturesque port for some hours then sauntered across the channel and strolled into southampton water in the evening of the day on which samuel marlowe had sat in the lane plotting with webster the valet at almost the exact moment when sam sidling through the windows of the drawingroom slid into the cupboard behind the piano mrs hignett was standing at the customs barrier telling the officials that she had nothing to declare  mrs hignett was a general who believed in forced marches a lesser woman might have taken the boattrain to london and proceeded to windles at her ease on the following afternoon mrs hignett was made of sterner stuff having fortified herself with a late dinner she hired a car and set out on the crosscountry journey it was only when the car a genuine antique had broken down three times in the first ten miles that she directed the driver to take her instead to the blue boar in windlehurst where she arrived tired but thankful to have reached it at all at about eleven oclock  at this point many indeed most women would have gone to bed but the familiar hampshire air and the knowledge that half an hours walking would take her to her beloved home acted on mrs hignett like a restorative one glimpse of windles she felt that she must have before she retired for the night if only to assure herself that it was still there she had a cup of coffee and a sandwich brought to her by the nightporter whom she had roused from sleep for bedtime is early in windlehurst and then informed him that she was going for a short walk and would ring when she returned  her heart leaped joyfully as she turned in at the drive gates of her home and felt the wellremembered gravel crunching under her feet the silhouette of the ruined castle against the summer sky gave her the feeling which all returning wanderers know and when she stepped on to the lawn and looked at the black bulk of the house indistinct and shadowy with its backing of trees tears came into her eyes she experienced a rush of emotion which made her feel quite faint and which lasted until on tiptoeing nearer to the house in order to gloat more adequately upon it she perceived that the french windows of the drawingroom were standing ajar sam had left them like this in order to facilitate departure if a hurried departure should by any mischance be rendered necessary and drawn curtains had kept the household from noticing the fact  all the proprietor in mrs hignett was roused this she felt indignantly was the sort of thing she had been afraid would happen the moment her back was turned evidently laxityone might almost say anarchyhad set in directly she had removed the eye of authority she marched to the window and pushed it open she had now completely abandoned her kindly scheme of refraining from rousing the sleeping house and spending the night at the inn she stepped into the drawingroom with the singleminded purpose of routing eustace out of his sleep and giving him a good talkingto for having failed to maintain her own standard of efficiency among the domestic staff if there was one thing on which mrs horace hignett had always insisted it was that every window in the house must be closed at lightsout  she pushed the curtains apart with a rattle and at the same moment from the direction of the door there came a low but distinct gasp which made her resolute heart jump and flutter it was too dark to see anything distinctly but in the instant before it turned and fled she caught sight of a shadowy male figure and knew that her worst fears had been realised the figure was too tall to be eustace and eustace she knew was the only man in the house male figures therefore that went flitting about windles must be the figures of burglars  mrs hignett bold woman though she was stood for an instant spellbound and for one moment of not unpardonable panic tried to tell herself that she had been mistaken almost immediately however there came from the direction of the hall a dull chunky sound as though something soft had been kicked followed by a low gurgle and the noise of staggering feet unless he were dancing a pas seul out of sheer lightness of heart the nocturnal visitor must have tripped over something  the latter theory was the correct one montagu webster was a man who at many a subscription ball had shaken a gifted dancingpump and nothing in the proper circumstances pleased him better than to exercise the skill which had become his as the result of twelve private lessons at halfacrown a visit but he recognised the truth of the scriptural adage that there is a time for dancing and that this was not it his only desire when stealing into the drawingroom he had been confronted through the curtains by a female figure was to get back to his bedroom undetected he supposed that one of the feminine members of the houseparty must have been taking a stroll in the grounds and he did not wish to stay and be compelled to make laborious explanations of his presence there in the dark he decided to postpone the knocking on the cupboard door which had been the signal arranged between himself and sam until a more suitable occasion in the meantime he bounded silently out into the hall and instantaneously tripped over the portly form of smith the bulldog who roused from a light sleep to the knowledge that something was going on and being a dog who always liked to be in the centre of the maelstrom of events had waddled out to investigate  by the time mrs hignett had pulled herself together sufficiently to feel brave enough to venture into the hall websters presence of mind and smiths gregariousness had combined to restore that part of the house to its normal nocturnal condition of emptiness websters stagger had carried him almost up to the green baize door leading to the servants staircase and he proceeded to pass through it without checking his momentum closely followed by smith who now convinced that interesting events were in progress which might possibly culminate in cake had abandoned the idea of sleep and meant to see the thing through he gambolled in websters wake up the stairs and along the passage leading to the latters room and only paused when the door was brusquely shut in his face upon which he sat down to think the thing over he was in no hurry the night was before him promising as far as he could judge from the way it had opened excellent entertainment  mrs hignett had listened fearfully to the uncouth noises from the hall the burglarsshe had now discovered that there were at least two of themappeared to be actually romping the situation had grown beyond her handling if this troupe of terpsichorean marauders was to be dislodged she must have assistance it was mans work she made a brave dash through the hall mercifully unmolested found the stairs raced up them and fell through the doorway of her son eustaces bedroom like a spent marathon runner staggering past the winningpost   § 2  at about the moment when mrs hignett was crunching the gravel of the drive eustace was lying in bed listening to jane hubbard as she told the story of how an alligator had once got into her tent while she was camping on the banks of the issawassi river in central africa ever since he had become ill it had been the largehearted girls kindly practice to soothe him to rest with some such narrative from her energetic past  and what happened then asked eustace breathlessly  he had raised himself on one elbow in his bed his eyes shone excitedly from a face which was almost the exact shape of an association football for he had reached the stage of mumps when the patient begins to swell as though somebody were inflating him with a bicyclepump  oh i jabbed him in the eye with a pair of nailscissors and he went away said jane hubbard  you know youre wonderful cried eustace simply wonderful  jane hubbard flushed a little beneath her tan she loved his pretty enthusiasm he was so genuinely stirred by what were to her the merest commonplaces of life  why if an alligator got into my tent said eustace i simply wouldnt know what to do i should be nonplussed  oh its just a knack said jane carelessly you soon pick it up  nailscissors  it ruined them unfortunately they were never any use again for the rest of the trip i had to manicure myself with a huntingspear  youre a marvel  eustace lay back in bed and gave himself up to meditation he had admired jane hubbard before but the intimacy of the sickroom and the stories which she had told him to relieve the tedium of his invalid state had set the seal on his devotion it has always been like this since othello wooed desdemona for three days jane hubbard had been weaving her spell about eustace hignett and now she monopolised his entire horizon she had spoken like othello of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touched heaven and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear would eustace hignett seriously incline and swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful he loved her for the dangers she had passed and she loved him that he did pity them in fact one would have said that it was all over except buying the licence had it not been for the fact that his very admiration served to keep eustace from pouring out his heart it seemed incredible to him that the queen of her sex a girl who had chatted in terms of equality with african headhunters and who swatted alligators as though they were flies could ever lower herself to care for a man who looked like the aftertaking advertisement of a patent food  but even those whom nature has destined to be mates may misunderstand each other and jane who was as modest as she was brave had come recently to place a different interpretation on his silence in the last few days of the voyage she had quite made up her mind that eustace hignett loved her and would shortly intimate as much in the usual manner but since coming to windles she had begun to have doubts she was not blind to the fact that billie bennett was distinctly prettier than herself and far more the type to which the ordinary man is attracted and much as she loathed the weakness and despised herself for yielding to it she had become distinctly jealous of her true billie was officially engaged to bream mortimer but she had had experience of the brittleness of miss bennetts engagements and she could by no means regard eustace as immune  do you suppose they will be happy she asked  eh who said eustace excusably puzzled for they had only just finished talking about alligators but there had been a pause since his last remark and janes thoughts had flitted back to the subject that usually occupied them  billie and bream mortimer  oh said eustace yes i suppose so  shes a delightful girl  yes said eustace without much animation  and of course its nice their fathers being so keen on the match it doesnt often happen that way  no peoples people generally want people to marry people people dont want to marry said eustace clothing in words a profound truth which from the earliest days of civilisation has deeply affected the youth of every country  i suppose your mother has got somebody picked out for you to marry said jane casually  mother doesnt want me to marry anybody said eustace with gloom it was another obstacle to his romance  what never  no  why ever not  as far as i can make out if i marry i get this house and mother has to clear out silly business  well you wouldnt let your mother stand in the way if you ever really fell in love said jane  it isnt so much a question of letting her stand in the way the tough job would be preventing her youve never met my mother  no im looking forward to it  youre looking forward eustace eyed her with honest amazement  but what could your mother do i mean supposing you had made up your mind to marry somebody  what could she do why there isnt anything she wouldnt do why once eustace broke off the anecdote which he had been about to tell contained information which on reflection he did not wish to reveal  once said jane  oh well i was just going to show you what mother is like ii was going out to lunch with a man andand eustace was not a ready improvisatorand she didnt want me to go so she stole all my trousers  jane hubbard started as if wandering through one of her favourite jungles she had perceived a snake in her path she was thinking hard that story which billie had told her on the boat about the man to whom she had been engaged whose mother had stolen his trousers on the wedding morning  it all came back to her with a topical significance which it had never had before it had lingered in her memory as stories will but it had been a detached episode having no personal meaning for her but now she did that just to stop you going out to lunch with a man she said slowly  yes rotten thing to do wasnt it  jane hubbard moved to the foot of the bed and her forceful gaze shooting across the intervening counterpane pinned eustace to the pillow she was in the mood which had caused spines in somaliland to curl like withered leaves  were you ever engaged to billie bennett she demanded  eustace hignett licked dry lips his face looked like a hunted melon the flannel bandage draped around it by loving hands hardly supported his sagging jaw  whyer  were you cried jane stamping an imperious foot there was that in her eye before which warriors of the lower congo had become as chewed blottingpaper eustace hignett shrivelled in the blaze he was filled with an unendurable sense of guilt  welleryes he mumbled weakly  jane hubbard buried her face in her hands and burst into tears she might know what to do when alligators started exploring her tent but she was a woman  this sudden solution of steely strength into liquid weakness had on eustace hignett the stunning effects which the absence of the last stair has on the returning reveller creeping up to bed in the dark it was as though his spiritual foot had come down hard on empty space and caused him to bite his tongue jane hubbard had always been to him a rock of support and now the rock had melted away and left him wallowing in a deep pool  he wallowed gratefully it had only needed this to brace him to the point of declaring his love his awe of this girl had momentarily vanished he felt strong and dashing he scrambled down the bed and peered over the foot of it at her huddled form  have some barleywater he urged try a little barleywater  it was all he had to offer her except the medicine which by the doctors instructions he took three times a day in a quarter of a glass of water  go away sobbed jane hubbard  the unreasonableness of this struck eustace  but i cant im in bed where could i go  i hate you  oh dont say that  youre still in love with her  nonsense i never was in love with her  then why were you going to marry her  oh i dont know it seemed a good idea at the time  oh oh oh  eustace bent a little further over the end of the bed and patted her hair  do have some barleywater he said just a sip  you are in love with her sobbed jane  im not i love you  you dont  pardon me said eustace firmly ive loved you ever since you gave me that extraordinary drink with worcester sauce in it on the boat  they why didnt you say so before  i hadnt the nerve you always seemed soi dont know how to put iti always seemed such a worm i was just trying to get the courage to propose when i caught the mumps and that seemed to me to finish it no girl could love a man with three times the proper amount of face  as if that could make any difference what does your outside matter i have seen your inside  i beg your pardon  i mean  eustace fondled her back hair  jane queen of my soul do you really love me  ive loved you ever since we met on the subway she raised a tearstained face if only i could be sure that you really loved me  i can prove it said eustace proudly you know how scared i am of my mother well for your sake i overcame my fear and did something which if she ever found out about it would make her sorer than a sunburned neck this house she absolutely refused to let it to old bennett and old mortimer they kept after her about it but she wouldnt hear of it well you told me on the boat that wilhelmina bennett had invited you to spend the summer with her and i knew that if they didnt come to windles they would take some other place and that meant i wouldnt see you so i hunted up old mortimer and let it to him on the quiet without telling my mother anything about it  why you darling angel child cried jane hubbard joyfully did you really do that for my sake now i know you love me  of course if mother ever got to hear of it  jane hubbard pushed him gently into the nest of bedclothes and tucked him in with strong calm hands she was a very different person from the girl who so short a while before had sobbed on the carpet love is a wonderful thing  you mustnt excite yourself she said youll be getting a temperature lie down and try to get to sleep she kissed his bulbous face you have made me so happy eustace darling  thats good said eustace cordially but its going to be an awful jar for mother  dont you worry about that ill break the news to your mother im sure she will be quite reasonable about it  eustace opened his mouth to speak then closed it again  lie back quite comfortably and dont worry said jane hubbard im going to my room to get a book to read you to sleep i shant be five minutes and forget about your mother ill look after her  eustace closed his eyes after all this girl had fought lions tigers pumas cannibals and alligators in her time with a good deal of success there might be a sporting chance of victory for her when she moved a step up in the animal kingdom and tackled his mother he was not unduly optimistic for he thought she was going out of her class but he felt faintly hopeful he allowed himself to drift into pleasant meditation  there was a scrambling sound outside the door the handle turned  hullo back already said eustace opening his eyes  the next moment he opened them wider his mouth gaped slowly like a hole in a sliding cliff mrs horace hignett was standing at his bedside   § 3  in the moment which elapsed before either of the two could calm their agitated brains to speech eustace became aware as never before of the truth of that wellknown linepeace perfect peace with loved ones far away there was certainly little hope of peace with loved ones in his bedroom dully he realised that in a few minutes jane hubbard would be returning with her book but his imagination refused to envisage the scene which would then occur  eustace  mrs hignett gasped hand on heart  eustace for the first time mrs hignett seemed to become aware that it was a changed face that confronted hers good gracious how stout youve grown  its mumps  mumps  yes ive got mumps  mrs hignetts mind was too fully occupied with other matters to allow her to dwell on this subject  eustace there are men in the house  this fact was just what eustace had been wondering how to break to her  i know he said uneasily  you know mrs hignett stared did you hear them  hear them said eustace puzzled  the drawingroom window was left open and there are two burglars in the hall  oh i say no thats rather rotten said eustace  i saw them and heard them ioh mrs hignetts sentence trailed off into a suppressed shriek as the door opened and jane hubbard came in  jane hubbard was a girl who by nature and training was well adapted to bear shocks her guiding motto in life was that helpful line of horaceaequam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem for the benefit of those who have not like myself enjoyed an expensive classical educationmementotake my tipservarepreserveaequaman unruffledmentemmindrebus in arduisin every crisis she had only been out of the room a few minutes and in that brief period a middleaged lady of commanding aspect had apparently come up through a trap it would have been enough to upset most girls but jane hubbard bore it calmly all through her vivid life her bedroom had been a sort of cosy corner for murderers alligators tarantulas scorpions and every variety of snake so she accepted the middleaged lady without comment  good evening she said placidly  mrs hignett having rallied from her moment of weakness glared at the new arrival dumbly she could not place jane from the airy way in which she had strolled into the room she appeared to be some sort of a nurse but she wore no nurses uniform  who are you she asked stiffly  who are you asked jane  i said mrs hignett portentously am the owner of this house and i should be glad to know what you are doing in it i am mrs horace hignett  a charming smile spread itself over janes finelycut face  im so glad to meet you she said i have heard so much about you  indeed said mrs hignett coldly and now i should like to hear a little about you  ive read all your books said jane i think theyre wonderful  in spite of herself in spite of a feeling that this young woman was straying from the point mrs hignett could not check a slight influx of amiability she was an authoress who received a good deal of incense from admirers but she could always do with a bit more besides most of the incense came by post living a quiet and retired life in the country it was rarely that she got it handed to her face to face she melted quite perceptibly she did not cease to look like a basilisk but she began to look like a basilisk who has had a good lunch  my favourite said jane who for a week had been sitting daily in a chair in the drawingroom adjoining the table on which the authoresss complete works were assembled is the spreading light i do like the spreading light  it was written some years ago said mrs hignett with something approaching cordiality and i have since revised some of the views i state in it but i still consider it quite a good textbook  of course i can see that what of the morrow is more profound said jane but i read the spreading light first and of course that makes a difference  i can quite see that it would agreed mrs hignett ones first step across the threshold of a new mind ones first glimpse  yes it makes you feel  like some watcher of the skies said mrs hignett when a new planet swims into his ken or like  yes doesnt it said jane  eustace who had been listening to the conversation with every muscle tense in much the same mental attitude as that of a peaceful citizen in a wild west saloon who holds himself in readiness to dive under a table directly the shooting begins began to relax what he had shrinkingly anticipated would be the biggest thing since the dempseycarpentier fight seemed to be turning into a pleasant social and literary evening not unlike what he imagined a meeting of old girton students must be for the first time since his mother had come into the room he indulged in the luxury of a deep breath  but what are you doing here asked mrs hignett returning almost reluctantly to the main issue  eustace perceived that he had breathed too soon in an unobtrusive way he subsided into the bed and softly pulled the sheets over his head following the excellent tactics of the great duke of wellington in his peninsular campaign when in doubt the duke used to say retire and dig yourself in  im nursing dear eustace said jane  mrs hignett quivered and cast an eye on the hump in the bedclothes which represented dear eustace a cold fear had come upon her  dear eustace she repeated mechanically  were engaged said jane  engaged eustace is this true  yes said a muffled voice from the interior of the bed  and poor eustace is so worried continued jane about the house she went on quickly he doesnt want to deprive you of it because he knows what it means to you so he is hopingwe are both hopingthat you will accept it as a present when we are married we really shant want it you know we are going to live in london so you will take it wont youto please us  we all of us even the greatest of us have our moments of weakness only a short while back in this very room we have seen jane hubbard that indomitable girl sobbing brokenly on the carpet let us then not express any surprise at the sudden collapse of one of the worlds greatest female thinkers as the meaning of this speech smote on mrs horace hignetts understanding she sank weeping into a chair the everpresent fear that had haunted her had been exorcised windles was hers in perpetuity the relief was too great she sat in her chair and gulped and eustace greatly encouraged emerged slowly from the bedclothes like a worm after a thunderstorm  how long this poignant scene would have lasted one cannot say it is a pity that it was cut short for i should have liked to dwell upon it but at this moment from the regions downstairs there suddenly burst upon the silent night such a whirlwind of sound as effectually dissipated the tense emotion in the room somebody appeared to have touched off the orchestrion in the drawingroom and that willing instrument had begun again in the middle of a bar at the point where jane hubbard had switched it off four afternoons ago its wailing lament for the passing of summer filled the whole house  thats too bad said jane a little annoyed at this time of night  its the burglars quavered mrs hignett in the stress of recent events she had completely forgotten the existence of those enemies of society they were dancing in the hall when i arrived and now theyre playing the orchestrion  lighthearted chaps said eustace admiring the sangfroid of the criminal world full of spirits  this wont do said jane hubbard shaking her head we cant have this sort of thing ill go and fetch my gun  theyll murder you dear panted mrs hignett clinging to her arm  jane hubbard laughed  murder me she said amusedly id like to catch them at it  mrs hignett stood staring at the door as jane closed it softly behind her  eustace she said solemnly that is a wonderful girl  yes she once killed a pantheror a puma i forget whichwith a hatpin said eustace with enthusiasm  i could wish you no better wife said mrs hignett  she broke off with a sharp wail out in the passage something like a battery of artillery had roared  the door opened and jane hubbard appeared slipping a fresh cartridge into the elephantgun  one of them was popping about outside here she announced i took a shot at him but im afraid i missed the visibility was bad at any rate he went away  in this last statement she was perfectly accurate bream mortimer who had been aroused by the orchestrion and who had come out to see what was the matter had gone away at the rate of fifty miles an hour he had been creeping down the passage when he found himself suddenly confronted by a dim figure which without a word had attempted to slay him with an enormous gun the shot had whistled past his ears and gone singing down the corridor this was enough for bream he had returned to his room in three strides and was now under the bed the burglars might take everything in the house and welcome so that they did not molest his privacy that was the way bream looked at it and very sensible of him too i consider  wed better go downstairs said jane bring the candle not you eustace darling you stay where you are or you may catch a chill dont stir out of bed  i wont said eustace obediently   § 4  of all the leisured pursuits there are few less attractive to the thinking man than sitting in a dark cupboard waiting for a houseparty to go to bed and sam who had established himself in the one behind the piano at a quarter to eight soon began to feel as if he had been there for an eternity he could dimly remember a previous existence in which he had not been sitting in his present position but it seemed so long ago that it was shadowy and unreal to him the ordeal of spending the evening in this retreat had not appeared formidable when he had contemplated it that afternoon in the lane but now that he was actually undergoing it it was extraordinary how many disadvantages it had  cupboards as a class are badly ventilated and this one seemed to contain no air at all and the warmth of the night combined with the cupboards natural stuffiness had soon begun to reduce sam to a condition of pulp he seemed to himself to be sagging like an icecream in front of a fire the darkness too weighed upon him he was abominably thirsty also he wanted to smoke in addition to this the small of his back tickled and he more than suspected the cupboard of harbouring mice not once or twice but many hundred times he wished that the ingenious webster had thought of something simpler  his was a position which would just have suited one of those indian mystics who sit perfectly still for twenty years contemplating the infinite but it reduced sam to an almost imbecile state of boredom he tried counting sheep he tried going over his past life in his mind from the earliest moment he could recollect and thought he had never encountered a duller series of episodes he found a temporary solace by playing a succession of mental golfgames over all the courses he could remember and he was just teeing up for the sixteenth at muirfield after playing hoylake st andrews westward ho hanger hill midsurrey walton heath and sandwich when the light ceased to shine through the crack under the door and he awoke with a sense of dull incredulity to the realisation that the occupants of the drawingroom had called it a day and that his vigil was over  but was it once more alert sam became cautious true the light seemed to be off but did that mean anything in a countryhouse where people had the habit of going and strolling about the garden to all hours probably they were still popping about all over the place at any rate it was not worth risking coming out of his lair he remembered that webster had promised to come and knock an allclear signal on the door it would be safer to wait for that  but the moments went by and there was no knock sam began to grow impatient the last few minutes of waiting in a cupboard are always the hardest time seemed to stretch out again interminably once he thought he heard footsteps but they led to nothing eventually having strained his ears and finding everything still he decided to take a chance he fished in his pocket for the key cautiously unlocked the door opened it by slow inches and peered out  the room was in blackness the house was still all was well with the feeling of a lifeprisoner emerging from the bastille he began to crawl stiffly forward and it was just then that the first of the disturbing events occurred which were to make this night memorable to him something like a rattlesnake suddenly went off with a whirr and his head jerking up collided with the piano it was only the cuckooclock which now having cleared its throat as was its custom before striking proceeded to cuck eleven times in rapid succession before subsiding with another rattle but to sam it sounded like the end of the world  he sat in the darkness massaging his bruised skull his hours of imprisonment in the cupboard had had a bad effect on his nervous system and he vacillated between tears of weakness and a militant desire to get at the cuckooclock with a hatchet he felt that it had done it on purpose and was now chuckling to itself in fancied security for quite a minute he raged silently and any cuckooclock which had strayed within his reach would have had a bad time of it then his attention was diverted  so concentrated was sam on his private vendetta with the clock that no ordinary happening would have had the power to distract him what occurred now was by no means ordinary and it distracted him like an electric shock as he sat on the floor passing a tender hand over the eggshaped bump which had already begun to manifest itself beneath his hair something cold and wet touched his face and paralysed him so completely both physically and mentally that he did not move a muscle but just congealed where he sat into a solid block of ice he felt vaguely that this was the end his heart had stopped beating and he simply could not imagine it ever starting again and if your heart refuses to beat what hope is there for you  at this moment something heavy and solid struck him squarely in the chest rolling him over something gurgled asthmatically in the darkness something began to lick his eyes ears and chin in a sort of ecstasy and clutching out he found his arms full of totally unexpected bulldog  get out whispered sam tensely recovering his faculties with a jerk go away  smith took the opportunity of sams lips having opened to lick the roof of his mouth smiths attitude in the matter was that providence in its allseeing wisdom had sent him a human being at a moment when he had reluctantly been compelled to reconcile himself to a total absence of such indispensable adjuncts to a good time he had just trotted downstairs in rather a disconsolate frame of mind after waiting with no result in front of websters bedroom door and it was a real treat to him to meet a man especially one seated in such a jolly and sociable manner on the floor he welcomed sam like a longlost friend  between smith and the humans who provided him with dogbiscuits and occasionally with sweet cakes there had always existed a state of misunderstanding which no words could remove the position of the humans was quite clear they had elected smith to his present position on a straight watchdog ticket they expected him to be one of those dogs who rouse the house and save the spoons they looked to him to pin burglars by the leg and hold on till the police arrived smith simply could not grasp such an attitude of mind he regarded windles not as a private house but as a social club and was utterly unable to see any difference between the human beings he knew and the strangers who dropped in for a late chat after the place was locked up he had no intention of biting sam the idea never entered his head at the present moment what he felt about sam was that he was one of the best fellows he had ever met and that he loved him like a brother  sam in his unnerved state could not bring himself to share these amiable sentiments he was thinking bitterly that webster might have had the intelligence to warn him of bulldogs on the premises it was just the sort of woollenheaded thing fellows did forgetting facts like that he scrambled stiffly to his feet and tried to pierce the darkness that hemmed him in he ignored smith who snuffled sportively about his ankles and made for the slightly less black oblong which he took to be the door leading into the hall he moved warily but not warily enough to prevent his cannoning into and almost upsetting a small table with a vase on it the table rocked and the vase jumped and the first bit of luck that had come to sam that night was when he reached out at a venture and caught it just as it was about to bound on to the carpet  he stood there shaking the narrowness of the escape turned him cold if he had been an instant later there would have been a crash loud enough to wake a dozen sleeping houses this sort of thing could not go on he must have light it might be a risk there might be a chance of somebody upstairs seeing it and coming down to investigate but it was a risk that must be taken he declined to go on stumbling about in this darkness any longer he groped his way with infinite care to the door on the wall adjoining which he presumed the electriclight switch would be it was nearly ten years since he had last been inside windles and it never occurred to him that in this progressive age even a woman like his aunt adeline of whom he could believe almost anything would still be using candles and oillamps as a means of illumination his only doubt was whether the switch was where it was in most houses near the door  it is odd to reflect that as his searching fingers touched the knob a delicious feeling of relief came to samuel marlowe this misguided young man actually felt at that moment that his troubles were over he positively smiled as he placed a thumb on the knob and shoved  he shoved strongly and sharply and instantaneously there leaped at him out of the darkness a blare of music which appeared to his disordered mind quite solid it seemed to wrap itself round him it was all over the place in a single instant the world had become one vast bellow of tostis goodbye  how long he stood there frozen he did not know nor can one say how long he would have stood there had nothing further come to invite his notice elsewhere but suddenly drowning even the impromptu concert there came from somewhere upstairs the roar of a gun and when he heard that sams rigid limbs relaxed and a violent activity descended upon him he bounded out into the hall looking to right and to left for a hidingplace one of the suits of armour which had been familiar to him in his boyhood loomed up in front of him and with the sight came the recollection of how when a mere child on his first visit to windles playing hide and seek with his cousin eustace he had concealed himself inside this very suit and had not only baffled eustace through a long summer evening but had wound up by almost scaring him into a decline by booing at him through the vizor of the helmet happy days happy days he leaped at the suit of armour having grown since he was last inside it he found the helmet a tight fit but he managed to get his head into it at last and the body of the thing was quite roomy  thank heaven said sam  he was not comfortable but comfort just then was not his primary need  smith the bulldog well satisfied with the way the entertainment had opened sat down wheezing slightly to await developments   § 5  he had not long to wait in a few minutes the hall had filled up nicely there was mr mortimer in his shirtsleeves mr bennett in blue pyjamas and a dressinggown mrs hignett in a travelling costume jane hubbard with her elephantgun and billie in a dinner dress smith welcomed them all impartially  somebody lit a lamp and mrs hignett stared speechlessly at the mob  mr bennett mr mortimer  mrs hignett what are you doing here  mrs hignett drew herself up stiffly  what an odd question mr mortimer i am in my own house  but you rented it to me for the summer at least your son did  eustace let you windles for the summer said mrs hignett incredulously  jane hubbard returned from the drawingroom where she had been switching off the orchestrion  let us talk all that over cosily tomorrow she said the point now is that there are burglars in the house  burglars cried mr bennett aghast i thought it was you playing that infernal instrument mortimer  what on earth should i play it for at this time of night said mr mortimer irritably  it woke me up said mr bennett complainingly and i had had great difficulty in dropping off to sleep i was in considerable pain i believe ive caught the mumps from young hignett  nonsense youre always imagining yourself ill snapped mr mortimer  my face hurts persisted mr bennett  you cant expect a face like that not to hurt said mr mortimer  it appeared only too evident that the two old friends were again on the verge of one of their distressing fallingsout but jane hubbard intervened once more this practicalminded girl disliked the introducing of sideissues into the conversation she was there to talk about burglars and she intended to do so  for goodness sake stop it she said almost petulantly for one usually so superior to emotion therell be lots of time for quarrelling tomorrow just now weve got to catch these  im not quarrelling said mr bennett  yes you are said mr mortimer  im not  you are  dont argue  im not arguing  you are  im not  jane hubbard had practically every noble quality which a woman can possess with the exception of patience a patient woman would have stood by shrinking from interrupting the dialogue jane hubbards robuster course was to raise the elephantgun point it at the front door and pull the trigger  i thought that would stop you she said complacently as the echoes died away and mr bennett had finished leaping into the air she inserted a fresh cartridge and sloped arms now the question is  you made me bite my tongue said mr bennett deeply aggrieved  serve you right said jane placidly now the question is have the fellows got away or are they hiding somewhere in the house i think theyre still in the house  the police exclaimed mr bennett forgetting his lacerated tongue and his other grievances we must summon the police  obviously said mrs hignett withdrawing her fascinated gaze from the ragged hole in the front door the cost of repairing which she had been mentally assessing we must send for the police at once  we dont really need them you know said jane if youll all go to bed and just leave me to potter round with my gun  and blow the whole house to pieces said mrs hignett tartly she had begun to revise her original estimate of this girl to her windles was sacred and anyone who went about shooting holes in it forfeited her esteem  shall i go for the police said billie i could bring them back in ten minutes in the car  certainly not said mr bennett my daughter gadding about all over the countryside in an automobile at this time of night  if you think i ought not to go alone i could take bream  where is bream said mr mortimer  the odd fact that bream was not among those present suddenly presented itself to the company  where can he be said billie  jane hubbard laughed the wholesome indulgent laugh of one who is broadminded enough to see the humour of the situation even when the joke is at her expense  what a silly girl i am she said i do believe that was bream i shot at upstairs how foolish of me making a mistake like that  you shot my only son cried mr mortimer  i shot at him said jane my belief is that i missed him though how i came to do it beats me i dont suppose ive missed a sitter like that since i was a child in the nursery of course she proceeded looking on the reasonable side the visibility wasnt good but its no use saying i oughtnt at least to have winged him because i ought she shook her head with a touch of selfreproach i shall get chaffed about this if it comes out she said regretfully  the poor boy must be in his room said mr mortimer  under the bed if you ask me said jane blowing on the barrel of her gun and polishing it with the side of her hand hes all right leave him alone and the housemaid will sweep him up in the morning  oh he cant be cried billie revolted  a girl of high spirit it seemed to her repellent that the man she was engaged to marry should be displaying such a craven spirit at that moment she despised and hated bream mortimer i think she was wrong mind you it is not my place to criticise the little group of people whose simple annals i am relatingmy position is merely that of a reporter but personally i think highly of breams sturdy commonsense if somebody loosed off an elephantgun at me in a dark corridor i would climb on to the roof and pull it up after me still rightly or wrongly that was how billie felt and it flashed across her mind that samuel marlowe scoundrel though he was would not have behaved like this and for a moment a certain wistfulness added itself to the varied emotions then engaging her mind  ill go and look if you like said jane agreeably you amuse yourselves somehow till i come back  she ran easily up the stairs three at a time mr mortimer turned to mr bennett  its all very well your saying wilhelmina mustnt go but if she doesnt how can we get the police the house isnt on the phone and nobody else can drive the car  thats true said mr bennett wavering  of course we could drop them a postcard first thing tomorrow morning said mr mortimer in his nasty sarcastic way  im going said billie resolutely it occurred to her as it has occurred to so many women before her how helpless men are in a crisis the temporary withdrawal of jane hubbard had had the effect which the removal of the rudder has on a boat its the only thing to do i shall be back in no time  she stepped firmly to the coatrack and began to put on her motoringcloak and just then jane hubbard came downstairs shepherding before her a pale and glassyeyed bream  right under the bed she announced cheerfully making a noise like a piece of fluff in order to deceive burglars  billie cast a scornful look at her fiancé absolutely unjustified in my opinion but nevertheless she cast it but it had no effect at all terror had stunned bream mortimers perceptions his was what the doctors call a penumbral mental condition  bream said billie i want you to come in the car with me to fetch the police  all right said bream  get your coat  all right said bream  and cap  all right said bream  he followed billie in a docile manner out through the front door and they made their way to the garage at the back of the house both silent the only difference between their respective silences was that billies was thoughtful while breams was just the silence of a man who has unhitched his brain and is getting along as well as he can without it  in the hall they had left jane hubbard once more took command of affairs  well thats something done she said scratching smiths broad back with the muzzle of her weapon something accomplished something done has earned a nights repose not that were going to get it yet i think those fellows are hiding somewhere and we ought to search the house and rout them out its a pity smith isnt a bloodhound hes a good cakehound but as a watchdog he doesnt finish in the first ten  the cakehound charmed at the compliment frisked about her feet like a young elephant  the first thing to do continued jane is to go through the groundfloor rooms she paused to strike a match against the suit of armour nearest to her a proceeding which elicited a sharp cry of protest from mrs hignett and lit a cigarette ill go first as ive got a gun she blew a cloud of smoke i shall want somebody with me to carry a light and  tchoo  what said jane  i didnt speak said mr mortimer who am i to speak he went on bitterly who am i that it should be supposed that i have anything sensible to suggest  somebody spoke said jane i  achoo  do you feel a draught mr bennett cried jane sharply wheeling round on him  there is a draught began mr bennett  well finish sneezing and ill go on  i didnt sneeze  somebody sneezed  it seemed to come from just behind you said mrs hignett nervously  it couldnt have come from just behind me said jane because there isnt anything behind me from which it could have she stopped suddenly in her eyes the light of understanding on her face the set expression which was wont to come to it on the eve of action oh she said in a different voice a voice which was cold and tense and sinister oh i see she raised her gun and placed a muscular forefinger on the trigger come out of that she said come out of that suit of armour and lets have a look at you  i can explain everything said a muffled voice through the vizor of the helmet i canachoo the smoke of the cigarette tickled sams nostrils again and he suspended his remarks  i shall count three said jane hubbard onetwo  im coming im coming said sam petulantly  youd better said jane  i cant get this dashed helmet off  if you dont come quick ill blow it off  sam stepped out into the hall a picturesque figure which combined the costumes of two widely separated centuries modern as far as the neck he slipped back at that point to the middle ages  hands up commanded jane hubbard  my hands are up retorted sam querulously as he wrenched at his unbecoming headwear  never mind trying to raise your hat said jane if youve lost the combination well dispense with the formalities what were anxious to hear is what youre doing in the house at this time of night and who your pals are come along my lad make a clean breast of it and perhaps youll get off easier are you a gang  do i look like a gang  if you ask me what you look like  my name is marlowe  samuel marlowe  alias what  alias nothing i say my name is samuel marlowe  an explosive roar burst from mr bennett  the scoundrel i know him i forbade him the house and  and by what right did you forbid people my house mr bennett said mrs hignett with acerbity  ive rented the house mortimer and i rented it from your son  yes yes yes said jane hubbard never mind about that so you know this fellow do you  i dont know him  you said you did  i refuse to know him went on mr bennett i wont know him i decline to have anything to do with him  but you identify him  if he says hes samuel marlowe assented mr bennett grudgingly i suppose he is i cant imagine anybody saying he was samuel marlowe if he didnt know it could be proved against him  are you my nephew samuel said mrs hignett  yes said sam  well what are you doing in my house  its my house said mr bennett for the summer henry mortimers and mine isnt that right henry  dead right said mr mortimer  there said mr bennett you hear and when henry mortimer says a thing its so theres nobodys word id take before henry mortimers  when rufus bennett makes an assertion said mr mortimer highly flattered by these kind words you can bank on it rufus bennetts word is his bond rufus bennett is a white man  the two old friends reconciled once more clasped hands with a good deal of feeling  i am not disputing mr bennetts claim to belong to the caucasian race said mrs hignett testily i merely maintain that this house is m  yes yes yes yes interrupted jane you can thresh all that out some other time the point is if this fellow is your nephew i dont see what we can do well have to let him go  i came to this house said sam raising his vizor to facilitate speech to make a social call  at this hour of the night snapped mrs hignett you always were an inconsiderate boy samuel  i came to inquire after poor eustaces mumps ive only just heard that the poor chap was ill  hes getting along quite well said jane melting if i had known you were so fond of eustace  all right is he said sam  well not quite all right but hes going on very nicely  fine  eustace and i are engaged you know  no really splendid i cant see you very distinctlyhow those johnnies in the old days ever contrived to put up a scrap with things like this on their heads beats mebut you sound a good sort i hope youll be very happy  thank you ever so much mr marlowe im sure we shall  eustace is one of the best  how nice of you to say so  all this interrupted mrs hignett who had been a chaffing auditor of this interchange of courtesies is beside the point why did you dance in the hall samuel and play the orchestrion  yes said mr bennett reminded of his grievance waking people up  scaring us all to death complained mr mortimer  i remember you as a boy samuel said mrs hignett lamentably lacking in consideration for others and concentrated only on your selfish pleasures you seem to have altered very little  dont ballyrag the poor man said jane hubbard be human lend him a sardine opener  i shall do nothing of the sort said mrs hignett i never liked him and i dislike him now he has got himself into this trouble through his own wrongheadedness  its not his fault his heads the wrong size said jane  he must get himself out as best he can said mrs hignett  very well said sam with bitter dignity then i will not trespass further on your hospitality aunt adeline i have no doubt the local blacksmith will be able to get this damned thing off me i shall go to him now i will let you have the helmet back by parcelpost at the earliest opportunity goodnight he walked coldly to the front door and there are people he remarked sardonically who say that blood is thicker than water ill bet they never had any aunts  he tripped over the mat and withdrew   § 6  billie meanwhile with bream trotting docilely at her heels had reached the garage and started the car like all cars which have been spending a considerable time in secluded inaction it did not start readily at each application of billies foot on the selfstarter it emitted a tinny and reproachful sound and then seemed to go to sleep again eventually however the engines began to revolve and the machine moved reluctantly out into the drive  the battery must be run down said billie  all right said bream  billie cast a glance of contempt at him out of the corner of her eyes she hardly knew why she had spoken to him except that as all motorists are aware the impulse to say rude things about their battery is almost irresistible to a motorist the art of conversation consists in rapping out scathing remarks either about the battery or the oilingsystem  billie switched on the headlights and turned the car down the dark drive she was feeling thoroughly upset her idealistic nature had received a painful shock on the discovery of the yellow streak in bream to call it a yellow streak was to understate the facts it was a great belt of saffron encircling his whole soul that she wilhelmina bennett who had gone through the world seeking a galahad should finish her career as the wife of a man who hid under beds simply because people shot at him with elephant guns was abhorrent to her why samuel marlowe would have perished rather than do such a thing you might say what you liked about samuel marloweand of course his habit of playing practical jokes put him beyond the palebut nobody could question his courage look at the way he had dived overboard that time in the harbour at new york billie found herself thinking wistfully about samuel marlowe  there are only a few makes of car in which you can think about anything except the actual driving without stalling the engines and mr bennetts twinsix complex was not one of them it stopped as if it had been waiting for the signal the noise of the engine died away the wheels ceased to revolve the car did everything except lie down it was a particularly pigheaded car and right from the start it had been unable to see the sense in this midnight expedition it seemed now to have the idea that if it just lay low and did nothing presently it would be taken back to its cosy garage  billie trod on the selfstarter nothing happened  youll have to get down and crank her she said curtly  all right said bream  well go on said billie impatiently  eh  get out and crank her  bream emerged for an instant from his trance  all right he said  the art of cranking a car is one that is not given to all men some of our greatest and wisest stand helpless before the task it is a job towards the consummation of which a noble soul and a fine brain help not at all a man may have all the other gifts and yet be unable to accomplish a task which the fellow at the garage does with one quiet flick of the wrist without even bothering to remove his chewing gum this being so it was not only unkind but foolish of billie to grow impatient as breams repeated efforts failed of their object it was wrong of her to click her tongue and certainly she ought not to have told bream that he was not fit to churn butter but women are an emotional sex and must be forgiven much in moments of mental stress  give it a good sharp twist she said  all right said bream  here let me do it cried billie  she jumped down and snatched the thingummy from his hand with bent brows and set teeth she wrenched it round the engine gave a faint protesting mutter like a dog that has been disturbed in its sleep and was still once more  may i help  it was not bream who spoke but a strange voicea sepulchral voice the sort of voice someone would have used in one of edgar allen poes cheerful little tales if he had been buried alive and were speaking from the family vault coming suddenly out of the night it affected bream painfully he uttered a sharp exclamation and gave a bound which if he had been a russian dancer would undoubtedly have caused the management to raise his salary he was in no frame of mind to bear up under sudden sepulchral voices  billie on the other hand was pleased the highspirited girl was just beginning to fear that she was unequal to the task which she had chided bream for being unable to perform and this was mortifying her  oh would you mind thank you so much the selfstarter has gone wrong  into the glare of the headlights there stepped a strange figure strange that is to say in these tame modern times in the middle ages he would have excited no comment at all passers by would simply have said to themselves ah another of those knights off after the dragons and would have gone on their way with a civil greeting but in the present age it is always somewhat startling to see a helmeted head pop up in front of your motor car at any rate it startled bream i will go further it gave bream the shock of a lifetime he had had shocks already that night but none to be compared with this or perhaps it was that this shock coming on top of those shocks affected him more disastrously than it would have done if it had been the first of the series instead of the last one may express the thing briefly by saying that as far as bream was concerned sams unconventional appearance put the lid on it he did not hesitate he did not pause to make comments or ask questions with a single catlike screech which took years off the lives of the abruptly wakened birds roosting in the neighbouring trees he dashed away towards the house and reaching his room locked the door and pushed the bed the chest of drawers two chairs the towel stand and three pairs of boots against it  out on the drive billie was staring at the man in armour who had now with a masterful wrench which informed the car right away that he would stand no nonsense set the engine going again  whywhy she stammered why are you wearing that thing on your head  because i cant get it off  hollow as the voice was billie recognised it  smr marlowe she exclaimed  get in said sam he had seated himself at the steering wheel where can i take you  go away said billie  get in  i dont want to talk to you  i want to talk to you get in  i wont  sam bent over the side of the car put his hands under her arms lifted her like a kitten and deposited her on the seat beside him then throwing in the clutch he drove at an everincreasing speed down the drive and out into the silent road strange creatures of the night came and went in the golden glow of the headlights   § 7  put me down said billie  youd get hurt if i did travelling at this pace  what are you going to do  drive about till you promise to marry me  youll have to drive a long time  right ho said sam  the car took a corner and purred down a lane billie reached out a hand and grabbed at the steering wheel  of course if you want to smash up in a ditch said sam righting the car with a wrench  youre a brute said billie  caveman stuff explained sam i ought to have tried it before  i dont know what you expect to gain by this  thats all right said sam i know what im about  im glad to hear it  i thought you would be  im not going to talk to you  all right lean back and doze off weve the whole night before us  what do you mean cried billie sitting up with a jerk  have you ever been to scotland  what do you mean  i thought we might push up there weve got to go somewhere and oddly enough ive never been to scotland  billie regarded him blankly  are you crazy  im crazy about you if you knew what ive gone through tonight for your sake youd be more sympathetic i love you said sam swerving to avoid a rabbit and whats more you know it  i dont care  you will said sam confidently how about north wales ive heard people speak well of north wales shall we head for north wales  im engaged to bream mortimer  oh no thats all off sam assured her  its not  right off said sam firmly you could never bring yourself to marry a man who dashed away like that and deserted you in your hour of need why for all he knew i might have tried to murder you and he ran away no no we eliminate bream mortimer once and for all he wont do  this was so exactly what billie was feeling herself that she could not bring herself to dispute it  anyway i hate you she said giving the conversation another turn  why in the name of goodness why  how dared you make a fool of me in your fathers office that morning  it was a sudden inspiration i had to do something to make you think well of me and i thought it might meet the case if i saved you from a lunatic with a pistol it wasnt my fault that you found out  i shall never forgive you  why not cornwall said sam the riviera of england lets go to cornwall i beg your pardon what were you saying  i said i should never forgive you and i wont  well i hope youre fond of motoring said sam because were going on till you do  very well go on then  i intend to of course its all right now while its dark but have you considered what is going to happen when the sun gets up we shall have a sort of triumphal procession how the small boys will laugh when they see a man in a helmet go by in a car i shant notice them myself because its a little difficult to notice anything from inside this thing but im afraid it will be rather unpleasant for you i know what well do well go to london and drive up and down piccadilly that will be fun  there was a long silence  is my helmet on straight said sam  billie made no reply she was looking before her down the hedgebordered road always a girl of sudden impulses she had just made a curious discovery to wit that she was enjoying herself there was something so novel and exhilarating about this midnight ride that imperceptibly her dismay and resentment had ebbed away she found herself struggling with a desire to laugh  lochinvar said sam suddenly thats the name of the chap ive been trying to think of did you ever read about lochinvar young lochinvar the poet calls him rather familiarly he did just what im doing now and everybody thought very highly of him i suppose in those days a helmet was just an ordinary part of what the welldressed man should wear odd how fashions change  till now dignity and wrath combined had kept billie from making any inquiries into a matter which had excited in her a quite painful curiosity in her new mood she resisted the impulse no longer  why are you wearing that thing  i told you purely and simply because i cant get it off you dont suppose im trying to set a new style in gents headwear do you  but why did you ever put it on  well it was this way after i came out of the cupboard in the drawingroom  what  didnt i tell you about that oh yes i was sitting in the cupboard in the drawingroom from dinnertime onwards after that i came out and started cannoning about among aunt adelines china so i thought id better switch the light on unfortunately i switched on some sort of musical instrument instead and then somebody started shooting so what with one thing and another i thought it would be best to hide somewhere i hid in one of the suits of armour in the hall  were you inside there all the time we were  yes i say that was funny about bream wasnt it getting under the bed i mean  dont lets talk about bream  thats the right spirit i like to see it all right we wont lets get back to the main issue will you marry me  but why did you come to the house at all  to see you  to see me at that time of night  well perhaps not actually to see you sam was a little perplexed for a moment something told him that it would be injudicious to reveal his true motive and thereby risk disturbing the harmony which he felt had begun to exist between them to be near you to be in the same house with you he went on vehemently feeling that he had struck the right note you dont know the anguish i went through after i read that letter of yours i was mad i was  well to return to the point will you marry me  billie sat looking straight before her the car now on the main road moved smoothly on  will you marry me  billie rested her hand on her chin and searched the darkness with thoughtful eyes  will you marry me  the car raced on  will you marry me said sam will you marry me will you marry me  oh dont talk like a parrot cried billie it reminds me of bream  but will you  yes said billie  sam brought the car to a standstill with a jerk probably very bad for the tyres  did you say yes  yes  darling said sam leaning towards her oh curse this helmet  why  well i rather wanted to kiss you and it hampers me  let me try and get it off bend down  ouch said sam  its coming there how helpless men are  we need a womans tender care said sam depositing the helmet on the floor of the car and rubbing his smarting ears billie  sam  you angel  youre rather a darling after all said billie but you want keeping in order she added severely  you will do that when were married when were married he repeated luxuriously how splendid it sounds  the only trouble is said billie father wont hear of it  no he wont not till it is all over said sam  he started the car again  what are you going to do said billie where are you going  to london said sam it may be news to you but the old lawyer like myself knows that by going to doctors commons or the court of arches or somewhere or by routing the archbishop of canterbury out of bed or something you can get a special licence and be married almost before you know where you are my schemeroughlyis to dig this special licence out of whoever keeps such things have a bit of breakfast and then get married at our leisure before lunch at a registrars  oh not a registrars said billie  no  i should hate a registrars  very well angel just as you say well go to a church there are millions of churches in london ive seen them all over the place he mused for a moment yes youre quite right he said a church is the thing itll please webster  webster  yes hes rather keen on the church bells never having rung out so blithe a peal before and we must consider websters feelings after all he brought us together  webster how  oh ill tell you all about that some other time said sam just for the moment i want to sit quite still and think are you comfortable fine then off we go  the birds in the trees fringing the road stirred and twittered grumpily as the noise of the engine disturbed their slumbers but if they had only known it they were in luck at any rate the worst had not befallen them for sam was too happy to sing  the end
