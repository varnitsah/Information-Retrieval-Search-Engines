of april os 1711 his parents were then residing in the parish of the tron church apparently on a visit to the scottish capital as the small estate which his father joseph hume or home inherited lay in berwickshire on the banks of the whitadder or whitewater a few miles from the border and within sight of english ground the paternal mansion was little more than a very modest farmhouse1 and the property derived its name of ninewells from a considerable spring which breaks out on the slope in front of the house and falls into the whitadder  both mother and father came of good scottish familiesthe paternal line running back to lord home of douglas who went over to france with the douglas during the french wars of henry v and vi and was killed at the battle of verneuil joseph hume died when david was an infant leaving himself and two elder children a brother and a sister to the care of their mother who is described by david hume in my own life as a woman of singular merit who though young and handsome devoted herself entirely to the rearing and education of her children mr burton says her portrait which i have seen represents a thin but pleasing countenance expressive of great intellectual acuteness and as hume told dr black that she had precisely the same constitution with himself and died of the disorder which proved fatal to him it is probable that the qualities inherited from his mother had much to do with the future philosophers eminence it is curious however that her estimate of her son in her only recorded and perhaps slightly apocryphal utterance is of a somewhat unexpected character our davies a fine goodnatured crater but uncommon wakeminded the first part of the judgment was indeed verified by davies whole life but one might seek in vain for signs of what is commonly understood as weakness of mind in a man who not only showed himself to be an intellectual athlete but who had an eminent share of practical wisdom and tenacity of purpose one would like to know however when it was that mrs hume committed herself to this not too flattering judgment of her younger son for as hume reached the mature age of four and thirty before he obtained any employment of sufficient importance to convert the meagre pittance of a middling lairds younger brother into a decent maintenance it is not improbable that a shrewd scots wife may have thought his devotion to philosophy and poverty to be due to mere infirmity of purpose but she lived till 1749 long enough to see more than the dawn of her sons literary fame and official importance and probably changed her mind about davies force of character  david hume appears to have owed little to schools or universities there is some evidence that he entered the greek class in the university of edinburgh in 1723when he was a boy of twelve years of agebut it is not known how long his studies were continued and he did not graduate in 1727 at any rate he was living at ninewells and already possessed by that love of learning and thirst for literary fame which as my own life tells us was the ruling passion of his life and the chief source of his enjoyments a letter of this date addressed to his friend michael ramsay is certainly a most singular production for a boy of sixteen after sundry quotations from virgil the letter proceeds       the perfectly wise man that outbraves fortune is much greater      than the husbandman who slips by her and indeed this pastoral      and saturnian happiness i have in a great measure come at just now      i live like a king pretty much by myself neither full of action      nor perturbationmolles somnos this state however i can      foresee is not to be relied on my peace of mind is not      sufficiently confirmed by philosophy to withstand the blows of      fortune this greatness and elevation of soul is to be found only      in study and contemplation this alone can teach us to look down on      human accidents you must allow me to talk thus like a      philosopher tis a subject i think much on and could talk all day      long of  if david talked in this strain to his mother her tongue probably gave utterance to bless the bairn and in her private soul the epithet wakeminded may then have recorded itself but though few lonely thoughtful studious boys of sixteen give vent to their thoughts in such stately periods it is probable that the brooding over an ideal is commoner at this age than fathers and mothers busy with the cares of practical life are apt to imagine  about a year later humes family tried to launch him into the profession of the law but as he tells us while they fancied i was poring upon voet and vinnius cicero and virgil were the authors which i was secretly devouring and the attempt seems to have come to an abrupt termination nevertheless as a very competent authority2 wisely remarks       there appear to have been in hume all the elements of which a good      lawyer is made clearness of judgment power of rapidly acquiring      knowledge untiring industry and dialectic skill and if his mind      had not been preoccupied he might have fallen into the gulf in      which many of the worlds greatest geniuses lie      buriedprofessional eminence and might have left behind him a      reputation limited to the traditional recollections of the      parliament house or associated with important decisions he was      through life an able clearheaded man of business and i have      seen several legal documents written in his own hand and evidently      drawn by himself they stand the test of general professional      observation and their writer by preparing documents of facts of      such a character on his own responsibility showed that he had      considerable confidence in his ability to adhere to the forms      adequate for the occasion he talked of it as an ancient prejudice      industriously propagated by the dunces in all countries that a      man of genius is unfit for business and he showed in his      general conduct through life that he did not choose to come      voluntarily under this proscription  six years longer hume remained at ninewells before he made another attempt to embark in a practical careerthis time commerceand with a like result for a few months trial proved that kind of life also to be hopelessly against the grain  it was while in london on his way to bristol where he proposed to commence his mercantile life that hume addressed to some eminent london physician probably as mr burton suggests dr george cheyne a remarkable letter whether it was ever sent seems doubtful but it shows that philosophers as well as poets have their werterian crises and it presents an interesting parallel to john stuart mills record of the corresponding period of his youth the letter is too long to be given in full but a few quotations may suffice to indicate its importance to those who desire to comprehend the man       you must know then that from my earliest infancy i found always a      strong inclination to books and letters as our college education      in scotland extending little further than the languages ends      commonly when we are about fourteen or fifteen years of age i was      after that left to my own choice in my reading and found it      incline me almost equally to books of reasoning and philosophy and      to poetry and the polite authors every one who is acquainted      either with the philosophers or critics knows that there is      nothing yet established in either of these two sciences and that      they contain little more than endless disputes even in the most      fundamental articles upon examination of these i found a certain      boldness of temper growing on me which was not inclined to submit      to any authority in these subjects but led me to seek out some new      medium by which truth might be established after much study and      reflection on this at last when i was about eighteen years of      age there seemed to be opened up to me a new scene of thought      which transported me beyond measure and made me with an ardour      natural to young men throw up every other pleasure or business to      apply entirely to it the law which was the business i designed to      follow appeared nauseous to me and i could think of no other way      of pushing my fortune in the world but that of a scholar and      philosopher i was infinitely happy in this course of life for some      months till at last about the beginning of september 1729 all      my ardour seemed in a moment to be extinguished and i could no      longer raise my mind to that pitch which formerly gave me such      excessive pleasure  this decline of soul hume attributes in part to his being smitten with the beautiful representations of virtue in the works of cicero seneca and plutarch and being thereby led to discipline his temper and his will along with his reason and understanding       i was continually fortifying myself with reflections against      death and poverty and shame and pain and all the other      calamities of life  and he adds very characteristically       these no doubt are exceeding useful when joined with an active      life because the occasion being presented along with the      reflection works it into the soul and makes it take a deep      impression but in solitude they serve to little other purpose      than to waste the spirits the force of the mind meeting no      resistance but wasting itself in the air like our arm when it      misses its aim  along with all this mental perturbation symptoms of scurvy a disease now almost unknown among landsmen but which in the days of winter salt meat before root crops flourished in the lothians greatly plagued our forefathers made their appearance and indeed it may be suspected that physical conditions were at first at the bottom of the whole business for in 1731 a ravenous appetite set in and in six weeks from being tall lean and rawboned hume says he became sturdy and robust with a ruddy complexion and a cheerful countenanceeating sleeping and feeling well except that the capacity for intense mental application seemed to be gone he therefore determined to seek out a more active life and though he could not and would not quit his pretensions to learning but with his last breath he resolved to lay them aside for some time in order the more effectually to resume them  the careers open to a poor scottish gentleman in those days were very few and as humes option lay between a travelling tutorship and a stool in a merchants office he chose the latter       and having got recommendation to a considerable trader in bristol      i am just now hastening thither with a resolution to forget      myself and everything that is past to engage myself as far as is      possible in that course of life and to toss about the world from      one pole to the other till i leave this distemper behind me3  but it was all of no usenature would have her wayand in the middle of 1736 david hume aged twentythree without a profession or any assured means of earning a guinea and having doubtless by his apparent vacillation but real tenacity of purpose once more earned the title of wakeminded at home betook himself to a foreign country       i went over to france with a view of prosecuting my studies in a      country retreat and there i laid that plan of life which i have      steadily and successfully pursued i resolved to make a very rigid      frugality supply my deficiency of fortune to maintain unimpaired      my independency and to regard every object as contemptible except      the improvement of my talents in literature4  hume passed through paris on his way to rheims where he resided for some time though the greater part of his three years stay was spent at la flêche in frequent intercourse with the jesuits of the famous college in which descartes was educated here he composed his first work the treatise of human nature though it would appear from the following passage in the letter to cheyne that he had been accumulating materials to that end for some years before he left scotland       i found that the moral philosophy transmitted to us by antiquity      laboured under the same inconvenience that has been found in their      natural philosophy of being entirely hypothetical and depending      more upon invention than experience every one consulted his fancy      in erecting schemes of virtue and happiness without regarding      human nature upon which every moral conclusion must depend  this is the keynote of the treatise of which hume himself says apologetically in one of his letters that it was planned before he was twentyone and composed before he had reached the age of twentyfive5  under these circumstances it is probably the most remarkable philosophical work both intrinsically and in its effects upon the course of thought that has ever been written berkeley indeed published the essay towards a new theory of vision the treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge and the three dialogues between the ages of twentyfour and twentyeight and thus comes very near to hume both in precocity and in influence but his investigations are more limited in their scope than those of his scottish contemporary  the first and second volumes of the treatise containing book i of the understanding and book ii of the passions were published in january 17396 the publisher gave fifty pounds for the copyright which is probably more than an unknown writer of twentyseven years of age would get for a similar work at the present time but in other respects its success fell far short of humes expectations in a letter dated the 1st of june 1739 he writes       i am not much in the humour of such compositions at present      having received news from london of the success of my philosophy      which is but indifferent if i may judge by the sale of the book      and if i may believe my bookseller  this however indicates a very different reception from that which hume looking through the inverted telescope of old age ascribes to the treatise in my own life       never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my treatise of      human nature it fell deadborn from the press without reaching      such a distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots  as a matter of fact it was fully and on the whole respectfully and appreciatively reviewed in the history of the works of the learned for november 17397 whoever the reviewer may have been he was a man of discernment for he says that the work bears incontestable marks of a great capacity of a soaring genius but young and not yet thoroughly practised and he adds that we shall probably have reason to consider this compared with the later productions in the same light as we view the juvenile works of a milton or the first manner of a raphael or other celebrated painter in a letter to hutcheson hume merely speaks of this article as somewhat abusive so that his vanity being young and callow seems to have been correspondingly widemouthed and hard to satiate  it must be confessed that on this occasion no less than on that of his other publications hume exhibits no small share of the craving after mere notoriety and vulgar success as distinct from the pardonable if not honourable ambition for solid and enduring fame which would have harmonised better with his philosophy indeed it appears to be by no means improbable that this peculiarity of humes moral constitution was the cause of his gradually forsaking philosophical studies after the publication of the third part on morals of the treatise in 1740 and turning to those political and historical topics which were likely to yield and did in fact yield a much better return of that sort of success which his soul loved the philosophical essays concerning the human understanding which afterwards became the inquiry is not much more than an abridgment and recast for popular use of parts of the treatise with the addition of the essays on miracles and on necessity in style it exhibits a great improvement on the treatise but the substance if not deteriorated is certainly not improved hume does not really bring his mature powers to bear upon his early speculations in the later work the crude fruits have not been ripened but they have been ruthlessly pruned away along with the branches which bore them the result is a pretty shrub enough but not the tree of knowledge with its roots firmly fixed in fact its branches perennially budding forth into new truths which hume might have reared perhaps after all worthy mrs hume was in the highest sense right davie was wakeminded not to see that the world of philosophy was his to overrun and subdue if he would but persevere in the work he had begun but nohe must needs turn aside for success and verily he had his reward but not the crown he might have won  in 1740 hume seems to have made an acquaintance which rapidly ripened into a life long friendship adam smith was at that time a boy student of seventeen at the university of glasgow and hume sends a copy of the treatise to mr smith apparently on the recommendation of the wellknown hutcheson professor of moral philosophy in the university it is a remarkable evidence of adam smiths early intellectual development that a youth of his age should be thought worthy of such a present  in 1741 hume published anonymously at edinburgh the first volume of essays moral and political which was followed in 1742 by the second volume  these pieces are written in an admirable style and though arranged without apparent method a system of political philosophy may be gathered from their contents thus the third essay that politics may be reduced to a science defends that thesis and dwells on the importance of forms of government       so great is the force of laws and of particular forms of      government and so little dependence have they on the humours and      tempers of men that consequences almost as general and certain may      sometimes be deduced from them as any which the mathematical      sciences afford usiii 15 see p 45  hume proceeds to exemplify the evils which inevitably flow from universal suffrage from aristocratic privilege and from elective monarchy by historical examples and concludes       that an hereditary prince a nobility without vassals and a      people voting by their representatives form the best monarchy      aristocracy and democracyiii 18  if we reflect that the following passage of the same essay was written nearly a century and a half ago it would seem that whatever other changes may have taken place political warfare remains in statu quo       those who either attack or defend a minister in such a government      as ours where the utmost liberty is allowed always carry matters      to an extreme and exaggerate his merit or demerit with regard to      the public his enemies are sure to charge him with the greatest      enormities both in domestic and foreign management and there is      no meanness or crime of which in their judgment he is not      capable unnecessary wars scandalous treaties profusion of public      treasure oppressive taxes every kind of maladministration is      ascribed to him to aggravate the charge his pernicious conduct      it is said will extend its baneful influence even to posterity by      undermining the best constitution in the world and disordering      that wise system of laws institutions and customs by which our      ancestors during so many centuries have been so happily governed      he is not only a wicked minister in himself but has removed every      security provided against wicked ministers for the future       on the other hand the partisans of the minister make his      panegyric rise as high as the accusation against him and celebrate      his wise steady and moderate conduct in every part of his      administration the honour and interest of the nation supported      abroad public credit maintained at home persecution restrained      faction subdued the merit of all these blessings is ascribed      solely to the minister at the same time he crowns all his other      merits by a religious care of the best government in the world      which he has preserved in all its parts and has transmitted      entire to be the happiness and security of the latest      posterityiii 26  hume sagely remarks that the panegyric and the accusation cannot both be true and that what truth there may be in either rather tends to show that our muchvaunted constitution does not fulfil its chief object which is to provide a remedy against maladministration and if it does not       we are rather beholden to any minister who undermines it and      affords us the opportunity of erecting a better in its      placeiii 28  the fifth essay discusses the origin of government       man born in a family is compelled to maintain society from      necessity from natural inclination and from habit the same      creature in his farther progress is engaged to establish      political society in order to administer justice without which      there can be no peace among them nor safety nor mutual      intercourse we are therefore to look upon all the vast apparatus      of our government as having ultimately no other object or purpose      but the distribution of justice or in other words the support of      the twelve judges kings and parliaments fleets and armies      officers of the court and revenue ambassadors ministers and privy      councillors are all subordinate in the end to this part of      administration even the clergy as their duty leads them to      inculcate morality may justly be thought so far as regards this      world to have no other useful object of their institutioniii      37  the police theory of government has never been stated more tersely and if there were only one state in the world and if we could be certain by intuition or by the aid of revelation that it is wrong for society as a corporate body to do anything for the improvement of its members and thereby indirectly support the twelve judges no objection could be raised to it  unfortunately the existence of rival or inimical nations furnishes kings and parliaments fleets and armies with a good deal of occupation beyond the support of the twelve judges and though the proposition that the state has no business to meddle with anything but the administration of justice seems sometimes to be regarded as an axiom it can hardly be said to be intuitively certain inasmuch as a great many people absolutely repudiate it while as yet the attempt to give it the authority of a revelation has not been made  as hume says with profound truth in the fourth essay on the first principles of government       as force is always on the side of the governed the governors have      nothing to support them but opinion it is therefore on opinion      only that government is founded and this maxim extends to the most      despotic and most military governments as well as to the most free      and the most populariii 31  but if the whole fabric of social organisation rests on opinion it may surely be fairly argued that in the interests of selfpreservation if for no better reason society has a right to see that the means of forming just opinions are placed within the reach of every one of its members and therefore that due provision for education at any rate is a right and indeed a duty of the state  the three opinions upon which all government or the authority of the few over the many is founded says hume are public interest right to power and right to property no government can permanently exist unless the majority of the citizens who are the ultimate depositary of force are convinced that it serves the general interest that it has lawful authority and that it respects individual rights       a government may endure for several ages though the balance of      power and the balance of property do not coincide but where the      original constitution allows any share of power though small to      an order of men who possess a large share of property it is easy      for them gradually to stretch their authority and bring the      balance of power to coincide with that of property this has been      the case with the house of commons in englandiii 34  hume then points out that in his time the authority of the commons was by no means equivalent to the property and power it represented and proceeds       were the members obliged to receive instructions from their      constituents like the dutch deputies this would entirely alter      the case and if such immense power and riches as those of all the      commons of great britain were brought into the scale it is not      easy to conceive that the crown could either influence that      multitude of people or withstand that balance of property it is      true the crown has great influence over the collective body in the      elections of members but were this influence which at present is      only exerted once in seven years to be employed in bringing over      the people to every vote it would soon be wasted and no skill      popularity or revenue could support it i must therefore be of      opinion that an alteration in this particular would introduce a      total alteration in our government would soon reduce it to a pure      republic and perhaps to a republic of no inconvenient      formiii 35  viewed by the light of subsequent events this is surely a very remarkable example of political sagacity the members of the house of commons are not yet delegates but with the widening of the suffrage and the rapidly increasing tendency to drill and organise the electorate and to exact definite pledges from candidates they are rapidly becoming if not delegates at least attorneys for committees of electors the same causes are constantly tending to exclude men who combine a keen sense of selfrespect with large intellectual capacity from a position in which the one is as constantly offended as the other is neutralised notwithstanding the attempt of george the third to resuscitate the royal authority humes foresight has been so completely justified that no one now dreams of the crown exerting the slightest influence upon elections  in the seventh essay hume raises a very interesting discussion as to the probable ultimate result of the forces which were at work in the british constitution in the first part of the eighteenth century       there has been a sudden and sensible change in the opinions of      men within these last fifty years by the progress of learning and      of liberty most people in this island have divested themselves of      all superstitious reverence to names and authority the clergy have      much lost their credit their pretensions and doctrines have been      much ridiculed and even religion can scarcely support itself in      the world the mere name of king commands little respect and to      talk of a king as gods vicegerent on earth or to give him any of      those magnificent titles which formerly dazzled mankind would but      excite laughter in every oneiii 54  in fact at the present day the danger to monarchy in britain would appear to lie not in increasing love for equality for which except as regards the law englishmen have never cared but rather entertain an aversion nor in any abstract democratic theories upon which the mass of englishmen pour the contempt with which they view theories in general but in the constantly increasing tendency of monarchy to become slightly absurd from the everwidening discrepancy between modern political ideas and the theory of kingship as hume observes even in his time people had left off making believe that a king was a different species of man from other men and since his day more and more such makebelieves have become impossible until the maintenance of kingship in coming generations seems likely to depend entirely upon whether it is the general opinion that a hereditary president of our virtual republic will serve the general interest better than an elective one or not the tendency of public feeling in this direction is patent but it does not follow that a republic is to be the final stage of our government in fact hume thinks not       it is well known that every government must come to a period and      that death is unavoidable to the political as well as to the      animal body but as one kind of death may be preferable to      another it may be inquired whether it be more desirable for the      british constitution to terminate in a popular government or in an      absolute monarchy here i would frankly declare that though      liberty be preferable to slavery in almost every case yet i      should rather wish to see an absolute monarch than a republic in      this island for let us consider what kind of republic we have      reason to expect the question is not concerning any fine imaginary      republic of which a man forms a plan in his closet there is no      doubt but a popular government may be imagined more perfect than      an absolute monarchy or even than our present constitution but      what reason have we to expect that any such government will ever be      established in great britain upon the dissolution of our monarchy      if any single person acquire power enough to take our constitution      to pieces and put it up anew he is really an absolute monarch      and we have already had an instance of this kind sufficient to      convince us that such a person will never resign his power or      establish any free government matters therefore must be trusted      to their natural progress and operation and the house of commons      according to its present constitution must be the only legislature      in such a popular government the inconveniences attending such a      situation of affairs present themselves by thousands if the house      of commons in such a case ever dissolve itself which is not to      be expected we may look for a civil war every election if it      continue itself we shall suffer all the tyranny of a faction      subdivided into new factions and as such a violent government      cannot long subsist we shall at last after many convulsions and      civil wars find repose in absolute monarchy which it would have      been happier for us to have established peaceably from the      beginning absolute monarchy therefore is the easiest death the      true euthanasia of the british constitution       thus if we have more reason to be jealous of monarchy because the      danger is more imminent from that quarter we have also reason to      be more jealous of popular government because that danger is more      terrible this may teach us a lesson of moderation in all our      political controversiesiii 55  one may admire the sagacity of these speculations and the force and clearness with which they are expressed without altogether agreeing with them that an analogy between the social and bodily organism exists and is in many respects clear and full of instructive suggestion is undeniable yet a state answers not to an individual but to a generic type and there is no reason in the nature of things why any generic type should die out the type of the pearly nautilus highly organised as it is has persisted with but little change from the silurian epoch till now and so long as terrestrial conditions remain approximately similar to what they are at present there is no more reason why it should cease to exist in the next than in the past hundred million years or so the true ground for doubting the possibility of the establishment of absolute monarchy in britain is that opinion seems to have passed through and left far behind the stage at which such a change would be possible and the true reason for doubting the permanency of a republic if it is ever established lies in the fact that a republic requires for its maintenance a far higher standard of morality and of intelligence in the members of the state than any other form of government samuel gave the israelites a king because they were not righteous enough to do without one with a pretty plain warning of what they were to expect from the gift and up to this time the progress of such republics as have been established in the world has not been such as to lead to any confident expectation that their foundation is laid on a sufficiently secure subsoil of public spirit morality and intelligence on the contrary they exhibit examples of personal corruption and of political profligacy as fine as any hotbed of despotism has ever produced while they fail in the primary duty of the administration of justice as none but an effete despotism has ever failed  hume has been accused of departing in his old age from the liberal principles of his youth and no doubt he was careful in the later editions of the essays to expunge everything that savoured of democratic tendencies but the passage just quoted shows that this was no recantation but simply a confirmation by his experience of one of the most debased periods of english history of those evil tendencies attendant on popular government of which from the first he was fully aware  in the ninth essay on the parties of great britain there occurs a passage which while it affords evidence of the marvellous change which has taken place in the social condition of scotland since 1741 contains an assertion respecting the state of the jacobite party at that time which at first seems surprising       as violent things have not commonly so long a duration as      moderate we actually find that the jacobite party is almost      entirely vanished from among us and that the distinction of      court and country which is but creeping in at london is the      only one that is ever mentioned in this kingdom beside the      violence and openness of the jacobite party another reason has      perhaps contributed to produce so sudden and so visible an      alteration in this part of britain there are only two ranks of men      among us gentlemen who have some fortune and education and the      meanest slaving poor without any considerable number of that      middling rank of men which abound more in england both in cities      and in the country than in any other part of the world the      slaving poor are incapable of any principles gentlemen may be      converted to true principles by time and experience the middling      rank of men have curiosity and knowledge enough to form principles      but not enough to form true ones or correct any prejudices that      they may have imbibed and it is among the middling rank of people      that tory principles do at present prevail most in englandiii      80 note  considering that the jacobite rebellion of 1745 broke out only four years after this essay was published the assertion that the jacobite party had almost entirely vanished in 1741 sounds strange enough and the passage which contains it is omitted in the third edition of the essays published in 1748 nevertheless hume was probably right as the outbreak of 45 was little better than a highland raid and the pretender obtained no important following in the lowlands  no less curious in comparison with what would be said nowadays is humes remark in the essay on the rise of the arts and sciences that       the english are become sensible of the scandalous licentiousness      of their stage from the example of the french decency and      moralsiii 135  and it is perhaps as surprising to be told by a man of humes literary power that the first polite prose in the english language was written by swift locke and temple with whom sprat is astoundingly conjoined knew too little of the rules of art to be esteemed elegant writers and the prose of bacon harrington and milton is altogether stiff and pedantic hobbes who whether he should be called a polite writer or not is a master of vigorous english clarendon addison and steele the last two surely were polite writers in all conscience are not mentioned  on the subject of national character about which more nonsense and often very mischievous nonsense has been and is talked than upon any other topic humes observations are full of sense and shrewdness he distinguishes between the moral and the physical causes of national character enumerating under the former       the nature of the government the revolutions of public affairs      the plenty or penury in which people live the situation of the      nation with regard to its neighbours and such like      circumstancesiii 225  and under the latter       those qualities of the air and climate which are supposed to work      insensibly on the temper by altering the tone and habit of the      body and giving a particular complexion which though reflexion      and reason may sometimes overcome it will yet prevail among the      generality of mankind and have an influence on their      mannersiii 225  while admitting and exemplifying the great influence of moral causes hume remarks       as to physical causes i am inclined to doubt altogether of their      operation in this particular nor do i think that men owe anything      of their temper or genius to the air food or climateiii      227  hume certainly would not have accepted the rice theory in explanation of the social state of the hindoos and it may be safely assumed that he would not have had recourse to the circumambience of the melancholy main to account for the troublous history of ireland he supports his views by a variety of strong arguments among which at the present conjuncture it is worth noting that the following occurs       where any accident as a difference in language or religion keeps      two nations inhabiting the same country from mixing with one      another they will preserve during several centuries a distinct and      even opposite set of manners the integrity gravity and bravery      of the turks form an exact contrast to the deceit levity and      cowardice of the modern greeksiii 233  the question of the influence of race which plays so great a part in modern political speculations was hardly broached in humes time but he had an inkling of its importance       i am apt to suspect the negroes to be naturally inferior to the      whites there scarcely ever was a civilised nation of that      complexion nor even any individual eminent either in action or      speculation such a uniform and constant difference between the      negroes and the whites could not happen in so many countries and      ages if nature had not made an original distinction between these      breeds of men in jamaica indeed they talk of one negro as a      man of parts and learning but it is likely he is admired for      slender accomplishments like a parrot who speaks a few words      plainlyiii 236  the essays met with the success they deserved hume wrote to henry home in june 1742       the essays are all sold in london as i am informed by two letters      from english gentlemen of my acquaintance there is a demand for      them and as one of them tells me innys the great bookseller in      pauls churchyard wonders there is not a new edition for he      cannot find copies for his customers i am also told that dr      butler has everywhere recommended them so that i hope that they      will have some success  hume had sent butler a copy of the treatise and had called upon him in london but he was out of town and being shortly afterwards made bishop of bristol hume seems to have thought that further advances on his part might not be well received  greatly comforted by this measure of success hume remained at ninewells rubbing up his greek until 1745 when at the mature age of thirtyfour he made his entry into practical life by becoming bearleader to the marquis of annandale a young nobleman of feeble body and feebler mind as might have been predicted this venture was not more fortunate than his previous ones and after a years endurance diversified latterly with pecuniary squabbles in which humes tenacity about a somewhat small claim is remarkable the engagement came to an end  footnotes  1 a picture of the house taken from drummonds history of noble british families is to be seen in chamberss book of days april 26th and if as drummond says it is a favourable specimen of the best scotch lairds houses all that can be said is worst scotch lairds must have been poorly lodged indeed  2 mr john hill burton in his valuable life of hume on which i need hardly say i have drawn freely for the materials of the present biographical sketch  3 one cannot but be reminded of young descartes renunciation of study for soldiering  4 my own life  5 letter to gilbert elliot of minto 1751 so vast an undertaking planned before i was oneandtwenty and composed before twentyfive must necessarily be very defective i have repented my haste a hundred and a hundred times  6 so says mr burton and that he is right is proved by a letter of humes dated february 13 1739 in which he writes tis now a fortnight since my book was published but it is a curious illustration of the value of testimony that hume in my own life states in the end of 1738 i published my treatise and immediately went down to my mother and my brother  7 burton life vol i p 109     chapter ii  later years the history of england   in 1744 humes friends had endeavoured to procure his nomination to the chair of ethics and pneumatic philosophy8 in the university of edinburgh about this matter he writes to his friend william mure       the accusation of heresy deism scepticism atheism c c      c was started against me but never took being bore down by the      contrary authority of all the good company in town  if the good company in town bore down the first three of these charges it is to be hoped for the sake of their veracity that they knew their candidate chiefly as the very good company that he always was and had paid as little attention as good company usually does to so solid a work as the treatise hume expresses a naïve surprise not unmixed with indignation that hutcheson and leechman both clergymen and sincere though liberal professors of orthodoxy should have expressed doubts as to his fitness for becoming a professedly presbyterian teacher of presbyterian youth the town council however would not have him and filled up the place with a safe nobody  in may 1746 a new prospect opened general st clair was appointed to the command of an expedition to canada and he invited hume at a weeks notice to be his secretary to which office that of judge advocate was afterwards added  hume writes to a friend the office is very genteel 10s a day perquisites and no expenses and to another he speculates on the chance of procuring a company in an american regiment but this i build not on nor indeed am i very fond of it he adds and this was fortunate for the expedition after dawdling away the summer in port was suddenly diverted to an attack on lorient where it achieved a huge failure and returned ignominiously to england  a letter to henry home written when this unlucky expedition was recalled shows that hume had already seriously turned his attention to history referring to an invitation to go over to flanders with the general he says       had i any fortune which would give me a prospect of leisure and      opportunity to prosecute my historical projects nothing could be      more useful to me and i should pick up more literary knowledge in      one campaign by being in the generals family and being introduced      frequently to the dukes than most officers could do after many      years service but to what can all this serve i am a philosopher      and so i suppose must continue  but this vaticination was shortly to prove erroneous hume seems to have made a very favourable impression on general st clair as he did upon every one with whom he came into personal contact for being charged with a mission to the court of turin in 1748 the general insisted upon the appointment of hume as his secretary he further made him one of his aidesdecamp so that the philosopher was obliged to encase his more than portly and by no means elegant figure in a military uniform lord charlemont who met him at turin says he was disguised in scarlet and that he wore his uniform like a grocer of the trainbands hume always ready for a joke at his own expense tells of the considerate kindness with which at a reception at vienna the empressdowager released him and his friends from the necessity of walking backwards we esteemed ourselves very much obliged to her for this attention especially my companions who were desperately afraid of my falling on them and crushing them  notwithstanding the many attractions of this appointment hume writes that he leaves home with infinite regret where i had treasured up stores of study and plans of thinking for many years and his only consolation is that the opportunity of becoming conversant with state affairs may be profitable       i shall have an opportunity of seeing courts and camps and if i      can afterward be so happy as to attain leisure and other      opportunities this knowledge may even turn to account to me as a      man of letters which i confess has always been the sole object of      my ambition i have long had an intention in my riper years of      composing some history and i question not but some greater      experience in the operations of the field and the intrigues of the      cabinet will be requisite in order to enable me to speak with      judgment on these subjects  hume returned to london in 1749 and during his stay there his mother died to his heartfelt sorrow a curious story in connection with this event is told by dr carlyle who knew hume well and whose authority is perfectly trustworthy       mr boyle hearing of it soon after went to his apartment for      they lodged in the same house where he found him in the deepest      affliction and in a flood of tears after the usual topics and      condolences mr boyle said to him my friend you owe this      uncommon grief to having thrown off the principles of religion for      if you had not you would have been consoled with the firm belief      that the good lady who was not only the best of mothers but the      most pious of christians was completely happy in the realms of the      just to which david replied though i throw out my speculations      to entertain the learned and metaphysical world yet in other      things i do not think so differently from the rest of the world as      you imagine  if hume had told this story to dr carlyle the latter would have said so it must therefore have come from mr boyle and one would like to have the opportunity of crossexamining that gentleman as to humes exact words and their context before implicitly accepting his version of the conversation mr boyles experience of mankind must have been small if he had not seen the firmest of believers overwhelmed with grief by a like loss and as completely inconsolable hume may have thrown off mr boyles principles of religion but he was none the less a very honest man perfectly open and candid and the last person to use ambiguous phraseology among his friends unless indeed he saw no other way of putting a stop to the intrusion of unmannerly twaddle amongst the bittersweet memories stirred in his affectionate nature by so heavy a blow  the philosophical essays or inquiry was published in 1748 while hume was away with general st clair and on his return to england he had the mortification to find it overlooked in the hubbub caused by middletons free inquiry and its bold handling of the topic of the essay on miracles by which hume doubtless expected the public to be startled  between 1749 and 1751 hume resided at ninewells with his brother and sister and busied himself with the composition of his most finished if not his most important works the dialogues on natural religion the inquiry concerning the principles of morals and the political discourses  the dialogues on natural religion were touched and retouched at intervals for a quarter of a century and were not published till after humes death but the inquiry concerning the principles of morals appeared in 1751 and the political discourses in 1752 full reference will be made to the two former in the exposition of humes philosophical views the last has been well said to be the cradle of political economy and much as that science has been investigated and expounded in later times these earliest shortest and simplest developments of its principles are still read with delight even by those who are masters of all the literature of this great subject9  the wealth of nations the masterpiece of humes close friend adam smith it must be remembered did not appear before 1776 so that in political economy no less than in philosophy hume was an original a daring and a fertile innovator  the political essays had a great and rapid success translated into french in 1753 and again in 1754 they conferred a european reputation upon their author and what was more to the purpose influenced the later french school of economists of the eighteenth century  by this time hume had not only attained a high reputation in the world of letters but he considered himself a man of independent fortune his frugal habits had enabled him to accumulate £1000 and he tells michael ramsay in 1751       while interest remains as at present i have £50 a year a hundred      pounds worth of books great store of linens and fine clothes and      near £100 in my pocket along with order frugality a strong      spirit of independency good health a contented humour and an      unabated love of study in these circumstances i must esteem myself      one of the happy and fortunate and so far from being willing to      draw my ticket over again in the lottery of life there are very      few prizes with which i would make an exchange after some      deliberation i am resolved to settle in edinburgh and hope i      shall be able with these revenues to say with horace        est bona librorum et provisæ frugis in annum      copia   it would be difficult to find a better example of the honourable independence and cheerful selfreliance which should distinguish a man of letters and which characterised hume throughout his career by honourable effort the boys noble ideal of life became the mans reality and at forty hume had the happiness of finding that he had not wasted his youth in the pursuit of illusions but that the solid certainty of waking bliss lay before him in the free play of his powers in their appropriate sphere  in 1751 hume removed to edinburgh and took up his abode on a flat in one of those prodigious houses in the lawnmarket which still excite the admiration of tourists afterwards moving to a house in the canongate his sister joined him adding £30 a year to the common stock and in one of his charmingly playful letters to dr clephane he thus describes his establishment in 1753       i shall exult and triumph to you a little that i have now at      lastbeing turned of forty to my own honour to that of learning      and to that of the present agearrived at the dignity of being a      householder       about seven months ago i got a house of my own and completed a      regular family consisting of a head viz myself and two      inferior members a maid and a cat my sister has since joined me      and keeps me company with frugality i can reach i find      cleanliness warmth light plenty and contentment what would you      have more independence i have it in a supreme degree honour      that is not altogether wanting grace that will come in time a      wife that is none of the indispensable requisites of life books      that is one of them and i have more than i can use in short i      cannot find any pleasure of consequence which i am not possessed of      in a greater or less degree and without any great effort of      philosophy i may be easy and satisfied       as there is no happiness without occupation i have begun a work      which will occupy me several years and which yields me much      satisfaction tis a history of britain from the union of the      crowns to the present time i have already finished the reign of      king james my friends flatter me by this i mean that they dont      flatter me that i have succeeded  in 1752 the faculty of advocates elected hume their librarian an office which though it yielded little emolumentthe salary was only forty pounds a yearwas valuable as it placed the resources of a large library at his disposal the proposal to give hume even this paltry place caused a great outcry on the old score of infidelity but as hume writes in a jubilant letter to clephane february 4 1752       i carried the election by a considerable majority what is more      extraordinary the cry of religion could not hinder the ladies from      being violently my partisans and i owe my success in a great      measure to their solicitations one has broke off all commerce with      her lover because he voted against me and mr lockhart in a      speech to the faculty said there was no walking the streets nor      even enjoying ones own fireside on account of their importunate      zeal the town says that even his bed was not safe for him though      his wife was cousingerman to my antagonist       twas vulgarly given out that the contest was between deists and      christians and when the news of my success came to the playhouse      the whisper rose that the christians were defeated are you not      surprised that we could keep our popularity notwithstanding this      imputation which my friends could not deny to be well founded  it would seem that the good company was less enterprising in its asseverations in this canvass than in the last  the first volume of the history of great britain containing the reign of james i and charles i was published in 1754 at first the sale was large especially in edinburgh and if notoriety per se was humes object he attained it but he liked applause as well as fame and to his bitter disappointment he says       i was assailed by one cry of reproach disapprobation and even      detestation english scotch and irish whig and tory churchman      and sectary freethinker and religionist patriot and courtier      united in their rage against the man who had presumed to shed a      generous tear for the fate of charles i and the earl of strafford      and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over what was      still more mortifying the book seemed to fall into oblivion mr      millar told me that in a twelvemonth he sold only fortyfive copies      of it i scarcely indeed heard of one man in the three kingdoms      considerable for rank or letters that could endure the book i      must only except the primate of england dr herring and the      primate of ireland dr stone which seem two odd exceptions these      dignified prelates separately sent me messages not to be      discouraged  it certainly is odd to think of david hume being comforted in his affliction by the independent and spontaneous sympathy of a pair of archbishops but the instincts of the dignified prelates guided them rightly for as the great painter of english history in whig pigments has been careful to point out10 humes historical picture though a great work drawn by a master hand has all the lights tory and all the shades whig  humes ecclesiastical enemies seem to have thought that their opportunity had now arrived and an attempt was made to get the general assembly of 1756 to appoint a committee to inquire into his writings but after a keen debate the proposal was rejected by fifty votes to seventeen hume does not appear to have troubled himself about the matter and does not even think it worth mention in my own life  in 1756 he tells clephane that he is worth £1600 sterling and consequently master of an income which must have been wealth to a man of his frugal habits in the same year he published the second volume of the history which met with a much better reception than the first and in 1757 one of his most remarkable works the natural history of religion appeared in the same year he resigned his office of librarian to the faculty of advocates and he projected removal to london probably to superintend the publication of the additional volume of the history       i shall certainly be in london next summer and probably to remain      there during life at least if i can settle myself to my mind      which i beg you to have an eye to a room in a sober discreet      family who would not be averse to admit a sober discreet      virtuous regular quiet goodnatured man of a bad charactersuch      a room i say would suit me extremely11  the promised visit took place in the latter part of the year 1758 and he remained in the metropolis for the greater part of 1759 the two volumes of the history of england under the house of tudor were published in london shortly after humes return to edinburgh and according to his own account they raised almost as great a clamour as the first two had done  busily occupied with the continuation of his historical labours hume remained in edinburgh until 1763 when at the request of lord hertford who was going as ambassador to france he was appointed to the embassy with the promise of the secretaryship and in the meanwhile performing the duties of that office at first hume declined the offer but as it was particularly honourable to so well abused a man on account of lord hertfords high reputation for virtue and piety12 and no less advantageous by reason of the increase of fortune which it secured to him he eventually accepted it  in france humes reputation stood far higher than in britain several of his works had been translated he had exchanged letters with montesquieu and with helvetius rousseau had appealed to him and the charming madame de boufflers had drawn him into a correspondence marked by almost passionate enthusiasm on her part and as fair an imitation of enthusiasm as hume was capable of on his in the extraordinary mixture of learning wit humanity frivolity and profligacy which then characterised the highest french society a new sensation was worth anything and it mattered little whether the cause thereof was a philosopher or a poodle so hume had a great success in the parisian world great nobles fêted him and great ladies were not content unless the gros david was to be seen at their receptions and in their boxes at the theatre at the opera his broad unmeaning face was usually to be seen entre deux jolis minois says lord charlemont13 humes cool head was by no means turned but he took the goods the gods provided with much satisfaction and everywhere won golden opinions by his unaffected good sense and thorough kindness of heart  over all this part of humes career as over the surprising episode of the quarrel with rousseau if that can be called quarrel which was lunatic malignity on rousseaus side and thorough generosity and patience on humes i may pass lightly the story is admirably told by mr burton to whose volumes i refer the reader nor need i dwell upon humes short tenure of office in london as undersecretary of state between 1767 and 1769 success and wealth are rarely interesting and humes case is no exception to the rule  according to his own description the cares of official life were not overwhelming       my way of life here is very uniform and by no means disagreeable      i have all the forenoon in the secretarys house from ten till      three when there arrive from time to time messengers that bring me      all the secrets of the kingdom and indeed of europe asia      africa and america i am seldom hurried but have leisure at      intervals to take up a book or write a private letter or converse      with a friend that may call for me and from dinner to bedtime is      all my own if you add to this that the person with whom i have the      chief if not only transactions is the most reasonable      equaltempered and gentlemanlike man imaginable and lady      aylesbury the same you will certainly think i have no reason to      complain and i am far from complaining i only shall not regret      when my duty is over because to me the situation can lead to      nothing at least in all probability and reading and sauntering      and lounging and dozing which i call thinking is my supreme      happinessi mean my full contentment  humes duty was soon over and he returned to edinburgh in 1769 very opulent in the possession of £1000 a year and determined to take what remained to him of life pleasantly and easily in october 1769 he writes to elliot       i have been settled here two months and am here body and soul      without casting the least thought of regret to london or even to      paris i live still and must for a twelvemonth in my old house      in jamess court which is very cheerful and even elegant but too      small to display my great talent for cookery the science to which      i intend to addict the remaining years of my life i have just now      lying on the table before me a receipt for making soupe à la      reine copied with my own hand for beef and cabbage a charming      dish and old mutton and old claret nobody excels me i make also      sheepshead broth in a manner that mr keith speaks of for eight      days after and the duc de nivernois would bind himself apprentice      to my lass to learn it i have already sent a challenge to david      moncreiff you will see that in a twelvemonth he will take to the      writing of history the field i have deserted for as to the giving      of dinners he can now have no further pretensions i should have      made a very bad use of my abode in paris if i could not get the      better of a mere provincial like him all my friends encourage me      in this ambition as thinking it will redound very much to my      honour  in 1770 hume built himself a house in the new town of edinburgh which was then springing up it was the first house in the street and a frolicsome young lady chalked upon the wall st davids street humes servant complained to her master who replied never mind lassie many a better man has been made a saint of before and the street retains its title to this day  in the following six years the house in st davids street was the centre of the accomplished and refined society which then distinguished edinburgh adam smith blair and ferguson were within easy reach and what remains of humes correspondence with sir gilbert elliot colonel edmonstone and mrs cockburn gives pleasant glimpses of his social surroundings and enables us to understand his contentment with his absence from the more perturbed if more brilliant worlds of paris and london  towards london londoners and indeed englishmen in general hume entertained a dislike mingled with contempt which was as nearly rancorous as any emotion of his could be during his residence in paris in 1764 and 1765 he writes to blair       the taste for literature is neither decayed nor depraved here as      with the barbarians who inhabit the banks of the thames  and he speaks of the general regard paid to genius and learning in france as one of the points in which it most differs from england ten years later he cannot even thank gibbon for his history without the lefthanded compliment that he should never have expected such an excellent work from the pen of an englishman early in 1765 hume writes to millar       the rage and prejudice of parties frighten me and above all this      rage against the scots which is so dishonourable and indeed so      infamous to the english nation we hear that it increases every      day without the least appearance of provocation on our part it has      frequently made me resolve never in my life to set foot on english      ground i dread if i should undertake a more modern history the      impertinence and illmanners to which it would expose me and i was      willing to know from you whether former prejudices had so far      subsided as to ensure me of a good reception  his fears were kindly appeased by millars assurance that the english were not prejudiced against the scots in general but against the particular scot lord bute who was supposed to be the guide philosopher and friend of both dowager queen and king  to care nothing about literature to dislike scotchmen and to be insensible to the merits of david hume was a combination of iniquities on the part of the english nation which would have been amply sufficient to ruffle the temper of the philosophic historian who without being foolishly vain had certainly no need of what has been said to be the one form of prayer in which his countrymen torn as they are by theological differences agree lord gie us a gude conceit o oursels but when to all this these same southrons added a passionate admiration for lord chatham who was in humes eyes a charlatan and filled up the cup of their abominations by cheering for wilkes and liberty humes wrath knew no bounds and between 1768 and 1770 he pours a perfect jeremiad into the bosom of his friend sir gilbert elliot       oh how i long to see america and the east indies revolted      totally and finallythe revenue reduced to halfpublic credit      fully discredited by bankruptcythe third of london in ruins and      the rascally mob subdued i think i am not too old to despair of      being witness to all these blessings       i am delighted to see the daily and hourly progress of madness and      folly and wickedness in england the consummation of these      qualities are the true ingredients for making a fine narrative in      history especially if followed by some signal and ruinous      convulsionas i hope will soon be the case with that pernicious      people  even from the secure haven of jamess court the maledictions continue to pour forth       nothing but a rebellion and bloodshed will open the eyes of that      deluded people though were they alone concerned i think it is no      matter what becomes of them our government has become a      chimera and is too perfect in point of liberty for so rude a      beast as an englishman who is a man a bad animal too corrupted      by above a century of licentiousness the misfortune is that this      liberty can scarcely be retrenched without danger of being entirely      lost at least the fatal effects of licentiousness must first be      made palpable by some extreme mischief resulting from it i may      wish that the catastrophe should rather fall on our posterity but      it hastens on with such large strides as to leave little room for      hope       i am running over again the last edition of my history in order to      correct it still further i either soften or expunge many      villainous seditious whig strokes which had crept into it i wish      that my indignation at the present madness encouraged by lies      calumnies imposture and every infamous act usual among popular      leaders may not throw me into the opposite extreme  a wise wish indeed posterity respectfully concurs therein and subjects humes estimate of england and things english to such modifications as it would probably have undergone had the wish been fulfilled  in 1775 humes health began to fail and in the spring of the following year his disorder which appears to have been hæmorrhage of the bowels attained such a height that he knew it must be fatal so he made his will and wrote my own life the conclusion of which is one of the most cheerful simple and dignified leavetakings of life and all its concerns extant       i now reckon upon a speedy dissolution i have suffered very      little pain from my disorder and what is more strange have      notwithstanding the great decline of my person never suffered a      moments abatement of spirits insomuch that were i to name the      period of my life which i should most choose to pass over again i      might be tempted to point to this later period i possess the same      ardour as ever in study and the same gaiety in company i consider      besides that a man of sixtyfive by dying cuts off only a few      years of infirmities and though i see many symptoms of my literary      reputations breaking out at last with additional lustre i know      that i could have but few years to enjoy it it is difficult to be      more detached from life than i am at present       to conclude historically with my own character i am or rather      was for that is the style i must now use in speaking of myself      which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments i was i say      a man of mild dispositions of command of temper of an open      social and cheerful humour capable of attachment but little      susceptible of enmity and of great moderation in all my passions      even my love of literary fame my ruling passion never soured my      temper notwithstanding my frequent disappointments my company was      not unacceptable to the young and careless as well as to the      studious and literary and as i took a particular pleasure in the      company of modest women i had no reason to be displeased with the      reception i met with from them in a word though most men any wise      eminent have found reason to complain of calumny i never was      touched or even attacked by her baleful tooth and though i      wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious      factions they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted      fury my friends never had occasion to vindicate any one      circumstance of my character and conduct not but that the zealots      we may well suppose would have been glad to invent and propagate      any story to my disadvantage but they could never find any which      they thought would wear the face of probability i cannot say there      is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself but i hope      it is not a misplaced one and this is a matter of fact which is      easily cleared and ascertained  hume died in edinburgh on the 25th of august 1776 and a few days later his body attended by a great concourse of people who seem to have anticipated for it the fate appropriate to the remains of wizards and necromancers was deposited in a spot selected by himself in an old burialground on the eastern slope of the calton hill  from the summit of this hill there is a prospect unequalled by any to be seen from the midst of a great city westward lies the forth and beyond it dimly blue the far away highland hills eastward rise the bold contours of arthurs seat and the rugged crags of the castle rock with the grey old town of edinburgh while far below from a maze of crowded thoroughfares the hoarse murmur of the toil of a polity of energetic men is borne upon the ear at times a man may be as solitary here as in a veritable wilderness and may meditate undisturbedly upon the epitome of nature and of manthe kingdoms of this worldspread out before him  surely there is a fitness in the choice of this last restingplace by the philosopher and historian who saw so clearly that these two kingdoms form but one realm governed by uniform laws and alike based on impenetrable darkness and eternal silence and faithful to the last to that profound veracity which was the secret of his philosophic greatness he ordered that the simple roman tomb which marks his grave should bear no inscription but                                  david hume                          born 1711     died 1776                  leaving it to posterity to add the rest   it was by the desire and at the suggestion of my friend the editor of this series that i undertook to attempt to help posterity in the difficult business of knowing what to add to humes epitaph and i might with justice throw upon him the responsibility of my apparent presumption in occupying a place among the men of letters who are engaged with him in their proper function of writing about english men of letters  that to which succeeding generations have made are making and will make continual additions however is humes fame as a philosopher and though i know that my plea will add to my offence in some quarters i must plead in extenuation of my audacity that philosophy lies in the province of science and not in that of letters  in dealing with humes life i have endeavoured as far as possible to make him speak for himself if the extracts from his letters and essays which i have given do not sufficiently show what manner of man he was i am sure that nothing i could say would make the case plainer in the exposition of humes philosophy which follows i have pursued the same plan and i have applied myself to the task of selecting and arranging in systematic order the passages which appeared to me to contain the clearest statements of humes opinions  i should have been glad to be able to confine myself to this duty and to limit my own comments to so much as was absolutely necessary to connect my excerpts here and there however it must be confessed that more is seen of my thread than of humes beads my excuse must be an ineradicable tendency to try to make things clear while i may further hope that there is nothing in what i may have said which is inconsistent with the logical development of humes principles  my authority for the facts of humes life is the admirable biography published in 1846 by mr john hill burton the edition of humes works from which all citations are made is that published by black and tait in edinburgh in 1826 in this edition the essays are reprinted from the edition of 1777 corrected by the author for the press a

other but for the convenience of those who possess some other edition the following table of the contents of the edition of 1826 with the paging of the four volumes is given

philosophy     chapter i  the object and scope of philosophy   kant has said that the business of philosophy is to answer three questions what can i know what ought i to do and for what may i hope but it is pretty plain that these three resolve themselves in the long run into the first for rational expectation and moral action are alike based upon beliefs and a belief is void of justification unless its subjectmatter lies within the boundaries of possible knowledge and unless its evidence satisfies the conditions which experience imposes as the guarantee of credibility  fundamentally then philosophy is the answer to the question what can i know and it is by applying itself to this problem that philosophy is properly distinguished as a special department of scientific research what is commonly called science whether mathematical physical or biological consists of the answers which mankind have been able to give to the inquiry what do i know they furnish us with the results of the mental operations which constitute thinking while philosophy in the stricter sense of the term inquires into the foundation of the first principles which those operations assume or imply  but though by reason of the special purpose of philosophy its distinctness from other branches of scientific investigation may be properly vindicated it is easy to see that from the nature of its subjectmatter it is intimately and indeed inseparably connected with one branch of science for it is obviously impossible to answer the question what can we know unless in the first place there is a clear understanding as to what is meant by knowledge and having settled this point the next step is to inquire how we come by that which we allow to be knowledge for upon the reply turns the answer to the further question whether from the nature of the case there are limits to the knowable or not while finally inasmuch as what can i know not only refers to knowledge of the past or of the present but to the confident expectation which we call knowledge of the future it is necessary to ask further what justification can be alleged for trusting to the guidance of our expectations in practical conduct  it surely needs no argumentation to show that the first problem cannot be approached without the examination of the contents of the mind and the determination of how much of these contents may be called knowledge nor can the second problem be dealt with in any other fashion for it is only by the observation of the growth of knowledge that we can rationally hope to discover how knowledge grows but the solution of the third problem simply involves the discussion of the data obtained by the investigation of the foregoing two  thus in order to answer three out of the four subordinate questions into which what can i know breaks up we must have recourse to that investigation of mental phenomena the results of which are embodied in the science of psychology  psychology is a part of the science of life or biology which differs from the other branches of that science merely in so far as it deals with the psychical instead of the physical phenomena of life  as there is an anatomy of the body so there is an anatomy of the mind the psychologist dissects mental phenomena into elementary states of consciousness as the anatomist resolves limbs into tissues and tissues into cells the one traces the development of complex organs from simple rudiments the other follows the building up of complex conceptions out of simpler constituents of thought as the physiologist inquires into the way in which the socalled functions of the body are performed so the psychologist studies the socalled faculties of the mind even a cursory attention to the ways and works of the lower animals suggests a comparative anatomy and physiology of the mind and the doctrine of evolution presses for application as much in the one field as in the other  but there is more than a parallel there is a close and intimate connexion between psychology and physiology no one doubts that at any rate some mental states are dependent for their existence on the performance of the functions of particular bodily organs there is no seeing without eyes and no hearing without ears if the origin of the contents of the mind is truly a philosophical problem then the philosopher who attempts to deal with that problem without acquainting himself with the physiology of sensation has no more intelligent conception of his business than the physiologist who thinks he can discuss locomotion without an acquaintance with the principles of mechanics or respiration without some tincture of chemistry  on whatever ground we term physiology science psychology is entitled to the same appellation and the method of investigation which elucidates the true relations of the one set of phenomena will discover those of the other hence as philosophy is in great measure the exponent of the logical consequences of certain data established by psychology and as psychology itself differs from physical science only in the nature of its subjectmatter and not in its method of investigation it would seem to be an obvious conclusion that philosophers are likely to be successful in their inquiries in proportion as they are familiar with the application of scientific method to less abstruse subjects just as it seems to require no elaborate demonstration that an astronomer who wishes to comprehend the solar system would do well to acquire a preliminary acquaintance with the elements of physics and it is accordant with this presumption that the men who have made the most important positive additions to philosophy such as descartes spinoza and kant not to mention more recent examples have been deeply imbued with the spirit of physical science and in some cases such as those of descartes and kant have been largely acquainted with its details on the other hand the founder of positivism no less admirably illustrates the connexion of scientific incapacity with philosophical incompetence in truth the laboratory is the forecourt of the temple of philosophy and whoso has not offered sacrifices and undergone purification there has little chance of admission into the sanctuary  obvious as these considerations may appear to be it would be wrong to ignore the fact that their force is by no means universally admitted on the contrary the necessity for a proper psychological and physiological training to the student of philosophy is denied on the one hand by the pure metaphysicians who attempt to base the theory of knowing upon supposed necessary and universal truths and assert that scientific observation is impossible unless such truths are already known or implied which to those who are not pure metaphysicians seems very much as if one should say that the fall of a stone cannot be observed unless the law of gravitation is already in the mind of the observer  on the other hand the positivists so far as they accept the teachings of their master roundly assert at any rate in words that observation of the mind is a thing inherently impossible in itself and that psychology is a chimeraa phantasm generated by the fermentation of the dregs of theology nevertheless if m comte had been asked what he meant by physiologic cérebrale except that which other people call psychology and how he knew anything about the functions of the brain except by that very observation intérieure which he declares to be an absurdityit seems probable that he would have found it hard to escape the admission that in vilipending psychology he had been propounding solemn nonsense  it is assuredly one of humes greatest merits that he clearly recognised the fact that philosophy is based upon psychology and that the inquiry into the contents and the operations of the mind must be conducted upon the same principles as a physical investigation if what he calls the moral philosopher would attain results of as firm and definite a character as those which reward the natural philosopher14 the title of his first work a treatise of human nature being an attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects sufficiently indicates the point of view from which hume regarded philosophical problems and he tells us in the preface that his object has been to promote the construction of a science of man       tis evident that all the sciences have a relation greater or      less to human nature and that however wide any of them may seem      to run from it they still return back by one passage or another      even mathematics natural philosophy and natural religion      are in some measure dependent on the science of man since they lie      under the cognizance of men and are judged of by their powers and      qualities tis impossible to tell what changes and improvements we      might make in these sciences were we thoroughly acquainted with the      extent and force of human understanding and could explain the      nature of the ideas we employ and of the operations we perform in      our reasonings to me it seems evident that the essence of mind      being equally unknown to us with that of external bodies it must      be equally impossible to form any notion of its powers and      qualities otherwise than from careful and exact experiments and      the observation of those particular effects which result from its      different circumstances and situations and though we must      endeavour to render all our principles as universal as possible by      tracing up our experiments to the utmost and explaining all      effects from the simplest and fewest causes tis still certain we      cannot go beyond experience and any hypothesis that pretends to      discover the ultimate original qualities of human nature ought at      first to be rejected as presumptuous and chimerical       but if this impossibility of explaining ultimate principles should      be esteemed a defect in the science of man i will venture to      affirm that it is a defect common to it with all the sciences and      all the arts in which we can employ ourselves whether they be      such as are cultivated in the schools of the philosophers or      practised in the shops of the meanest artisans none of them can go      beyond experience or establish any principles which are not      founded on that authority moral philosophy has indeed this      peculiar disadvantage which is not found in natural that in      collecting its experiments it cannot make them purposely with      premeditation and after such a manner as to satisfy itself      concerning every particular difficulty which may arise when i am      at a loss to know the effects of one body upon another in any      situation i need only put them in that situation and observe what      results from it but should i endeavour to clear up in the same      manner any15 doubt in moral philosophy by placing myself in the      same case with that which i consider tis evident this reflection      and premeditation would so disturb the operation of my natural      principles as must render it impossible to form any just      conclusion from the phenomenon we must therefore glean up our      experiments in this science from a cautious observation of human      life and take them as they appear in the common course of the      world by mens behaviour in company in affairs and in their      pleasures where experiments of this kind are judiciously collected      and compared we may hope to establish on them a science which      will not be inferior in certainty and will be much superior in      utility to any other of human comprehensioni pp 711  all science starts with hypothesesin other words with assumptions that are unproved while they may be and often are erroneous but which are better than nothing to the seeker after order in the maze of phenomena and the historical progress of every science depends on the criticism of hypotheseson the gradual stripping off that is of their untrue or superfluous partsuntil there remains only that exact verbal expression of as much as we know of the fact and no more which constitutes a perfect scientific theory  philosophy has followed the same course as other branches of scientific investigation the memorable service rendered to the cause of sound thinking by descartes consisted in this that he laid the foundation of modern philosophical criticism by his inquiry into the nature of certainty it is a clear result of the investigation started by descartes that there is one thing of which no doubt can be entertained for he who should pretend to doubt it would thereby prove its existence and that is the momentary consciousness we call a present thought or feeling that is safe even if all other kinds of certainty are merely more or less probable inferences berkeley and locke each in his way applied philosophical criticism in other directions but they always at any rate professedly followed the cartesian maxim of admitting no propositions to be true but such as are clear distinct and evident even while their arguments stripped off many a layer of hypothetical assumption which their great predecessor had left untouched no one has more clearly stated the aims of the critical philosopher than locke in a passage of the famous essay concerning human understanding which perhaps i ought to assume to be well known to all english readers but which so probably is unknown to this fullcrammed and much examined generation that i venture to cite it       if by this inquiry into the nature of the understanding i can      discover the powers thereof how far they reach to what things      they are in any degree proportionate and where they fail us i      suppose it may be of use to prevail with the busy mind of man to be      more cautious in meddling with things exceeding its comprehension      to stop when it is at the utmost extent of its tether and to sit      down in quiet ignorance of those things which upon examination      are proved to be beyond the reach of our capacities we should not      then perhaps be so forward out of an affectation of universal      knowledge to raise questions and perplex ourselves and others with      disputes about things to which our understandings are not suited      and of which we cannot frame in our minds any clear and distinct      perception or whereof as it has perhaps too often happened we      have not any notion at all men may find matter sufficient to      busy their heads and employ their hands with variety delight and      satisfaction if they will not boldly quarrel with their own      constitution and throw away the blessings their hands are filled      with because they are not big enough to grasp everything we shall      not have much reason to complain of the narrowness of our minds if      we will but employ them about what may be of use to us for of that      they are very capable and it will be an unpardonable as well as a      childish peevishness if we undervalue the advantages of our      knowledge and neglect to improve it to the ends for which it was      given us because there are some things that are set out of the      reach of it it will be no excuse to an idle and untoward servant      who would not attend to his business by candlelight to plead that      he had not broad sunshine the candle that is set up in us shines      bright enough for all our purposes our business here is not to      know all things but those which concern our conduct16  hume develops the same fundamental conception in a somewhat different way and with a more definite indication of the practical benefits which may be expected from a critical philosophy the first and second parts of the twelfth section of the inquiry are devoted to a condemnation of excessive scepticism or pyrrhonism with which hume couples a caricature of the cartesian doubt but in the third part a certain mitigated scepticism is recommended and adopted under the title of academical philosophy after pointing out that a knowledge of the infirmities of the human understanding even in its most perfect state and when most accurate and cautious in its determinations is the best check upon the tendency to dogmatism hume continues       another species of mitigated scepticism which may be of      advantage to mankind and which maybe the natural result of the      pyrrhonian doubts and scruples is the limitation of our inquiries      to such subjects as are best adapted to the narrow capacity of      human understanding the imagination of man is naturally sublime      delighted with whatever is remote and extraordinary and running      without control into the most distant parts of space and time in      order to avoid the objects which custom has rendered too familiar      to it a correct judgment observes a contrary method and      avoiding all distant and high inquiries confines itself to common      life and to such subjects as fall under daily practice and      experience leaving the more sublime topics to the embellishment of      poets and orators or to the arts of priests and politicians to      bring us to so salutary a determination nothing can be more      serviceable than to be once thoroughly convinced of the force of      the pyrrhonian doubt and of the impossibility that anything but      the strong power of natural instinct could free us from it those      who have a propensity to philosophy will still continue their      researches because they reflect that besides the immediate      pleasure attending such an occupation philosophical decisions are      nothing but the reflections of common life methodised and      corrected but they will never be tempted to go beyond common life      so long as they consider the imperfection of those faculties which      they employ their narrow reach and their inaccurate operations      while we cannot give a satisfactory reason why we believe after a      thousand experiments that a stone will fall or fire burn can we      ever satisfy ourselves concerning any determination which we may      form with regard to the origin of worlds and the situation of      nature from and to eternityiv pp 18990  but further it is the business of criticism not only to keep watch over the vagaries of philosophy but to do the duty of police in the whole world of thought wherever it espies sophistry or superstition they are to be bidden to stand nay they are to be followed to their very dens and there apprehended and exterminated as othello smothered desdemona else shell betray more men  hume warms into eloquence as he sets forth the labours meet for the strength and the courage of the hercules of mitigated scepticism       here indeed lies the justest and most plausible objection      against a considerable part of metaphysics that they are not      properly a science but arise either from the fruitless efforts of      human vanity which would penetrate into subjects utterly      inaccessible to the understanding or from the craft of popular      superstitions which being unable to defend themselves on fair      ground raise these entangling brambles to cover and protect their      weakness chased from the open country these robbers fly into the      forest and lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of      the mind and overwhelm it with religious fears and prejudices the      stoutest antagonist if he remits his watch a moment is oppressed      and many through cowardice and folly open the gates to the      enemies and willingly receive them with reverence and submission      as their legal sovereigns       but is this a sufficient reason why philosophers should desist      from such researches and leave superstition still in possession of      her retreat is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion and      perceive the necessity of carrying the war into the most secret      recesses of the enemy the only method of freeing learning at      once from these abstruse questions is to inquire seriously into      the nature of human understanding and show from an exact analysis      of its powers and capacity that it is by no means fitted for such      remote and abstruse subjects we must submit to this fatigue in      order to live at ease ever after and must cultivate true      metaphysics with some care in order to destroy the false and      adulteratediv pp 10 11  near a century and a half has elapsed since these brave words were shaped by david humes pen and the business of carrying the war into the enemys camp has gone on but slowly like other campaigns it long languished for want of a good base of operations but since physical science in the course of the last fifty years has brought to the front an inexhaustible supply of heavy artillery of a new pattern warranted to drive solid bolts of fact through the thickest skulls things are looking better though hardly more than the first faint flutterings of the dawn of the happy day when superstition and false metaphysics shall be no more and reasonable folks may live at ease are as yet discernible by the enfants perdus of the outposts  if in thus conceiving the object and the limitations of philosophy hume shows himself the spiritual child and continuator of the work of locke he appears no less plainly as the parent of kant and as the protagonist of that more modern way of thinking which has been called agnosticism from its profession of an incapacity to discover the indispensable conditions of either positive or negative knowledge in many propositions respecting which not only the vulgar but philosophers of the more sanguine sort revel in the luxury of unqualified assurance  the aim of the kritik der reinen vernunft is essentially the same as that of the treatise of human nature by which indeed kant was led to develop that critical philosophy with which his name and fame are indissolubly bound up and if the details of kants criticism differ from those of hume they coincide with them in their main result which is the limitation of all knowledge of reality to the world of phenomena revealed to us by experience  the philosopher of königsberg epitomises the philosopher of ninewells when he thus sums up the uses of philosophy       the greatest and perhaps the sole use of all philosophy of pure      reason is after all merely negative since it serves not as an      organon for the enlargement of knowledge but as a discipline for      its delimitation and instead of discovering truth has only the      modest merit of preventing error17  footnotes  14 in a letter to hutcheson september 17th 1739 hume remarksthere are different ways of examining the mind as well as the body one may consider it either as an anatomist or as a painter either to discover its most secret springs and principles or to describe the grace and beauty of its actions and he proceeds to justify his own mode of looking at the moral sentiments from the anatomists point of view  15 the manner in which hume constantly refers to the results of the observation of the contents and the processes of his own mind clearly shows that he has here inadvertently overstated the case  16 locke an essay concerning human understanding book i chap i §§ 4 5 6  17 kritik der reinen vernunft ed hartenstein p 256     chapter ii  the contents of the mind   in the language of common life the mind is spoken of as an entity independent of the body though resident in and closely connected with it and endowed with numerous faculties such as sensibility understanding memory volition which stand in the same relation to the mind as the organs do to the body and perform the functions of feeling reasoning remembering and willing of these functions some such as sensation are supposed to be merely passivethat is they are called into existence by impressions made upon the sensitive faculty by a material world of real objects of which our sensations are supposed to give us pictures others such as the memory and the reasoning faculty are considered to be partly passive and partly active while volition is held to be potentially if not always actually a spontaneous activity  the popular classification and terminology of the phenomena of consciousness however are by no means the first crude conceptions suggested by common sense but rather a legacy and in many respects a sufficiently damnosa hæreditas of ancient philosophy more or less leavened by theology which has incorporated itself with the common thought of later times as the vices of the aristocracy of one age become those of the mob in the next very little attention to what passes in the mind is sufficient to show that these conceptions involve assumptions of an extremely hypothetical character and the first business of the student of psychology is to get rid of such prepossessions to form conceptions of mental phenomena as they are given us by observation without any hypothetical admixture or with only so much as is definitely recognised and held subject to confirmation or otherwise to classify these phenomena according to their clearly recognisable characters and to adopt a nomenclature which suggests nothing beyond the results of observation thus chastened observation of the mind makes us acquainted with nothing but certain events facts or phenomena whichever name be preferred which pass over the inward field of view in rapid and as it may appear on careless inspection in disorderly succession like the shifting patterns of a kaleidoscope to all these mental phenomena or states of our consciousness18 descartes gave the name of thoughts19 while locke and berkeley termed them ideas hume regarding this as an improper use of the word idea for which he proposes another employment gives the general name of perceptions to all states of consciousness thus whatever other signification we may see reason to attach to the word mind it is certain that it is a name which is employed to denote a series of perceptions just as the word tune whatever else it may mean denotes in the first place a succession of musical notes hume indeed goes further than others when he says that       what we call a mind is nothing but a heap or collection of      different perceptions united together by certain relations and      supposed though falsely to be endowed with a perfect simplicity      and identityi p 268  with this nothing but however he obviously falls into the primal and perennial error of philosophical speculatorsdogmatising from negative arguments he may be right or wrong but the most he or anybody else can prove in favour of his conclusion is that we know nothing more of the mind than that it is a series of perceptions whether there is something in the mind that lies beyond the reach of observation or whether perceptions themselves are the products of something which can be observed and which is not mind are questions which can in nowise be settled by direct observation elsewhere the objectionable hypothetical element of the definition of mind is less prominent       the true idea of the human mind is to consider it as a system of      different perceptions or different existences which are linked      together by the relation of cause and effect and mutually produce      destroy influence and modify each other in this respect i      cannot compare the soul more properly to anything than a republic      or commonwealth in which the several members are united by the      reciprocal ties of government and subordination and give rise to      other persons who propagate the same republic in the incessant      changes of its partsi p 331  but leaving the question of the proper definition of mind open for the present it is further a matter of direct observation that when we take a general survey of all our perceptions or states of consciousness they naturally fall into sundry groups or classes of these classes two are distinguished by hume as of primary importance all perceptions he says are either impressions or ideas  under impressions he includes all our more lively perceptions when we hear see feel love or will in other words all our sensations passions and emotions as they make their first appearance in the soul i p 15  ideas on the other hand are the faint images of impressions in thinking and reasoning or of antecedent ideas  both impressions and ideas may be either simple when they are incapable of further analysis or complex when they may be resolved into simpler constituents all simple ideas are exact copies of impressions but in complex ideas the arrangement of simple constituents may be different from that of the impressions of which those simple ideas are copies  thus the colours red and blue and the odour of a rose are simple impressions while the ideas of blue of red and of roseodour are simple copies of these impressions but a red rose gives us a complex impression capable of resolution into the simple impressions of red colour rosescent and numerous others and we may have a complex idea which is an accurate though faint copy of this complex impression once in possession of the ideas of a red rose and of the colour blue we may in imagination substitute blue for red and thus obtain a complex idea of a blue rose which is not an actual copy of any complex impression though all its elements are such copies  hume has been criticised for making the distinction of impressions and ideas to depend upon their relative strength or vivacity yet it would be hard to point out any other character by which the things signified can be distinguished any one who has paid attention to the curious subject of what are called subjective sensations will be familiar with examples of the extreme difficulty which sometimes attends the discrimination of ideas of sensation from impressions of sensation when the ideas are very vivid or the impressions are faint who has not fancied he heard a noise or has not explained inattention to a real sound by saying i thought it was nothing but my fancy even healthy persons are much more liable to both visual and auditory spectrathat is ideas of vision and sound so vivid that they are taken for new impressionsthan is commonly supposed and in some diseased states ideas of sensible objects may assume all the vividness of reality  if ideas are nothing but copies of impressions arranged either in the same order as that of the impressions from which they are derived or in a different order it follows that the ultimate analysis of the contents of the mind turns upon that of the impressions according to hume these are of two kinds either they are impressions of sensation or they are impressions of reflection the former are those afforded by the five senses together with pleasure and pain the latter are the passions or the emotions which hume employs as equivalent terms thus the elementary states of consciousness the raw materials of knowledge so to speak are either sensations or emotions and whatever we discover in the mind beyond these elementary states of consciousness results from the combinations and the metamorphoses which they undergo  it is not a little strange that a thinker of humes capacity should have been satisfied with the results of a psychological analysis which regards some obvious compounds as elements while it omits altogether a most important class of elementary states  with respect to the former point spinozas masterly examination of the passions in the third part of the ethics should have been known to hume20 but if he had been acquainted with that wonderful piece of psychological anatomy he would have learned that the emotions and passions are all complex states arising from the close association of ideas of pleasure or pain with other ideas and indeed without going to spinoza his own acute discussion of the passions leads to the same result21 and is wholly inconsistent with his classification of those mental states among the primary uncompounded materials of consciousness  if humes impressions of reflection are excluded from among the primary elements of consciousness nothing is left but the impressions afforded by the five senses with pleasure and pain putting aside the muscular sense which had not come into view in humes time the questions arise whether these are all the simple undecomposable materials of thought or whether others exist of which hume takes no cognizance  kant answered the latter question in the affirmative in the kritik der reinen vernunft and thereby made one of the greatest advances ever effected in philosophy though it must be confessed that the german philosophers exposition of his views is so perplexed in style so burdened with the weight of a cumbrous and uncouth scholasticism that it is easy to confound the unessential parts of his system with those which are of profound importance his baggage train is bigger than his army and the student who attacks him is too often led to suspect he has won a position when he has only captured a mob of useless campfollowers  in his principles of psychology mr herbert spencer appears to me to have brought out the essential truth which underlies kants doctrine in a far clearer manner than any one else but for the purpose of the present summary view of humes philosophy it must suffice if i state the matter in my own way giving the broad outlines without entering into the details of a large and difficult discussion  when a red light flashes across the field of vision there arises in the mind an impression of sensationwhich we call red it appears to me that this sensation red is a something which may exist altogether independently of any other impression or idea as an individual existence it is perfectly conceivable that a sentient being should have no sense but vision and that he should have spent his existence in absolute darkness with the exception of one solitary flash of red light that momentary illumination would suffice to give him the impression under consideration and the whole content of his consciousness might be that impression and if he were endowed with memory its idea  such being the state of affairs suppose a second flash of red light to follow the first if there were no memory of the latter the state of the mind on the second occasion would simply be a repetition of that which occurred before there would be merely another impression  but suppose memory to exist and that an idea of the first impression is generated then if the supposed sentient being were like ourselves there might arise in his mind two altogether new impressions the one is the feeling of the succession of the two impressions the other is the feeling of their similarity  yet a third case is conceivable suppose two flashes of red light to occur together then a third feeling might arise which is neither succession nor similarity but that which we call coexistence  these feelings or their contraries are the foundation of everything that we call a relation they are no more capable of being described than sensations are and as it appears to me they are as little susceptible of analysis into simpler elements like simple tastes and smells or feelings of pleasure and pain they are ultimate irresolvable facts of conscious experience and if we follow the principle of humes nomenclature they must be called impressions of relation but it must be remembered that they differ from the other impressions in requiring the preexistence of at least two of the latter though devoid of the slightest resemblance to the other impressions they are in a manner generated by them in fact we may regard them as a kind of impressions of impressions or as the sensations of an inner sense which takes cognizance of the materials furnished to it by the outer senses  hume failed as completely as his predecessors had done to recognise the elementary character of impressions of relation and when he discusses relations he falls into a chaos of confusion and selfcontradiction  in the treatise for example book i § iv resemblance contiguity in time and space and cause and effect are said to be the uniting principles among ideas the bond of union or associating quality by which one idea naturally introduces another hume affirms that       these qualities produce an association among ideas and upon the      appearance of one idea naturally introduce another they are the      principles of union or cohesion among our simple ideas and in      the imagination supply the place of that inseparable connection by      which they are united in our memory here is a kind of      attraction which in the mental world will be found to have as      extraordinary effects as in the natural and to show itself in as      many and as various forms its effects are everywhere conspicuous      but as to its causes they are mostly unknown and must be resolved      into original qualities of human nature which i pretend not to      explaini p 29  and at the end of this section hume goes on to say       amongst the effects of this union or association of ideas there      are none more remarkable than those complex ideas which are the      common subjects of our thought and reasoning and generally arise      from some principle of union among our simple ideas these complex      ideas may be resolved into relations modes and      substancesibid  in the next section which is devoted to relations they are spoken of as qualities by which two ideas are connected together in the imagination or which make objects admit of comparison and seven kinds of relation are enumerated namely resemblance identity space and time quantity or number degrees of quality contrariety and cause and effect  to the reader of hume whose conceptions are usually so clear definite and consistent it is as unsatisfactory as it is surprising to meet with so much questionable and obscure phraseology in a small space one and the same thing for example resemblance is first called a quality of an idea and secondly a complex idea surely it cannot be both ideas which have the qualities of resemblance contiguity and cause and effect are said to attract one another save the mark and so become associated though in a subsequent part of the treatise humes great effort is to prove that the relation of cause and effect is a particular case of the process of association that is to say is a result of the process of which it is supposed to be the cause moreover since as hume is never weary of reminding his readers there is nothing in ideas save copies of impressions the qualities of resemblance contiguity and so on in the idea must have existed in the impression of which that idea is a copy and therefore they must be either sensations or emotionsfrom both of which classes they are excluded  in fact in one place hume himself has an insight into the real nature of relations speaking of equality in the sense of a relation of quantity he says       since equality is a relation it is not strictly speaking a      property in the figures themselves but arises merely from the      comparison which the mind makes between themi p 70  that is to say when two impressions of equal figures are present there arises in the mind a tertium quid which is the perception of equality on his own principles hume should therefore have placed this perception among the ideas of reflection however as we have seen he expressly excludes everything but the emotions and the passions from this group  it is necessary therefore to amend humes primary geography of the mind by the excision of one territory and the addition of another and the elementary states of consciousness will stand thus        a impressions        a sensations of            a smell            b taste            c hearing            d sight            e touch            f resistance the muscular sense        b pleasure and pain        c relations            a coexistence            b succession            c similarity and dissimilarity      b ideas      copies or reproductions in memory of the foregoing   and now the question arises whether any and if so what portion of these contents of the mind are to be termed knowledge  according to locke knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas and hume though he does not say so in so many words tacitly accepts the definition it follows that neither simple sensation nor simple emotion constitutes knowledge but that when impressions of relation are added to these impressions or their ideas knowledge arises and that all knowledge is the knowledge of likenesses and unlikenesses coexistences and successions  it really matters very little in what sense terms are used so long as the same meaning is always rigidly attached to them and therefore it is hardly worth while to quarrel with this generally accepted though very arbitrary limitation of the signification of knowledge but on the face of the matter it is not obvious why the impression we call a relation should have a better claim to the title of knowledge than that which we call a sensation or an emotion and the restriction has this unfortunate result that it excludes all the most intense states of consciousness from any claim to the title of knowledge  for example on this view pain so violent and absorbing as to exclude all other forms of consciousness is not knowledge but becomes a part of knowledge the moment we think of it in relation to another pain or to some other mental phenomenon surely this is somewhat inconvenient for there is only a verbal difference between having a sensation and knowing one has it they are simply two phrases for the same mental state  but the pure metaphysicians make great capital out of the ambiguity for starting with the assumption that all knowledge is the perception of relations and finding themselves like mere commonsense folks very much disposed to call sensation knowledge they at once gratify that disposition and save their consistency by declaring that even the simplest act of sensation contains two terms and a relationthe sensitive subject the sensigenous object and that masterful entity the ego from which great triad as from a gnostic trinity emanates an endless procession of other logical shadows and all the fata morgana of philosophical dreamland  footnotes  18 consciousnesses would be a better name but it is awkward i have elsewhere proposed psychoses as a substantive name for mental phenomena  19 as this has been denied it may be as well to give descartess words par le mot de penser jentends tout ce que se fait dans nous de telle sorte que nous lapercevons immédiatement par nousmêmes cest pourquoi nonseulement entendre vouloir imaginer mais aussi sentir cest le même chose ici que penserprincipes de philosophie ed cousin 57  toutes les propriétés que nous trouvons en la chose qui pense ne sont que des façons différentes de penseribid 96  20 on the whole it is pleasant to find satisfactory evidence that hume knew nothing of the works of spinoza for the invariably abusive manner in which he refers to that type of the philosophic hero is only to be excused if it is to be excused by sheer ignorance of his life and work  21 for example in discussing pride and humility hume says  according as our idea of ourselves is more or less advantageous we feel either of these opposite affections and are elated by pride or dejected with humility  when self enters not into the consideration there is no room either for pride or humility that is pride is pleasure and humility is pain associated with certain conceptions of ones self or as spinoza puts itsuperbia est de se præ amore sui plus justo sentire amor being lætitia concomitante idea causæ externæ and humilitas est tristitia orta ex eo quod homo suam impotentiam sive imbecillitatem contemplatur     chapter iii  the origin of the impressions   admitting that the sensations the feelings of pleasure and pain and those of relation are the primary irresolvable states of consciousness two further lines of investigation present themselves the one leads us to seek the origin of these impressions the other to inquire into the nature of the steps by which they become metamorphosed into those compound states of consciousness which so largely enter into our ordinary trains of thought  with respect to the origin of impressions of sensation hume is not quite consistent with himself in one place i p 117 he says that it is impossible to decide whether they arise immediately from the object or are produced by the creative power of the mind or are derived from the author of our being thereby implying that realism and idealism are equally probable hypotheses but in fact after the demonstration by descartes that the immediate antecedents of sensations are changes in the nervous system with which our feelings have no sort of resemblance the hypothesis that sensations arise immediately from the object was out of court and that hume fully admitted the cartesian doctrine is apparent when he says i p 272       all our perceptions are dependent on our organs and the      disposition of our nerves and animal spirits  and again though in relation to another question he observes       there are three different kinds of impressions conveyed by the      senses the first are those of the figure bulk motion and      solidity of bodies the second those of colours tastes smells      sounds heat and cold the third are the pains and pleasures that      arise from the application of objects to our bodies as by the      cutting of our flesh with steel and such like both philosophers      and the vulgar suppose the first of these to have a distinct      continued existence the vulgar only regard the second as on the      same footing both philosophers and the vulgar again esteem the      third to be merely perceptions and consequently interrupted and      dependent beings       now tis evident that whatever may be our philosophical opinion      colour sounds heat and cold as far as appears to the senses      exist after the same manner with motion and solidity and that the      difference we make between them in this respect arises not from      the mere perception so strong is the prejudice for the distinct      continued existence of the former qualities that when the contrary      opinion is advanced by modern philosophers people imagine they can      almost refute it from their reason and experience and that their      very senses contradict this philosophy tis also evident that      colours sounds c are originally on the same footing with the      pain that arises from steel and pleasure that proceeds from a      fire and that the difference betwixt them is founded neither on      perception nor reason but on the imagination for as they are      confessed to be both of them nothing but perceptions arising from      the particular configurations and motions of the parts of body      wherein possibly can their difference consist upon the whole      then we may conclude that as far as the senses are judges all      perceptions are the same in the manner of their existencei p      250 251  the last words of this passage are as much berkeleys as humes but instead of following berkeley in his deductions from the position thus laid down hume as the preceding citation shows fully adopted the conclusion to which all that we know of psychological physiology tends that the origin of the elements of consciousness no less than that of all its other states is to be sought in bodily changes the seat of which can only be placed in the brain and as locke had already done with less effect he states and refutes the arguments commonly brought against the possibility of a causal connexion between the modes of motion of the cerebral substance and states of consciousness with great clearness       from these hypotheses concerning the substance and local      conjunction of our perceptions we may pass to another which is      more intelligible than the former and more important than the      latter viz concerning the cause of our perceptions matter and      motion tis commonly said in the schools however varied are      still matter and motion and produce only a difference in the      position and situation of objects divide a body as often as you      please tis still body place it in any figure nothing ever      results but figure or the relation of parts move it in any      manner you still find motion or a change of relation tis absurd      to imagine that motion in a circle for instance should be nothing      but merely motion in a circle while motion in another direction      as in an ellipse should also be a passion or moral reflection      that the shocking of two globular particles should become a      sensation of pain and that the meeting of the triangular ones      should afford a pleasure now as these different shocks and      variations and mixtures are the only changes of which matter is      susceptible and as these never afford us any idea of thought or      perception tis concluded to be impossible that thought can ever      be caused by matter       few have been able to withstand the seeming evidence of this      argument and yet nothing in the world is more easy than to refute      it we need only reflect upon what has been proved at large that      we are never sensible of any connexion between causes and effects      and that tis only by our experience of their constant conjunction      we can arrive at any knowledge of this relation now as all      objects which are not contrary are susceptible of a constant      conjunction and as no real objects are contrary i have inferred      from these principles part iii § 15 that to consider the matter      a priori anything may produce anything and that we shall never      discover a reason why any object may or may not be the cause of any      other however great or however little the resemblance may be      betwixt them this evidently destroys the precedent reasoning      concerning the cause of thought or perception for though there      appear no manner of connection betwixt motion and thought the case      is the same with all other causes and effects place one body of a      pound weight on one end of a lever and another body of the same      weight on the other end you will never find in these bodies any      principle of motion dependent on their distance from the centre      more than of thought and perception if you pretend therefore to      prove a priori that such a position of bodies can never cause      thought because turn it which way you will it is nothing but a      position of bodies you must by the same course of reasoning      conclude that it can never produce motion since there is no more      apparent connection in the one than in the other but as this      latter conclusion is contrary to evident experience and as tis      possible we may have a like experience in the operations of the      mind and may perceive a constant conjunction of thought and      motion you reason too hastily when from the mere consideration of      the ideas you conclude that tis impossible motion can ever      produce thought or a different position of parts give rise to a      different passion or reflection nay tis not only possible we may      have such an experience but tis certain we have it since every      one may perceive that the different dispositions of his body change      his thoughts and sentiments and should it be said that this      depends on the union of soul and body i would answer that we must      separate the question concerning the substance of the mind from      that concerning the cause of its thought and that confining      ourselves to the latter question we find by the comparing their      ideas that thought and motion are different from each other and by      experience that they are constantly united which being all the      circumstances that enter into the idea of cause and effect when      applied to the operations of matter we may certainly conclude that      motion may be and actually is the cause of thought and      perceptioni pp 314316  the upshot of all this is that the collection of perceptions which constitutes the mind is really a system of effects the causes of which are to be sought in antecedent changes of the matter of the brain just as the collection of motions which we call flying is a system of effects the causes of which are to be sought in the modes of motion of the matter of the muscles of the wings  hume however treats of this important topic only incidentally he seems to have had very little acquaintance even with such physiology as was current in his time at least the only passage of his works bearing on this subject with which i am acquainted contains nothing but a very odd version of the physiological views of descartes       when i received the relations of resemblance contiguity and      causation as principles of union among ideas without examining      into their causes twas more in prosecution of my first maxim      that we must in the end rest contented with experience than for      want of something specious and plausible which i might have      displayed on that subject twould have been easy to have made an      imaginary dissection of the brain and have shown why upon our      conception of any idea the animal spirits run into all the      contiguous traces and rouse up the other ideas that are related to      it but though i have neglected any advantage which i might have      drawn from this topic in explaining the relations of ideas i am      afraid i must here have recourse to it in order to account for the      mistakes that arise from these relations i shall therefore      observe that as the mind is endowed with the power of exciting any      idea it pleases whenever it despatches the spirits into that      region of the brain in which the idea is placed these spirits      always excite the idea when they run precisely into the proper      traces and rummage that cell which belongs to the idea but as      their motion is seldom direct and naturally turns a little to the      one side or to the other for this reason the animal spirits      falling into the contiguous traces present other related ideas in      lieu of that which the mind desired at first to survey this change      we are not always sensible of but continuing still the same train      of thought make use of the related idea which is presented to us      and employ it in our reasonings as if it were the same with what      we demanded this is the cause of many mistakes and sophisms in      philosophy as will naturally be imagined and as it would be easy      to show if there was occasioni p 88  perhaps it is as well for humes fame that the occasion for further physiological speculations of this sort did not arise but while admitting the crudity of his notions and the strangeness of the language in which they are couched it must in justice be remembered that what are now known as the elements of the physiology of the nervous system were hardly dreamed of in the first half of the eighteenth century and as a further set off to humes credit it must be noted that he grasped the fundamental truth that the key to the comprehension of mental operations lies in the study of the molecular changes of the nervous apparatus by which they are originated  surely no one who is cognisant of the facts of the case nowadays doubts that the roots of psychology lie in the physiology of the nervous system what we call the operations of the mind are functions of the brain and the materials of consciousness are products of cerebral activity cabanis may have made use of crude and misleading phraseology when he said that the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile but the conception which that muchabused phrase embodies is nevertheless far more consistent with fact than the popular notion that the mind is a metaphysical entity seated in the head but as independent of the brain as a telegraph operator is of his instrument  it is hardly necessary to point out that the doctrine just laid down is what is commonly called materialism in fact i am not sure that the adjective crass which appears to have a special charm for rhetorical sciolists would not be applied to it but it is nevertheless true that the doctrine contains nothing inconsistent with the purest idealism for as hume remarks as indeed descartes had observed long before       tis not our body we perceive when we regard our limbs and      members but certain impressions which enter by the senses so that      the ascribing a real and corporeal existence to these impressions      or to their objects is an act of the mind as difficult to explain      as that the external existence of objects which we examine at      presenti p 249  therefore if we analyse the proposition that all mental phenomena are the effects or products of material phenomena all that it means amounts to this that whenever those states of consciousness which we call sensation or emotion or thought come into existence complete investigation will show good reason for the belief that they are preceded by those other phenomena of consciousness to which we give the names of matter and motion all material changes appear in the long run to be modes of motion but our knowledge of motion is nothing but that of a change in the place and order of our sensations just as our knowledge of matter is restricted to those feelings of which we assume it to be the cause  it has already been pointed out that hume must have admitted and in fact does admit the possibility that the mind is a leibnitzian monad or a fichtean worldgenerating ego the universe of things being merely the picture produced by the evolution of the phenomena of consciousness for any demonstration that can be given to the contrary effect the collection of perceptions which makes up our consciousness may be an orderly phantasmagoria generated by the ego unfolding its successive scenes on the background of the abyss of nothingness as a firework which is but cunningly arranged combustibles grows from a spark into a coruscation and from a coruscation into figures and words and cascades of devouring fire and then vanishes into the darkness of the night  on the other hand it must no less readily be allowed that for anything that can be proved to the contrary there may be a real something which is the cause of all our impressions that sensations though not likenesses are symbols of that something and that the part of that something which we call the nervous system is an apparatus for supplying us with a sort of algebra of fact based on those symbols a brain may be the machinery by which the material universe becomes conscious of itself but it is important to notice that even if this conception of the universe and of the relation of consciousness to its other components should be true we should nevertheless be still bound by the limits of thought still unable to refute the arguments of pure idealism the more completely the materialistic position is admitted the easier is it to show that the idealistic position is unassailable if the idealist confines himself within the limits of positive knowledge   hume deals with the questions whether all our ideas are derived from experience or whether on the contrary more or fewer of them are innate which so much exercised the mind of locke after a somewhat summary fashion in a note to the second section of the inquiry       it is probable that no more was meant by those who denied innate      ideas than that all ideas were copies of our impressions though      it must be confessed that the terms which they employed were not      chosen with such caution nor so exactly defined as to prevent all      mistakes about their doctrine for what is meant by innate if      innate be equivalent to natural then all the perceptions and ideas      of the mind must be allowed to be innate or natural in whatever      sense we take the latter word whether in opposition to what is      uncommon artificial or miraculous if by innate be meant      contemporary with our birth the dispute seems to be frivolous nor      is it worth while to inquire at what time thinking begins whether      before at or after our birth again the word idea seems to be      commonly taken in a very loose sense by locke and others as      standing for any of our perceptions our sensations and passions      as well as thoughts now in this sense i should desire to know what      can be meant by asserting that selflove or resentment of      injuries or the passion between the sexes is not innate       but admitting these terms impressions and ideas in the      sense above explained and understanding by innate what is      original or copied from no precedent perception then we may assert      that all our impressions are innate and our ideas not innate  it would seem that hume did not think it worth while to acquire a comprehension of the real points at issue in the controversy which he thus carelessly dismisses  yet descartes has defined what he means by innate ideas with so much precision that misconception ought to have been impossible he says that when he speaks of an idea being innate he means that it exists potentially in the mind before it is actually called into existence by whatever is its appropriate exciting cause       i have never either thought or said he writes that the mind      has any need of innate ideas idées naturelles which are      anything distinct from its faculty of thinking but it is true that      observing that there are certain thoughts which arise neither from      external objects nor from the determination of my will but only      from my faculty of thinking in order to mark the difference      between the ideas or the notions which are the forms of these      thoughts and to distinguish them from the others which may be      called extraneous or voluntary i have called them innate but i      have used this term in the same sense as when we say that      generosity is innate in certain families or that certain maladies      such as gout or gravel are innate in others not that children      born in these families are troubled with such diseases in their      mothers womb but because they are born with the disposition or      the faculty of contracting them22  his troublesome disciple regius having asserted that all our ideas come from observation or tradition descartes remarks       so thoroughly erroneous is this assertion that whoever has a      proper comprehension of the action of our senses and understands      precisely the nature of that which is transmitted by them to our      thinking faculty will rather affirm that no ideas of things such      as are formed in thought are brought to us by the senses so that      there is nothing in our ideas which is other than innate in the      mind naturel à lesprit or in the faculty of thinking if only      certain circumstances are excepted which belong only to      experience for example it is experience alone which causes us to      judge that such and such ideas now present in our minds are      related to certain things which are external to us not in truth      that they have been sent into our mind by these things such as      they are by the organs of the senses but because these organs      have transmitted something which has occasioned the mind in virtue      of its innate power to form them at this time rather than at      another       nothing passes from external objects to the soul except certain      motions of matter mouvemens corporels but neither these      motions nor the figures which they produce are conceived by us as      they exist in the sensory organs as i have fully explained in my      dioptrics whence it follows that even the ideas of motion and of      figures are innate naturellement en nous and à fortiori      the ideas of pain of colours of sounds and of all similar things      must be innate in order that the mind may represent them to      itself on the occasion of certain motions of matter with which      they have no resemblance  whoever denies what is in fact an inconceivable proposition that sensations pass as such from the external world into the mind must admit the conclusion here laid down by descartes that strictly speaking sensations and à fortiori all the other contents of the mind are innate or to state the matter in accordance with the views previously expounded that they are products of the inherent properties of the thinking organ in which they lie potentially before they are called into existence by their appropriate causes  but if all the contents of the mind are innate what is meant by experience  it is the conversion by unknown causes of these innate potentialities into actual existences the organ of thought prior to experience may be compared to an untouched piano in which it may be properly said that music is innate inasmuch as its mechanism contains potentially so many octaves of musical notes the unknown cause of sensation which descartes calls the je ne sais quoi dans les objets or choses telles quelles sont and kant the noumenon or ding an sich is represented by the musician who by touching the keys converts the potentiality of the mechanism into actual sounds a note so produced is the equivalent of a single experience  all the melodies and harmonies that proceed from the piano depend upon the action of the musician upon the keys there is no internal mechanism which when certain keys are struck gives rise to an accompaniment of which the musician is only indirectly the cause according to descartes howeverand this is what is generally fixed upon as the essence of his doctrine of innate ideasthe mind possesses such an internal mechanism by which certain classes of thoughts are generated on the occasion of certain experiences such thoughts are innate just as sensations are innate they are not copies of sensations any more than sensations are copies of motions they are invariably generated in the mind when certain experiences arise in it just as sensations are invariably generated when certain bodily motions take place they are universal inasmuch as they arise under the same conditions in all men they are necessary because their genesis under these conditions is invariable these innate thoughts are what descartes terms vérités or truths that is beliefsand his notions respecting them are plainly set forth in a passage of the principes       thus far i have discussed that which we know as things it remains      that i should speak of that which we know as truths for example      when we think that it is impossible to make anything out of      nothing we do not imagine that this proposition is a thing which      exists or a property of something but we take it for a certain      eternal truth which has its seat in the mind pensée and is      called a common notion or an axiom similarly when we affirm that      it is impossible that one and the same thing should exist and not      exist at the same time that that which has been created should not      have been created that he who thinks must exist while he thinks      and a number of other like propositions these are only truths and      not things which exist outside our thoughts and there is such a      number of these that it would be wearisome to enumerate them nor      is it necessary to do so because we cannot fail to know them when      the occasion of thinking about them presents itself and we are not      blinded by any prejudices  it would appear that locke was not more familiar with descartes writings than hume seems to have been for viewed in relation to the passages just cited the arguments adduced in his famous polemic against innate ideas are totally irrelevant  it has been shown that hume practically if not in so many words admits the justice of descartes assertion that strictly speaking sensations are innate that is to say that they are the product of the reaction of the organ of the mind on the stimulus of an unknown cause which is descartes je ne sais quoi therefore the difference between descartes opinion and that of hume resolves itself into this given sensationexperiences can all the contents of consciousness be derived from the collocation and metamorphosis of these experiences or are new elements of consciousness products of an innate potentiality distinct from sensibility added to these hume affirms the former position descartes the latter if the analysis of the phenomena of consciousness given in the preceding pages is correct hume is in error while the father of modern philosophy had a truer insight though he overstated the case for want of sufficiently searching psychological investigations descartes was led to suppose that innumerable ideas the evolution of which in the course of experience can be demonstrated were direct or innate products of the thinking faculty  as has been already pointed out it is the great merit of kant that he started afresh on the track indicated by descartes and steadily upheld the doctrine of the existence of elements of consciousness which are neither senseexperiences nor any modifications of them we may demur to the expression that space and time are forms of sensory intuition but it imperfectly represents the great fact that coexistence and succession are mental phenomena not given in the mere sense experience23  footnotes  22 remarques de rené descartes sur un certain placard imprimé aux pays bas vers la fin de lannée 1647descartes oeuvres ed cousin x p 71  23 wir können uns keinen gegenstand

terminology this passage would be hardly intelligible in a translation but it may be paraphrased thus all knowledge is founded upon experiences of sensation but it is not all derived from those experiences inasmuch as the impressions of relation reine anschauungen reine verstandesbegriffe have a potential or à priori existence in us and by their addition to senseexperiences constitute knowledge     chapter iv  the classification and the nomenclature of mental operations   if as has been set forth in the preceding chapter all mental states are effects of physical causes it follows that what are called mental faculties and operations are properly speaking cerebral functions allotted to definite though not yet precisely assignable parts of the brain  these functions appear to be reducible to three groups namely sensation correlation and ideation  the organs of the functions of sensation and correlation are those portions of the cerebral substance the molecular changes of which give rise to impressions of sensation and impressions of relation  the changes in the nervous matter which bring about the effects which we call its functions follow upon some kind of stimulus and rapidly reaching their maximum as rapidly die away the effect of the irritation of a nervefibre on the cerebral substance with which it is connected may be compared to the pulling of a long bellwire the impulse takes a little time to reach the bell the bell rings and then becomes quiescent until another pull is given so in the brain every sensation is the ring of a cerebral particle the effect of a momentary impulse sent along a nervefibre  if there were a complete likeness between the two terms of this very rough and ready comparison it is obvious that there could be no such thing as memory a bell records no audible sign of having been rung five minutes ago and the activity of a sensigenous cerebral particle might similarly leave no trace under these circumstances again it would seem that the only impressions of relation which could arise would be those of coexistence and of similarity for succession implies memory of an antecedent state24  but the special peculiarity of the cerebral apparatus is that any given function which has once been performed is very easily set agoing again by causes more or less different from those to which it owed its origin of the mechanism of this generation of images of impressions or ideas in humes sense which may be termed ideation we know nothing at present though the fact and its results are familiar enough  during our waking and many of our sleeping hours in fact the function of ideation is in continual if not continuous activity trains of thought as we call them succeed one another without intermission even when the starting of new trains by fresh senseimpressions is as far as possible prevented the rapidity and the intensity of this ideational process are obviously dependent upon physiological conditions the widest differences in these respects are constitutional in men of different temperaments and are observable in oneself under varying conditions of hunger and repletion fatigue and freshness calmness and emotional excitement the influence of diet on dreams of stimulants upon the fulness and the velocity of the stream of thought the delirious phantasms generated by disease by hashish or by alcohol will occur to every one as examples of the marvellous sensitiveness of the apparatus of ideation to purely physical influences  the succession of mental states in ideation is not fortuitous but follows the law of association which may be stated thus that every idea tends to be followed by some other idea which is associated with the first or its impression by a relation of succession of contiguity or of likeness  thus the idea of the word horse just now presented itself to my mind and was followed in quick succession by the ideas of four legs hoofs teeth rider saddle racing cheating all of which ideas are connected in my experience with the impression or the idea of a horse and with one another by the relations of contiguity and succession no great attention to what passes in the mind is needful to prove that our trains of thought are neither to be arrested nor even permanently controlled by our desires or emotions nevertheless they are largely influenced by them in the presence of a strong desire or emotion the stream of thought no longer flows on in a straight course but seems as it were to eddy round the idea of that which is the object of the emotion every one who has eaten his bread in sorrow knows how strangely the current of ideas whirls about the conception of the object of regret or remorse as a centre every now and then indeed breaking away into the new tracks suggested by passing associations but still returning to the central thought few can have been so happy as to have escaped the social bore whose pet notion is certain to crop up whatever topic is started while the fixed idea of the monomaniac is but the extreme form of the same phenomenon  and as on the one hand it is so hard to drive away the thought we would fain be rid of so upon the other the pleasant imaginations which we would so gladly retain are sooner or later jostled away by the crowd of claimants for birth into the world of consciousness which hover as a sort of psychical possibilities or inverse ghosts the bodily presentments of spiritual phenomena to be in the limbo of the brain in that form of desire which is called attention the train of thought held fast for a time in the desired direction seems ever striving to get on to another lineand the junctions and sidings are so multitudinous   the constituents of trains of ideas may be grouped in various ways  hume says       we find by experience that when any impression has been present      in the mind it again makes its appearance there as an idea and      this it may do in two different ways either when on its new      appearance it retains a considerable degree of its first vivacity      and is somewhat intermediate between an impression and an idea or      when it entirely loses that vivacity and is a perfect idea the      faculty by which we repeat our impressions in the first manner is      called the memory and the other the imaginationi pp 23      24  and he considers that the only difference between ideas of imagination and those of memory except the superior vivacity of the latter lies in the fact that those of memory preserve the original order of the impressions from which they are derived while the imagination is free to transpose and change its ideas  the latter statement of the difference between memory and imagination is less open to cavil than the former though by no means unassailable  the special characteristic of a memory surely is not its vividness but that it is a complex idea in which the idea of that which is remembered is related by coexistence with other ideas and by antecedence with present impressions  if i say i remember a b the chance acquaintance of ten years ago it is not because my idea of a b is very vividon the contrary it is extremely faintbut because that idea is associated with ideas of impressions coexistent with those which i call a b and that all these are at the end of the long series of ideas which represent that much past time in truth i have a much more vivid idea of mr pickwick or of colonel newcome than i have of a b but associated with the ideas of these persons i have no idea of their having ever been derived from the world of impressions and so they are relegated to the world of imagination on the other hand the characteristic of an imagination may properly be said to lie not in its intensity but in the fact that as hume puts it the arrangement or the relations of the ideas are different from those in which the impressions whence these ideas are derived occurred or in other words that the thing imagined has not happened in popular usage however imagination is frequently employed for simple memoryin imagination i was back in the old times  it is a curious omission on humes part that while thus dwelling on two classes of ideas memories and imaginations he has not at the same time taken notice of a third group of no small importance which are as different from imaginations as memories are though like the latter they are often confounded with pure imaginations in general speech these are the ideas of expectation or as they may be called for the sake of brevity expectations which differ from simple imaginations in being associated with the idea of the existence of corresponding impressions in the future just as memories contain the idea of the existence of the corresponding impressions in the past  the ideas belonging to two of the three groups enumerated namely memories and expectations present some features of particular interest and first with respect to memories  in humes words all simple ideas are copies of simple impressions the idea of a single sensation is a faint but accurate image of that sensation the idea of a relation is a reproduction of the feeling of coexistence of succession or of similarity but when complex impressions or complex ideas are reproduced as memories it is probable that the copies never give all the details of the originals with perfect accuracy and it is certain that they rarely do so no one possesses a memory so good that if he has only once observed a natural object a second inspection does not show him something that he has forgotten almost all if not all our memories are therefore sketches rather than portraits of the originalsthe salient features are obvious while the subordinate characters are obscure or unrepresented  now when several complex impressions which are more or less different from one anotherlet us say that out of ten impressions in each six are the same in all and four are different from all the restare successively presented to the mind it is easy to see what must be the nature of the result the repetition of the six similar impressions will strengthen the six corresponding elements of the complex idea which will therefore acquire greater vividness while the four differing impressions of each will not only acquire no greater strength than they had at first but in accordance with the law of association they will all tend to appear at once and will thus neutralise one another  this mental operation may be rendered comprehensible by considering what takes place in the formation of compound photographswhen the images of the faces of six sitters for example are each received on the same photographic plate for a sixth of the time requisite to take one portrait the final result is that all those points in which the six faces agree are brought out strongly while all those in which they differ are left vague and thus what may be termed a generic portrait of the six in contradistinction to a specific portrait of any one is produced  thus our ideas of single complex impressions are incomplete in one way and those of numerous more or less similar complex impressions are incomplete in another way that is to say they are generic not specific and hence it follows that our ideas of the impressions in question are not in the strict sense of the word copies of those impressions while at the same time they may exist in the mind independently of language  the generic ideas which are formed from several similar but not identical complex experiences are what are commonly called abstract or general ideas and berkeley endeavoured to prove that all general ideas are nothing but particular ideas annexed to a certain term which gives them a more extensive signification and makes them recall upon occasion other individuals which are similar to them hume says that he regards this as one of the greatest and the most valuable discoveries that has been made of late years in the republic of letters and endeavours to confirm it in such a manner that it shall be put beyond all doubt and controversy  i may venture to express a doubt whether he has succeeded in his object but the subject is an abstruse one and i must content myself with the remark that though berkeleys view appears to be largely applicable to such general ideas as are formed after language has been acquired and to all the more abstract sort of conceptions yet that general ideas of sensible objects may nevertheless be produced in the way indicated and may exist independently of language in dreams one sees houses trees and other objects which are perfectly recognisable as such but which remind one of the actual objects as seen out of the corner of the eye or of the pictures thrown by a badlyfocussed magic lantern a man addresses us who is like a figure seen by twilight or we travel through countries where every feature of the scenery is vague the outlines of the hills are illmarked and the rivers have no defined banks they are in short generic ideas of many past impressions of men hills and rivers an anatomist who occupies himself intently with the examination of several specimens of some new kind of animal in course of time acquires so vivid a conception of its form and structure that the idea may take visible shape and become a sort of waking dream but the figure which thus presents itself is generic not specific it is no copy of any one specimen but more or less a mean of the series and there seems no reason to doubt that the minds of children before they learn to speak and of deaf mutes are peopled with similarly generated generic ideas of sensible objects   it has been seen that a memory is a complex idea made up of at least two constituents in the first place there is the idea of an object and secondly there is the idea of the relation of antecedence between that object and some present objects  to say that one has a recollection of a given event and to express the belief that it happened are two ways of giving an account of one and the same mental fact but the former mode of stating the fact of memory is preferable at present because it certainly does not presuppose the existence of language in the mind of the rememberer while it may be said that the latter does it is perfectly possible to have the idea of an event a and of the events b c d which came between it and the present state e as mere mental pictures it is hardly to be doubted that children have very distinct memories long before they can speak and we believe that such is the case because they act upon their memories but if they act upon their memories they to all intents and purposes believe their memories in other words though being devoid of language the child cannot frame a proposition expressive of belief cannot say sugarplum was sweet yet the psychical operation of which that proposition is merely the verbal expression is perfectly effected the experience of the coexistence of sweetness with sugar has produced a state of mind which bears the same relation to a verbal proposition as the natural disposition to produce a given idea assumed to exist by descartes as an innate idea would bear to that idea put into words  the fact that the beliefs of memory precede the use of language and therefore are originally purely instinctive and independent of any rational justification should have been of great importance to hume from its bearing upon his theory of causation and it is curious that he has not adverted to it but always takes the trustworthiness of memories for granted it may be worth while briefly to make good the omission  that i was in pain yesterday is as certain to me as any matter of fact can be by no effort of the imagination is it possible for me really to entertain the contrary belief at the same time i am bound to admit that the whole foundation for my belief is the fact that the idea of pain is indissolubly associated in my mind with the idea of that much past time any one who will be at the trouble may provide himself with hundreds of examples to the same effect  this and similar observations are important under another aspect they prove that the idea of even a single strong impression may be so powerfully associated with that of a certain time as to originate a belief of which the contrary is inconceivable and which may therefore be properly said to be necessary a single weak or moderately strong impression may not be represented by any memory but this defect of weak experiences may be compensated by their repetition and what hume means by custom or habit is simply the repetition of experiences       wherever the repetition of any particular act or operation      produces a propensity to renew the same act or operation without      being impelled by any reasoning or process of the understanding we      always say that this propensity is the effect of custom by      employing that word we pretend not to have given the ultimate      reason of such a propensity we only point out a principle of human      nature which is universally acknowledged and which is well known      by its effectsiv p 52  it has been shown that an expectation is a complex idea which like a memory is made up of two constituents the one is the idea of an object the other is the idea of a relation of sequence between that object and some present object and the reasoning which applied to memories applies to expectations to have an expectation25 of a given event and to believe that it will happen are only two modes of stating the same fact again just in the same way as we call a memory put into words a belief so we give the same name to an expectation in like clothing and the fact already cited that a child before it can speak acts upon its memories is good evidence that it forms expectations the infant who knows the meaning neither of sugarplum nor of sweet nevertheless is in full possession of that complex idea which when he has learned to employ language will take the form of the verbal proposition a sugarplum will be sweet  thus beliefs of expectation or at any rate their potentialities are as much as those of memory antecedent to speech and are as incapable of justification by any logical process in fact expectations are but memories inverted the association which is the foundation of expectation must exist as a memory before it can play its part as hume says         it is certain we here advance a very intelligible proposition      at least if not a true one when we assert that after the constant      conjunction of two objects heat and flame for instance weight      and solidity we are determined by custom alone to expect the one      from the appearance of the other this hypothesis seems even the      only one which explains the difficulty why we draw from a thousand      instances an inference which we are not able to draw from one      instance that is in no respect different from them       custom then is the great guide of human life it is that      principle alone which renders our experience useful to us and      makes us expect for the future a similar train of events with      those which have appeared in the past       all belief of matteroffact or real existence is derived merely      from some object present to the memory or senses and a customary      conjunction between that and some other object or in other words      having found in many instances that any two kinds of objects      flame and heat snow and cold have always been conjoined together      if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses the mind is      carried by custom to expect heat or cold and to believe that      such a quality does exist and will discover itself upon a nearer      approach this belief is the necessary result of placing the mind      in such circumstances it is an operation of the soul when we are      so situated as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love when we      receive benefits or hatred when we meet with injuries all these      operations are a species of natural instincts which no reasoning      or process of the thought and understanding is able either to      produce or to preventiv pp 5256  the only comment that appears needful here is that hume has attached somewhat too exclusive a weight to that repetition of experiences to which alone the term custom can be properly applied the proverb says that a burnt child dreads the fire and any one who will make the experiment will find that one burning is quite sufficient to establish an indissoluble belief that contact with fire and pain go together  as a sort of inverted memory expectation follows the same laws hence while a belief of expectation is in most cases as hume truly says established by custom or the repetition of weak impressions it may quite well be based upon a single strong experience in the absence of language a specific memory cannot be strengthened by repetition it is obvious that that which has happened cannot happen again with the same collateral associations of coexistence and succession but memories of the coexistence and succession of impressions are capable of being indefinitely strengthened by the recurrence of similar impressions in the same order even though the collateral associations are totally different in fact the ideas of these impressions become generic  if i recollect that a piece of ice was cold yesterday nothing can strengthen the recollection of that particular fact on the contrary it may grow weaker in the absence of any record of it but if i touch ice today and again find it cold the association is repeated and the memory of it becomes stronger and by this very simple process of repetition of experience it has become utterly impossible for us to think of having handled ice without thinking of its coldness but that which is under the one aspect the strengthening of a memory is under the other the intensification of an expectation not only can we not think of having touched ice without feeling cold but we cannot think of touching ice in the future without expecting to feel cold an expectation so strong that it cannot be changed or abolished may thus be generated out of repeated experiences and it is important to note that such expectations may be formed quite unconsciously in my dressing room a certain can is usually kept full of water and i am in the habit of lifting it to pour out water for washing sometimes the servant has forgotten to fill it and then i find that when i take hold of the handle the can goes up with a jerk long association has in fact led me to expect the can to have a considerable weight and quite unawares my muscular effort is adjusted to the expectation  the process of strengthening generic memories of succession and at the same time intensifying expectations of succession is what is commonly called verification the impression b has frequently been observed to follow the impression a the association thus produced is represented as the memory a  b when the impression a appears again the idea of b follows associated with that of the immediate appearance of the impression b if the impression b does appear the expectation is said to be verified while the memory a  b is strengthened and gives rise in turn to a stronger expectation and repeated verification may render that expectation so strong that its nonverification is inconceivable  footnotes  24 it is not worth while for the present purpose to consider whether as all nervous action occupies a sensible time the duration of one impression might not overlap that of the impression which follows it in the case supposed  25 we give no name to faint memories but expectations of like character play so large a part in human affairs that they together with the associated emotions of pleasure and pain are distinguished as hopes or fears     chapter v  the mental phenomena of animals   in the course of the preceding chapters attention has been more than once called to the fact that the elements of consciousness and the operations of the mental faculties under discussion exist independently of and antecedent to the existence of language  if any weight is to be attached to arguments from analogy there is overwhelming evidence in favour of the belief that children before they can speak and deaf mutes possess the feelings to which those who have acquired the faculty of speech apply the name of sensations that they have the feelings of relation that trains of ideas pass through their minds that generic ideas are formed from specific ones and that among these ideas of memory and expectation occupy a most important place inasmuch as in their quality of potential beliefs they furnish the grounds of action this conclusion in truth is one of those which though they cannot be demonstrated are never doubted and since it is highly probable and cannot be disproved we are quite safe in accepting it as at any rate a good working hypothesis  but if we accept it we must extend it to a much wider assemblage of living beings whatever cogency is attached to the arguments in favour of the occurrence of all the fundamental phenomena of mind in young children and deaf mutes an equal force must be allowed to appertain to those which may be adduced to prove that the higher animals have minds we must admit that hume does not express himself too strongly when he says       no truth appears to me more evident than that the beasts are      endowed with thought and reason as well as men the arguments are      in this case so obvious that they never escape the most stupid and      ignoranti p 232  in fact this is one of the few cases in which the conviction which forces itself upon the stupid and the ignorant is fortified by the reasonings of the intelligent and has its foundation deepened by every increase of knowledge it is not merely that the observation of the actions of animals almost irresistibly suggests the attribution to them of mental states such as those which accompany corresponding actions in men the minute comparison which has been instituted by anatomists and physiologists between the organs which we know to constitute the apparatus of thought in man and the corresponding organs in brutes has demonstrated the existence of the closest similarity between the two not only in structure as far as the microscope will carry us but in function as far as functions are determinable by experiment there is no question in the mind of any one acquainted with the facts that so far as observation and experiment can take us the structure and the functions of the nervous system are fundamentally the same in an ape or in a dog and in a man and the suggestion that we must stop at the exact point at which direct proof fails us and refuse to believe that the similarity which extends so far stretches yet further is no better than a quibble robinson crusoe did not feel bound to conclude from the single human footprint which he saw in the sand that the maker of the impression had only one leg  structure for structure down to the minutest microscopical details the eye the ear the olfactory organs the nerves the spinal cord the brain of an ape or of a dog correspond with the same organs in the human subject cut a nerve and the evidence of paralysis or of insensibility is the same in the two cases apply pressure to the brain or administer a narcotic and the signs of intelligence disappear in the one as in the other whatever reason we have for believing that the changes which take place in the normal cerebral substance of man give rise to states of consciousness the same reason exists for the belief that the modes of motion of the cerebral substance of an ape or of a dog produce like effects  a dog acts as if he had all the different kinds of impressions of sensation of which each of us is cognisant moreover he governs his movements exactly as if he had the feelings of distance form succession likeness and unlikeness with which we are familiar or as if the impressions of relation were generated in his mind as they are in our own sleeping dogs frequently appear to dream if they do it must be admitted that ideation goes on in them while they are asleep and in that case there is no reason to doubt that they are conscious of trains of ideas in their waking state further that dogs if they possess ideas at all have memories and expectations and those potential beliefs of which these states are the foundation can hardly be doubted by any one who is conversant with their ways finally there would appear to be no valid argument against the supposition that dogs form generic ideas of sensible objects one of the most curious peculiarities of the dog mind is its inherent snobbishness shown by the regard paid to external respectability the dog who barks furiously at a beggar will let a welldressed man pass him without opposition has he not then a generic idea of rags and dirt associated with the idea of aversion and that of sleek broadcloth associated with the idea of liking  in short it seems hard to assign any good reason for denying to the higher animals any mental state or process in which the employment of the vocal or visual symbols of which language is composed is not involved and comparative psychology confirms the position in relation to the rest of the animal world assigned to man by comparative anatomy as comparative anatomy is easily able to show that physically man is but the last term of a long series of forms which lead by slow gradations from the highest mammal to the almost formless speck of living protoplasm which lies on the shadowy boundary between animal and vegetable life so comparative psychology though but a young science and far short of her elder sisters growth points to the same conclusion  in the absence of a distinct nervous system we have no right to look for its product consciousness and even in those forms of animal life in which the nervous apparatus has reached no higher degree of development than that exhibited by the system of the spinal cord and the foundation of the brain in ourselves the argument from analogy leaves the assumption of the existence of any form of consciousness unsupported with the superaddition of a nervous apparatus corresponding with the cerebrum in ourselves it is allowable to suppose the appearance of the simplest states of consciousness or the sensations and it is conceivable that these may at first exist without any power of reproducing them as memories and consequently without ideation still higher an apparatus of correlation may be superadded until as all these organs become more developed the condition of the highest speechless animals is attained  it is a remarkable example of humes sagacity that he perceived the importance of a branch of science which even now can hardly be said to exist and that in a remarkable passage he sketches in bold outlines the chief features of comparative psychology         any theory by which we explain the operations of the      understanding or the origin and connexion of the passions in man      will acquire additional authority if we find that the same theory      is requisite to explain the same phenomena in all other animals we      shall make trial of this with regard to the hypothesis by which we      have in the foregoing discourse endeavoured to account for all      experimental reasonings and it is hoped that this new point of      view will serve to confirm all our former observations       first it seems evident that animals as well as men learn many      things from experience and infer that the same events will always      follow from the same causes by this principle they become      acquainted with the more obvious properties of external objects      and gradually from their birth treasure up a knowledge of the      nature of fire water earth stones heights depths c and of      the effects which result from their operation the ignorance and      inexperience of the young are here plainly distinguishable from the      cunning and sagacity of the old who have learned by long      observation to avoid what hurt them and pursue what gave ease or      pleasure a horse that has been accustomed to the field becomes      acquainted with the proper height which he can leap and will never      attempt what exceeds his force and ability an old greyhound will      trust the more fatiguing part of the chase to the younger and will      place himself so as to meet the hare in her doubles nor are the      conjectures which he forms on this occasion founded on anything but      his observation and experience       this is still more evident from the effects of discipline and      education on animals who by the proper application of rewards and      punishments may be taught any course of action the most contrary      to their natural instincts and propensities is it not experience      which renders a dog apprehensive of pain when you menace him or      lift up the whip to beat him is it not even experience which makes      him answer to his name and infer from such an arbitrary sound that      you mean him rather than any of his fellows and intend to call      him when you pronounce it in a certain manner and with a certain      tone and accent       in all these cases we may observe that the animal infers some fact      beyond what immediately strikes his senses and that this inference      is altogether founded on past experience while the creature      expects from the present object the same consequences which it has      always found in its observation to result from similar objects       secondly it is impossible that this inference of the animal can      be founded on any process of argument or reasoning by which he      concludes that like events must follow like objects and that the      course of nature will always be regular in its operations for if      there be in reality any arguments of this nature they surely lie      too abstruse for the observation of such imperfect understandings      since it may well employ the utmost care and attention of a      philosophic genius to discover and observe them animals therefore      are not guided in these inferences by reasoning neither are      children neither are the generality of mankind in their ordinary      actions and conclusions neither are philosophers themselves who      in all the active parts of life are in the main the same as the      vulgar and are governed by the same maxims nature must have      provided some other principle of more ready and more general use      and application nor can an operation of such immense consequence      in life as that of inferring effects from causes be trusted to the      uncertain process of reasoning and argumentation were this      doubtful with regard to men it seems to admit of no question with      regard to the brute creation and the conclusion being once firmly      established in the one we have a strong presumption from all the      rules of analogy that it ought to be universally admitted without      any exception or reserve it is custom alone which engages animals      from every object that strikes their senses to infer its usual      attendant and carries their imagination from the appearance of the      one to conceive the other in that particular manner which we      denominate belief no other explication can be given of this      operation in all the higher as well as lower classes of sensitive      beings which fall under our notice and observationiv pp      1224  it will be observed that hume appears to contrast the inference of the animal with the process of argument or reasoning in man but it would be a complete misapprehension of his intention if we were to suppose that he thereby means to imply that there is any real difference between the two processes the inference of the animal is a potential belief of expectation the process of argument or reasoning in man is based upon potential beliefs of expectation which are formed in the man exactly in the same way as in the animal but in men endowed with speech the mental state which constitutes the potential belief is represented by a verbal proposition and thus becomes what all the world recognises as a belief the fallacy which hume combats is that the proposition or verbal representative of a belief has come to be regarded as a reality instead of as the mere symbol which it really is and that reasoning or logic which deals with nothing but propositions is supposed to be necessary in order to validate the natural fact symbolised by those propositions it is a fallacy similar to that of supposing that money is the foundation of wealth whereas it is only the wholly unessential symbol of property  in the passage which immediately follows that just quoted hume makes admissions which might be turned to serious account against some of his own doctrines       but though animals learn many parts of their knowledge from      observation there are also many parts of it which they derive from      the original hand of nature which much exceed the share of      capacity they possess on ordinary occasions and in which they      improve little or nothing by the longest practice and experience      these we denominate instincts and are so apt to admire as      something very extraordinary and inexplicable by all the      disquisitions of human understanding but our wonder will perhaps      cease or diminish when we consider that the experimental reasoning      itself which we possess in common with beasts and on which the      whole conduct of life depends is nothing but a species of instinct      or mechanical power that acts in us unknown to ourselves and in      its chief operations is not directed by any such relations or      comparison of ideas as are the proper objects of our intellectual      faculties       though the instinct be different yet still it is an instinct      which teaches a man to avoid the fire as much as that which      teaches a bird with such exactness the art of incubation and the      whole economy and order of its nurseryiv pp 125 126  the parallel here drawn between the avoidance of a fire by a man and the incubatory instinct of a bird is inexact the man avoids fire when he has had experience of the pain produced by burning but the bird incubates the first time it lays eggs and therefore before it has had any experience of incubation for the comparison to be admissible it would be necessary that a man should avoid fire the first time he saw it which is notoriously not the case  the term instinct is very vague and illdefined it is commonly employed to denote any action or even feeling which is not dictated by conscious reasoning whether it is or is not the result of previous experience it is instinct which leads a chicken just hatched to pick up a grain of corn parental love is said to be instinctive the drowning man who catches at a straw does it instinctively and the hand that accidentally touches something hot is drawn back by instinct thus instinct is made to cover everything from a simple reflex movement in which the organ of consciousness need not be at all implicated up to a complex combination of acts directed towards a definite end and accompanied by intense consciousness  but this loose employment of the term instinct really accords with the nature of the thing for it is wholly impossible to draw any line of demarcation between reflex actions and instincts if a frog on the flank of which a little drop of acid has been placed rubs it off with the foot of the same side and if that foot be held performs the same operation at the cost of much effort with the other foot it certainly displays a curious instinct but it is no less true that the whole operation is a reflex operation of the spinal cord which can be performed quite as well when the brain is destroyed and between which and simple reflex actions there is a complete series of gradations in like manner when an infant takes the breast it is impossible to say whether the action should be rather termed instinctive or reflex  what are usually called the instincts of animals are however acts of such a nature that if they were performed by men they would involve the generation of a series of ideas and of inferences from them and it is a curious and apparently an insoluble problem whether they are or are not accompanied by cerebral changes of the same nature as those which give rise to ideas and inferences in ourselves when a chicken picks up a grain for example are there firstly certain sensations accompanied by the feeling of relation between the grain and its own body secondly a desire of the grain thirdly a volition to seize it or are only the sensational terms of the series actually represented in consciousness  the latter seems the more probable opinion though it must be admitted that the other alternative is possible but in this case the series of mental states which occurs is such as would be represented in language by a series of propositions and would afford proof positive of the existence of innate ideas in the cartesian sense indeed a metaphysical fowl brooding over the mental operations of his fullyfledged consciousness might appeal to the fact as proof that in the very first action of his life he assumed the existence of the ego and the nonego and of a relation between the two  in all seriousness if the existence of instincts be granted the possibility of the existence of innate ideas in the most extended sense ever imagined by descartes must also be admitted in fact descartes as we have soon illustrates what he means by an innate idea by the analogy of hereditary diseases or hereditary mental peculiarities such as generosity on the other hand hereditary mental tendencies may justly be termed instincts and still more appropriately might those special proclivities which constitute what we call genius come into the same category  the child who is impelled to draw as soon as it can hold a pencil the mozart who breaks out into music as early the boy bidder who worked out the most complicated sums without learning arithmetic the boy pascal who evolved euclid out of his own consciousness all these may be said to have been impelled by instinct as much as are the beaver and the bee and the man of genius is distinct in kind from the man of cleverness by reason of the working within him of strong innate tendencieswhich cultivation may improve but which it can no more create than horticulture can make thistles bear figs the analogy between a musical instrument and the mind holds good here also art and industry may get much music of a sort out of a penny whistle but when all is done it has no chance against an organ the innate musical potentialities of the two are infinitely different     chapter vi  languagepropositions concerning necessary truths   though we may accept humes conclusion that speechless animals think believe and reason yet it must be borne in mind that there is an important difference between the signification of the terms when applied to them and when applied to those animals which possess language the thoughts of the former are trains of mere feelings those of the latter are in addition trains of the ideas of the signs which represent feelings and which are called words  a word in fact is a spoken or written sign the idea of which is by repetition so closely associated with the idea of the simple or complex feeling which it represents that the association becomes indissoluble no englishman for example can think of the word dog without immediately having the idea of the group of impressions to which that name is given and conversely the group of impressions immediately calls up the idea of the word dog  the association of words with impressions and ideas is the process of naming and language approaches perfection in proportion as the shades of difference between various ideas and impressions are represented by differences in their names  the names of simple impressions and ideas or of groups of coexistent or successive complex impressions and ideas considered per se are substantives as redness dog silver mouth while the names of impressions or ideas considered as parts or attributes of a complex whole are adjectives thus redness considered as part of the complex idea of a rose becomes the adjective red flesheater as part of the idea of a dog is represented by carnivorous whiteness as part of the idea of silver is white and so on  the linguistic machinery for the expression of belief is called predication and as all beliefs express ideas of relation we may say that the sign of predication is the verbal symbol of a feeling of relation the words which serve to indicate predication are verbs if i say silver and then white i merely utter two names but if i interpose between them the verb is i express a belief in the coexistence of the feeling of whiteness with the other feelings which constitute the totality of the complex idea of silver in other words i predicate whiteness of silver  in such a case as this the verb expresses predication and nothing else and is called a copula but in the great majority of verbs the word is the sign of a complex idea and the predication is expressed only by its form thus in silver shines the verb to shine is the sign for the feeling of brightness and the mark of predication lies in the form shines  another result is brought about by the forms of verbs by slight modifications they are made to indicate that a belief or predication is a memory or is an expectation thus silver shone expresses a memory silver will shine an expectation  the form of words which expresses a predication is a proposition hence every predication is the verbal equivalent of a belief and as every belief is either an immediate consciousness a memory or an expectation and as every expectation is traceable to a memory it follows that in the long run all propositions express either immediate states of consciousness or memories the proposition which predicates a of x must mean either that the fact is testified by my present consciousness as when i say that two colours visible at this moment resemble one another or that a is indissolubly associated with x in memory or that a is indissolubly associated with x in expectation but it has already been shown that expectation is only an expression of memory  hume does not discuss the nature of language but so much of what remains to be said concerning his philosophical tenets turns upon the value and the origin of verbal propositions that this summary sketch of the relations of language to the thinking process will probably not be deemed superfluous  so large an extent of the field of thought is traversed by hume in his discussion of the verbal propositions in which mankind enshrine their beliefs that it would be impossible to follow him throughout all the windings of his long journey within the limits of this essay i purpose therefore to limit myself to those propositions which concern1 necessary truths 2 the order of nature 3 the soul 4 theism 5 the passions and volition 6 the principle of morals   humes views respecting necessary truths and more particularly concerning causation have more than any other part of his teaching contributed to give him a prominent place in the history of philosophy       all the objects of human reason and inquiry may naturally be      divided into two kinds to wit relations of ideas and matters      of fact of the first kind are the sciences of geometry algebra      and arithmetic and in short every affirmation which is either      intuitively or demonstratively certain that the square of the      hypothenuse is equal to the square of the two sides is a      proposition which expresses a relation between these two figures      that three times five is equal to the half of thirty expresses a      relation between these numbers propositions of this kind are      discoverable by the mere operation of thought without dependence on      whatever is anywhere existent in the universe though there never      were a circle or a triangle in nature the truths demonstrated by      euclid would for ever retain their certainty and evidence       matters of fact which are the second objects of human reason are      not ascertained in the same manner nor is an evidence of their      truth however great of a like nature with the foregoing the      contrary of every matter of fact is still possible because it can      never imply a contradiction and is conceived by the mind with the      same facility and distinctness as if ever so conformable to      reality that the sun will not rise tomorrow is no less      intelligible a proposition and implies no more contradiction than      the affirmation that it will rise we should in vain therefore      attempt to demonstrate its falsehood were it demonstratively      false it would imply a contradiction and could never be      distinctly conceived by the mindiv pp 32 33  the distinction here drawn between the truths of geometry and other kinds of truth is far less sharply indicated in the treatise but as hume expressly disowns any opinions on these matters but such as are expressed in the inquiry we may confine ourselves to the latter and it is needful to look narrowly into the propositions here laid down as much stress has been laid upon humes admission that the truths of mathematics are intuitively and demonstratively certain in other words that they are necessary and in that respect differ from all other kinds of belief  what is meant by the assertion that propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of thought without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe  suppose that there were no such things as impressions of sight and touch anywhere in the universe what idea could we have even of a straight line much less of a triangle and of the relations between its sides the fundamental proposition of all humes philosophy is that ideas are copied from impressions and therefore if there were no impressions of straight lines and triangles there could be no ideas of straight lines and triangles but what we mean by the universe is the sum of our actual and possible impressions  so again whether our conception of number is derived from relations of impressions in space or in time the impressions must exist in nature that is in experience before their relations can be perceived form and number are mere names for certain relations between matters of fact unless a man had seen or felt the difference between a straight line and a crooked one straight and crooked would have no more meaning to him than red and blue to the blind  the axiom that things which are equal to the same are equal to one another is only a particular case of the predication of similarity if there were no impressions it is obvious that there could be no predicates but what is an existence in the universe but an impression  if what are called necessary truths are rigidly analysed they will be found to be of two kinds either they depend on the convention which underlies the possibility of intelligible speech that terms shall always have the same meaning or they are propositions the negation of which implies the dissolution of some association in memory or expectation which is in fact indissoluble or the denial of some fact of immediate consciousness  the necessary truth a  a means that the perception which is called a shall always be called a the necessary truth that two straight lines cannot inclose a space means that we have no memory and can form no expectation of their so doing the denial of the necessary truth that the thought now in my mind exists involves the denial of consciousness  to the assertion that the evidence of matter of fact is not so strong as that of relations of ideas it may be justly replied that a great number of matters of fact are nothing but relations of ideas if i say that red is unlike blue i make an assertion concerning a relation of ideas but it is also matter of fact and the contrary proposition is inconceivable if i remember26 something that happened five minutes ago that is matter of fact and at the same time it expresses a relation between the event remembered and the present time it is wholly inconceivable to me that the event did not happen so that my assurance respecting it is as strong as that which i have respecting any other necessary truth in fact the man is either very wise or very virtuous or very lucky perhaps all three who has gone through life without accumulating a store of such necessary beliefs which he would give a good deal to be able to disbelieve  it would be beside the mark to discuss the matter further on the present occasion it is sufficient to point out that whatever may be the differences between mathematical and other truths they do not justify humes statement and it is at any rate impossible to prove that the cogency of mathematical first principles is due to anything more than these circumstances that the experiences with which they are concerned are among the first which arise in the mind that they are so incessantly repeated as to justify us according to the ordinary laws of ideation in expecting that the associations which they form will be of extreme tenacity while the fact that the expectations based upon them are always verified finishes the process of welding them together  thus if the axioms of mathematics are innate nature would seem to have taken unnecessary trouble since the ordinary process of association appears to be amply sufficient to confer upon them all the universality and necessity which they actually possess   whatever needless admissions hume may have made respecting other necessary truths he is quite clear about the axiom of causation that whatever event has a beginning must have a cause whether and in what sense it is a necessary truth and that question being decided whence it is derived  with respect to the first question hume denies that it is a necessary truth in the sense that we are unable to conceive the contrary the evidence by which he supports this conclusion in the inquiry however is not strictly relevant to the issue       no object ever discovers by the qualities which appear to the      senses either the cause which produced it or the effects which      will arise from it nor can our reason unassisted by experience      ever draw any inference concerning real existence and matter of      factiv p 35  abundant illustrations are given of this assertion which indeed cannot be seriously doubted but it does not follow that because we are totally unable to say what cause preceded or what effect will succeed any event we do not necessarily suppose that the event had a cause and will be succeeded by an effect the scientific investigator who notes a new phenomenon may be utterly ignorant of its cause but he will without hesitation seek for that cause if you ask him why he does so he will probably say that it must have had a cause and thereby imply that his belief in causation is a necessary belief  in the treatise hume indeed takes the bull by the horns         as all distinct ideas are separable from each other and as      the ideas of cause and effect are evidently distinct twill be      easy for us to conceive any object to be nonexistent this moment      find existent the next without conjoining to it the distinct idea      of a cause or productive principlei p 111  if hume had been content to state what he believed to be matter of fact and had abstained from giving superfluous reasons for that which is susceptible of being proved or disproved only by personal experience his position would have been stronger for it seems clear that on the ground of observation he is quite right any man who lets his fancy run riot in a waking dream may experience the existence at one moment and the nonexistence at the next of phenomena which suggest no connexion of cause and effect not only so but it is notorious that to the unthinking mass of mankind ninetenths of the facts of life do not suggest the relation of cause and effect and they practically deny the existence of any such relation by attributing them to chance few gamblers but would stare if they were told that the falling of a die on a particular face is as much the effect of a definite cause as the fact of its falling it is a proverb that the wind bloweth where it listeth and even thoughtful men usually receive with surprise the suggestion that the form of the crest of every wave that breaks winddriven on the seashore and the direction of every particle of foam that flies before the gale are the exact effects of definite causes and as such must be capable of being determined deductively from the laws of motion and the properties of air and water so again there are large numbers of highly intelligent persons who rather pride themselves on their fixed belief that our volitions have no cause or that the will causes itself which is either the same thing or a contradiction in terms  humes argument in support of what appears to be a true proposition however is of the circular sort for the major premiss that all distinct ideas are separable in thought assumes the question at issue  but the question whether the idea of causation is necessary or not is really of very little importance for to say that an idea is necessary is simply to affirm that we cannot conceive the contrary and the fact that we cannot conceive the contrary of any belief may be a presumption but is certainly no proof of its truth  in the wellknown experiment of touching a single round object such as a marble with crossed fingers it is utterly impossible to conceive that we have not two round objects under them and though light is undoubtedly a mere sensation arising in the brain it is utterly impossible to conceive that it is not outside the retina in the same way he who touches anything with a rod not only is irresistibly led to believe that the sensation of contact is at the end of the rod but is utterly incapable of conceiving that this sensation is really in his head yet that which is inconceivable is manifestly true in all these cases the beliefs and the unbeliefs are alike necessary and alike erroneous  it is commonly urged that the axiom of causation cannot be derived from experience because experience only proves that many things have causes whereas the axiom declares that all things have causes the syllogism many things which come into existence have causes a has come into existence therefore a had a cause is obviously fallacious if a is not previously shown to be one of the many things and this objection is perfectly sound so far as it goes the axiom of causation cannot possibly be deduced from any general proposition which simply embodies experience but it does not follow that the belief or expectation expressed by the axiom is not a product of experience generated antecedently to and altogether independently of the logically unjustifiable language in which we express it  in fact the axiom of causation resembles all other beliefs of expectation in being the verbal symbol of a purely automatic act of the mind which is altogether extralogical and would be illogical if it were not constantly verified by experience experience as we have seen stores up memories memories generate expectations or beliefswhy they do so may be explained hereafter by proper investigation of cerebral physiology but to seek for the reason of the facts in the verbal symbols by which they are expressed and to be astonished that it is not to be found there is surely singular and what hume did was to turn attention from the verbal proposition to the psychical fact of which it is the symbol       when any natural object or event is presented it is impossible      for us by any sagacity or penetration to discover or even      conjecture without experience what event will result from it or      to carry our foresight beyond that object which is immediately      present to the memory and senses even after one instance or      experiment where we have observed a particular event to follow      upon another we are not entitled to form a general rule or      foretell what will happen in like cases it being justly esteemed      an unpardonable temerity to judge of the whole course of nature      from one single experiment however accurate or certain but when      one particular species of events has always in all instances been      conjoined with another we make no longer any scruple of      foretelling one upon the appearance of the other and of employing      that reasoning which can alone assure us of any matter of fact or      existence we then call the one object cause the other effect      we suppose that there is some connexion between them some power in      the one by which it infallibly produces the other and operates      with the greatest certainty and strongest necessity but there      is nothing in a number of instances different from every single      instance which is supposed to be exactly similar except only      that after a repetition of similar instances the mind is carried      by habit upon the appearance of one event to expect its usual      attendant and to believe that it will exist the first time a      man saw the communication of motion by impulse as by the shock of      two billiard balls he could not pronounce that the one event was      connected but only that it was conjoined with the other      after he has observed several instances of this nature he then      pronounces them to be connected what alteration has happened to      give rise to this new idea of connexion nothing but that he now      feels those events to be connected in his imagination and can      readily foresee the existence of the one from the appearance of the      other when we say therefore that one object is connected with      another we mean only that they have acquired a connexion in our      thought and give rise to this inference by which they become      proofs of each others existence a conclusion which is somewhat      extraordinary but which seems founded on sufficient      evidenceiv pp 8789  in the fifteenth section of the third part of the treatise under the head of the rules by which to judge of causes and effects hume gives a sketch of the method of allocating effects to their causes upon which so far as i am aware no improvement was made down to the time of the publication of mills logic of mills four methods that of agreement is indicated in the following passage         where several different objects produce the same effect it      must be by means of some quality which we discover to be common      amongst them for as like effects imply like causes we must always      ascribe the causation to the circumstance wherein we discover the      resemblancei p 229  next the foundation of the method of difference is stated       the difference in the effects of two resembling objects must      proceed from that particular in which they differ for as like      causes always produce like effects when in any instance we find      our expectation to be disappointed we must conclude that this      irregularity proceeds from some difference in the causesi p      230  in the succeeding paragraph the method of concomitant variations is foreshadowed       when any object increases or diminishes with the increase or      diminution of the cause tis to be regarded as a compounded      effect derived from the union of the several different effects      which arise from the several different parts of the cause the      absence or presence of one part of the cause is here supposed to be      always attended with the absence or presence of a proportionable      part of the effect this constant conjunction sufficiently proves      that the one part is the cause of the other we must however      beware not to draw such a conclusion from a few experimentsi      p 230  lastly the following rule though awkwardly stated contains a suggestion of the method of residues         an object which exists for any time in its full perfection      without any effect is not the sole cause of that effect but      requires to be assisted by some other principle which may forward      its influence and operation for as like effects necessarily follow      from like causes and in a contiguous time and place their      separation for a moment shows that these causes are not complete      onesi p 230  in addition to the bare notion of necessary connexion between the cause and its effect we undoubtedly find in our minds the idea of something resident in the cause which as we say produces the effect and we call this something force power or energy hume explains force and power as the results of the association with inanimate causes of the feelings of endeavour or resistance which we experience when our bodies give rise to or resist motion  if i throw a ball i have a sense of effort which ends when the ball leaves my hand and if i catch a ball i have a sense of resistance which comes to an end with the quiescence of the ball in the former case there is a strong suggestion of something having gone from myself into the ball in the latter of something having been received from the ball let any one hold a piece of iron near a strong magnet and the feeling that the magnet endeavours to pull the iron one way in the same manner as he endeavours to pull it in the opposite direction is very strong  as hume says       no animal can put external bodies in motion without the sentiment      of a nisus or endeavour and every animal has a sentiment or      feeling from the stroke or blow of an external object that is in      motion these sensations which are merely animal and from which      we can a priori draw no inference we are apt to transfer to      inanimate objects and to suppose that they have some such feelings      whenever they transfer or receive motioniv p 91 note  it is obviously however an absurdity not less gross than that of supposing the sensation of warmth to exist in a fire to imagine that the subjective sensation of effort or resistance in ourselves can be present in external objects when they stand in the relation of causes to other objects  to the argument that we have a right to suppose the relation of cause and effect to contain something more than invariable succession because when we ourselves act as causes or in volition we are conscious of exerting power hume replies that we know nothing of the feeling we call power except as effort or resistance and that we have not the slightest means of knowing whether it has anything to do with the production of bodily motion or mental changes and he points out as descartes and spinoza had done before him that when voluntary motion takes place that which we will is not the immediate consequence of the act of volition but something which is separated from it by a long chain of causes and effects if the will is the cause of the movement of a limb it can be so only in the sense that the guard who gives the order to go on is the cause of the transport of a train from one station to another       we learn from anatomy that the immediate object of power in      voluntary motion is not the member itself which is moved but      certain muscles and nerves and animal spirits and perhaps      something still more minute and unknown through which the motion      is successively propagated ere it reach the member itself whose      motion is the immediate object of volition can there be a more      certain proof that the power by which the whole operation is      performed so far from being directly and fully known by an inward      sentiment or consciousness is to the last degree mysterious and      unintelligible here the mind wills a certain event immediately      another event unknown to ourselves and totally different from the      one intended is produced this event produces another equally      unknown till at last through a long succession the desired event      is producediv p 78  a still stronger argument against ascribing an objective existence to force or power on the strength of our supposed direct intuition of power in voluntary acts may be urged from the unquestionable fact that we do not know and cannot know that volition does cause corporeal motion while there is a great deal to be said in favour of the view that it is no cause but merely a concomitant of that motion but the nature of volition will be more fitly considered hereafter  footnote  26 hume however expressly includes the records of our memory among his matters of factiv p 33     chapter vii  the order of nature miracles   if our beliefs of expectation are based on our beliefs of memory and anticipation is only inverted recollection it necessarily follows that every belief of expectation implies the belief that the future will have a certain resemblance to the past from the first hour of experience onwards this belief is constantly being verified until old age is inclined to suspect that experience has nothing new to offer and when the experience of generation after generation is recorded and a single book tells us more than methuselah could have learned had he spent every waking hour of his thousand years in learning when apparent disorders are found to be only the recurrent pulses of a slow working order and the wonder of a year becomes the commonplace of a century when repeated and minute examination never reveals a break in the chain of causes and effects and the whole edifice of practical life is built upon our faith in its continuity the belief that that chain has never been broken and will never be broken becomes one of the strongest and most justifiable of human convictions and it must be admitted to be a reasonable request if we ask those who would have us put faith in the actual occurrence of interruptions of that order to produce evidence in favour of their view not only equal but superior in weight to that which leads us to adopt ours  this is the essential argument of humes famous disquisition upon miracles and it may safely be declared to be irrefragable but it must be admitted that hume has surrounded the kernel of his essay with a shell of very doubtful value  the first step in this as in all other discussions is to come to a clear understanding as to the meaning of the terms employed argumentation whether miracles are possible and if possible credible is mere beating the air until the arguers have agreed what they mean by the word miracles  hume with less than his usual perspicuity but in accordance with a common practice of believers in the miraculous defines a miracle as a violation of the laws of nature or as a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the deity or by the interposition of some invisible agent  there must he says       be an uniform experience against every miraculous event otherwise      the event would not merit that appellation and as an uniform      experience amounts to a proof there is here a direct and full      proof from the nature of the fact against the existence of any      miracle nor can such a proof be destroyed or the miracle rendered      credible but by an opposite proof which is superioriv p      134  every one of these dicta appears to be open to serious objection  the word miraclemiraculumin its primitive and legitimate sense simply means something wonderful  cicero applies it as readily to the fancies of philosophers portenta et miracula philosophorum somniantium as we do to the prodigies of priests and the source of the wonder which a miracle excites is the belief on the part of those who witness it that it transcends or contradicts ordinary experience  the definition of a miracle as a violation of the laws of nature is in reality an employment of language which on the face of the matter cannot be justified for nature means neither more nor less than that which is the sum of phenomena presented to our experience the totality of events past present and to come every event must be taken to be a part of nature until proof to the contrary is supplied and such proof is from the nature of the case impossible  hume asks       why is it more than probable that all men must die that lead      cannot of itself remain suspended in the air that fire consumes      wood and is extinguished by water unless it be that these events      are found agreeable to the laws of nature and there is required a      violation of those laws or in other words a miracle to prevent      themiv p 133  but the reply is obvious not one of these events is more than probable though the probability may reach such a very high degree that in ordinary language we are justified in saying that the opposite events are impossible calling our often verified experience a law of nature adds nothing to its value nor in the slightest degree increases any probability that it will be verified again which may arise out of the fact of its frequent verification  if a piece of lead were to remain suspended of itself in the air the occurrence would be a miracle in the sense of a wonderful event indeed but no one trained in the methods of science would imagine that any law of nature was really violated thereby he would simply set to work to investigate the conditions under which so highly unexpected an occurrence took place and thereby enlarge his experience and modify his hitherto unduly narrow conception of the laws of nature  the alternative definition that a miracle is a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the deity or by the interposition of some invisible agent iv p 134 note is still less defensible for a vast number of miracles have professedly been worked neither by the deity nor by any invisible agent but by beelzebub and his compeers or by very visible men  moreover not to repeat what has been said respecting the absurdity of supposing that something which occurs is a transgression of laws our only knowledge of which is derived from the observation of that which occurs upon what sort of evidence can we be justified in concluding that a given event is the effect of a particular volition of the deity or of the interposition of some invisible that is unperceivable agent it may be so but how is the assertion that it is so to be tested if it be said that the event exceeds the power of natural causes what can justify such a saying the dayfly has better grounds for calling a thunderstorm supernatural than has man with his experience of an infinitesimal fraction of duration to say that the most astonishing event that can be imagined is beyond the scope of natural causes       whatever is intelligible and can be distinctly conceived implies      no contradiction and can never be proved false by any      demonstration argument or abstract reasoning a prioriiv      p 44  so wrote hume with perfect justice in his sceptical doubts but a miracle in the sense of a sudden and complete change in the customary order of nature is intelligible can be distinctly conceived implies no contradiction and therefore according to humes own showing cannot be proved false by any demonstrative argument  nevertheless in diametrical contradiction to his own principles hume says elsewhere       it is a miracle that a dead man should come to life because that      has never been observed in any age or countryiv p 134  that is to say there is an uniform experience against such an event and therefore if it occurs it is a violation of the laws of nature or to put the argument in its naked absurdity that which never has happened never can happen without a violation of the laws of nature in truth if a dead man did come to life the fact would be evidence not that any law of nature had been violated but that those laws even when they express the results of a very long and uniform experience are necessarily based on incomplete knowledge and are to be held only as grounds of more or less justifiable expectation  to sum up the definition of a miracle as a suspension or a contravention of the order of nature is selfcontradictory because all we know of the order of nature is derived from our observation of the course of events of which the socalled miracle is a part on the other hand no event is too extraordinary to be impossible and therefore if by the term miracles we mean only extremely wonderful events there can be no just ground for denying the possibility of their occurrence   but when we turn from the question of the possibility of miracles however they may be defined in the abstract to that respecting the grounds upon which we are justified in believing any particular miracle humes arguments have a very different value for they resolve themselves into a simple statement of the dictates of common sensewhich may be expressed in this canon the more a statement of fact conflicts with previous experience the more complete must be the evidence which is to justify us in believing it it is upon this principle that every one carries on the business of common life if a man tells me he saw a piebald horse in piccadilly i believe him without hesitation the thing itself is likely enough and there is no imaginable motive for his deceiving me but if the same person tells me he observed a zebra there i might hesitate a little about accepting his testimony unless i were well satisfied not only as to his previous acquaintance with zebras but as to his powers and opportunities of observation in the present case if however my informant assured me that he beheld a centaur trotting down that famous thoroughfare i should emphatically decline to credit his statement and this even if he were the most saintly of men and ready to suffer martyrdom in support of his belief in such a case i could of course entertain no doubt of the good faith of the witness it would be only his competency which unfortunately has very little to do with good faith or intensity of conviction which i should presume to call in question  indeed i hardly know what testimony would satisfy me of the existence of a live centaur to put an extreme case suppose the late johannes müller of berlin the greatest anatomist and physiologist among my contemporaries had barely affirmed he had seen a live centaur i should certainly have been staggered by the weight of an assertion coming from such an authority but i could have got no further than a suspension of judgment for on the whole it would have been more probable that even he had fallen into some error of interpretation of the facts which came under his observation than that such an animal as a centaur really existed and nothing short of a careful monograph by a highly competent investigator accompanied by figures and measurements of all the most important parts of a centaur put forth under circumstances which could leave no doubt that falsification or misinterpretation would meet with immediate exposure could possibly enable a man of science to feel that he acted conscientiously in expressing his belief in the existence of a centaur on the evidence of testimony  this hesitation about admitting the existence of such an animal as a centaur be it observed does not deserve reproach as scepticism but moderate praise as mere scientific good faith it need not imply and it does not so far as i am concerned any a priori hypothesis that a centaur is an impossible animal or that his existence if he did exist would violate the laws of nature indubitably the organisation of a centaur presents a variety of practical difficulties to an anatomist and physiologist and a good many of those generalisations of our present experience which we are pleased to call laws of nature would be upset by the appearance of such an animal so that we should have to frame new laws to cover our extended experience every wise man will admit that the possibilities of nature are infinite and include centaurs but he will not the less feel it his duty to hold fast for the present by the dictum of lucretius nam certe ex vivo centauri non fit imago and to cast the entire burthen of proof that centaurs exist on the shoulders of those who ask him to believe the statement  judged by the canons either of common sense or of science which are indeed one and the same all miracles are centaurs or they would not be miracles and men of sense and science will deal with them on the same principles no one who wishes to keep well within the limits of that which he has a right to assert will affirm that it is impossible that the sun and moon should ever have been made to appear to stand still in the valley of ajalon or that the walls of a city should have fallen down at a trumpet blast or that water was turned into wine because such events are contrary to uniform experience and violate laws of nature for aught he can prove to the contrary such events may appear in the order of nature tomorrow but common sense and common honesty alike oblige him to demand from those who would have him believe in the actual occurrence of such events evidence of a cogency proportionate to their departure from probability evidence at least as strong as that which the man who says he has seen a centaur is bound to produce unless he is content to be thought either more than credulous or less than honest  but are there any miracles on record the evidence for which fulfils the plain and simple requirements alike of elementary logic and of elementary morality  hume answers this question without the smallest hesitation and with all the authority of a historical specialist       there is not to be found in all history any miracle attested by      a sufficient number of men of such unquestioned goodness      education and learning as to secure us against all delusion in      themselves of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond      all suspicion of any design to deceive others of such credit and      reputation in the eyes of mankind as to have a great deal to lose      in case of their being detected in any falsehood and at the same      time attesting facts performed in such a public manner and in so      celebrated a part of the world as to render the detection      unavoidable all which circumstances are requisite to give us a      full assurance of the testimony of meniv p 135  these are grave assertions but they are least likely to be challenged by those who have made it their business to weigh evidence and to give their decision under a due sense of the moral responsibility which they incur in so doing  it is probable that few persons who proclaim their belief in miracles have considered what would be necessary to justify that belief in the case of a professed modern miracleworker suppose for example it is affirmed that ab died and that cd brought him to life again let it be granted that ab and cd are persons of unimpeachable honour and veracity that cd is the next heir to abs estate and therefore had a strong motive for not bringing him to life again and that all abs relations respectable persons who bore him a strong affection or had otherwise an interest in his being alive declared that they saw him die furthermore let ab be seen after his recovery by all his friends and neighbours and let his and their depositions that he is now alive be taken down before a magistrate of known integrity and acuteness would all this constitute even presumptive evidence that cd had worked a miracle unquestionably not for the most important link in the whole chain of evidence is wanting and that is the proof that ab was really dead the evidence of ordinary observers on such a point as this is absolutely worthless and even medical evidence unless the physician is a person of unusual knowledge and skill may have little more value unless careful thermometric observation proves that the temperature has sunk below a certain point unless the cadaveric stiffening of the muscles has become well established all the ordinary signs of death may be fallacious and the intervention of cd may have had no more to do with abs restoration to life than any other fortuitously coincident event  it may be said that such a coincidence would be more wonderful than the miracle itself nevertheless history acquaints us with coincidences as marvellous  on the 19th of february 1842 sir robert sale held jellalabad with a small english force and daily expecting attack from an overwhelming force of afghans had spent three months in incessantly labouring to improve the fortifications of the town akbar khan had approached within a few miles and an onslaught of his army was supposed to be imminent that morning an earthquake       nearly destroyed the town threw down the greater part of the      parapets the central gate with the adjoining bastions and a part      of the new bastion which flanked it three other bastions were also      nearly destroyed whilst several large breaches were made in the      curtains and the peshawur side eighty feet long was quite      practicable the ditch being filled and the descent easy thus in      one moment the labours of three months were in a great measure      destroyed27  if akbar khan had happened to give orders for an assault in the early morning of the 19th of february what good follower of the prophet could have doubted that allah had lent his aid as it chanced however mahometan faith in the miraculous took another turn for the energetic defenders of the post had repaired the damage by the end of the month and the enemy finding no signs of the earthquake when they invested the place ascribed the supposed immunity of jellalabad to english witchcraft   but the conditions of belief do not vary with time or place and if it is undeniable that evidence of so complete and weighty a character is needed at the present time for the establishment of the occurrence of such a wonder as that supposed it has always been needful those who study the extant records of miracles with due attention will judge for themselves how far it has ever been supplied  footnote  27 report of captain broadfoot garrison engineer quoted in kayes afghanistan     chapter viii  theism evolution of theology   hume seems to have had but two hearty dislikes the one to the english nation and the other to all the professors of dogmatic theology the one aversion he vented only privately to his friends but if he is ever bitter in his public utterances it is against priests28 in general and theological enthusiasts and fanatics in particular if he ever seems insincere it is when he wishes to insult theologians by a parade of sarcastic respect one need go no further than the peroration of the essay on miracles for a characteristic illustration       i am the better pleased with the method of reasoning here      delivered as i think it may serve to confound those dangerous      friends and disguised enemies to the christian religion who have      undertaken to defend it by the principles of human reason our      most holy religion is founded on faith not on reason and it is      a sure method of exposing it to put it to such a trial as it is by      no means fitted to endure  the christian religion not only was      at first attended with miracles but even at this day cannot be      believed by any reasonable person without one mere reason is      insufficient to convince us of its veracity and whoever is moved      by faith to assent to it is conscious of a continual miracle in      his own person which subverts all the principles of his      understanding and gives him a determination to believe what is      most contrary to custom and experienceiv pp 153 154  it is obvious that here and elsewhere hume adopting a popular confusion of ideas uses religion as the equivalent of dogmatic theology and therefore he says with perfect justice that religion is nothing but a species of philosophy iv p 171 here no doubt lies the root of his antagonism the quarrels of theologians and philosophers have not been about religion but about philosophy and philosophers not unfrequently seem to entertain the same feeling towards theologians that sportsmen cherish towards poachers there cannot be two passions more nearly resembling each other than hunting and philosophy says hume and philosophic hunters are given to think that while they pursue truth for its own sake out of pure love for the chase perhaps mingled with a little human weakness to be thought good shots and by open and legitimate methods their theological competitors too often care merely to supply the market of establishments and disdain neither the aid of the snares of superstition nor the cover of the darkness of ignorance  unless some foundation was given for this impression by the theological writers whose works had fallen in humes way it is difficult to account for the depth of feeling which so good natured a man manifests on the subject  thus he writes in the natural history of religion with quite unusual acerbity       the chief objection to it the ancient heathen mythology with      regard to this planet is that it is not ascertained by any just      reason or authority the ancient tradition insisted on by heathen      priests and theologers is but a weak foundation and transmitted      also such a number of contradictory reports supported all of them      by equal authority that it became absolutely impossible to fix a      preference among them a few volumes therefore must contain all      the polemical writings of pagan priests and their whole theology      must consist more of traditional stories and superstitious      practices than of philosophical argument and controversy       but where theism forms the fundamental principle of any popular      religion that tenet is so conformable to sound reason that      philosophy is apt to incorporate itself with such a system of      theology and if the other dogmas of that system be contained in a      sacred book such as the alcoran or be determined by any visible      authority like that of the roman pontiff speculative reasoners      naturally carry on their assent and embrace a theory which has      been instilled into them by their earliest education and which      also possesses some degree of consistence and uniformity but as      these appearances are sure all of them to prove deceitful      philosophy will very soon find herself very unequally yoked with      her new associate and instead of regulating each principle as      they advance together she is at every turn perverted to serve the      purposes of superstition for besides the unavoidable incoherences      which must be reconciled and adjusted one may safely affirm that      all popular theology especially the scholastic has a kind of      appetite for absurdity and contradiction if that theology went not      beyond reason and common sense her doctrines would appear too easy      and familiar amazement must of necessity be raised mystery      affected darkness and obscurity sought after and a foundation of      merit afforded to the devout votaries who desire an opportunity      of subduing their rebellious reason by the belief of the most      unintelligible sophisms       ecclesiastical history sufficiently confirms these reflections      when a controversy is started some people always pretend with      certainty to foretell the issue whichever opinion say they is      most contrary to plain reason is sure to prevail even when the      general interest of the system requires not that decision though      the reproach of heresy may for some time be bandied about among      the disputants it always rests at last on the side of reason any      one it is pretended that has but learning enough of this kind to      know the definition of arian pelagian erastian socinian      sabellian eutychian nestorian monothelite c not to      mention protestant whose fate is yet uncertain will be      convinced of the truth of this observation it is thus a system      becomes absurd in the end merely from its being reasonable and      philosophical in the beginning       to oppose the torrent of scholastic religion by such feeble maxims      as these that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not      to be that the whole is greater than a part that two and      three make five is pretending to stop the ocean with a bulrush      will you set up profane reason against sacred mystery no      punishment is great enough for your impiety and the same fires      which were kindled for heretics will serve also for the destruction      of philosophersiv pp 4813  holding these opinions respecting the recognised systems of theology and their professors hume nevertheless seems to have had a theology of his own that is to say he seems to have thought though as will appear it is needful for an expositor of his opinions to speak very guardedly on this point that the problem of theism is susceptible of scientific treatment with something more than a negative result his opinions are to be gathered from the eleventh section of the inquiry 1748 from the dialogues concerning natural religion which were written at least as early as 1751 though not published till after his death and from the natural history of religion published in 1757  in the first two pieces the reader is left to judge for himself which interlocutor in the dialogue represents the thoughts of the author but for the views put forward in the last hume accepts the responsibility unfortunately this essay deals almost wholly with the historical development of theological ideas and on the question of the philosophical foundation of theology does little more than express the writers contentment with the argument from design       the whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author and no      rational inquirer can after serious reflection suspend his belief      a moment with regard to the primary principles of genuine theism      and religioniv p 435       were men led into the apprehension of invisible intelligent      power by a contemplation of the works of nature they could never      possibly entertain any conception but of one single being who      bestowed existence and order on this vast machine and adjusted all      its parts according to one regular plan or connected system for      though to persons of a certain turn of mind it may not appear      altogether absurd that several independent beings endowed with      superior wisdom might conspire in the contrivance and execution of      one regular plan yet is this a merely arbitrary supposition      which even if allowed possible must be confessed neither to be      supported by probability nor necessity all things in the universe      are evidently of a piece everything is adjusted to everything one      design prevails throughout the whole and this uniformity leads the      mind to acknowledge one author because the conception of different      authors without any distinction of attributes or operations      serves only to give perplexity to the imagination without      bestowing any satisfaction on the understandingiv p 442  thus hume appears to have sincerely accepted the two fundamental conclusions of the argument from design firstly that a deity exists and secondly that he possesses attributes more or less allied to those of human intelligence but at this embryonic stage of theology humes progress is arrested and after a survey of the development of dogma his general corollary is that       the whole is a riddle an enigma an inexplicable mystery doubt      uncertainty suspense of judgment appear the only result of our      most accurate scrutiny concerning this subject but such is the      frailty of human reason and such the irresistible contagion of      opinion that even this deliberate doubt could scarcely be upheld      did we not enlarge our view and opposing one species of      superstition to another set them a quarrelling while we      ourselves during their fury and contention happily make our      escape into the calm though obscure regions of philosophyiv      p 513  thus it may be fairly presumed that hume expresses his own sentiments in the words of the speech with which philo concludes the dialogues       if the whole of natural theology as some people seem to maintain      resolves itself into one simple though somewhat ambiguous at      least undefined proposition that the cause or causes of order in      the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human      intelligence if this proposition be not capable of extension      variation or more particular explication if it affords no      inference that affects human life or can be the source of any      action or forbearance and if the analogy imperfect as it is can      be carried no further than to the human intelligence and cannot be      transferred with any appearance of probability to the other      qualities of the mind if this really be the case what can the      most inquisitive contemplative and religious man do more than      give a plain philosophical assent to the proposition as often as      it occurs and believe that the arguments on which it is      established exceed the objections which lie against it some      astonishment indeed will naturally arise from the greatness of the      object some melancholy from its obscurity some contempt of human      reason that it can give no solution more satisfactory with regard      to so extraordinary and magnificent a question but believe me      cleanthes the most natural sentiment which a welldisposed mind      will feel on this occasion is a longing desire and expectation      that heaven would be pleased to dissipate at least alleviate this      profound ignorance by affording some more particular revelation to      mankind and making discoveries of the nature attributes and      operations of the divine object of our faith29ii pp      5478  such being the sum total of humes conclusions it cannot be said that his theological burden is a heavy one but if we turn from the natural history of religion to the treatise the inquiry and the dialogues the story of what happened to the ass laden with salt who took to the water irresistibly suggests itself humes theism such as it is dissolves away in the dialectic river until nothing is left but the verbal sack in which it was contained  of the two theistic propositions to which hume is committed the first is the affirmation of the existence of a god supported by the argument from the nature of causation in the dialogues philo while pushing scepticism to its utmost limit is nevertheless made to say that         where reasonable men treat these subjects the question can      never be concerning the being but only the nature of the      deity the former truth as you will observe is unquestionable and      selfevident nothing exists without a cause and the original      cause of this universe whatever it be we call god and piously      ascribe to him every species of perfectionii p 439  the expositor of hume who wishes to do his work thoroughly as far as it goes cannot but fall into perplexity30 when he contrasts this language with that of the sections of the third part of the treatise entitled why a cause is always necessary and of the idea of necessary connexion  it is there shown at large that every demonstration which has been produced for the necessity of a cause is fallacious and sophistical i p 111 it is affirmed that there is no absolute nor metaphysical necessity that every beginning of existence should be attended with such an object as a cause i p 227 and it is roundly asserted that it is easy for us to conceive any object to be nonexistent this moment and existent the next without conjoining to it the distinct idea of a cause or productive principle i p 111 so far from the axiom that whatever begins to exist must have a cause of existence being selfevident as philo calls it hume spends the greatest care in showing that it is nothing but the product of custom or experience  and the doubt thus forced upon one whether philo ought to be taken as even so far humes mouthpiece is increased when we reflect that we are dealing with an acute reasoner and that there is no difficulty in drawing the deduction from humes own definition of a cause that the very phrase a first cause involves a contradiction in terms he lays down that       tis an established axiom both in natural and moral philosophy      that an object which exists for any time in its full perfection      without producing another is not its sole cause but is assisted      by some other principle which pushes it from its state of      inactivity and makes it exert that energy of which it was      secretly possessedi p 106  now the first cause is assumed to have existed from all eternity up to the moment at which the universe came into existence hence it cannot be the sole cause of the universe in fact it was no cause at all until it was assisted by some other principle consequently the socalled first cause so far as it produces the universe is in reality an effect of that other principle moreover though in the person of philo hume assumes the axiom that whatever begins to exist must have a cause which he denies in the treatise he must have seen for a child may see that the assumption is of no real service  suppose y to be the imagined first cause and z to be its effect let the letters of the alphabet a b c d e f g in their order represent successive moments of time and let g represent the particular moment at which the effect z makes its appearance it follows that the cause y could not have existed in its full perfection during the time ae for if it had then the effect z would have come into existence during that time which by the hypothesis it did not do the cause y therefore must have come into existence at f and if everything that comes into existence has a cause y must have had a cause x operating at e x a cause w operating at d and so on ad infinitum31  if the only demonstrative argument for the existence of a deity which hume advances thus literally goes to water in the solvent of his philosophy the reasoning from the evidence of design does not fare much better if hume really knew of any valid reply to philos arguments in the following passages of the dialogues he has dealt unfairly by the leader in concealing it       but because i know you are not much swayed by names and      authorities i shall endeavour to show you a little more      distinctly the inconveniences of that anthropomorphism which you      have embraced and shall prove that there is no ground to suppose      a plan of the world to be formed in the divine mind consisting of      distinct ideas differently arranged in the same manner as an      architect forms in his head the plan of a house which he intends to      execute       it is not easy i own to see what is gained by this supposition      whether we judge the matter by reason or by experience we are      still obliged to mount higher in order to find the cause of this      cause which you had assigned as satisfactory and conclusive       if reason i mean abstract reason derived from inquiries a      priori be not alike mute with regard to all questions concerning      cause and effect this sentence at least it will venture to      pronounce that a mental world or universe of ideas requires a      cause as much as does a material world or universe of objects      and if similar in its arrangement must require a similar cause      for what is there in this subject which should occasion a      different conclusion or inference in an abstract view they are      entirely alike and no difficulty attends the one supposition      which is not common to both of them       again when we will needs force experience to pronounce some      sentence even on those subjects which lie beyond her sphere      neither can she perceive any material difference in this      particular between these two kinds of worlds but finds them to be      governed by similar principles and to depend upon an equal variety      of causes in their operations we have specimens in miniature of      both of them our own mind resembles the one a vegetable or animal      body the other let experience therefore judge from these      samples nothing seems more delicate with regard to its causes      than thought and as these causes never operate in two persons      after the same manner so we never find two persons who think      exactly alike nor indeed does the same person think exactly alike      at any two different periods of time a difference of age of the      disposition of his body of weather of food of company of books      of passions any of these particulars or others more minute are      sufficient to alter the curious machinery of thought and      communicate to it very different movements and operations as far      as we can judge vegetables and animal bodies are not more delicate      in their motions nor depend upon a greater variety or more curious      adjustment of springs and principles       how therefore shall we satisfy ourselves concerning the cause of      that being whom you suppose the author of nature or according to      your system of anthropomorphism the ideal world in which you trace      the material have we not the same reason to trace the ideal world      into another ideal world or new intelligent principle but if we      stop and go no farther why go so far why not stop at the material      world how can we satisfy ourselves without going on in      infinitum and after all what satisfaction is there in that      infinite progression let us remember the story of the indian      philosopher and his elephant it was never more applicable than to      the present subject if the material world rests upon a similar      ideal world this ideal world must rest upon some other and so on      without end it were better therefore never to look beyond the      present material world by supposing it to contain the principle of      its order within itself we really assert it to be god and the      sooner we arrive at that divine being so much the better when you      go one step beyond the mundane system you only excite an      inquisitive humour which it is impossible ever to satisfy       to say that the different ideas which compose the reason of the      supreme being fall into order of themselves and by their own      natures is really to talk without any precise meaning if it has a      meaning i would fain know why it is not as good sense to say      that the parts of the material world fall into order of themselves      and by their own nature can the one opinion be intelligible while      the other is not soii pp 4614  cleanthes in replying to philos discourse says that it is very easy to answer his arguments but as not unfrequently happens with controversialists he mistakes a reply for an answer when he declares that       the order and arrangement of nature the curious adjustment of      final causes the plain use and intention of every part and organ      all these bespeak in the clearest language one intelligent cause or      author the heavens and the earth join in the same testimony the      whole chorus of nature raises one hymn to the praises of its      creatorii p 465  though the rhetoric of cleanthes may be admired its irrelevancy to the point at issue must be admitted wandering still further into the region of declamation he works himself into a passion       you alone or almost alone disturb this general harmony you      start abstruse doubts cavils and objections you ask me what is      the cause of this cause i know not i care not that concerns not      me i have found a deity and here i stop my inquiry let those go      further who are wiser or more enterprisingii p 466  in other words o cleanthes reasoning having taken you as far as you want to go you decline to advance any further even though you fully admit that the very same reasoning forbids you to stop where you are pleased to cry halt but this is simply forcing your reason to abdicate in favour of your caprice it is impossible to imagine that hume of all men in the world could have rested satisfied with such an act of hightreason against the sovereignty of philosophy we may rather conclude that the last word of the discussion which he gives to philo is also his own       if i am still to remain in utter ignorance of causes and can      absolutely give an explication of nothing i shall never esteem it      any advantage to shove off for a moment a difficulty which you      acknowledge must immediately in its full force recur upon me      naturalists32 indeed very justly explain particular effects by      more general causes though these general causes should remain in      the end totally inexplicable but they never surely thought it      satisfactory to explain a particular effect by a particular cause      which was no more to be accounted for than the effect itself an      ideal system arranged of itself without a precedent design is      not a whit more explicable than a material one which attains its      order in a like manner nor is there any more difficulty in the      latter supposition than in the formerii p 466  it is obvious that if hume had been pushed he must have admitted that his opinion concerning the existence of a god and of a certain remote resemblance of his intellectual nature to that of man was an hypothesis which might possess more or less probability but was incapable on his own principles of any approach to demonstration and to all attempts to make any practical use of his theism or to prove the existence of the attributes of infinite wisdom benevolence justice and the like which are usually ascribed to the deity by reason he opposes a searching critical negation33  the object of the speech of the imaginary epicurean in the eleventh section of the inquiry entitled of a particular providence and of a future state is to invert the argument of bishop butlers analogy  that famous defence of theology against the a priori scepticism of freethinkers of the eighteenth century who based their arguments on the inconsistency of the revealed scheme of salvation with the attributes of the deity consists essentially in conclusively proving that from a moral point of view nature is at least as reprehensible as orthodoxy if you tell me says butler in effect that any part of revealed religion must be false because it is inconsistent with the divine attributes of justice and mercy i beg leave to point out to you that there are undeniable natural facts which are fully open to the same objection since you admit that nature is the work of god you are forced to allow that such facts are consistent with his attributes therefore you must also admit that the parallel facts in the scheme of orthodoxy are also consistent with them and all your arguments to the contrary fall to the ground qed in fact the solid sense of butler left the deism of the freethinkers not a leg to stand upon perhaps however he did not remember the wise saying that a man seemeth right in his own cause but another cometh after and judgeth him humes epicurean philosopher adopts the main arguments of the analogy but unfortunately drives them home to a conclusion of which the good bishop would hardly have approved       i deny a providence you say and supreme governor of the world      who guides the course of events and punishes the vicious with      infamy and disappointment and rewards the virtuous with honour and      success in all their undertakings but surely i deny not the course      itself of events which lies open to every ones inquiry and      examination i acknowledge that in the present order of things      virtue is attended with more peace of mind than vice and meets      with a more favourable reception from the world i am sensible      that according to the past experience of mankind friendship is      the chief joy of human life and moderation the only source of      tranquillity and happiness i never balance between the virtuous      and the vicious course of life but am sensible that to a      welldisposed mind every advantage is on the side of the former      and what can you say more allowing all your suppositions and      reasonings you tell me indeed that this disposition of things      proceeds from intelligence and design but whatever it proceeds      from the disposition itself on which depends our happiness and      misery and consequently our conduct and deportment in life is      still the same it is still open for me as well as you to      regulate my behaviour by my experience of past events and if you      affirm that while a divine providence is allowed and a supreme      distributive justice in the universe i ought to expect some more      particular reward of the good and punishment of the bad beyond      the ordinary course of events i here find the same fallacy which i      have before endeavoured to detect you persist in imagining that      if we grant that divine existence for which you so earnestly      contend you may safely infer consequences from it and add      something to the experienced order of nature by arguing from the      attributes which you ascribe to your gods you seem not to remember      that all your reasonings on this subject can only be drawn from      effects to causes and that every argument deduced from causes to      effects must of necessity be a gross sophism since it is      impossible for you to know anything of the cause but what you have      antecedently not inferred but discovered to the full in the      effect       but what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners who      instead of regarding the present scene of things as the sole object      of their contemplation so far reverse the whole course of nature      as to render this life merely a passage to something further a      porch which leads to a greater and vastly different building a      prologue which serves only to introduce the piece and give it more      grace and propriety whence do you think can such philosophers      derive their idea of the gods from their own conceit and      imagination surely for if they derive it from the present      phenomena it would never point to anything further but must be      exactly adjusted to them that the divinity may possibly be      endowed with attributes which we have never seen exerted may be      governed by principles of action which we cannot discover to be      satisfied all this will freely be allowed but still this is mere      possibility and hypothesis we never can have reason to infer      any attributes or any principles of action in him but so far as we      know them to have been exerted and satisfied       are there any marks of a distributive justice in the world if      you answer in the affirmative i conclude that since justice here      exerts itself it is satisfied if you reply in the negative i      conclude that you have then no reason to ascribe justice in our      sense of it to the gods if you hold a medium between affirmation      and negation by saying that the justice of the gods at present      exerts itself in part but not in its full extent i answer that      you have no reason to give it any particular extent but only so      far as you see it at present exert itselfiv pp 1646  thus the freethinkers said the attributes of the deity being what they are the scheme of orthodoxy is inconsistent with them whereupon butler gave the crushing reply agreeing with you as to the attributes of the deity nature by its existence proves that the things to which you object are quite consistent with them to whom enters humes epicurean with the remark then as nature is our only measure of the attributes of the deity in their practical manifestation what warranty is there for supposing that such measure is anywhere transcended that the other side of nature if there be one is governed on different principles from this side  truly on this topic silence is golden while speech reaches not even the dignity of sounding brass or tinkling cymbal and is but the weary clatter of an endless logomachy one can but suspect that hume also had reached this conviction and that his shadowy and inconsistent theism was the expression of his desire to rest in a state of mind which distinctly excluded negation while it included as little as possible of affirmation respecting a problem which he felt to be hopelessly insoluble  but whatever might be the views of the philosopher as to the arguments for theism the historian could have no doubt respecting its manyshaped existence and the great part which it has played in the world here then was a body of natural facts to be investigated scientifically and the result of humes inquiries is embodied in the remarkable essay on the natural history of religion hume anticipated the results of modern investigation in declaring fetishism and polytheism to be the form in which savage and ignorant men naturally clothe their ideas of the unknown influences which govern their destiny and they are polytheists rather than monotheists because         the first ideas of religion arose not from a contemplation      of the works of nature but from a concern with regard to the      events of life and from the incessant hopes and fears which      actuate the human mind  in order to carry mens attention beyond      the present course of things or lead them into any inference      concerning invisible intelligent power they must be actuated by      some passion which prompts their thought and reflection some      motive which urges their first inquiry but what passion shall we      have recourse to for explaining an effect of such mighty      consequence not speculative curiosity merely or the pure love of      truth that motive is too refined for such gross apprehensions      and would lead men into inquiries concerning the frame of nature a      subject too large and comprehensive for their narrow capacities no      passions therefore can be supposed to work on such barbarians      but the ordinary affections of human life the anxious concern for      happiness the dread of future misery the terror of death the      thirst of revenge the appetite for food and other necessaries      agitated by hopes and fears of this nature especially the latter      men scrutinize with a trembling curiosity the course of future      causes and examine the various and contrary events of human life      and in this disordered scene with eyes still more disordered and      astonished they see the first obscure traces of divinityiv      pp 443 4  the shape assumed by these first traces of divinity is that of the shadows of mens own minds projected out of themselves by their imaginations       there is an universal tendency among mankind to conceive all      beings like themselves and to transfer to every object those      qualities with which they are familiarly acquainted and of which      they are intimately conscious the unknown causes which      continually employ their thought appearing always in the same      aspect are all apprehended to be of the same kind or species nor      is it long before we ascribe to them thought and reason and      passion and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men in order      to bring them nearer to a resemblance with ourselvesiv pp      4467  hume asks whether polytheism really deserves the name of theism       our ancestors in europe before the revival of letters believed      as we do at present that there was one supreme god the author of      nature whose power though in itself uncontrollable was yet often      exerted by the interposition of his angels and subordinate      ministers who executed his sacred purposes but they also      believed that all nature was full of other invisible powers      fairies goblins elves sprights beings stronger and mightier      than men but much inferior to the celestial natures who surround      the throne of god now suppose that any one in these ages had      denied the existence of god and of his angels would not his      impiety justly have deserved the appellation of atheism even      though he had still allowed by some odd capricious reasoning that      the popular stories of elves and fairies were just and well      grounded the difference on the one hand between such a person      and a genuine theist is infinitely greater than that on the      other between him and one that absolutely excludes all invisible      intelligent power and it is a fallacy merely from the casual      resemblance of names without any conformity of meaning to rank      such opposite opinions under the same denomination       to any one who considers justly of the matter it will appear that      the gods of the polytheists are no better than the elves and      fairies of our ancestors and merit as little as any pious worship      and veneration these pretended religionists are really a kind of      superstitious atheists and acknowledge no being that corresponds      to our idea of a deity no first principle of mind or thought no      supreme government and administration no divine contrivance or      intention in the fabric of the worldiv pp 45051  the doctrine that you may call an atheist anybody whose ideas about the deity do not correspond with your own is so largely acted upon by persons who are certainly not of humes way of thinking and probably so far from having read him would shudder to open any book bearing his name except the history of england that it is surprising to trace the theory of their practice to such a source  but on thinking the matter over this theory seems so consonant with reason that one feels ashamed of having suspected many excellent persons of being moved by mere malice and viciousness of temper to call other folks atheists when after all they have been obeying a purely intellectual sense of fitness as hume says truly enough it is a mere fallacy because two people use the same names for things the ideas of which are mutually exclusive to rank such opposite opinions under the same denomination if the jew says that the deity is absolute unity and that it is sheer blasphemy to say that he ever became incarnate in the person of a man and if the trinitarian says that the deity is numerically three as well as numerically one and that it is sheer blasphemy to say that he did not so become incarnate it is obvious enough that each must be logically held to deny the existence of the others deity therefore that each has a scientific right to call the other an atheist and that if he refrains it is only on the ground of decency and good manners which should restrain an honourable man from employing even scientifically justifiable language if custom has given it an abusive connotation while one must agree with hume then it is nevertheless to be wished that he had not set the bad example of calling polytheists superstitious atheists it probably did not occur to him that by a parity of reasoning the unitarians might justify the application of the same language to the ultramontanes and vice versâ but to return from a digression which may not be wholly unprofitable hume proceeds to show in what manner polytheism incorporated physical and moral allegories and naturally accepted heroworship and he sums up his views of the first stages of the evolution of theology as follows       these then are the general principles of polytheism founded in      human nature and little or nothing dependent on caprice or      accident as the causes which bestow happiness or misery are in      general very little known and very uncertain our anxious concern      endeavours to attain a determinate idea of them and finds no      better expedient than to represent them as intelligent voluntary      agents like ourselves only somewhat superior in power and wisdom      the limited influence of these agents and their proximity to human      weakness introduce the various distribution and division of their      authority and thereby give rise to allegory the same principles      naturally deify mortals superior in power courage or      understanding and produce heroworship together with fabulous      history and mythological tradition in all its wild and      unaccountable forms and as an invisible spiritual intelligence is      an object too refined for vulgar apprehension men naturally affix      it to some sensible representation such as either the more      conspicuous parts of nature or the statues images and pictures      which a more refined age forms of its divinitiesiv p 461  how did the further stage of theology monotheism arise out of polytheism hume replies certainly not by reasonings from first causes or any sort of finedrawn logic       even at this day and in europe ask any of the vulgar why he      believes in an omnipotent creator of the world he will never      mention the beauty of final causes of which he is wholly ignorant      he will not hold out his hand and bid you contemplate the      suppleness and variety of joints in his fingers their bending all      one way the counterpoise which they receive from the thumb the      softness and fleshy parts of the inside of the hand with all the      other circumstances which render that member fit for the use to      which it was destined to these he has been long accustomed and he      beholds them with listlessness and unconcern he will tell you of      the sudden and unexpected death of suchaone the fall and bruise      of such another the excessive drought of this season the cold and      rains of another these he ascribes to the immediate operation of      providence and such events as with good reasoners are the chief      difficulties in admitting a supreme intelligence are with him the      sole arguments for it       we may conclude therefore upon the whole that since the vulgar      in nations which have embraced the doctrine of theism still build      it upon irrational and superstitious grounds they are never led      into that opinion by any process of argument but by a certain      train of thinking more suitable to their genius and capacity       it may readily happen in an idolatrous nation that though men      admit the existence of several limited deities yet there is some      one god whom in a particular manner they make the object of      their worship and adoration they may either suppose that in the      distribution of power and territory among the gods their nation      was subjected to the jurisdiction of that particular deity or      reducing heavenly objects to the model of things below they may      represent one god as the prince or supreme magistrate of the rest      who though of the same nature rules them with an authority like      that which an earthly sovereign exerts over his subjects and      vassals whether this god therefore be considered as their      peculiar patron or as the general sovereign of heaven his      votaries will endeavour by every art to insinuate themselves into      his favour and supposing him to be pleased like themselves with      praise and flattery there is no eulogy or exaggeration which will      be spared in their addresses to him in proportion as mens fears      or distresses become more urgent they still invent new strains of      adulation and even he who outdoes his predecessor in swelling the      titles of his divinity is sure to be outdone by his successor in      newer and more pompous epithets of praise thus they proceed till      at last they arrive at infinity itself beyond which there is no      further progress and it is well if in striving to get further      and to represent a magnificent simplicity they run not into      inexplicable mystery and destroy the intelligent nature of their      deity on which alone any rational worship or adoration can be      founded while they confine themselves to the notion of a perfect      being the creator of the world they coincide by chance with the      principles of reason and true philosophy though they are guided to      that notion not by reason of which they are in a great measure      incapable but by the adulation and fears of the most vulgar      superstitioniv pp 4636       nay if we should suppose what never happens that a popular      religion were found in which it was expressly declared that      nothing but morality could gain the divine favour if an order of      priests were instituted to inculcate this opinion in daily      sermons and with all the arts of persuasion yet so inveterate are      the peoples prejudices that for want of some other superstition      they would make the very attendance on these sermons the essentials      of religion rather than place them in virtue and good morals the      sublime prologue of zaleucus laws inspired not the locrians so      far as we can learn with any sounder notions of the measures of      acceptance with the deity than were familiar to the other      greeksiv p 505  it has been remarked that humes writings are singularly devoid of local colour of allusions to the scenes with which he was familiar and to the people from whom he sprang yet surely the lowlands of scotland were more in his thoughts than the zephyrean promontory and the hard visage of john knox peered from behind the mask of zaleucus when this passage left his pen nay might not an acute german critic discern therein a reminiscence of that eminently scottish institution a holy fair where as humes young contemporary sings         opens out his cauld harangues        on practice and on morals      an aff the godly pour in thrangs        to gie the jars and barrels                    a lift that day       what signifies

what he means by this term by priests i understand only the pretenders to power and dominion and to a superior sanctity of character distinct from virtue and good morals these are very different from clergymen who are set apart to the care of sacred matters and the conducting our public devotions with greater decency and order there is no rank of men more to be respected than the latteriii p 83  29 it is needless to quote the rest of the passage though i cannot refrain from observing that the recommendation which it contains that a man of letters should become a philosophical sceptic as the first and most essential step towards being a sound believing christian though adopted and largely acted upon by many a champion of orthodoxy in these days is questionable in taste if it be meant as a jest and more than questionable in morality if it is to be taken in earnest to pretend that you believe any doctrine for no better reason than that you doubt everything else would be dishonest if it were not preposterous  30 a perplexity which is increased rather than diminished by some passages in a letter to gilbert elliot of minto march 10 1751 hume says you would perceive by the sample i have given you that i make cleanthes the hero of the dialogue whatever you can think of to strengthen that side of the argument will be most acceptable to me any propensity you imagine i have to the other side crept in upon me against my will and tis not long ago that i burned an old manuscript book wrote before i was twenty which contained page after page the gradual progress of my thoughts on this head it began with an anxious scent after arguments to confirm the common opinion doubts stole in dissipated returned were again dissipated returned again and it was a perpetual struggle of a restless imagination against inclinationperhaps against reason i could wish cleanthes argument could be so analysed as to be rendered quite formal and regular the propensity of the mind towards itunless that propensity were as strong and universal as that to believe in our senses and experiencewill still i am afraid be esteemed a suspicious foundation tis here i wish for your assistance we must endeavour to prove that this propensity is somewhat different from our inclination to find our own figures in the clouds our faces in the moon our passions and sentiments even in inanimate matter such an inclination may and ought to be controlled and can never be a legitimate ground of assent burton life i pp 3313 the picture of hume here drawn unconsciously by his own hand is unlike enough to the popular conception of him as a careless sceptic loving doubt for doubts sake  31 kant employs substantially the same argumentwürde das höchste wesen in dieser kette der bedingungen stehen so würde es selbst ein glied der reihe derselben sein und eben so wie die niederen glieder denen es vorgesetzt ist noch fernere untersuchungen wegen seines noch höheren grundes erfahrenkritik ed hartenstein p 422  32 ie natural philosophers  33 humes letter to mure of caldwell containing a criticism of leechmans sermon burton i p 163 bears strongly on this point  34 burns published the holy fair only ten years after humes death     chapter ix  the soul the doctrine of immortality   descartes taught that an absolute difference of kind separates matter as that which possesses extension from spirit as that which thinks they not only have no character in common but it is inconceivable that they should have any on the assumption that the attributes of the two were wholly different it appeared to be a necessary consequence that the hypothetical causes of these attributestheir respective substancesmust be totally different notably in the matter of divisibility since that which has no extension cannot be divisible it seemed that the chose pensante the soul must be an indivisible entity  later philosophers accepting this notion of the soul were naturally much perplexed to understand how if matter and spirit had nothing in common they could act and react on one another all the changes of matter being modes of motion the difficulty of understanding how a moving extended material body was to affect a thinking thing which had no dimension was as great as that involved in solving the problem of how to hit a nominative case with a stick hence the successors of descartes either found themselves obliged with the occasionalists to call in the aid of the deity who was supposed to be a sort of gobetween betwixt matter and spirit or they had recourse with leibnitz to the doctrine of preestablished harmony which denied any influence of the body on the soul or vice versâ and compared matter and spirit to two clocks so accurately regulated to keep time with one another that the one struck when ever the other pointed to the hour or with berkeley they abolished the substance of matter altogether as a superfluity though they failed to see that the same arguments equally justified the abolition of soul as another superfluity and the reduction of the universe to a series of events or phenomena or finally with spinoza to whom berkeley makes a perilously close approach they asserted the existence of only one substance with two chief attributes the one thought and the other extension  there remained only one possible position which had it been taken up earlier might have saved an immensity of trouble and that was to affirm that we do not and cannot know anything about the substance either of the thinking thing or of the extended thing and humes sound common sense led him to defend this thesis which locke had already foreshadowed with respect to the question of the substance of the soul hume enunciates two opinions the first is that the question itself is unintelligible and therefore cannot receive any answer the second is that the popular doctrine respecting the immateriality simplicity and indivisibility of a thinking substance is a true atheism and will serve to justify all those sentiments for which spinoza is so universally infamous  in support of the first opinion hume points out that it is impossible to attach any definite meaning to the word substance when employed for the hypothetical substratum of soul and matter for if we define substance as that which may exist by itself the definition does not distinguish the soul from perceptions it is perfectly easy to conceive that states of consciousness are selfsubsistent and if the substance of the soul is defined as that in which perceptions inhere what is meant by the inherence is such inherence conceivable if conceivable what evidence is there of it and what is the use of a substratum to things which for anything we know to the contrary are capable of existing by themselves  moreover it may be added supposing the soul has a substance how do we know that it is different from the substance which on like grounds must be supposed to underlie the qualities of matter  again if it be said that our personal identity requires the assumption of a substance which remains the same while the accidents of perception shift and change the question arises what is meant by personal identity       for my part says hume when i enter most intimately into what i      call myself i always stumble on some particular perception or      other of heat or cold light or shade love or hatred pain or      pleasure i never can catch myself at any time without a      perception and never can observe anything but the perception when      my perceptions are removed for any time as by sound sleep so long      am i insensible of myself and may be truly said not to exist      and were all my perceptions removed by death and i could neither      think nor feel nor see nor love nor hate after the dissolution      of my body i should be entirely annihilated nor do i conceive      what is further requisite to make me a perfect nonentity if any      one upon serious and unprejudiced reflection thinks he has a      different notion of himself i must confess i can reason no      longer with him all i can allow him is that he may be in the      right as well as i and that we are essentially different in this      particular he may perhaps perceive something simple and continued      which he calls himself though i am certain there is no such      principle in me       but setting aside some metaphysicians of this kind i may venture      to affirm of the rest of mankind that they are nothing but a      bundle or collection of different perceptions which succeed one      another with an inconceivable rapidity and are in a perpetual flux      and movement the mind is a kind of theatre where several      perceptions successively make their appearance pass repass glide      away and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations      there is properly no simplicity in it at one time nor identity      in different whatever natural propension we may have to imagine      that simplicity and identity the comparison of the theatre must      not mislead us they are the successive perceptions only that      constitute the mind nor have we the most distant notion of the      place where these scenes are represented or of the materials of      which it is composed       what then gives so great a propension to ascribe an identity to      these successive perceptions and to suppose ourselves possessed of      an invariable and uninterrupted existence through the whole course      of our lives in order to answer this question we must distinguish      between personal identity as it regards our thought and      imagination and as it regards our passions or the concern we take      in ourselves the first is our present subject and to explain it      perfectly we must take the matter pretty deep and account for that      identity which we attribute to plants and animals there being a      great analogy betwixt it and the identity of a self or      personi pp 321 322  perfect identity is exhibited by an object which remains unchanged throughout a certain time perfect diversity is seen in two or more objects which are separated by intervals of space and periods of time but in both these cases there is no sharp line of demarcation between identity and diversity and it is impossible to say when an object ceases to be one and becomes two  when a seaanemone multiplies by division there is a time during which it is said to be one animal partially divided but after a while it becomes two animals adherent together and the limit between these conditions is purely arbitrary so in mineralogy a crystal of a definite chemical composition may have its substance replaced particle by particle by another chemical compound when does it lose its primitive identity and become a new thing  again a plant or an animal in the course of its existence from the condition of an egg or seed to the end of life remains the same neither in form nor in structure nor in the matter of which it is composed every attribute it possesses is constantly changing and yet we say that it is always one and the same individual and if in this case we attribute identity without supposing an indivisible immaterial something to underlie and condition that identity why should we need the supposition in the case of that succession of changeful phenomena we call the mind  in fact we ascribe identity to an individual plant or animal simply because there has been no moment of time at which we could observe any division of it into parts separated by time or space every experience we have of it is as one thing and not as two and we sum up our experiences in the ascription of identity although we know quite well that strictly speaking it has not been the same for any two moments  so with the mind our perceptions flow in even succession the impressions of the present moment are inextricably mixed up with the memories of yesterday and the expectations of tomorrow and all are connected by the links of cause and effect         as the same individual republic may not only change its      members but also its laws and constitutions in like manner the      same person may vary his character and disposition as well as his      impressions and ideas without losing his identity whatever      changes he endures his several parts are still connected by the      relation of causation and in this view our identity with regard to      the passions serves to corroborate that with regard to the      imagination by the making our distant perceptions influence each      other and by giving us a present concern for our past or future      pains or pleasures       as memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of      this succession of perceptions tis to be considered upon that      account chiefly as the source of personal identity had we no      memory we never should have any notion of causation nor      consequently of that chain of causes and effects which constitute      our self or person but having once acquired this notion of      causation from the memory we can extend the same chain of causes      and consequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory      and can comprehend times and circumstances and actions which we      have entirely forgot but suppose in general to have existed for      how few of our past actions are there of which we have any memory      who can tell me for instance what were his thoughts and actions      on the first of january 1715 the eleventh of march 1719 and the      third of august 1733 or will he affirm because he has entirely      forgot the incidents of those days that the present self is not      the same person with the self of that time and by that means      overturn all the most established notions of personal identity in      this view therefore memory does not so much produce as      discover personal identity by showing us the relation of cause      and effect among our different perceptions twill be incumbent on      those who affirm that memory produces entirely our personal      identity to give a reason why we can thus extend our identity      beyond our memory       the whole of this doctrine leads us to a conclusion which is of      great importance in the present affair viz that all the nice and      subtle questions concerning personal identity can never possibly be      decided and are to be regarded rather as grammatical than as      philosophical difficulties identity depends on the relations of      ideas and these relations produce identity by means of that easy      transition they occasion but as the relations and the easiness of      the transition may diminish by insensible degrees we have no just      standard by which we can decide any dispute concerning the time      when they acquire or lose a title to the name of identity all the      disputes concerning the identity of connected objects are merely      verbal except so far as the relation of parts gives rise to some      fiction or imaginary principle of union as we have already      observed       what i have said concerning the first origin and uncertainty of      our notion of identity as applied to the human mind may be      extended with little or no variation to that of simplicity an      object whose different coexistent parts are bound together by a      close relation operates upon the imagination after much the same      manner as one perfectly simple and undivisible and requires not a      much greater stretch of thought in order to its conception from      this similarity of operation we attribute a simplicity to it and      feign a principle of union as the support of this simplicity and      the centre of all the different parts and qualities of the      objecti pp 3313  the final result of humes reasoning comes to this as we use the name of body for the sum of the phenomena which make up our corporeal existence so we employ the name of soul for the sum of the phenomena which constitute our mental existence and we have no more reason in the latter case than in the former to suppose that there is anything beyond the phenomena which answers to the name in the case of the soul as in that of the body the idea of substance is a mere fiction of the imagination this conclusion is nothing but a rigorous application of berkeleys reasoning concerning matter to mind and it is fully adopted by kant35  having arrived at the conclusion that the conception of a soul as a substantive thing is a mere figment of the imagination and that whether it exists or not we can by no possibility know anything about it the inquiry as to the durability of the soul may seem superfluous  nevertheless there is still a sense in which even under these conditions such an inquiry is justifiable leaving aside the problem of the substance of the soul and taking the word soul simply as a name for the series of mental phenomena which make up an individual mind it remains open to us to ask whether that series commenced with or before the series of phenomena which constitute the corresponding individual body and whether it terminates with the end of the corporeal series or goes on after the existence of the body has ended and in both cases there arises the further question whether the excess of duration of the mental series over that of the body is finite or infinite  hume has discussed some of these questions in the remarkable essay on the immortality of the soul which was not published till after his death and which seems long to have remained but little known nevertheless indeed possibly for that reason its influence has been manifested in unexpected quarters and its main arguments have been adduced by archiepiscopal and episcopal authority in evidence of the value of revelation dr whately36 sometime archbishop of dublin paraphrases hume though he forgets to cite him and bishop courtenays elaborate work37 dedicated to the archbishop is a development of that prelates version of humes essay  this little paper occupies only some ten pages but it is not wonderful that it attracted an acute logician like whately for it is a model of clear and vigorous statement the argument hardly admits of condensation so that i must let hume speak for himself       by the mere light of reason it seems difficult to prove the      immortality of the soul the arguments for it are commonly derived      either from metaphysical topics or moral or physical but in      reality it is the gospel and the gospel alone that has brought      life and immortality to light38       1 metaphysical topics suppose that the soul is immaterial and      that tis impossible for thought to belong to a material      substance39 but just metaphysics teach us that the notion of      substance is wholly confused and imperfect and that we have no      other idea of any substance than as an aggregate of particular      qualities inhering in an unknown something matter therefore and      spirit are at bottom equally unknown and we cannot determine what      qualities inhere in the one or in the other40 they likewise      teach us that nothing can be decided a priori concerning any      cause or effect and that experience being the only source of our      judgments of this nature we cannot know from any other principle      whether matter by its structure or arrangement may not be the      cause of thought abstract reasonings cannot decide any question of      fact or existence but admitting a spiritual substance to be      dispersed throughout the universe like the ethereal fire of the      stoics and to be the only inherent subject of thought we have      reason to conclude from analogy that nature uses it after the      manner she does the other substance matter she employs it as a      kind of paste or clay modifies it into a variety of forms or      existences dissolves after a time each modification and from its      substance erects a new form as the same material substance may      successively compose the bodies of all animals the same spiritual      substance may compose their minds their consciousness or that      system of thought which they formed during life may be continually      dissolved by death and nothing interests them in the new      modification the most positive assertors of the mortality of the      soul never denied the immortality of its substance and that an      immaterial substance as well as a material may lose its memory      or consciousness appears in part from experience if the soul be      immaterial seasoning from the common course of nature and without      supposing any new interposition of the supreme cause which ought      always to be excluded from philosophy what is incorruptible must      also be ingenerable the soul therefore if immortal existed      before our birth and if the former existence noways concerned us      neither will the latter animals undoubtedly feel think love      hate will and even reason though in a more imperfect manner than      men are their souls also immaterial and immortal41  hume next proceeds to consider the moral arguments and chiefly         those derived from the justice of god which is supposed to      be further interested in the future punishment of the vicious and      reward of the virtuous  but if by the justice of god we moan the same attribute which we call justice in ourselves then why should either reward or punishment be extended beyond this life42 our sole means of knowing anything is the reasoning faculty which god has given us and that reasoning faculty not only denies us any conception of a future state but fails to furnish a single valid argument in favour of the belief that the mind will endure after the dissolution of the body         if any purpose of nature be clear we may affirm that the      whole scope and intention of mans creation so far as we can judge      by natural reason is limited to the present life  to the argument that the powers of man are so much greater than the needs of this life require that they suggest a future scene in which they can be employed hume replies       if the reason of man gives him great superiority above other      animals his necessities are proportionably multiplied upon him      his whole time his whole capacity activity courage and passion      find sufficient employment in fencing against the miseries of his      present condition and frequently nay almost always are too      slender for the business assigned them a pair of shoes perhaps      was never yet wrought to the highest degree of perfection that      commodity is capable of attaining yet it is necessary at least      very useful that there should be some politicians and moralists      even some geometers poets and philosophers among mankind the      powers of men are no more superior to their wants considered      merely in this life than those of foxes and hares are compared to      their wants and to their period of existence the inference from      parity of reason is therefore obvious  in short hume argues that if the faculties with which we are endowed are unable to discover a future state and if the most attentive consideration of their nature serves to show that they are adapted to this life and nothing more it is surely inconsistent with any conception of justice that we should be dealt with as if we had all along had a clear knowledge of the fact thus carefully concealed from us what should we think of the justice of a father who gave his son every reason to suppose that a trivial fault would only be visited by a box on the ear and then years afterwards put him on the rack for a week for the same fault  again the suggestion arises if god is the cause of all things he is responsible for evil as well as for good and it appears utterly irreconcilable with our notions of justice that he should punish another for that which he has in fact done himself moreover just punishment bears a proportion to the offence while suffering which is infinite is ipso facto disproportionate to any finite deed       why then eternal punishment for the temporary offences of so frail      a creature as man can any one approve of alexanders rage who      intended to exterminate a whole nation because they had seized his      favourite horse bucephalus       heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men the good and      the bad but the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and      virtue were one to go round the world with the intention of giving      a good supper to the righteous and a sound drubbing to the wicked      he would frequently be embarrassed in his choice and would find      the merits and demerits of most men and women scarcely amount to      the value of either43  one can but admire the broad humanity and the insight into the springs of action manifest in this passage comprendre est à moitié pardonner the more one knows of the real conditions which determine mens acts the less one finds either to praise or blame for kindly david hume the damnation of one man is an infinitely greater evil in the universe than the subversion of a thousand million of kingdoms and he would have felt with his countryman burns that even auld nickie ben should hae a chance  as against those who reason for the necessity of a future state in order that the justice of the deity may be satisfied humes argumentation appears unanswerable for if the justice of god resembles what we mean by justice the bestowal of infinite happiness for finite welldoing and infinite misery for finite illdoing it is in no sense just and if the justice of god does not resemble what we mean by justice it is an abuse of language to employ the name of justice for the attribute described by it but as against those who choose to argue that there is nothing in what is known to us of the attributes of the deity inconsistent with a future state of rewards and punishments humes pleadings have no force bishop butlers argument that inasmuch as the visitation of our acts by rewards and punishments takes place in this life rewards and punishments must be consistent with the attributes of the deity and therefore may go on as long as the mind endures is unanswerable whatever exists is by the hypothesis existent by the will of god and therefore the pains and pleasures which exist now may go on existing for all eternity either increasing diminishing or being endlessly varied in their intensity as they are now  it is remarkable that hume does not refer to the sentimental arguments for the immortality of the soul which are so much in vogue at the present day and which are based upon our desire for a longer conscious existence than that which nature appears to have allotted to us perhaps he did not think them worth notice for indeed it is not a little strange that our strong desire that a certain occurrence should happen should be put forward as evidence that it will happen if my intense desire to see the friend from whom i have parted does not bring him from the other side of the world or take me thither if the mothers agonised prayer that her child should live has not prevented him from dying experience certainly affords no presumption that the strong desire to be alive after death which we call the aspiration after immortality is any more likely to be gratified as hume truly says all doctrines are to be suspected which are favoured by our passions and the doctrine that we are immortal because we should extremely like to be so contains the quintessence of suspiciousness  in respect of the existence and attributes of the soul as of those of the deity then logic is powerless and reason silent at the most we can get no further than the conclusion of kant       after we have satisfied ourselves of the vanity of all the      ambitious attempts of reason to fly beyond the bounds of      experience enough remains of practical value to content us it is      true that no one may boast that he knows that god and a future      life exist for if he possesses such knowledge he is just the      man for whom i have long been seeking all knowledge touching an      object of mere reason can be communicated and therefore i might      hope to see my own knowledge increased to this prodigious extent      by his instruction no our conviction in these matters is not      logical but moral certainty and inasmuch as it rests upon      subjective grounds of moral disposition i must not even say it      is morally certain that there is a god and so on but i am      morally certain and so on that is to say the belief in a god and      in another world is so interwoven with my moral nature that the      former can no more vanish than the latter can ever be torn from      me       the only point to be remarked here is that this act of faith of      the intellect vernunftglaube assumes the existence of moral      dispositions if we leave them aside and suppose a mind quite      indifferent to moral laws the inquiry started by reason becomes      merely a subject for speculation and the conclusion attained may      then indeed be supported by strong arguments from analogy but not      by such as are competent to overcome persistent scepticism       there is no one however who can fail to be interested in these      questions for although he may be excluded from moral influences      by the want of a good disposition yet even in this case enough      remains to lead him to fear a divine existence and a future state      to this end no more is necessary than that he can at least have no      certainty that there is no such being and no future life for to      make this conclusion demonstratively certain he must be able to      prove the impossibility of both and this assuredly no rational man      can undertake to do this negative belief indeed cannot produce      either morality or good dispositions but can operate in an      analogous fashion by powerfully repressing the outbreak of evil      tendencies       but it will be said is this all that pure reason can do when it      gazes out beyond the bounds of experience nothing more than two      articles of faith common sense could achieve as much without      calling the philosophers to its counsels       i will not here speak of the service which philosophy has rendered      to human reason by the laborious efforts of its criticism granting      that the outcome proves to be merely negative about that matter      something is to be said in the following section but do you then      ask that the knowledge which interests all men shall transcend the      common understanding and be discovered for you only by      philosophers the very thing which you make a reproach is the best      confirmation of the justice of the previous conclusions since it      shows that which could not at first have been anticipated      namely that in those matters which concern all men alike nature      is not guilty of distributing her gifts with partiality and that      the highest philosophy in dealing with the most important concerns      of humanity is able to take us no further than the guidance which      she affords to the commonest understanding44  in short nothing can be proved or disproved respecting either the distinct existence the substance or the durability of the soul so far kant is at one with hume but kant adds as you cannot disprove the immortality of the soul and as the belief therein is very useful for moral purposes you may assume it to which had hume lived half a century later he would probably have replied that if morality has no better foundation than an assumption it is not likely to bear much strain and if it has a better foundation the assumption rather weakens than strengthens it  as has been already said hume is not content with denying that we know anything about the existence or the nature of the soul but he carries the war into the enemys camp and accuses those who affirm the immateriality simplicity and indivisibility of the thinking substance of atheism and spinozism which are assumed to be convertible terms  the method of attack is ingenious observation appears to acquaint us with two different systems of beings and both spinoza and orthodox philosophers agree that the necessary substratum of each of these is a substance in which the phenomena adhere or of which they are attributes or modes       i observe first the universe of objects or of body the sun moon      and stars the earth seas plants animals men ships houses      and other productions either of art or of nature here spinoza      appears and tells me that these are only modifications and that      the subject in which they inhere is simple uncompounded and      indivisible after this i consider the other system of beings viz      the universe of thought or my impressions and ideas then i      observe another sun moon and stars an earth and seas covered      and inhabited by plants and animals towns houses mountains      rivers and in short everything i can discover or conceive in the      first system upon my inquiring concerning these theologians      present themselves and tell me that these also are modifications      and modifications of one simple uncompounded and indivisible      substance immediately upon which i am deafened with the noise of a      hundred voices that treat the first hypothesis with detestation      and scorn and the second with applause and veneration i turn my      attention to these hypotheses to see what may be the reason of so      great a partiality and find that they have the same fault of being      unintelligible and that as far as we can understand them they      are so much alike that tis impossible to discover any absurdity      in one which is not common to both of themi p 309  for the manner in which hume makes his case good i must refer to the original plain people may rest satisfied that both hypotheses are unintelligible without plunging any further among syllogisms the premisses of which convey no meaning while the conclusions carry no conviction  footnotes  35 our internal intuition shows no permanent existence for the ego is only the consciousness of my thinking there is no means whatever by which we can learn anything respecting the constitution of the soul so far as regards

necessity   in the opening paragraphs of the third part of the second book of the treatise hume gives a description of the will       of all the immediate effects of pain and pleasure there is none      more remarkable than the will and though properly speaking it      be not comprehended among the passions yet as the full      understanding of its nature and properties is necessary to the      explanation of them we shall here make it the subject of our      inquiry i desire it may be observed that by the will i mean      nothing but the internal impression we feel and are conscious of      when we knowingly give rise to any new motion of our body or new      perception of our mind this impression like the preceding ones      of pride and humility love and hatred tis impossible to define      and needless to describe any furtherii p 150  this description of volition may be criticised on various grounds more especially does it seem defective in restricting the term will to that feeling which arises when we act or appear to act as causes for one may will to strike without striking or to think of something which we have forgotten  every volition is a complex idea composed of two elements the one is the idea of an action the other is a desire for the occurrence of that action if i will to strike i have an idea of a certain movement and a desire that that movement should take place if i will to think of any subject or in other words to attend to that subject i have an idea of the subject and a strong desire that it should remain present to my consciousness and so far as i can discover this combination of an idea of an object with an emotion is everything that can be directly observed in an act of volition so that humes definition may be amended thus volition is the impression which arises when the idea of a bodily or mental action is accompanied by the desire that the action should be accomplished it differs from other desires simply in the fact that we regard ourselves as possible causes of the action desired  two questions arise in connexion with the observation of the phenomenon of volition as they arise out of the contemplation of all other natural phenomena firstly has it a cause and if so what is its cause secondly is it followed by any effect and if so what effect does it produce  hume points out that the nature of the phenomena we consider can have nothing to do with the origin of the conception that they are connected by the relation of cause and effect for that relation is nothing but an order of succession which so far as our experience goes is invariable and it is obvious that the nature of phenomena has nothing to do with their order whatever it is that leads us to seek for a cause for every event in the case of the phenomena of the external world compels us with equal cogency to seek it in that of the mind  the only meaning of the law of causation in the physical world is that it generalises universal experience of the order of that world and if experience shows a similar order to obtain among states of consciousness the law of causation will properly express that order  that such an order exists however is acknowledged by every sane man       our idea therefore of necessity and causation arises entirely      from the uniformity observable in the operations of nature where      similar objects are constantly conjoined together and the mind is      determined by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the      other these two circumstances form the whole of that necessity      which we ascribe to matter beyond the constant conjunction of      similar objects and the consequent inference from one to the      other we have no notion of any necessity of connexion       if it appear therefore what all mankind have ever allowed      without any doubt or hesitation that these two circumstances take      place in the voluntary actions of men and in the operations of      mind it must follow that all mankind have ever agreed in the      doctrine of necessity and that they have hitherto disputed merely      from not understanding each otheriv p 97  but is this constant conjunction observable in human actions a student of history could give but one answer to this question       ambition avarice selflove vanity friendship generosity      public spirit these passions mixed in various degrees and      distributed through society have been from the beginning of the      world and still are the source of all the actions and enterprizes      which have ever been observed among mankind would you know the      sentiments inclinations and course of life of the greeks and      romans study well the temper and actions of the french and      english you cannot be much mistaken in transferring to the former      most of the observations which you have made with regard to the      latter mankind are so much the same in all times and places that      history informs us of nothing new or strange in this particular      its chief use is only to discover the constant and universal      principles of human nature by showing men in all varieties of      circumstances and situations and furnishing us with materials from      which we may form our observations and become acquainted with the      regular springs of human action and behaviour these records of      wars intrigues factions and revolutions are so many collections      of experiments by which the politician or moral philosopher fixes      the principles of his science in the same manner as the physician      or natural philosopher becomes acquainted with the nature of      plants minerals and other external objects by the experiments      which he forms concerning them nor are the earth air water and      other elements examined by aristotle and hippocrates more like to      those which at present lie under our observation than the men      described by polybius and tacitus are to those who now govern the      worldiv pp 978  hume proceeds to point out that the value set upon experience in the conduct of affairs whether of business or of politics involves the acknowledgment that we base our expectation of what men will do upon our observation of what they have done and that we are as firmly convinced of the fixed order of thoughts as we are of that of things and if it be urged that human actions not unfrequently appear unaccountable and capricious his reply is prompt       i grant it possible to find some actions which seem to have no      regular connexion with any known motives and are exceptions to all      the measures of conduct which have ever been established for the      government of men but if one could willingly know what judgment      should be formed of such irregular and extraordinary actions we      may consider the sentiments commonly entertained with regard to      those irregular events which appear in the course of nature and      the operations of external objects all causes are not conjoined to      their usual effects with like uniformity an artificer who handles      only dead matter may be disappointed in his aim as well as the      politician who directs the conduct of sensible and intelligent      agents       the vulgar who take things according to their first appearance      attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the      causes as make the latter often fail of their usual influence      though they meet with no impediment to their operation but      philosophers observing that almost in every part of nature there      is contained a vast variety of springs and principles which are      hid by reason of their minuteness or remoteness find that it is      at least possible the contrariety of events may not proceed from      any contingency in the cause but from the secret operation of      contrary causes this possibility is converted into certainty by      further observation when they remark that upon an exact scrutiny      a contrariety of effects always betrays a contrariety of causes      and proceeds from their mutual opposition a peasant can give no      better reason for the stopping of any clock or watch than to say      that it does not commonly go right but an artist easily perceives      that the same force in the spring or pendulum has always the same      influence on the wheels but fails of its usual effect perhaps by      reason of a grain of dust which puts a stop to the whole movement      from the observation of several parallel instances philosophers      form a maxim that the connexion between all causes and effects is      equally necessary and that its seeming uncertainty in some      instances proceeds from the secret opposition of contrary      causesiv pp 1012  so with regard to human actions       the internal principles and motives may operate in a uniform      manner notwithstanding these seeming irregularities in the same      manner as the winds rains clouds and other variations of the      weather are supposed to be governed by steady principles though      not easily discoverable by human sagacity and inquiryiv p      103  meteorology as a science was not in existence in humes time or he would have left out the supposed to be in practice again what difference does any one make between natural and moral evidence       a prisoner who has neither money nor interest discovers the      impossibility of his escape as well when he considers the      obstinacy of the gaoler as the walls and bars with which he is      surrounded and in all attempts for his freedom chooses rather to      work upon the stone and iron of the one than upon the inflexible      nature of the other the same prisoner when conducted to the      scaffold foresees his death as certainly from the constancy and      fidelity of his guards as from the operation of the axe or wheel      his mind runs along a certain train of ideas the refusal of the      soldiers to consent to his escape the action of the executioner      the separation of the head and body bleeding convulsive motions      and death here is a connected chain of natural causes and      voluntary actions but the mind feels no difference between them      in passing from one link to another nor is less certain of the      future event than if it were connected with the objects presented      to the memory or senses by a train of causes cemented together by      what we are pleased to call a physical necessity the same      experienced union has the same effect on the mind whether the      united objects be motives volition and actions or figure and      motion we may change the names of things but their nature and      their operation on the understanding never changeiv pp      1056  but if the necessary connexion of our acts with our ideas has always been acknowledged in practice why the proclivity of mankind to deny it words       if we examine the operations of body and the production of      effects from their causes we shall find that all our faculties can      never carry us further in our knowledge of this relation than      barely to observe that particular objects are constantly      conjoined together and that the mind is carried by a customary      transition from the appearance of the one to the belief of the      other but though this conclusion concerning human ignorance be the      result of the strictest scrutiny of this subject men still      entertain a strong propensity to believe that they penetrate      further into the province of nature and perceive something like a      necessary connexion between cause and effect when again they      turn their reflections towards the operations of their own minds      and feel no such connexion between the motive and the action      they are thence apt to suppose that there is a difference between      the effects which result from material force and those which arise      from thought and intelligence but being once convinced that we      know nothing of causation of any kind than merely the constant      conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of the mind      from one to another and finding that these two circumstances are      universally allowed to have place in voluntary actions we may be      more easily led to own the same necessity common to all      causesiv pp 107 8  the last asylum of the hardpressed advocate of the doctrine of uncaused volition is usually that argue as you like he has a profound and ineradicable consciousness of what he calls the freedom of his will but hume follows him even here though only in a note as if he thought the extinction of so transparent a sophism hardly worthy of the dignity of his text       the prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be accounted for      from another cause viz a false sensation or seeming experience      which we have or may have of liberty or indifference in many of      our actions the necessity of any action whether of matter or of      mind is not properly speaking a quality in the agent but in any      thinking or intelligent being who may consider the action and it      consists chiefly in the determination of his thoughts to infer the      existence of that action from some preceding objects as liberty      when opposed to necessity is nothing but the want of that      determination and a certain looseness or indifference which we      feel in passing or not passing from the idea of any object to the      idea of any succeeding one now we may observe that though in      reflecting on human actions we seldom feel such looseness or      indifference but are commonly able to infer them with considerable      certainty from their motives and from the dispositions of the      agent yet it frequently happens that in performing the actions      themselves we are sensible of something like it and as all      resembling objects are taken for each other this has been employed      as demonstrative and even intuitive proof of human liberty we feel      that our actions are subject to our will on most occasions and      imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to nothing      because when by a denial of it we are provoked to try we feel      that it moves easily every way and produces an image of itself or      a velleity as it is called in the schools even on that side on      which it did not settle this image or faint notion we persuade      ourselves could at that time have been completed into the thing      itself because should that be denied we find upon a second trial      that at present it can we consider not that the fantastical desire      of showing liberty is here the motive of our actionsiv p      110 note  moreover the moment the attempt is made to give a definite meaning to the words the supposed opposition between free will and necessity turns out to be a mere verbal dispute       for what is meant by liberty when applied to voluntary actions      we cannot surely mean that actions have so little connexion with      motive inclinations and circumstances that one does not follow      with a certain degree of uniformity from the other and that one      affords no inference by which we can conclude the existence of the      other for these are plain and acknowledged matters of fact by      liberty then we can only mean a power of acting or not acting      according to the determinations of the will that is if we choose      to remain at rest we may if we choose to move we also may now      this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every      one who is not a prisoner and in chains here then is no subject of      disputeiv p 111  half the controversies about the freedom of the will would have had no existence if this pithy paragraph had been well pondered by those who oppose the doctrine of necessity for they rest upon the absurd presumption that the proposition i can do as i like is contradictory to the doctrine of necessity the answer is nobody doubts that at any rate within certain limits you can do as you like but what determines your likings and dislikings did you make your own constitution is it your contrivance that one thing is pleasant and another is painful and even if it were why did you prefer to make it after the one fashion rather than the other the passionate assertion of the consciousness of their freedom which is the favourite refuge of the opponents of the doctrine of necessity is mere futility for nobody denies it what they really have to do if they would upset the necessarian argument is to prove that they are free to associate any emotion whatever with any idea whatever to like pain as much as pleasure vice as much as virtue in short to prove that whatever may be the fixity of order of the universe of things that of thought is given over to chance  in the second part of this remarkable essay hume considers the real or supposed immoral consequences of the doctrine of necessity premising the weighty observation that       when any opinion leads to absurdity it is certainly false but it      is not certain that an opinion is false because it is of dangerous      consequenceiv p 112  and therefore that the attempt to refute an opinion by a picture of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality is as illogical as it is reprehensible  it is said in the first place that necessity destroys responsibility that as it is usually put we have no right to praise or blame actions that cannot be helped humes reply amounts to this that the very idea of responsibility implies the belief in the necessary connexion of certain actions with certain states of the mind a person is held responsible only for those acts which are preceded by a certain intention and as we cannot see or hear or feel an intention we can only reason out its existence on the principle that like effects have like causes  if a man is found by the police busy with jemmy and dark lantern at a jewellers shop door over night the magistrate before whom he is brought the next morning reasons from those effects to their causes in the fellows burglarious ideas and volitions with perfect confidence and punishes him accordingly and it is quite clear that such a proceeding would be grossly unjust if the links of the logical process were other than necessarily connected together the advocate who should attempt to get the man off on the plea that his client need not necessarily have had a felonious intent would hardly waste his time more if he tried to prove that the sum of all the angles of a triangle is not two right angles but three  a mans moral responsibility for his acts has in fact nothing to do with the causation of these acts but depends on the frame of mind which accompanies them common language tells us this when it uses welldisposed as the equivalent of good and evilminded as that of wicked if a does something which puts b in a violent passion it is quite possible to admit that bs passion is the necessary consequence of as act and yet to believe that bs fury is morally wrong or that he ought to control it in fact a calm bystander would reason with both on the assumption of moral necessity he would say to a you were wrong in doing a thing which you knew that is of the necessity of which you were convinced would irritate b and he would say to b you are wrong to give way to passion for you know its evil effectsthat is the necessary connection between yielding to passion and evil  so far therefore from necessity destroying moral responsibility it is the foundation of all praise and blame and moral admiration reaches its climax in the ascription of necessary goodness to the deity  to the statement of another consequence of the necessarian doctrine that if there be a god he must be the cause of all evil as well as of all good hume gives no real replyprobably because none is possible but then if this conclusion is distinctly and unquestionably deducible from the doctrine of necessity it is no less unquestionably a direct consequence of every known form of monotheism if god is the cause of all things he must be the cause of evil among the rest if he is omniscient he must have the foreknowledge of evil if he is almighty he must possess the power of preventing or of extinguishing evil and to say that an allknowing and allpowerful being is not responsible for what happens because he only permits it is under its intellectual aspect a piece of childish sophistry while as to the moral look of it one has only to ask any decently honourable man whether under like circumstances he would try to get rid of his responsibility by such a plea  humes inquiry appeared in 1748 he does not refer to anthony collins essay on liberty published thirtythree years before in which the same question is treated to the same effect with singular force and lucidity it may be said perhaps that it is not wonderful that the two freethinkers should follow the same line of reasoning but no such theory will account for the fact that in 1754 the famous calvinistic divine jonathan edwards president of the college of new jersey produced in the interests of the straitest orthodoxy a demonstration of the necessarian thesis which has never been equalled in power and certainly has never been refuted  in the ninth section of the fourth part of edwards inquiry he has to deal with the arminian objection to the calvinistic doctrine that it makes god the author of sin and it is curious to watch the struggle between the theological controversialist striving to ward off an admission which he knows will be employed to damage his side and the acute logician conscious that in some shape or other the admission must be made beginning with a tu quoque that the arminian doctrine involves consequences as bad as the calvinistic view he proceeds to object to the term author of sin though he ends by admitting that in a certain sense it is applicable he proves from scripture that god is the disposer and orderer of sin and then by an elaborate false analogy with the darkness resulting from the absence of the sun endeavours to suggest that he is only the author of it in a negative sense and finally he takes refuge in the conclusion that though god is the orderer and disposer of those deeds which considered in relation to their agents are morally evil yet inasmuch as his purpose has all along been infinitely good they are not evil relatively to him  and this of course may be perfectly true but if true it is inconsistent with the attribute of omnipotence it is conceivable that there should be no evil in the world that which is conceivable is certainly possible if it were possible for evil to be nonexistent the maker of the world who though foreknowing the existence of evil in that world did not prevent it either did not really desire it should not exist or could not prevent its existence it might be well for those who inveigh against the logical consequences of necessarianism to bethink them of the logical consequences of theism which are not only the same when the attribute of omniscience is ascribed to the deity but which bring out from the existence of moral evil a hopeless conflict between the attributes of infinite benevolence and infinite power which with no less assurance are affirmed to appertain to the divine being  kants mode of dealing with the doctrine of necessity is very singular that the phenomena of the mind follow fixed relations of cause and effect is to him as unquestionable as it is to hume but then there is the ding an sich the noumenon or kantian equivalent for the substance of the soul this being out of the phenomenal world is subject to none of the laws of phenomena and is consequently as absolutely free and as completely powerless as a mathematical point in vacua would be hence volition is uncaused so far as it belongs to the noumenon but necessary so far as it takes effect in the phenomenal world  since kant is never weary of telling us that we know nothing whatever and can know nothing about the noumenon except as the hypothetical subject of any number of negative predicates the information that it is free in the sense of being out of reach of the law of causation is about as valuable as the assertion that it is neither grey nor blue nor square for practical purposes it must be admitted that the inward possession of such a noumenal libertine does not amount to much for people whose actual existence is made up of nothing but definitely regulated phenomena when the good and evil angels fought for the dead body of moses its presence must have been of about the same value to either of the contending parties as that of kants noumenon in the battle of impulses which rages in the breast of man metaphysicians as a rule are sadly deficient in the sense of humour or they would surely abstain from advancing propositions which when stripped of the verbiage in which they are disguised appear to the profane eye to be bare shams naked but not ashamed     chapter xi  the principles of morals   in his autobiography hume writes       in the same year 1752 was published at london my inquiry      concerning the principles of morals which in my own opinion who      ought not to judge on that subject is of all my writings      historical philosophical and literary incomparably the best it      came unnoticed and unobserved into the world  it may commonly be noticed that the relative value which an author ascribes to his own works rarely agrees with the estimate formed of them by his readers who criticise the products without either the power or the wish to take into account the pains which they may have cost the producer moreover the clear and dispassionate common sense of the inquiry concerning the principles of morals may have tasted flat after the highlyseasoned inquiry concerning the human understanding whether the public like to be deceived or not may be open to question but it is beyond a doubt that they love to be shocked in a pleasant and mannerly way now humes speculations on moral questions are not so remote from those of respectable professors like hutcheson or saintly prelates such as butler as to present any striking novelty and they support the cause of righteousness in a cool reasonable indeed slightly patronising fashion eminently in harmony with the mind of the eighteenth century which admired virtue very much if she would only avoid the rigour which the age called fanaticism and the fervour which it called enthusiasm  having applied the ordinary methods of scientific inquiry to the intellectual phenomena of the mind it was natural that hume should extend the same mode of investigation to its moral phenomena and in the true spirit of a natural philosopher he commences by selecting a group of those states of consciousness with which every ones personal experience must have made him familiar in the expectation that the discovery of the sources of moral approbation and disapprobation in this comparatively easy case may furnish the means of detecting them where they are more recondite       we shall analyse that complication of mental qualities which form      what in common life we call personal merit we shall consider      every attribute of the mind which renders a man an object either      of esteem and affection or of hatred and contempt every habit or      sentiment or faculty which if ascribed to any person implies      either praise or blame and may enter into any panegyric or satire      of his character and manners the quick sensibility which on this      head is so universal among mankind gives a philosopher sufficient      assurance that he can never be considerably mistaken in framing the      catalogue or incurs any danger of misplacing the objects of his      contemplation he needs only enter into his own breast for a      moment and consider whether he should or should not desire to have      this or that quality assigned to him and whether such or such an      imputation would proceed from a friend or an enemy the very nature      of language guides us almost infallibly in forming a judgment of      this nature and as every tongue possesses one set of words which      are taken in a good sense and another in the opposite the least      acquaintance with the idiom suffices without any reasoning to      direct us in collecting and arranging the estimable or blamable      qualities of men the only object of reasoning is to discover the      circumstances on both sides which are common to these qualities      to observe that particular in which the estimable qualities agree      on the one hand and the blamable on the other and thence to reach      the foundation of ethics and find their universal principles from      which all censure or approbation is ultimately derived as this is      a question of fact not of abstract science we can only expect      success by following the experimental method and deducing general      maxims from a comparison of particular instances the other      scientifical method where a general abstract principle is first      established and is afterwards branched out into a variety of      inferences and conclusions may be more perfect in itself but      suits less the imperfection of human nature and is a common source      of illusion and mistake in this as well as in other subjects men      are now cured of their passion for hypotheses and systems in      natural philosophy and will hearken to no arguments but those      which are derived from experience it is full time they should      attempt a like reformation in all moral disquisitions and reject      every system of ethics however subtile or ingenious which is not      founded on fact and observationiv pp 2424  no qualities give a man a greater claim to personal merit than benevolence and justice but if we inquire why benevolence deserves so much praise the answer will certainly contain a large reference to the utility of that virtue to society and as for justice the very existence of the virtue implies that of society public utility is its sole origin and the measure of its usefulness is also the standard of its merit if every man possessed everything he wanted and no one had the power to interfere with such possession or if no man desired that which could damage his fellowman justice would have no part to play in the universe but as hume observes       in the present disposition of the human heart it would perhaps be      difficult to find complete instances of such enlarged affections      but still we may observe that the case of families approaches      towards it and the stronger the mutual benevolence is among the      individuals the nearer it approaches till all distinction of      property be in a great measure lost and confounded among them      between married persons the cement of friendship is by the laws      supposed so strong as to abolish all division of possessions and      has often in reality the force assigned to it45 and it is      observable that during the ardour of new enthusiasms when every      principle is inflamed into extravagance the community of goods has      frequently been attempted and nothing but experience of its      inconveniences from the returning or disguised selfishness of men      could make the imprudent fanatics adopt anew the ideas of justice      and separate property so true is it that this virtue derives its      existence entirely from its necessary use to the intercourse and      social state of mankindiv p 256       were the human species so framed by nature as that each individual      possessed within himself every faculty requisite both for his own      preservation and for the propagation of his kind were all society      and intercourse cut off between man and man by the primary      intention of the supreme creator it seems evident that so solitary      a being would be as much incapable of justice as of social      discourse and conversation where mutual regard and forbearance      serve to no manner of purpose they would never direct the conduct      of any reasonable man the headlong course of the passions would be      checked by no reflection on future consequences and as each man      is here supposed to love himself alone and to depend only on      himself and his own activity for safety and happiness he would on      every occasion to the utmost of his power challenge the      preference above every other being to none of which he is bound by      any ties either of nature or of interest       but suppose the conjunction of the sexes to be established in      nature a family immediately arises and particular rules being      found requisite for its subsistence these are immediately      embraced though without comprehending the rest of mankind within      their prescriptions suppose that several families unite together      in one society which is totally disjoined from all others the      rules which preserve peace and order enlarge themselves to the      utmost extent of that society but becoming then entirely useless      lose their force when carried one step further but again suppose      that several distinct societies maintain a kind of intercourse for      mutual convenience and advantage the boundaries of justice still      grow larger in proportion to the largeness of mens views and the      force of their mutual connexion history experience reason      sufficiently instruct us in this natural progress of human      sentiments and in the gradual enlargement of our regard to justice      in proportion as we become acquainted with the extensive utility of      that virtueiv pp 2624  the moral obligation of justice and the rights of property are by no means diminished by this exposure of the purely utilitarian basis on which they rest       for what stronger foundation can be desired or conceived for any      duty than to observe that human society or even human nature      could not subsist without the establishment of it and will still      arrive at greater degrees of happiness and perfection the more      inviolable the regard is which is paid to that duty       the dilemma seems obvious as justice evidently tends to promote      public utility and to support civil society the sentiment of      justice is either derived from our reflecting on that tendency or      like hunger thirst and other appetites resentment love of life      attachment to offspring and other passions arises from a simple      original instinct in the human heart which nature has implanted      for like salutary purposes if the latter be the case it follows      that property which is the object of justice is also      distinguished by a simple original instinct and is not ascertained      by any argument or reflection but who is there that ever heard of      such an instinct or is this a subject in which new discoveries can      be made we may as well expect to discover in the body new senses      which had before escaped the observation of all mankindiv pp      273 4  the restriction of the object of justice to property in this passage is singular pleasure and pain can hardly be included under the term property and yet justice surely deals largely with the withholding of the former or the infliction of the latter by men on one another if a man bars another from a pleasure which he would otherwise enjoy or actively hurts him without good reason the latter is said to be injured as much as if his property had been interfered with here indeed it may be readily shown that it is as much the interest of society that men should not interfere with one anothers freedom or mutually inflict positive or negative pain as that they should not meddle with one anothers property and hence the obligation of justice in such matters may be deduced but if a man merely thinks ill of another or feels maliciously towards him without due cause he is properly said to be unjust in this case it would be hard to prove that any injury is done to society by the evil thought but there is no question that it will be stigmatised as an injustice and the offender himself in another frame of mind is often ready enough to admit that he has failed to be just towards his neighbour however it may plausibly be said that so slight a barrier lies between thought and speech that any moral quality attached to the latter is easily transferred to the former and that since open slander is obviously opposed to the interests of society injustice of thought which is silent slander must become inextricably associated with the same blame  but granting the utility to society of all kinds of benevolence and justice why should the quality of those virtues involve the sense of moral obligation  hume answers this question in the fifth section entitled why utility pleases he repudiates the deduction of moral approbation from selflove and utterly denies that we approve of benevolent or just actions because we think of the benefits which they are likely to confer indirectly on ourselves the source of the approbation with which we view an act useful to society must be sought elsewhere and in fact is to be found in that feeling which is called sympathy       no man is absolutely indifferent to the happiness and misery of      others the first has a natural tendency to give pleasure the      second pain this every one may find in himself it is not probable      that these principles can be resolved into principles more simple      and universal whatever attempts may have been made for that      purposeiv p 294 note  other mens joys and sorrows are not spectacles at which we remain unmoved         the view of the former whether in its causes or effects      like sunshine or the prospect of wellcultivated plains to carry      our pretensions no higher communicates a secret joy and      satisfaction the appearance of the latter like a lowering cloud      or barren landscape throws a melancholy damp over the imagination      and this concession being once made the difficulty is over and a      natural unforced interpretation of the phenomena of human life will      afterwards we hope prevail among all speculative      inquirersiv p 320  the moral approbation therefore with which we regard acts of justice or benevolence rests upon their utility to society because the perception of that utility or in other words of the pleasure which they give to other men arouses a feeling of sympathetic pleasure in ourselves the feeling of obligation to be just or of the duty of justice arises out of that association of moral approbation or disapprobation with ones own actions which is what we call conscience to fail in justice or in benevolence is to be displeased with oneself but happiness is impossible without inward selfapproval and hence every man who has any regard to his own happiness and welfare will find his best reward in the practice of every moral duty on this topic hume expends much eloquence       but what philosophical truths can be more advantageous to society      than these here delivered which represent virtue in all her      genuine and most engaging charms and make us approach her with      ease familiarity and affection the dismal dress falls off with      which many divines and some philosophers have covered her and      nothing appears but gentleness humanity beneficence affability      nay even at proper intervals play frolic and gaiety she talks      not of useless austerities and rigours suffering and selfdenial      she declares that her sole purpose is to make her votaries and all      mankind during every period of their existence if possible      cheerful and happy nor does she ever willingly part with any      pleasure but in hopes of ample compensation in some other period of      their lives the sole trouble which she demands is that of just      calculation and a steady preference of the greater happiness and      if any austere pretenders approach her enemies to joy and      pleasure she either rejects them as hypocrites and deceivers or      if she admit them in her train they are ranked however among the      least favoured of her votaries       and indeed to drop all figurative expression what hopes can we      ever have of engaging mankind to a practice which we confess full      of austerity and rigour or what theory of morals can ever serve      any useful purpose unless it can show by a particular detail      that all the duties which it recommends are also the true interest      of each individual the peculiar advantage of the foregoing system      seem to be that it furnishes proper mediums for that      purposeiv p 360  in this pæan to virtue there is more of the dance measure than will sound appropriate in the ears of most of the pilgrims who toil painfully not without many a stumble and many a bruise along the rough and steep roads which lead to the higher life  virtue is undoubtedly beneficent but the man is to be envied to whom her ways seem in anywise playful and though she may not talk much about suffering and selfdenial her silence on that topic may be accounted for on the principle ça va sans dire the calculation of the greatest happiness is not performed quite so easily as a rule of three sum while in the hour of temptation the question will crop up whether as something has to be sacrificed a bird in the hand is not worth two in the bush whether it may not be as well to give up the problematical greater happiness in the future for a certain great happiness in the present and                buy the merry madness of one hour      with the long irksomeness of following time46   if mankind cannot be engaged in practices full of austerity and rigour by the love of righteousness and the fear of evil without seeking for other compensation than that which flows from the gratification of such love and the consciousness of escape from debasement they are in a bad case for they will assuredly find that virtue presents no very close likeness to the sportive leader of the joyous hours in humes rosy picture but that she is an awful goddess whose ministers are the furies and whose highest reward is peace  it is not improbable that hume would have qualified all this as enthusiasm or fanaticism or both but he virtually admits it       now as virtue is an end and is desirable on its own account      without fee or reward merely for the immediate satisfaction which      it conveys it is requisite that there should be some sentiment      which it touches some internal taste or feeling or whatever you      please to call it which distinguishes moral good and evil and      which embraces the one and rejects the other       thus the distinct boundaries and offices of reason and of      taste are easily ascertained the former conveys the knowledge of      truth and falsehood the latter gives the sentiment of beauty and      deformity vice and virtue the one discovers objects as they      really stand in nature without addition or diminution the other      has a productive faculty and gilding and staining all natural      objects with the colours borrowed from internal sentiment raises      in a manner a new creation reason being cool and disengaged is no      motive to action and directs only the impulse received from      appetite or inclination by showing us the means of attaining      happiness or avoiding misery taste as it gives pleasure or pain      and thereby constitutes happiness or misery becomes a motive to      action and is the first spring or impulse to desire and volition      from circumstances and relations known or supposed the former      leads us to the discovery of the concealed and unknown after all      circumstances and relations are laid before us the latter makes us      feel from the whole a new sentiment of blame or approbation the      standard of the one being founded on the nature of things is      external and inflexible even by the will of the supreme being the      standard of the other arising from the internal frame and      constitution of animals is ultimately derived from the supreme      will which bestowed on each being its peculiar nature and      arranged the several classes and orders of existenceiv pp      3767  hume has not discussed the theological theory of the obligations of morality but it is obviously in accordance with his view of the nature of those obligations under its theological aspect morality is obedience to the will of god and the ground for such obedience is twofold either we ought to obey god because he will punish us if we disobey him which is an argument based on the utility of obedience or our obedience ought to flow from our love towards god which is an argument based on pure feeling and for which no reason can be given for if any man should say that he takes no pleasure in the contemplation of the ideal of perfect holiness or in other words that he does not love god the attempt to argue him into acquiring that pleasure would be as hopeless as the endeavour to persuade peter bell of the witchery of the soft blue sky  in whichever way we look at the matter morality is based on feeling not on reason though reason alone is competent to trace out the effects of our actions and thereby dictate conduct justice is founded on the love of ones neighbour and goodness is a kind of beauty the moral law like the laws of physical nature rests in the long run upon instinctive intuitions and is neither more nor less innate and necessary than they are some people cannot by any means be got to understand the first book of euclid but the truths of mathematics are no less necessary and binding on the great mass of mankind some there are who cannot feel the difference between the sonata appassionata and cherry ripe or between a gravestonecutters cherub and the apollo belvidere but the canons of art are none the less acknowledged while some there may be who devoid of sympathy are incapable of a sense of duty but neither does their existence affect the foundations of morality such pathological deviations from true manhood are merely the halt the lame and the blind of the world of consciousness and the anatomist of the mind leaves them aside as the anatomist of the body would ignore abnormal specimens  and as there are pascals and mozarts newtons and raffaelles in whom the innate faculty for science or art seems to need but a touch to spring into full vigour and through whom the human race obtains new possibilities of knowledge and new conceptions of beauty so there have been men of moral genius to whom we owe ideals of duty and visions of moral perfection which ordinary mankind could never have attained though happily for them they can feel the beauty of a vision which lay beyond the reach of their dull imaginations and count life well spent in shaping some faint image of it in the actual world  the end  london r clay sons and taylor
