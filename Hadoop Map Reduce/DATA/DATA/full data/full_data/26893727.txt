by dodd mead  company  published september 1908    the neighbourhood of bloomsbury square towards four oclock of a november afternoon is not so crowded as to secure to the stranger of appearance anything out of the common immunity from observation tibbs boy screaming at the top of his voice that she was his honey stopped suddenly stepped backwards on to the toes of a voluble young lady wheeling a perambulator and remained deaf apparently to the somewhat personal remarks of the voluble young lady not until he had reached the next cornerand then more as a soliloquy than as information to the streetdid tibbs boy recover sufficient interest in his own affairs to remark that he was her bee the voluble young lady herself following some halfadozen yards behind forgot her wrongs in contemplation of the strangers back there was this that was peculiar about the strangers back that instead of being flat it presented a decided curve it aint a ump and it dont look like kervitcher of the spine observed the voluble young lady to herself blimy if i dont believe es taking ome is washing up his back  the constable at the corner trying to seem busy doing nothing noticed the strangers approach with gathering interest thats an odd sort of a walk of yours young man thought the constable you take care you dont fall down and tumble over yourself  thought he was a young man murmured the constable the stranger having passed him he had a young face right enough  the daylight was fading the stranger finding it impossible to read the name of the street upon the corner house turned back  why tis a young man the constable told himself a mere boy  i beg your pardon said the stranger but would you mind telling me my way to bloomsbury square  this is bloomsbury square explained the constable leastways round the corner is what number might you be wanting  the stranger took from the ticket pocket of his tightly buttoned overcoat a piece of paper unfolded it and read it out mrs pennycherry number fortyeight  round to the left instructed him the constable fourth house been recommended there  byby a friend replied the stranger thank you very much  ah muttered the constable to himself guess you wont be calling him that by the end of the week young  funny added the constable gazing after the retreating figure of the stranger seen plenty of the other sex as looked young behind and old in front this cove looks young in front and old behind guess hell look old all round if he stops long at mother pennycherrys stingy old cat  constables whose beat included bloomsbury square had their reasons for not liking mrs pennycherry indeed it might have been difficult to discover any human being with reasons for liking that sharpfeatured lady maybe the keeping of secondrate boarding houses in the neighbourhood of bloomsbury does not tend to develop the virtues of generosity and amiability  meanwhile the stranger proceeding upon his way had rung the bell of number fortyeight mrs pennycherry peeping from the area and catching a glimpse above the railings of a handsome if somewhat effeminate masculine face hastened to readjust her widows cap before the lookingglass while directing mary jane to show the stranger should he prove a problematical boarder into the diningroom and to light the gas  and dont stop gossiping and dont you take it upon yourself to answer questions say ill be up in a minute were mrs pennycherrys further instructions and mind you hide your hands as much as you can    what are you grinning at demanded mrs pennycherry a couple of minutes later of the dingy mary jane  wasnt grinning explained the meek mary jane was only smiling to myself  what at  dunno admitted mary jane but still she went on smiling  whats he like then demanded mrs pennycherry  e aint the usual sort was mary janes opinion  thank god for that ejaculated mrs pennycherry piously  says es been recommended by a friend  by whom  by a friend e didnt say no name mrs pennycherry pondered hes not the funny sort is he  not that sort at all mary jane was sure of it  mrs pennycherry ascended the stairs still pondering as she entered the room the stranger rose and bowed nothing could have been simpler than the strangers bow yet there came with it to mrs pennycherry a rush of old sensations long forgotten for one brief moment mrs pennycherry saw herself an amiable wellbred lady widow of a solicitor a visitor had called to see her it was but a momentary fancy the next instant reality reasserted itself mrs pennycherry a lodginghouse keeper existing precariously upon a daily round of petty meannesses was prepared for contest with a possible new boarder who fortunately looked an inexperienced young gentleman  someone has recommended me to you began mrs pennycherry may i ask who  but the stranger waved the question aside as immaterial  you might not rememberhim he smiled he thought that i should do well to pass the few months i am giventhat i have to be in london here you can take me in  mrs pennycherry thought that she would be able to take the stranger in  a room to sleep in explained the stranger any room will dowith food and drink sufficient for a man is all that i require  for breakfast began mrs pennycherry i always give  what is right and proper i am convinced interrupted the stranger pray do not trouble to go into detail mrs pennycherry with whatever it is i shall be content  mrs pennycherry puzzled shot a quick glance at the stranger but his face though the gentle eyes were smiling was frank and serious  at all events you will see the room suggested mrs pennycherry before we discuss terms  certainly agreed the stranger i am a little tired and shall be glad to rest there  mrs pennycherry led the way upward on the landing of the third floor paused a moment undecided then opened the door of the back bedroom  it is very comfortable commented the stranger  for this room stated mrs pennycherry together with full board consisting of  of everything needful it goes without saying again interrupted the stranger with his quiet grave smile  i have generally asked continued mrs pennycherry four pounds a week to you mrs pennycherrys voice unknown to her took to itself the note of aggressive generosityseeing you have been recommended here say three pounds ten  dear lady said the stranger that is kind of you as you have divined i am not a rich man if it be not imposing upon you i accept your reduction with gratitude  again mrs pennycherry familiar with the satirical method shot a suspicious glance upon the stranger but not a line was there upon that smooth fair face to which a sneer could for a moment have clung clearly he was as simple as he looked  gas of course extra  of course agreed the stranger  coals  we shall not quarrel for a third time the stranger interrupted you have been very considerate to me as it is i feel mrs pennycherry i can leave myself entirely in your hands  the stranger appeared anxious to be alone mrs pennycherry having put a match to the strangers fire turned to depart and at this point it was that mrs pennycherry the holder hitherto of an unbroken record for sanity behaved in a manner she herself five minutes earlier in her career would have deemed impossiblethat no living soul who had ever known her would have believed even had mrs pennycherry gone down upon her knees and sworn it to them  did i say three pound ten demanded mrs pennycherry of the stranger her hand upon the door she spoke crossly she was feeling cross with the stranger with herselfparticularly with herself  you were kind enough to reduce it to that amount replied the stranger but if upon reflection you find yourself unable  i was making a mistake said mrs pennycherry it should have been two pound ten  i cannoti will not accept such sacrifice exclaimed the stranger the three pound ten i can well afford  two pound ten are my terms snapped mrs pennycherry if you are bent on paying more you can go elsewhere youll find plenty to oblige you  her vehemence must have impressed the stranger we will not contend further he smiled i was merely afraid that in the goodness of your heart  oh it isnt as good as all that growled mrs pennycherry  i am not so sure returned the stranger i am somewhat suspicious of you but wilful woman must i suppose have her way  the stranger held out his hand and to mrs pennycherry at that moment it seemed the most natural thing in the world to take it as if it had been the hand of an old friend and to end the interview with a pleasant laughthough laughing was an exercise not often indulged in by mrs pennycherry  mary jane was standing by the window her hands folded in front of her when mrs pennycherry reentered the kitchen by standing close to the window one caught a glimpse of the trees in bloomsbury square and through their bare branches of the sky beyond  theres nothing much to do for the next half hour till cook comes back ill see to the door if youd like a run out suggested mrs pennycherry  it would be nice agreed the girl so soon as she had recovered power of speech its just the time of day i like  dont be longer than the half hour added mrs pennycherry  fortyeight bloomsbury square assembled after dinner in the drawingroom discussed the stranger with that freedom and frankness characteristic of fortyeight bloomsbury square towards the absent  not what i call a smart young man was the opinion of augustus longcord who was something in the city  thpeaking for mythelf commented his partner isidore havnth any uthe for the thmart young man too many of him ath it ith  must be pretty smart if hes one too many for you laughed his partner  there was this to be said for the repartee of fortyeight bloomsbury square it was simple of construction and easy of comprehension  well it made me feel good just looking at him declared miss kite the highly coloured it was his clothes i supposemade me think of noah and the arkall that sort of thing  it would be clothes that would make you thinkif anything drawled the languid miss devine she was a tall handsome girl engaged at the moment in futile efforts to recline with elegance and comfort combined upon a horsehair sofa miss kite by reason of having secured the only easychair was unpopular that evening so that miss devines remark received from the rest of the company more approbation than perhaps it merited  is that intended to be clever dear or only rude miss kite requested to be informed  both claimed miss devine  myself i must confess shouted the tall young ladys father commonly called the colonel i found him a fool  i noticed you seemed to be getting on very well together purred his wife a plump smiling little lady  possibly we were retorted the colonel fate has accustomed me to the society of fools  isnt it a pity to start quarrelling immediately after dinner you two suggested their thoughtful daughter from the sofa youll have nothing left to amuse you for the rest of the evening  he didnt strike me as a conversationalist said the lady who was cousin to a baronet but he did pass the vegetables before he helped himself a little thing like that shows breeding  or that he didnt know you and thought maybe youd leave him half a spoonful laughed augustus the wit  what i cant make out about him shouted the colonel  the stranger entered the room  the colonel securing the evening paper retired into a corner the highly coloured kite reaching down from the mantelpiece a paper fan held it coyly before her face miss devine sat upright on the horsehair sofa and rearranged her skirts  know anything demanded augustus of the stranger breaking the somewhat remarkable silence  the stranger evidently did not understand it was necessary for augustus the witty to advance further into that odd silence  whats going to pull off the lincoln handicap tell me and ill go out straight and put my shirt upon it  i think you would act unwisely smiled the stranger i am not an authority upon the subject  not why they told me you were captain spy of the sporting lifein disguise  it would have been difficult for a joke to fall more flat nobody laughed though why mr augustus longcord could not understand and maybe none of his audience could have told him for at fortyeight bloomsbury square mr augustus longcord passed as a humorist the stranger himself appeared unaware that he was being made fun of  you have been misinformed assured him the stranger  i beg your pardon said mr augustus longcord  it is nothing replied the stranger in his sweet low voice and passed on  well what about this theatre demanded mr longcord of his friend and partner do you want to go or dont you mr longcord was feeling irritable  goth the tickethmay ath well thought isidore  damn stupid piece im told  motht of them thupid more or leth pity to wathte the ticketh argued isidore and the pair went out  are you staying long in london asked miss kite raising her practised eyes towards the stranger  not long answered the stranger at least i do not know it depends  an unusual quiet had invaded the drawingroom of fortyeight bloomsbury square generally noisy with strident voices about this hour the colonel remained engrossed in his paper mrs devine sat with her plump white hands folded on her lap whether asleep or not it was impossible to say the lady who was cousin to a baronet had shifted her chair beneath the gasolier her eyes bent on her everlasting crochet work the languid miss devine had crossed to the piano where she sat fingering softly the tuneless keys her back to the cold barelyfurnished room  sit down commanded saucily miss kite indicating with her fan the vacant seat beside her tell me about yourself you interest me miss kite adopted a pretty authoritative air towards all youthfullooking members of the opposite sex it harmonised with the peach complexion and the golden hair and fitted her about as well  i am glad of that answered the stranger taking the chair suggested i so wish to interest you  youre a very bold boy miss kite lowered her fan for the purpose of glancing archly over the edge of it and for the first time encountered the eyes of the stranger looking into hers and then it was that miss kite experienced precisely the same curious sensation that an hour or so ago had troubled mrs pennycherry when the stranger had first bowed to her it seemed to miss kite that she was no longer the miss kite that had she risen and looked into it the flyblown mirror over the marble mantelpiece would she knew have presented to her view but quite another miss kitea cheerful brighteyed lady verging on middle age yet still goodlooking in spite of her faded complexion and somewhat thin brown locks miss kite felt a pang of jealousy shoot through her this middleaged miss kite seemed on the whole a more attractive lady there was a wholesomeness a broadmindedness about her that instinctively drew one towards her not hampered as miss kite herself was by the necessity of appearing to be somewhere between eighteen and twentytwo this other miss kite could talk sensibly even brilliantly one felt it a thoroughly nice woman this other miss kite the real miss kite though envious was bound to admit it miss kite wished to goodness she had never seen the woman the glimpse of her had rendered miss kite dissatisfied with herself  i am not a boy explained the stranger and i had no intention of being bold  i know replied miss kite it was a silly remark whatever induced me to make it i cant think getting foolish in my old age i suppose  the stranger laughed surely you are not old  im thirtynine snapped out miss kite you dont call it young  i think it a beautiful age insisted the stranger young enough not to have lost the joy of youth old enough to have learnt sympathy  oh i daresay returned miss kite any age youd think beautiful im going to bed miss kite rose the paper fan had somehow got itself broken she threw the fragments into the fire  it is early yet pleaded the stranger i was looking forward to a talk with you  well youll be able to look forward to it retorted miss kite goodnight  the truth was miss kite was impatient to have a look at herself in the glass in her own room with the door shut the vision of that other miss kitethe cleanlooking lady of the pale face and the brown hair had been so vivid miss kite wondered whether temporary forgetfulness might not have fallen upon her while dressing for dinner that evening  the stranger left to his own devices strolled towards the loo table seeking something to read  you seem to have frightened away miss kite remarked the lady who was cousin to a baronet  it seems so admitted the stranger  my cousin sir william bosster observed the crocheting lady who married old lord eghams nieceyou never met the eghams  hitherto replied the stranger i have not had that pleasure  a charming family cannot understandmy cousin sir william i mean cannot understand my remaining here my dear emilyhe says the same thing every time he sees me my dear emily how can you exist among the sort of people one meets with in a boardinghouse but they amuse me  a sense of humour agreed the stranger was always of advantage  our family on my mothers side continued sir williams cousin in her placid monotone was connected with the tattonjoneses who when king george the fourth sir williams cousin needing another reel of cotton glanced up and met the strangers gaze  im sure i dont know why im telling you all this said sir williams cousin in an irritable tone it cant possibly interest you  everything connected with you interests me gravely the stranger assured her  it is very kind of you to say so sighed sir williams cousin but without conviction i am afraid sometimes i bore people  the polite stranger refrained from contradiction  you see continued the poor lady i really am of good family  dear lady said the stranger your gentle face your gentle voice your gentle bearing all proclaim it  she looked without flinching into the strangers eyes and gradually a smile banished the reigning dulness of her features  how foolish of me she spoke rather to herself than to the stranger why of course peoplepeople whose opinion is worth troubling aboutjudge of you by what you are not by what you go about saying you are  the stranger remained silent  i am the widow of a provincial doctor with an income of just two hundred and thirty pounds per annum she argued the sensible thing for me to do is to make the best of it and to worry myself about these high and mighty relations of mine as little as they have ever worried themselves about me  the stranger appeared unable to think of anything worth saying  i have other connections remembered sir williams cousin those of my poor husband to whom instead of being the poor relation i could be the fairy godmama they are my peopleor would be added sir williams cousin tartly if i wasnt a vulgar snob  she flushed the instant she had said the words and rising commenced preparations for a hurried departure  now it seems i am driving you away sighed the stranger  having been called a vulgar snob retorted the lady with some heat i think it about time i went  the words were your own the stranger reminded her  whatever i may have thought remarked the indignant dame no ladyleast of all in the presence of a total strangerwould have called herself the poor dame paused bewildered there is something very curious the matter with me this evening that i cannot understand she explained i seem quite unable to avoid insulting myself  still surrounded by bewilderment she wished the stranger goodnight hoping that when next they met she would be more herself the stranger hoping so also opened the door and closed it again behind her  tell me laughed miss devine who by sheer force of talent was contriving to wring harmony from the reluctant piano how did you manage to do it i should like to know  how did i do what inquired the stranger  contrive to get rid so quickly of those two old frumps  how well you play observed the stranger i knew you had genius for music the moment i saw you  how could you tell  it is written so clearly in your face  the girl laughed well pleased you seem to have lost no time in studying my face  it is a beautiful and interesting face observed the stranger  she swung round sharply on the stool and their eyes met  you can read faces  yes  tell me what else do you read in mine  frankness courage  ah yes all the virtues perhaps we will take them for granted it was odd how serious the girl had suddenly become tell me the reverse side  i see no reverse side replied the stranger i see but a fair girl bursting into noble womanhood  and nothing else you read no trace of greed of vanity of sordidness of an angry laugh escaped her lips and you are a reader of faces  a reader of faces the stranger smiled do you know what is written upon yours at this very moment a love of truth that is almost fierce scorn of lies scorn of hypocrisy the desire for all things pure contempt of all things that are contemptibleespecially of such things as are contemptible in woman tell me do i not read aright  i wonder thought the girl is that why those two others both hurried from the room does everyone feel ashamed of the littleness that is in them when looked at by those clear believing eyes of yours  the idea occurred to her papa seemed to have a good deal to say to you during dinner tell me what were you talking about  the military looking gentleman upon my left we talked about your mother principally  i am sorry returned the girl wishful now she had not asked the question i was hoping he might have chosen another topic for the first evening  he did try one or two admitted the stranger but i have been about the world so little i was glad when he talked to me about himself i feel we shall be friends he spoke so nicely too about mrs devine  indeed commented the girl  he told me he had been married for twenty years and had never regretted it but once  her black eyes flashed upon him but meeting his the suspicion died from them she turned aside to hide her smile  so he regretted itonce  only once explained the stranger in a passing irritable mood it was so frank of him to admit it he told mei think he has taken a liking to me indeed he hinted as much he said he did not often get an opportunity of talking to a man like myselfhe told me that he and your mother when they travel together are always mistaken for a honeymoon couple some of the experiences he related to me were really quite amusing the stranger laughed at recollection of themthat even here in this place they are generally referred to as darby and joan  yes said the girl that is true mr longcord gave them that name the second evening after our arrival it was considered cleverbut rather obvious i thought myself  nothingso it seems to me said the stranger is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of life the sweet tender blossom that flowers in the heart of the youngin hearts such as yoursthat too is beautiful the love of the young for the young that is the beginning of life but the love of the old for the old that is the beginning ofof things longer  you seem to find all things beautiful the girl grumbled  but are not all things beautiful demanded the stranger  the colonel had finished his paper you two are engaged in a very absorbing conversation observed the colonel approaching them  we were discussing darbies and joans explained his daughter how beautiful is the love that has weathered the storms of life  ah smiled the colonel that is hardly fair my friend has been repeating to cynical youth the confessions of an amorous husbands affection for his middleaged and somewhat the colonel in playful mood laid his hand upon the strangers shoulder an action that necessitated his looking straight into the strangers eyes the colonel drew himself up stiffly and turned scarlet  somebody was calling the colonel a cad not only that but was explaining quite clearly so that the colonel could see it for himself why he was a cad  that you and your wife lead a cat and dog existence is a disgrace to both of you at least you might have the decency to try and hide it from the worldnot make a jest of your shame to every passing stranger you are a cad sir a cad  who was daring to say these things not the stranger his lips had not moved besides it was not his voice indeed it sounded much more like the voice of the colonel himself the colonel looked from the stranger to his daughter from his daughter back to the stranger clearly they had not heard the voicea mere hallucination the colonel breathed again  yet the impression remaining was not to be shaken off undoubtedly it was bad taste to have joked to the stranger upon such a subject no gentleman would have done so  but then no gentleman would have permitted such a jest to be possible no gentleman would be forever wrangling with his wifecertainly never in public however irritating the woman a gentleman would have exercised selfcontrol  mrs devine had risen was coming slowly across the room fear laid hold of the colonel she was going to address some aggravating remark to himhe could see it in her eyewhich would irritate him into savage retort  even this prize idiot of a stranger would understand why boardinghouse wits had dubbed them darby and joan would grasp the fact that the gallant colonel had thought it amusing in conversation with a table acquaintance to hold his own wife up to ridicule  my dear cried the colonel hurrying to speak first does not this room strike you as cold let me fetch you a shawl  it was useless the colonel felt it it had been too long the custom of both of them to preface with politeness their deadliest insults to each other she came on thinking of a suitable reply suitable from her point of view that is in another moment the truth would be out a wild fantastic possibility flashed through the colonels brain if to him why not to her  letitia cried the colonel and the tone of his voice surprised her into silence i want you to look closely at our friend does he not remind you of someone  mrs devine so urged looked at the stranger long and hard yes she murmured turning to her husband he does who is it  i cannot fix it replied the colonel i thought that maybe you would remember  it will come to me mused mrs devine it is someoneyears ago when i was a girlin devonshire thank you if it isnt troubling you harry i left it in the diningroom  it was as mr augustus longcord explained to his partner isidore the colossal foolishness of the stranger that was the cause of all the trouble give me a man who can take care of himselfor thinks he can declared augustus longcord and i am prepared to give a good account of myself but when a helpless baby refuses even to look at what you call your figures tells you that your mere word is sufficient for him and hands you over his chequebook to fill up for yourselfwell it isnt playing the game  auguthuth was the curt comment of his partner youre a fool  all right my boy you try suggested augustus  jutht what i mean to do asserted his partner  well demanded augustus one evening later meeting isidore ascending the stairs after a long talk with the stranger in the diningroom with the door shut  oh dont arth me retorted isidore thilly ath thath what he ith  what did he say  what did he thay talked about the jewth what a grand rathe they werehow people mithjudged them all that thort of rot  thaid thome of the motht honorable men he had ever met had been jewth thought i wath one of em  well did you get anything out of him  get anything out of him of courthe not couldnt very well thell the whole rathe ath it were for a couple of hundred poundth after that didnt theem worth it  there were many things fortyeight bloomsbury square came gradually to the conclusion were not worth the doingsnatching at the gravy pouncing out of ones turn upon the vegetables and helping oneself to more than ones fair share manoeuvering for the easychair sitting on the evening paper while pretending not to have seen itall suchlike tiresome bits of business for the little one made out of it really it was not worth the bother grumbling everlastingly at ones food grumbling everlastingly at most things abusing pennycherry behind her back abusing for a change ones fellowboarders squabbling with ones fellowboarders about nothing in particular sneering at ones fellowboarders talking scandal of ones fellowboarders making senseless jokes about ones fellowboarders talking big about oneself nobody believing oneall suchlike vulgarities other boardinghouses might indulge in them fortyeight bloomsbury square had its dignity to consider  the truth is fortyeight bloomsbury square was coming to a very good opinion of itself for the which not bloomsbury square so much as the stranger must be blamed the stranger had arrived at fortyeight bloomsbury square with the preconceived ideawhere obtained from heaven knowsthat its seemingly commonplace meanminded coarsefibred occupants were in reality ladies and gentlemen of the first water and time and observation had apparently only strengthened this absurd idea the natural result was fortyeight bloomsbury square was coming round to the strangers opinion of itself  mrs pennycherry the stranger would persist in regarding as a lady born and bred compelled by circumstances over which she had no control to fill an arduous but honorable position of middleclass societya sort of fostermother to whom were due the thanks and gratitude of her promiscuous family and this view of herself mrs pennycherry now clung to with obstinate conviction there were disadvantages attaching but these mrs pennycherry appeared prepared to suffer cheerfully a lady born and bred cannot charge other ladies and gentlemen for coals and candles they have never burnt a fostermother cannot palm off upon her children new zealand mutton for southdown a mere lodginghousekeeper can play these tricks and pocket the profits but a lady feels she cannot mrs pennycherry felt she no longer could  to the stranger miss kite was a witty and delightful conversationalist of most attractive personality miss kite had one failing it was lack of vanity she was unaware of her own delicate and refined beauty if miss kite could only see herself with his the strangers eyes the modesty that rendered her distrustful of her natural charms would fall from her the stranger was so sure of it miss kite determined to put it to the test one evening an hour before dinner there entered the drawingroom when the stranger only was there and before the gas was lighted a pleasant goodlooking lady somewhat pale with neatlyarranged brown hair who demanded of the stranger if he knew her all her body was trembling and her voice seemed inclined to run away from her and become a sob but when the stranger looking straight into her eyes told her that from the likeness he thought she must be miss kites younger sister but much prettier it became a laugh instead and that evening the goldenhaired miss kite disappeared never to show her highcoloured face again and what perhaps more than all else might have impressed some former habitue of fortyeight bloomsbury square with awe it was that no one in the house made even a passing inquiry concerning her  sir williams cousin the stranger thought an acquisition to any boardinghouse a lady of highclass family there was nothing outward or visible perhaps to tell you that she was of highclass family she herself naturally would not mention the fact yet somehow you felt it unconsciously she set a highclass tone diffused an atmosphere of gentle manners not that the stranger had said this in so many words sir williams cousin gathered that he thought it and felt herself in agreement with him  for mr longcord and his partner as representatives of the best type of business men the stranger had a great respect with what unfortunate results to themselves has been noted the curious thing is that the firm appeared content with the price they had paid for the strangers good opinionhad even it was rumoured acquired a taste for honest mens respectthat in the long run was likely to cost them dear but we all have our pet extravagance  the colonel and mrs devine both suffered a good deal at first from the necessity imposed upon them of learning somewhat late in life new tricks in the privacy of their own apartment they condoled with one another  tomfool nonsense grumbled the colonel you and i starting billing and cooing at our age  what i object to said mrs devine is the feeling that somehow i am being made to do it  the idea that a man and his wife cannot have their little joke together for fear of what some impertinent jackanapes may think of them its damn ridiculous the colonel exploded  even when he isnt there said mrs devine i seem to see him looking at me with those vexing eyes of his really the man quite haunts me  i have met him somewhere mused the colonel ill swear ive met him somewhere i wish to goodness he would go  a hundred things a day the colonel wanted to say to mrs devine a hundred things a day mrs devine would have liked to observe to the colonel but by the time the opportunity occurredwhen nobody else was by to hearall interest in saying them was gone  women will be women was the sentiment with which the colonel consoled himself a man must bear with themmust never forget that he is a gentleman  oh well i suppose theyre all alike laughed mrs devine to herself having arrived at that stage of despair when one seeks refuge in cheerfulness whats the use of putting oneself outit does no good and only upsets one there is a certain satisfaction in feeling you are bearing with heroic resignation the irritating follies of others colonel and mrs devine came to enjoy the luxury of much selfapprobation  but the person seriously annoyed by the strangers bigoted belief in the innate goodness of everyone he came across was the languid handsome miss devine the stranger would have it that miss devine was a noblesouled highminded young woman something midway between a flora macdonald and a joan of arc miss devine on the contrary knew herself to be a sleek luxuryloving animal quite willing to sell herself to the bidder who could offer her the finest clothes the richest foods the most sumptuous surroundings such a bidder was to hand in the person of a retired bookmaker a somewhat greasy old gentleman but exceedingly rich and undoubtedly fond of her  miss devine having made up her mind that the thing had got to be done was anxious that it should be done quickly and here it was that the strangers ridiculous opinion of her not only irritated but inconvenienced her under the very eyes of a personhowever foolishconvinced that you are possessed of all the highest attributes of your sex it is difficult to behave as though actuated by only the basest motives a dozen times had miss devine determined to end the matter by formal acceptance of her elderly admirers large and flabby hand and a dozen timesthe vision intervening of the strangers grave believing eyeshad miss devine refused decided answer the stranger would one day depart indeed he had told her himself he was but a passing traveller when he was gone it would be easier so she thought at the time  one afternoon the stranger entered the room where she was standing by the window looking out upon the bare branches of the trees in bloomsbury square she remembered afterwards it was just such another foggy afternoon as the afternoon of the strangers arrival three months before no one else was in the room the stranger closed the door and came towards her with that curious quickleaping step of his his long coat was tightly buttoned and in his hands he carried his old felt hat and the massive knotted stick that was almost a staff  i have come to say goodbye explained the stranger i am going  i shall not see you again asked the girl  i cannot say replied the stranger but you will think of me  yes she answered with a smile i can promise that  and i shall always remember you promised the stranger and i wish you every joythe joy of love the joy of a happy marriage  the girl winced love and marriage are not always the same thing she said  not always agreed the stranger but in your case they will be one  she looked at him  do you think i have not noticed smiled the stranger a gallant handsome lad and clever you love him and he loves you i could not have gone away without knowing it was well with you  her gaze wandered towards the fading light  ah yes i love him she answered petulantly your eyes can see clearly enough when they want to but one does not live on love in our world i will tell you the man i am going to marry if you care to know she would not meet his eyes she kept her gaze still fixed upon the dingy trees the mist beyond and spoke rapidly and vehemently the man who can give me all my souls desiremoney and the things that money can buy you think me a woman im only a pig he is moist and breathes like a porpoise with cunning in place of a brain and the rest of him mere stomach but he is good enough for me  she hoped this would shock the stranger and that now perhaps he would go it irritated her to hear him only laugh  no he said you will not marry him  who will stop me she cried angrily  your better self  his voice had a strange ring of authority compelling her to turn and look upon his face yes it was true the fancy that from the very first had haunted her she had met him talked to himin silent country roads in crowded city streets where was it and always in talking with him her spirit had been lifted up she had beenwhat he had always thought her  there are those continued the stranger and for the first time she saw that he was of a noble presence that his gentle childlike eyes could also command whose better self lies slain by their own hand and troubles them no more but yours my child you have let grow too strong it will ever be your master you must obey flee from it and it will follow you you cannot escape it insult it and it will chastise you with burning shame with stinging selfreproach from day to day the sternness faded from the beautiful face the tenderness crept back he laid his hand upon the young girls shoulder you will marry your lover he smiled with him you will walk the way of sunlight and of shadow  and the girl looking up into the strong calm face knew that it would be so that the power of resisting her better self had passed away from her for ever  now said the stranger come to the door with me leavetakings are but wasted sadness let me pass out quietly close the door softly behind me  she thought that perhaps he would turn his face again but she saw no more of him than the odd roundness of his back under the tightly buttoned coat before he faded into the gathering fog  then softly she closed the door
