51006231	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    homeward bound   mr hatchards conversation for nearly a week had been confined to fault finding and grunts a system of treatment designed to wean mrs hatchard from her besetting sin of extravagance  on other occasions the treatment had for short periods proved successful but it was quite evident that his wifes constitution was becoming inured to this physic and required a change of treatment  the evidence stared at him from the mantelpiece in the shape of a pair of huge pink vases which had certainly not been there when he left in the morning  he looked at them and breathed heavily  pretty aint they said his wife nodding at them  who gave em to you inquired mr hatchard sternly  his wife shook her head  you dont get vases like that given to you she said slowly  leastways i dont  do you mean to say you bought em demanded her husband  mrs hatchard nodded  after all i said to you about wasting my money persisted mr hatchard in amazed accents  mrs hatchard nodded more brightly than before  there has got to be an end to this said her husband desperately i wont have it  dye hear  i wonthaveit  i bought em with my own money said his wife tossing her head  your money said mr hatchard  to hear you talk anybody ud think youd got three hundred a year instead o thirty  your money ought to be spent in useful things same as what mine is  why should i spend my money keeping you while you waste yours on pink vases and having friends in to tea  mrs hatchards still comely face took on a deeper tinge  keeping me she said sharply  youd better stop before you say anything you might be sorry for alfred  i should have to talk a long time before i said that retorted the other  im not so sure said his wife  im beginning to be tired of it  ive reasoned with you continued mr hatchard ive argued with you and ive pointed out the error of your ways to you and its all no good  oh be quiet and dont talk nonsense said his wife  talking continued mr hatchard as i said before is no good  deeds not words is what is wanted  he rose suddenly from his chair and taking one of the vases from the mantelpiece dashed it to pieces on the fender  example is contagious and two seconds later he was in his chair again softly feeling a rapidly growing bump on his head and gazing goggleeyed at his wife  illustration taking one of the vases from the mantelpiece he dashed it to pieces on the fender  and id do it again said that lady breathlessly if there was another vase  mr hatchard opened his mouth but speech failed him  he got up and left the room without a word and making his way to the scullery turned on the tap and held his head beneath it  a sharp intake of the breath announced that a tributary stream was looking for the bump down the neck of his shirt  he was away a long timeso long that the halfpenitent mrs hatchard was beginning to think of giving first aid to the wounded  then she heard him coming slowly back along the passage  he entered the room drying his wet hair on a handkerchief  ii hope i didnt hurt youmuch  said his wife  mr hatchard drew himself up and regarded her with lofty indignation  you might have killed me he said at last in thrilling tones  then what would you have done  swept up the pieces and said you came home injured and died in my arms said mrs hatchard glibly  i dont want to be unfeeling but youd try the temper of a saint  im sure i wonder i havent done it before  why i married a stingy man i dont know  why i married at all i dont know said her husband in a deep voice  we were both fools said mrs hatchard in a resigned voice thats what it was  however it cant be helped now  some men would go and leave you said mr hatchard  well go said his wife bridling  i dont want you  dont talk nonsense said the other  it aint nonsense said mrs hatchard  if you want to go go i dont want to keep you  i only wish i could said her husband wistfully  theres the door said mrs hatchard pointing  whats to prevent you  and have you going to the magistrate  observed mr hatchard  not me was the reply  or coming up full of complaints to the warehouse  not me said his wife again  it makes my mouth water to think of it said mr hatchard  four years ago i hadnt a care in the world  me neither said mrs hatchard but then i never thought i should marry you  i remember the first time i saw you i had to stuff my handkerchief in my mouth  what for inquired mr hatchard  keep from laughing was the reply  you took care not to let me see you laugh said mr hatchard grimly you were polite enough in them days  i only wish i could have my time over again thats all  you can go as i said before said his wife  id go this minute said mr hatchard but i know what it ud be in three or four days youd be coming and begging me to take you back again  you try me said mrs hatchard with a hard laugh  i can keep myself you leave me the furnituremost of it is mineand i shant worry you again  mind  said mr hatchard raising his hand with great solemnity  if i go i never come back again  ill take care of that said his wife equably  you are far more likely to ask to come back than i am  mr hatchard stood for some time in deep thought and then spurred on by a short contemptuous laugh from his wife went to the small passage and putting on his overcoat and hat stood in the parlor doorway regarding her  ive a good mind to take you at your word he said at last  goodnight said his wife briskly  if you send me your address ill send your things on to you  theres no need for you to call about them  hardly realizing the seriousness of the step mr hatchard closed the front door behind him with a bang and then discovered that it was raining  too proud to return for his umbrella he turned up his coatcollar and thrusting his hands in his pockets walked slowly down the desolate little street  by the time he had walked a dozen yards he began to think that he might as well have waited until the morning before he had walked fifty he was certain of it  he passed the night at a coffeehouse and rose so early in the morning that the proprietor took it as a personal affront and advised him to get his breakfast elsewhere  it was the longest day in mr hatchards experience and securing modest lodgings that evening he overslept himself and was late at the warehouse next morning for the first time in ten years  his personal effects arrived next day but no letter came from his wife and one which he wrote concerning a pair of missing garments received no reply  he wrote again referring to them in laudatory terms and got a brief reply to the effect that they had been exchanged in part payment on a pair of valuable pink vases the pieces of which he could have by paying the carriage  in six weeks mr hatchard changed his lodgings twice  a lack of those home comforts which he had taken as a matter of course during his married life was a source of much tribulation and it was clear that his weekly bills were compiled by a clever writer of fiction  it was his first experience of lodgings and the difficulty of saying unpleasant things to a woman other than his wife was not the least of his troubles  he changed his lodgings for a third time and much surprised at his wifes continued silence sought out a cousin of hers named joe pett and poured his troubles into that gentlemans reluctant ear  if she was to ask me to take her back he concluded im not sure mind you that i wouldnt do so  it does you credit said mr pett  well tata i must be off  and i expect shed be very much obliged to anybody that told her so said mr hatchard clutching at the others sleeve  mr pett gazing into space said that he thought it highly probable  it wants to be done cleverly though said mr hatchard else she might get the idea that i wanted to go back  i spose you know shes moved  said mr pett with the air of a man anxious to change the conversation  eh said the other  number thirtyseven john street said mr pett  told my wife shes going to take in lodgers  calling herself mrs harris after her maiden name  he went off before mr hatchard could recover and the latter at once verified the information in part by walking round to his old house  bits of straw and paper littered the front garden the blinds were down and a bill was pasted on the front parlor window  aghast at such determination he walked back to his lodgings in gloomy thought  on saturday afternoon he walked round to john street and from the corner of his eye as he passed stole a glance at no 37  he recognized the curtains at once and seeing that there was nobody in the room leaned over the palings and peered at a card that stood on the windowsash                         furnished apartments                        for single young man                         board if desired  he walked away whistling and after going a little way turned and passed it again  he passed in all four times and then with an odd grin lurking at the corners of his mouth strode up to the front door and knocked loudly  he heard somebody moving about inside and more with the idea of keeping his courage up than anything else gave another heavy knock at the door  it was thrown open hastily and the astonished face of his wife appeared before him  what do you want she inquired sharply  mr hatchard raised his hat  goodafternoon maam he said politely  what do you want repeated his wife  i called said mr hatchard clearing his throati called about the bill in the window  illustration i called about the bill in the window  mrs hatchard clutched at the doorpost  well  she gasped  id like to see the rooms said the other  but you aint a single young man said his wife recovering  im as good as single said mr hatchard  i should say better  you aint young objected mrs hatchard  im three years younger than what you are said mr hatchard dispassionately  his wifes lips tightened and her hand closed on the door mr hatchard put his foot in  if you dont want lodgers why do you put a bill up he inquired  i dont take the first that comes said his wife  ill pay a week in advance said mr hatchard putting his hand in his pocket  of course if youre afraid of having me hereafraid o giving way to tenderness i mean  afraid  choked mrs hatchard  tenderness  ii  just a matter o business continued her husband thats my way of looking at itthats a mans way  i spose women are different  they cant  come in said mrs hatchard breathing hard mr hatchard obeyed and clapping a hand over his mouth ascended the stairs behind her  at the top she threw open the door of a tiny bedroom and stood aside for him to enter  mr hatchard sniffed critically  smells rather stuffy he said at last  you neednt have it said his wife abruptly  theres plenty of other fish in the sea  yes and i expect theyd stay there if they saw this room said the other  dont think i want you to have it because i dont said mrs hatchard making a preliminary movement to showing him downstairs  they might suit me said mr hatchard musingly as he peeped in at the sittingroom door  i shouldnt be at home much  im a man thats fond of spending his evenings out  mrs hatchard checking a retort eyed him grimly  ive seen worse he said slowly but then ive seen a good many  how much are you asking  seven shillings a week replied his wife  with breakfast tea and supper a pound a week  mr hatchard nearly whistled but checked himself just in time  ill give it a trial he said with an air of unbearable patronage  mrs hatchard hesitated  if you come here you quite understand its on a business footing she said  o course said the other with affected surprise  what do you think i want it on  you come here as a stranger and i look after you as a stranger continued his wife  certainly said the other  i shall be made more comfortable that way im sure  but of course if youre afraid as i said before of giving way to tender  tender fiddlesticks interrupted his wife flushing and eying him angrily  ill come in and bring my things at nine oclock tonight said mr hatchard  id like the windows open and the rooms aired a bit  and what about the sheets  what about them  inquired his wife  dont put me in damp sheets thats all said mr hatchard  one place i was at  he broke off suddenly  well  said his wife quickly  was very particular about them said mr hatchard recovering  well goodafternoon to you maam  i want three weeks in advance said his wife  three exclaimed the other  three weeks in advance  why  those are my terms said mrs hatchard  take em or leave em praps it would be better if you left em  mr hatchard looked thoughtful and then with obvious reluctance took his purse from one pocket and some silver from another and made up the required sum  and what if im not comfortable here  he inquired as his wife hastily pocketed the money  itll be your own fault was the reply  mr hatchard looked dubious and in a thoughtful fashion walked downstairs and let himself out  he began to think that the joke was of a more complicated nature than he had expected and it was not without forebodings that he came back at nine oclock that night accompanied by a boy with his baggage  his gloom disappeared the moment the door opened  the air inside was warm and comfortable and pervaded by an appetizing smell of cooked meats  upstairs a small bright fire and a neatly laid suppertable awaited his arrival  he sank into an easychair and rubbed his hands  then his gaze fell on a small bell on the table and opening the door he rang for supper  yes sir said mrs hatchard entering the room  supper please said the new lodger with dignity  mrs hatchard looked bewildered  well there it is she said indicating the table  you dont want me to feed you do you  the lodger eyed the small dry piece of cheese the bread and butter and his face fell  ii thought i smelled something cooking he said at last  illustration ii thought i smelled something cooking he said  oh that was my supper said mrs hatchard with a smile  iim very hungry said mr hatchard trying to keep his temper  its the cold weather i expect said mrs hatchard thoughtfully it does affect some people that way i know  please ring if you want anything  she left the room humming blithely and mr hatchard after sitting for some time in silent consternation got up and ate his frugal meal  the fact that the waterjug held three pints and was filled to the brim gave him no satisfaction  he was still hungry when he arose next morning and with curiosity tempered by uneasiness waited for his breakfast  mrs hatchard came in at last and after polite inquiries as to how he had slept proceeded to lay breakfast  a fresh loaf and a large teapot appeared and the smell of frizzling bacon ascended from below  then mrs hatchard came in again and smiling benevolently placed an egg before him and withdrew two minutes later he rang the bell  you can clear away he said as mrs hatchard entered the room  what no breakfast  she said holding up her hands  well ive heard of you single young men but i never thought  the teas cold and as black as ink growled the indignant lodger and the egg isnt eatable  im afraid youre a bit of a faultfinder said mrs hatchard shaking her head at him  im sure i try my best to please  i dont mind what i do but if youre not satisfied youd better go  look here emily began her husband  dont you emily me  said mrs hatchard quickly  the idea  a lodger too  you know the arrangement  youd better go i think if you cant behave yourself  i wont go till my three weeks are up said mr hatchard doggedly so you may as well behave yourself  i cant pamper you for a pound a week said mrs hatchard walking to the door  if you want pampering you had better go  a week passed and the additional expense caused by getting most of his meals out began to affect mr hatchards health  his wife on the contrary was in excellent spirits and coming in one day explained the absence of the easychair by stating that it was wanted for a new lodger  hes taken my other two rooms she said smilingthe little back parlor and the front bedroomim full up now  wouldnt he like my table too  inquired mr hatchard with bitter sarcasm  his wife said that she would inquire and brought back word next day that mr sadler the new lodger would like it  it disappeared during mr hatchards enforced absence at business and a small bamboo table weak in the joints did duty in its stead  the new lodger a man of middle age with a ready tongue was a success from the first and it was only too evident that mrs hatchard was trying her best to please him  mr hatchard supping on bread and cheese more than once left that wholesome meal to lean over the balusters and smell the hot meats going into mr sadler  youre spoiling him he said to mrs hatchard after the new lodger had been there a week  mark my wordshell get above himself  thats my lookout said his wife briefly  dont come to me if you get into trouble thats all said the other  mrs hatchard laughed derisively  you dont like him thats what it is she remarked  he asked me yesterday whether he had offended you in any way  oh  he did did he snarled mr hatchard  let him keep himself to himself and mind his own business  he said he thinks you have got a bad temper continued his wife  he thinks perhaps its indigestion caused by eating cheese for supper always  mr hatchard affected not to hear and lighting his pipe listened fer some time to the hum of conversation between his wife and mr sadler below  with an expression of resignation on his face that was almost saintly he knocked out his pipe at last and went to bed  half an hour passed and he was still awake  his wifes voice had ceased but the gruff tones of mr sadler were still audible  then he sat up in bed and listened as a faint cry of alarm and the sound of somebody rushing upstairs fell on his ears  the next moment the door of his room burst open and a wild figure stumbling in the darkness rushed over to the bed and clasped him in its arms  help gasped his wiles voice  oh alfred  alfred  maam  said mr hatchard in a prim voice as he struggled in vain to free himself  im sosofrfrightened  sobbed mrs hatchard  thats no reason for coming into a lodgers room and throwing your arms round his neck said her husband severely  dont be stustustupid gasped mrs hatchard  hehes sitting downstairs in my room with a paper cap on his head and a fireshovel in his hand and hehe says hes thethe emperor of china  he  who inquired her husband  mr sadsadler replied mrs hatchard almost strangling him  he made me kneel in front o him and keep touching the floor with my head  the chairbedstead shook in sympathy with mr hatchards husbandly emotion  well its nothing to do with me he said at last  hes mad said his wife in a tense whisper stark staring mad  he says im his favorite wife and he made me stroke his forehead  the bed shook again  i dont see that i have any right to interfere said mr hatchard after he had quieted the bedstead  hes your lodger  youre my husband said mrs hatchard  ho said mr hatchard youve remembered that have you  yes alfred said his wife  and are you sorry for all your bad behavior demanded mr hatchard  mrs hatchard hesitated  then a clatter of fireirons downstairs moved her to speech  yeyes she sobbed  and you want me to take you back  queried the generous mr hatchard  yeyeyes said his wife  mr hatchard got out of bed and striking a match lit the candle and taking his overcoat from a peg behind the door put it on and marched downstairs  mrs hatchard still trembling followed behind  whats all this  he demanded throwing the door open with a flourish  mr sadler still holding the fireshovel sceptrefashion and still with the paper cap on his head opened his mouth to reply  then as he saw the unkempt figure of mr hatchard with the scared face of mrs hatchard peeping over his shoulder his face grew red his eyes watered and his cheeks swelled  kkkkch  kkch he said explosively  talk english not chinese said mr hatchard sternly  illustration kkkkch  kkch he said explosively  mr sadler threw down the fireshovel and to mr hatchards great annoyance clapped his open hand over his mouth and rocked with merriment  shshsheshe he spluttered  thatll do said mr hatchard hastily with a warning frown  kowtowed to me gurgled mr sadler  you ought to have seen it alf i shall never get over itnever  itsnono good winwinking at me i cant help myself  he put his handkerchief to his eyes and leaned back exhausted  when he removed it he found himself alone and everything still but for a murmur of voices overhead  anon steps sounded on the stairs and mr hatchard grave of face entered the room  outside he said briefly  what said the astounded mr sadler  why its eleven oclock  i cant help it if its twelve oclock was the reply  you shouldnt play the fool and spoil things by laughing  now are you going or have i got to put you out  he crossed the room and putting his hand on the shoulder of the protesting mr sadler pushed him into the passage and taking his coat from the peg held it up for him  mr sadler abandoning himself to his fate got into it slowly and indulged in a few remarks on the subject of ingratitude  i cant help it said his friend in a low voice  ive had to swear ive never seen you before  does she believe you said the staring mr sadler shivering at the open door  no said mr hatchard slowly but she pretends to
