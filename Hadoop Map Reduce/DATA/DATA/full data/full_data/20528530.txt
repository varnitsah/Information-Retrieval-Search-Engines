20528530	the golden lion of granpere by anthony trollope     chapter i  up among the vosges mountains in lorraine but just outside the old halfgerman province of alsace about thirty miles distant from the new and thoroughly french baths of plombieres there lies the village of granpere  whatever may be said or thought here in england of the late imperial rule in france it must at any rate be admitted that good roads were made under the empire  alsace which twenty years ago seems to have been somewhat behindhand in this respect received her full share of napoleons attention and granpere is now placed on an excellent road which runs from the town of remiremont on one line of railway to colmar on another  the inhabitants of the alsatian ballon hills and the open valleys among them seem to think that the civilisation of great cities has been brought near enough to them as there is already a diligence running daily from granpere to remiremontand at remiremont you are on the railway and of course in the middle of everything  and indeed an observant traveller will be led to think that a great deal of what may most truly be called civilisation has found its way in among the ballons whether it travelled thither by the newfangled railways and imperial routes or found its passage along the valley streams before imperial favours had been showered upon the district  we are told that when pastor oberlin was appointed to his cure as protestant clergyman in the ban de la roche a little more than one hundred years agothat was in 1767this region was densely dark and far behind in the worlds running as regards all progress  the people were ignorant poor halfstarved almost savage destitute of communication and unable to produce from their own soil enough food for their own sustenance  of manufacturing enterprise they understood nothing and were only just far enough advanced in knowledge for the protestants to hate the catholics and the catholics to hate the protestants  then came that wonderful clergyman pastor oberlinhe was indeed a wonderful clergymanand made a great change  since that there have been the two empires and alsace has looked up in the world  whether the thanks of the people are more honestly due to oberlin or to the late emperor the author of this little story will not pretend to say but he will venture to express his opinion that at present the rural alsatians are a happy prosperous people with the burden on their shoulders of but few paupers and fewer gentlemenapparently a contented people not ambitious given but little to politics protestants and catholics mingled without hatred or fanaticism educated though not learned industrious though not energetic quiet and peaceful making linen and cheese growing potatoes importing corn coming into the world marrying begetting children and dying in the wholesome homespun fashion which is so sweet to us in that mood of philosophy which teaches us to love the country and to despise the town  whether it be better for a people to achieve an even level of prosperity which is shared by all but which makes none eminent or to encounter those rough ambitious competitive strengths which produce both palaces and poorhouses shall not be matter of argument here but the teller of this story is disposed to think that the chance traveller as long as he tarries at granpere will insensibly and perhaps unconsciously become an advocate of the former doctrine he will be struck by the comfort which he sees around him and for a while will dispense with wealth luxury scholarships and fashion  whether the inhabitants of these hills and valleys will advance to farther progress now that they are again to become german is another question which the writer will not attempt to answer here  granpere in itself is a very pleasing village  though the amount of population and number of houses do not suffice to make it more than a village it covers so large a space of ground as almost to give it a claim to town honours  it is perhaps a full mile in length and though it has but one street there are buildings standing here and there back from the line which make it seem to stretch beyond the narrow confines of a single thoroughfare  in most french villages some of the houses are high and spacious but here they seem almost all to be so  and many of them have been constructed after that independent fashion which always gives to a house in a street a character and importance of its own  they do not stand in a simple line each supported by the strength of its neighbour but occupy their own ground facing this way or that as each may please presenting here a corner to the main street and there an end there are little gardens and big stables and commodious barns and periodical paint with annual whitewash is not wanting  the unstinted slates shine copiously under the sun and over almost every other door there is a large lettered board which indicates that the resident within is a dealer in the linen which is produced throughout the country  all these things together give to granpere an air of prosperity and comfort which is not at all checked by the fact that there is in the place no mansion which we englishmen would call the gentlemans house nothing approaching to the ascendancy of a parish squire no barons castle no manorial hallnot even a chateau to overshadow the modest roofs of the dealers in the linen of the vosges  and the scenery round granpere is very pleasant though the neighbouring hills never rise to the magnificence of mountains or produce that grandeur which tourists desire when they travel in search of the beauties of nature  it is a spot to love if you know it well rather than to visit with hopes raised high and to leave with vivid impressions  there is water in abundance a pretty lake lying at the feet of sloping hills rivulets running down from the high upper lands and turning many a modest wheel in their course a waterfall or two here and there and a socalled mountain summit within an easy distance from whence the sun may be seen to rise among the swiss mountainsand distant perhaps three miles from the village the main river which runs down the valley makes for itself a wild ravine just where the bridge on the new road to munster crosses the water and helps to excuse the people of granpere for claiming for themselves a great object of natural attraction  the bridge and the river and the ravine are very pretty and perhaps justify all that the villagers say of them when they sing to travellers the praises of their country  whether it be the sale of linen that has produced the large inn at granpere or the delicious air of the place or the ravine and the bridge matters little to our story but the fact of the inn matters very much  there it isa roomy commodious building not easily intelligible to a stranger with its widely distributed parts standing like an inverted v with its open side towards the main road  on the groundfloor on one side are the large stables and coachhouse with a billiardroom and cafe over them and a long balcony which runs round the building and on the other side there are kitchens and drinkingrooms and over these the chamber for meals and the bedrooms  all large airy and clean though perhaps not excellently well finished in their construction and furnished with but little pretence to french luxury  and behind the inn there are gardens by no means trim and a dusty summerhouse which serves however for the smoking of a cigar and there is generally space and plenty and goodwill  either the linen or the air or the ravine or as is more probable the three combined have produced a business so that the landlord of the lion dor at granpere is a thriving man  the reader shall at once be introduced to the landlord and informed at the same time that in so far as he may be interested in this story he will have to take up his abode at the lion dor till it be concluded not as a guest staying loosely at his inn but as one who is concerned with all the innermost affairs of the household  he will not simply eat his plate of soup and drink his glass of wine and pass on knowing and caring more for the servant than for the servants master but he must content himself to sit at the landlords table to converse very frequently with the landlords wife to become very intimate with the landlords sonwhether on loving or on unloving terms shall be left entirely to himselfand to throw himself with the sympathy of old friendship into all the troubles and all the joys of the landlords niece  if the reader be one who cannot take such a journey and pass a month or two without the society of persons whom he would define as ladies and gentlemen he had better be warned at once and move on not setting foot within the lion dor at granpere  michel voss the landlord in person was at this time a tall stout active and very handsome man about fifty years of age  as his son was already twentyfiveand was known to be so throughout the communepeople were sure that michel voss was fifty or thereabouts but there was very little in his appearance to indicate so many years  he was fat and burly to be sure but then he was not fat to lethargy or burly with any sign of slowness  there was still the spring of youth in his footstep and when there was some weight to be lifted some heavy timber to be thrust here or there some huge lumbering vehicle to be hoisted in or out there was no arm about the place so strong as that of the master  his short dark curly hairthat was always kept clipped round his headwas beginning to show a tinge of gray but the huge moustache on his upper lip was still of a thorough brown as was also the small morsel of beard which he wore upon his chin  he had bright sharp brown eyes a nose slightly beaked and a large mouth  he was on the whole a man of good temper just withal and one who loved those who belonged to him but he chose to be master in his own house and was apt to think that his superior years enabled him to know what younger people wanted better than they would know themselves  he was loved in his house and respected in his village but there was something in the beak of his nose and the brightness of his eye which was apt to make those around him afraid of him  and indeed michel voss could lose his temper and become an angry man  our landlord had been twice married  by his first wife he had now living a single son george voss who at the time of our tale had already reached his twentyfifth year  george however did not at this time live under his fathers roof having taken service for a time with the landlady of another inn at colmar  george voss was known to be a clever young man many in those parts declared that he was much more so than his father and when he became clerk at the poste in colmar and after a year or two had taken into his hands almost the entire management of that houseso that people began to say that oldfashioned and wretched as it was money might still be made therepeople began to say also that michel voss had been wrong to allow his son to leave granpere  but in truth there had been a few words between the father and the son and the two were so like each other that the father found it difficult to rule and the son found it difficult to be ruled  george voss was very like his father with this difference as he was often told by the old folk about granpere that he would never fill his fathers shoes  he was a smaller man less tall by a couple of inches less broad in proportion across the shoulders whose arm would never be so strong whose leg would never grace a tight stocking with so full a development  but he had the same eye bright and brown and very quick the same mouth the same aquiline nose the same broad forehead and wellshaped chin and the same look in his face which made men know as by instinct that he would sooner command than obey  so there had come to be a few words and george voss had gone away to the house of a cousin of his mothers and had taken to commanding there  not that there had been any quarrel between the father and the son nor indeed that george was aware that he had been in the least disobedient to his parent  there was no recognised ambition for rule in the breasts of either of them  it was simply this that their tempers were alike and when on an occasion michel told his son that he would not allow a certain piece of folly which the son was as he thought likely to commit george declared that he would soon set that matter right by leaving granpere  accordingly he did leave granpere and became the right hand and indeed the head and backbone and best leg of his old cousin madame faragon of the poste at colmar  now the matter on which these few words occurred was a question of lovewhether george voss should fall in love with and marry his stepmothers niece marie bromar  but before anything farther can be said of these few words madame voss and her niece must be introduced to the reader  madame voss was nearly twenty years younger than her husband and had now been a wife some five or six years  she had been brought from epinal where she had lived with a married sister a widow much older than herselfin parting from whom on her marriage there had been much tribulation  should anything happen to marie she had said to michel voss before she gave him her troth you will let minnie bromar come to me  michel voss who was then hotly in love with his hopedfor bridehotly in love in spite of his fourandforty yearsgave the required promise  the said something which had been suspected had happened  madame bromar had died and minnie bromar her daughteror marie as she was always afterwards calledhad at once been taken into the house at granpere  michel never thought twice about it when he was reminded of his promise if i hadnt promised at all she should come the same he said the house is big enough for a dozen more yet  in saying this he perhaps alluded to a little baby that then lay in a cradle in his wifes room by means of which at that time madame voss was able to make her big husband do pretty nearly anything that she pleased  so marie bromar then just fifteen years of age was brought over from epinal to granpere and the house certainly was not felt to be too small because she was there  marie soon learned the ways and wishes of her burly softhearted uncle would fill his pipe for him and hand him his soup and bring his slippers and put her soft arm round his neck and became a favourite  she was only a child when she came and michel thought it was very pleasant but in five years time she was a woman and michel was forced to reflect that it would not be well that there should be another marriage and another family in the house while he was so young himselfthere was at this time a third baby in the cradleand then marie bromar had not a franc of dot  marie was the sweetest eldest daughter in the world but he could not think it right that his son should marry a wife before he had done a stroke for himself in the world prudence made it absolutely necessary that he should say a word to his son  madame voss was certainly nearly twenty years younger than her husband and yet the pair did not look to be illsorted  michel was so handsome strong and hale and madame voss though she was a comely womanthough when she was brought home a bride to granpere the neighbours had all declared that she was very handsomecarried with her a look of more years than she really possessed  she had borne many of a womans cares and had known much of womans sorrows before she had become wife to michel voss and then when the babes came and she had settled down as mistress of that large household and taught herself to regard george voss and marie bromar almost as her own children all idea that she was much younger than her husband departed from her  she was a woman who desired to excel her husband in nothingif only she might be considered to be in some things his equal  there was no feeling in the village that michel voss had brought home a young wife and had made a fool of himself he was a man entitled to have a wife much younger than himself madame voss in those days always wore a white cap and a dark stuff gown which was changed on sundays for one of black silk and brown mittens on her hands and she went about the house in soft carpet shoes  she was a conscientious useful but not an enterprising woman loving her husband much and fearing him somewhat liking to have her own way in certain small matters but willing to be led in other things so long as those were surrendered to her careful with her children the care of whom seemed to deprive her of the power of caring for the business of the inn kind to her niece goodhumoured in her house and satisfied with the world at large as long as she might always be allowed to entertain m le cure at dinner on sundays  michel voss protestant though he was had not the slightest objection to giving m le cure his sunday dinner on condition that m le cure on these occasions would confine his conversation to open subjects  m le cure was quite willing to eat his dinner and give no offence  a word too must be said of marie bromar before we begin our story marie bromar is the heroine of this little tale and the reader must be made to have some idea of her as she would have appeared before him had he seen her standing near her uncle in the long room upstairs of the hotel at granpere  marie had been fifteen when she was brought from epinal to granpere and had then been a child but she had now reached her twentieth birthday and was a woman  she was not above the middle height and might seem to be less indeed in that house because her aunt and her uncle were tall but she was straight well made and very active  she was strong and liked to use her strength and was very keen about all the work of the house during the five years of her residence at granpere she had thoroughly learned the mysteries of her uncles trade  she knew good wine from bad by the perfume she knew whether bread was the full weight by the touch with a glance of her eye she could tell whether the cheese and butter were what they ought to be in a matter of poultry no woman in all the commune could take her in she was great in judging eggs knew well the quality of linen and was even able to calculate how long the hay should last and what should be the consumption of corn in the stables  michel voss was well aware before marie had been a year beneath his roof that she well earned the morsel she ate and the drop she drank and when she had been there five years he was ready to swear that she was the cleverest girl in lorraine or alsace  and she was very pretty with rich brown hair that would not allow itself to be brushed out of its crisp halfcurls in front and which she always wore cut short behind curling round her straight wellformed neck  her eyes were gray with a strong shade indeed of green but were very bright and pleasant full of intelligence telling stories by their glances of her whole inward disposition of her activity quickness and desire to have a hand in everything that was being done  her father jean bromar had come from the same stock with michel voss and she too had something of that aquiline nose which gave to the innkeeper and his son the look which made men dislike to contradict them  her mouth was large but her teeth were very white and perfect and her smile was the sweetest thing that ever was seen  marie bromar was a pretty girl and george voss had he lived so near to her and not have fallen in love with her must have been cold indeed  at the end of these five years marie had become a woman and was known by all around her to be a woman much stronger both in person and in purpose than her aunt but she maintained almost unconsciously many of the ways in the house which she had assumed when she first entered it  then she had always been on foot to be everybodys messengerand so she was now  when her uncle and aunt were at their meals she was always up and aboutattending them attending the public guests attending the whole house  and it seemed as though she herself never sat down to eat or drink indeed it was rare enough to find her seated at all  she would have a cup of coffee standing up at the little desk near the public window when she kept her books or would take a morsel of meat as she helped to remove the dishes  she would stand sometimes for a minute leaning on the back of her uncles chair as he sat at his supper and would say when he bade her to take her chair and eat with them that she preferred picking and stealing  in all things she worshipped her uncle observing his movements caring for his wants and carrying out his plans  she did not worship her aunt but she so served madame voss that had she been withdrawn from the household madame voss would have found herself altogether unable to provide for its wants  thus marie bromar had become the guardian angel of the lion dor at granpere  there must be a word or two more said of the difference between george voss and his father which had ended in sending george to colmar a word or two about that and a word also of what occurred between george and marie  then we shall be able to commence our story without farther reference to things past  as michel voss was a just affectionate and intelligent man he would not probably have objected to a marriage between the two young people had the proposition for such a marriage been first submitted to him with a proper amount of attention to his judgment and controlling power but the idea was introduced to him in a manner which taught him to think that there was to be a clandestine love affair  to him george was still a boy and marie not much more than a child andwithout much thinkinghe felt that the thing was improper  i wont have it george he had said  wont have what father  never mind  you know  if you cant get over it in any other way you had better go away  you must do something for yourself before you can think of marrying  i am not thinking of marrying  then what were you thinking of when i saw you with marie  i wont have it for her sake and i wont have it for mine and i wont have it for your own  you had better go away for a while  ill go away tomorrow if you wish it father  michel had turned away not saying another word and on the following day george did go away hardly waiting an hour to set in order his part of his fathers business  for it must be known that george had not been an idler in his fathers establishment  there was a trade of woodcutting upon the mountainside with a sawmill turned by water beneath over which george had presided almost since he had left the school of the commune  when his father told him that he was bound to do something before he got married he could not have intended to accuse him of having been hitherto idle  of the woodcutting and the sawmill george knew as much as marie did of the poultry and the linen  michel was wrong probably in his attempt to separate them the house was large enough or if not there was still room for another house to be built in granpere  they would have done well as man and wife  but then the head of a household naturally objects to seeing the boys and girls belonging to him making love under his nose without any reference to his opinion  things were not made so easy for me he says to himself and feels it to be a sort of duty to take care that the course of love shall not run altogether smooth  george no doubt was too abrupt with his father or perhaps it might be the case that he was not sorry to take an opportunity of leaving for a while granpere and marie bromar  it might be well to see the world and though marie bromar was bright and pretty it might be that there were others abroad brighter and prettier  his father had spoken to him on one fine september afternoon and within an hour george was with the men who were stripping bark from the great pine logs up on the side of the mountain  with them and with two or three others who were engaged at the sawmills he remained till the night was dark  then he came down and told something of his intentions to his stepmother  he was going to colmar on the morrow with a horse and small cart and would take with him what clothes he had ready  he did not speak to marie that night but he said something to his father about the timber and the mill  gaspar muntz the head woodsman knew he said all about the business  gaspar could carry on the work till it would suit michel voss himself to see how things were going on  michel voss was sore and angry but he said nothing  he sent to his son a couple of hundred francs by his wife but said no word of explanation even to her  on the following morning george was off without seeing his father  but marie was up to give him his breakfast  what is the meaning of this george she said  father says that i shall be better away from thisso im going away  and why will you be better away  to this george made no answer it will be terrible if you quarrel with your father  nothing can be so bad as that  we have not quarrelled  that is to say i have not quarrelled with him  if he quarrels with me i cannot help it  it must be helped said marie as she placed before him a mess of eggs which she had cooked for him with her own hands  i would sooner die than see anything wrong between you two  then there was a pause  is it about me george she asked boldly  father thinks that i love youso i do  marie paused for a few minutes before she said anything farther she was standing very near to george who was eating his breakfast heartily in spite of the interesting nature of the conversation  as she filled his cup a second time she spoke again  i will never do anything george if i can help it to displease my uncle  but why should it displease him  he wants to have his own way in everything  of course he does  he has told me to goand ill go  ive worked for him as no other man would work and have never said a word about a share in the businessand never would  is it not all for yourself george  and why shouldnt you and i be married if we like it  i will never like it said she solemnly if uncle dislikes it  very well said george  there is the horse ready and now im off  so he went starting just as the day was dawning and no one saw him on that morning except marie bromar  as soon as he was gone she went up to her little room and sat herself down on her bedside she knew that she loved him and had been told that she was beloved she knew that she could not lose him without suffering terribly but now she almost feared that it would be necessary that she should lose him  his manner had not been tender to her  he had indeed said that he loved her but there had been nothing of the tenderness of love in his mode of saying soand then he had said no word of persistency in the teeth of his fathers objection  she had declaredthoroughly purposing that her declaration should be truethat she would never become his wife in opposition to her uncles wishes but he had he been in earnest might have said something of his readiness to attempt at least to overcome his fathers objection  but he had said not a word and marie as she sat upon her bed made up her mind that it must be all over  but she made up her mind also that she would entertain no feeling of anger against her uncle  she owed him everything so she thoughtmaking no account as george had done of labour given in return  she was only a girl and what was her labour  for a while she resolved that she would give a spoken assurance to her uncle that he need fear nothing from her  it was natural enough to her that her uncle should desire a better marriage for his son  but after a while she reflected that any speech from her on such a subject would be difficult and that it would be better that she should hold her tongue  so she held her tongue and thought of george and sufferedbut still was merry at least in manner when her uncle spoke to her and priced the poultry and counted the linen and made out the visitors bills as though nothing evil had come upon her  she was a gallant girl and michel voss though he could not speak of it understood her gallantry and made notes of it on the notebook of his heart  in the mean time george voss was thriving at colmaras the vosses did thrive wherever they settled themselves  but he sent no word to his fathernor did his father send word to himthough they were not more than ten leagues apart  once madame voss went over to see him and brought back word of his welldoing    chapter ii  exactly at eight oclock every evening a loud bell was sounded in the hotel of the lion dor at granpere and all within the house sat down together to supper  the supper was spread on a long table in the saloon upstairs and the room was lighted with camphine lampsfor as yet gas had not found its way to granpere  at this meal assembled not only the guests in the house and the members of the family of the landlordbut also many persons living in the village whom it suited to take at a certain price per month the chief meal of the day at the house of the innkeeper instead of eating in their own houses a more costly a less dainty and probably a lonely supper  therefore when the bell was heard there came together some dozen residents of granpere mostly young men engaged in the linen trade from their different lodgings and each took his accustomed seat down the sides of the long board at which tied in a knot was placed his own napkin  at the top of the table was the place of madame voss which she never failed to fill exactly three minutes after the bell had been rung  at her right hand was the chair of the master of the housenever occupied by any one elsebut it would often happen that some business would keep him away  since george had left him he had taken the timber into his own hands and was accustomed to think and sometimes to say that the necessity was cruel on him  below his chair and on the other side of madame voss there would generally be two or three places kept for guests who might be specially looked upon as the intimate friends of the mistress of the house and at the farther end of the table close to the window was the space allotted to travellers  here the napkins were not tied in knots but were always clean  and though the little plates of radishes cakes and dried fruits were continued from one of the tables to the other the longnecked thin bottles of common wine came to an end before they reached the strangers portion of the board for it had been found that strangers would take at that hour either tea or a better kind of wine than that which michel voss gave to his accustomed guests without any special charge  when however the stranger should please to take the common wine he was by no means thereby prejudiced in the eyes of madame voss or her husband  michel voss liked a profit but he liked the habits of his country almost as well  one evening in september about twelve months after the departure of george madame voss took her seat at the table and the young men of the place who had been waiting round the door of the hotel for a few minutes followed her into the room  and there was m goudin the cure with another young clergyman his friend  on sundays the cure always dined at the hotel at halfpast twelve oclock as the friend of the family but for his supper he paid as did the other guests i rather fancy that on week days he had no particular dinner and indeed there was no such formal meal given in the house of michel voss on week days  there was something put on the table about noon in the little room between the kitchen and the public window but except on sundays it could hardly be called a dinner  on sundays a real dinner was served in the room upstairs with soup and removes and entrees and the roti all in the right placewhich showed that they knew what a dinner was at the lion dorbut throughout the week supper was the meal of the day  after m goudin on this occasion there came two maiden ladies from epinal who were lodging at granpere for change of air  they seated themselves near to madame voss but still leaving a place or two vacant  and presently at the bottom of the table there came an englishman and his wife who were travelling through the country and so the table was made up  a lad of about fifteen who was known in granpere as the waiter at the lion dor looked after the two strangers and the young men and marie bromar who herself had arranged the board stood at the top of the room by a second table and dispensed the soup  it was pleasant to watch her eyes as she marked the moment when the dispensing should begin and counted her guests thoughtful as to the sufficiency of the dishes to come and noticed that edmond greisse had sat down with such dirty hands that she must bid her uncle to warn the lad and observed that the more elderly of the two ladies from epinal had bread too hard to suit herwhich should be changed as soon as the soup had been dispensed  she looked round and even while dispensing saw everything  it was suggested in the last chapter that another house might have been built in granpere and that george voss might have gone there taking marie as his bride but the lion dor would sorely have missed those quick and careful eyes  then when that dispensing of the soup was concluded michel entered the room bringing with him a young man  the young man had evidently been expected for when he took the place close at the left hand of madame voss she simply bowed to him saying some word of courtesy as michel took his place on the other side  then marie dispensed two more portions of soup and leaving one on the farther table for the boy to serve though she could well have brought the two waited herself upon her uncle  and is urmand to have no soup said michel voss as he took his niece lovingly by the hand  peter is bringing it said marie  and in a moment or two peter the waiter did bring the young man his soup  and will not mademoiselle marie sit down with us said the young man  if you can make her you have more influence than i said michel marie never sits and never eats and never drinks  she was standing now close behind her uncle with both her hands upon his head and she would often stand so after the supper was commenced only moving to attend upon him or to supplement the services of peter and the maidservant when she perceived that they were becoming for a time inadequate to their duties  she answered her uncle now by gently pulling his ears but she said nothing  sit down with us marie to oblige me said madame voss  i had rather not aunt  it is foolish to sit at supper and not eat  i have taken my supper already  then she moved away and hovered round the two strangers at the end of the room  after supper michel voss and the young manadrian urmand by namelit their cigars and seated themselves on a bench outside the front door  have you never said a word to her said michel  wella word yes  but you have not asked her you know what i meanasked her whether she could love you  wellyes  i have said as much as that but i have never got an answer  and when i did ask her she merely left me  she is not much given to talking  she will not make the worse wife my friend because she is not much given to such talking as that  when she is out with me on a sunday afternoon she has chat enough  by st james shell talk for two hours without stopping when im so out of breath with the hill that i havent a word  i dont doubt she can talk  that she can and manage a house better than any girl i ever saw you ask her aunt  i know what her aunt thinks of her  madame voss says that neither you nor she can afford to part with her  michel voss was silent for a moment  it was dusk and no one could see him as he brushed a tear from each eye with the back of his hand  ill tell you what urmandit will break my heart to lose her  do you see how she comes to me and comforts me  but if it broke my heart and broke the house too i would not keep her here it isnt fit  if you like her and she can like you it will be a good match for her  you have my leave to ask her  she brought nothing here but she has been a good girl a very good girl and she will not leave the house emptyhanded  adrian urmand was a linenbuyer from basle and was known to have a good share in a good business  he was a handsome young man too though rather small and perhaps a little too apt to wear rings on his fingers and to show jewelry on his shirtfront and about his waistcoat  so at least said some of the young people of granpere where rings and gold studs are not so common as they are at basle but he was one who understood his business and did not neglect it he had money too and was therefore such a young man that michel voss felt that he might give his niece to him without danger if he and she could manage to like each other sufficiently  as to urmands liking there was no doubt  urmand was ready enough  i will see if she will speak to me just now said urmand after a pause  shall her aunt try it or shall i do it said michel  but adrian urmand thought that part of the pleasure of love lay in the making of it himself  so he declined the innkeepers offer at any rate for the present occasion  perhaps said he madame voss will say a word for me after i have spoken for myself  so let it be said the landlord  and then they finished their cigars in silence  it was in vain that adrian urmand tried that night to obtain audience from marie  marie as though she well knew what was wanted of her and was determined to thwart her lover would not allow herself to be found alone for a moment  when adrian presented himself at the window of her little bar he found that peter was with her and she managed to keep peter with her till adrian was gone  and again when he hoped to find her alone for a few moments after the work of the day was over in the small parlour where she was accustomed to sit for some half hour before she would go up to her room he was again disappointed  she was already upstairs with her aunt and the children and all michel vosss good nature in keeping out of the way was of no avail  but urmand was determined not to be beaten  he intended to return to basle on the next day but one and desired to put this matter a little in forwardness before he took his departure  on the following morning he had various appointments to keep with countrymen and their wives who sold linen to him but he was quick over his business and managed to get back to the inn early in the afternoon  from six till eight he well knew that marie would allow nothing to impede her in the grand work of preparing for supper but at four oclock she would certainly be sitting somewhere about the house with her needle in her hand  at four oclock he found her not with her needle in her hand but better still perfectly idle she was standing at an open window looking out upon the garden as he came behind her standing motionless with both hands on the sill of the window thinking deeply of something that filled her mind it might be that she was thinking of him  i have done with my customers now and i shall be off to basle tomorrow said he as soon as she had looked round at the sound of his footsteps and perceived that he was close to her  i hope you have bought your goods well m urmand  ah for the matter of that the time for buying things well is clean gone  one used to be able to buy well but there is not an old woman now in alsace who doesnt know as well as i do or better what linen is worth in berne and paris  they expect to get nearly as much for it here at granpere  they work hard m urmand and things are dearer than they were it is well that they should get a price for their labour  a price yesbut how is a man to buy without a profit  they think that i come here for their sakesmerely to bring the market to their doors  then he began to remember that he had no special object in discussing the circumstances of his trade with marie bromar and that he had a special object in another direction  but how to turn the subject was now a difficulty  i am sure you do not buy without a profit said marie bromar when she found that he was silent  and then the poor people who have to pay so dear for everything  she was making a violent attempt to keep him on the ground of his customers and his purchases  there was another thing that i wanted to say to you marie he began at last abruptly  another thing said marie knowing that the hour had come  yesanother thing  i daresay you know what it is  i need not tell you now that i love you need i marie  you know as well as i do what i think of you  no i dont said marie not intending to encourage him to tell her but simply saying that which came easiest to her at the moment  i think thisthat if you will consent to be my wife i shall be a very happy man  that is all  everybody knows how pretty you are and how good and how clever but i do not think that anybody loves you better than i do  can you say that you will love me marie your uncle approves of itand your aunt  he had now come quite close to her and having placed his hand behind her back was winding his arm round her waist  i will not have you do that m urmand she said escaping from his embrace  but that is no answer  can you love me marie  no she said hardly whispering the word between her teeth  and is that to be all  what more can i say  but your uncle wishes it and your aunt  dear marie can you not try to love me  i know they wish it  it is easy enough for a girl to see when such things are wished or when they are forbidden  of course i know that uncle wishes it  and he is very goodand so are you i daresay and im sure i ought to be very proud because you are so much above me  i am not a bit above you  if you knew what i think you wouldnt say so  but  well marie  think a moment dearest before you give me an answer that shall make me either happy or miserable  i have thought  i would almost burn myself in the fire if uncle wished it  and he does wish this  but i cannot do this even because he wishes it  why not marie  i prefer being as i am  i do not wish to leave the hotel or to be married at all  nay marie you will certainly be married some day  no there is no such certainty  some girls never get married  i am of use here and i am happy here  ah it is because you cannot love me  i dont suppose i shall ever love any one not in that way  i must go away now m urmand because i am wanted below  she did go and adrian urmand spoke no farther word of love to her on that occasion  i will speak to her about it myself said michel voss when he heard his young friends story that evening seated again upon the bench outside the door and smoking another cigar  it will be of no use said adrian  one never knows said michel  young women are queer cattle to take to market  one can never be quite certain which way they want to go  after you are off tomorrow i will have a few words with her  she does not quite understand as yet that she must make her hay while the sun shines  some of em are all in a hurry to get married and some of em again are all for hanging back when their friends wish it  its natural i believe that they should be contrary  but marie is as good as the best of them and when i speak to her shell hear reason  adrian urmand had no alternative but to assent to the innkeepers proposition  the idea of making love secondhand was not pleasant to him but he could not hinder the uncle from speaking his mind to the niece  one little suggestion he did make before he took his departure  it cant be i suppose that there is any one else that she likes better  to this michel voss made no answer in words but shook his head in a fashion that made adrian feel assured that there was no danger on that head  but michel voss though he had shaken his head in a manner so satisfactory had feared that there was such danger  he had considered himself justified in shaking his head but would not be so false as to give in words the assurance which adrian had asked that night he discussed the matter with his wife declaring it as his purpose that marie bromar should marry adrian urmand  it is impossible that she should do better said michel  it would be very well said madame voss  very well  why he is worth thirty thousand francs and is as steady at his business as his father was before him  he is a dandy  psha that is nothing said michel  and he is too fond of money  it is a fault on the right side said michel  his wife and children will not come to want  madame voss paused a moment before she made her last and grand objection to the match  it is my belief said she that marie is always thinking of george  then she had better cease to think of him said michel for george is not thinking of her  he said nothing farther but resolved to speak his own mind freely to marie bromar    chapter iii  the oldfashioned inn at colmar at which george voss was acting as assistant and chief manager to his fathers distant cousin madame faragon was a house very different in all its belongings from the lion dor at granpere  it was very much larger and had much higher pretensions  it assumed to itself the character of a firstclass hotel and when colmar was without a railway and was a great postingstation on the high road from strasbourg to lyons there was some real business at the hotel de la poste in that town  at present though colmar may probably have been benefited by the railway the inn has faded and is in its yellow leaf  travellers who desire to see the statue which a grateful city has erected to the memory of its most illustrious citizen general rapp are not sufficient in number to keep a firstclass hotel in the glories of fresh paint and smart waiters and when you have done with general rapp there is not much to interest you in colmar  but there is the hotel and poor fat unwieldy madame faragon though she grumbles much and declares that there is not a sou to be made still keeps it up and bears with as much bravery as she can the buffets of a world which seems to her to be becoming less prosperous and less comfortable and more exacting every day  in her younger years a postinghouse in such a town was a postinghouse and when m faragon married her the heiress of the then owner of the business he was supposed to have done uncommonly well for himself  madame faragon is now a childless widow and sometimes declares that she will shut the house up and have done with it  why maintain a business without a profit simply that there may be an hotel de la poste at colmar  but there are old servants whom she has not the heart to send away and she has at any rate a roof of her own over her head and though she herself is unconscious that it is so she has many ties to the old business and now since her young cousin george voss has been with her things go a little better  she is not robbed so much and the people of the town finding that they can get a fair bottle of wine and a good supper come to the inn and at length an omnibus has been established and there is a little glimmer of returning prosperity  it is a large old rambling house built round an irregularlyshaped court with another court behind it and in both courts the stables and coachhouses seem to be so mixed with the kitchens and entrances that one hardly knows what part of the building is equine and what part human  judging from the smell which pervades the lower quarters and alas also too frequently the upper rooms one would be inclined to say that the horses had the best of it  the defect had been pointed out to madame faragon more than once but that lady though in most of the affairs of life her temper is gentle and kindly cannot hear with equanimity an insinuation that any portion of her house is either dirty or unsweet  complaints have reached her that the beds werewell inhabitedbut no servant now dares to hint at anything wrong in this particular  if this traveller or that says a word to her personally in complaint she looks as sour as death and declines to open her mouth in reply but when that travellers back is turned the things that madame faragon can say about the upstart coxcombry of the wretch and as to the want of all real comforts which she is sure prevails in the home quarters of that illstarred complaining traveller are proof to those who hear them that the old landlady has not as yet lost all her energy  it need not be doubted that she herself religiously believes that no foul perfume has ever pervaded the sanctity of her chambers and that no living thing has ever been seen inside the sheets of her beds except those guests whom she has allocated to the different rooms  matters had not gone very easily with george voss in all the changes he had made during the last year  some things he was obliged to do without consulting madame faragon at all  then she would discover what was going on and there would be a few words  at other times he would consult her and carry his purpose only after much perseverance  twice or thrice he had told her that he must go away and then with many groans she had acceded to his propositions  it had been necessary to expend two thousand francs in establishing the omnibus and in that affair the appearance of things had been at one time quite hopeless  and then when george had declared that the altered habits of the people required that the hour of the morning tabledhote should be changed from noon to one she had sworn that she would not give way  she would never lend her assent to such vile idleness  it was already robbing the business portion of the day of an hour  she would wrap her colours round her and die upon the ground sooner than yield  then they wont come said george and its no use you having the table then  they will all go to the hotel de limperatrice  this was a new house the very mention of which was a daggerthrust into the bosom of madame faragon  then they will be poisoned she said  and let them  it is what they are fit for  but the change was made and for the first three days she would not come out of her room  when the bell was rung at the obnoxious hour she stopped her ears with her two hands  but though there had been these contests madame faragon had made more than one effort to induce george voss to become her partner and successor in the house  if he would only bring in a small sum of moneya sum which must be easily within his fathers reachhe should have half the business now and all of it when madame faragon had gone to her rest  or if he would prefer to give madame faragon a pensiona moderate pensionshe would give up the house at once at these tender moments she used to say that he probably would not begrudge her a room in which to die  but george voss would always say that he had no money that he could not ask his father for money and that he had not made up his mind to settle at colmar madame faragon who was naturally much interested in the matter and was moreover not without curiosity could never quite learn how matters stood at granpere  a word or two she had heard in a circuitous way of marie bromar but from george himself she could never learn anything of his affairs at home  she had asked him once or twice whether it would not be well that he should marry but he had always replied that he did not think of such a thingat any rate as yet  he was a steady young man given more to work than to play and apparently not inclined to amuse himself with the girls of the neighbourhood  one day edmond greisse was over at colmaredmond greisse the lad whose untidy appearance at the suppertable at the lion dor had called down the rebuke of marie bromar  he had been sent over on some business by his employer and had come to get his supper and bed at madame faragons hotel  he was a modest unassuming lad and had been hardly more than a boy when george voss had left granpere from time to time george had seen some friend from the village and had thus heard tidings from home  once as has been said madame voss had made a pilgrimage to madame faragons establishment to visit him but letters between the houses had not been frequent though postage in franceor shall we say germanyis now almost as low as in england these people of alsace have not yet fallen into the way of writing to each other when it occurs to any of them that a word may be said  young greisse had seen the landlady who now never went upstairs among her guests and had had his chamber allotted to him and was seated at the suppertable before he met george voss  it was from madame faragon that george heard of his arrival  there is a neighbour of yours from granpere in the house said she  from granpere  and who is he  i forget the lads name but he says that your father is well and madame voss  he goes back early tomorrow with the roulage and some goods that his people have bought  i think he is at supper now  the place of honour at the top of the table at the colmar inn was not in these days assumed by madame faragon  she had alas become too stout to do so with either grace or comfort and always took her meals as she always lived in the little room downstairs from which she could see through the apertures of two doors all who came in and all who went out by the chief entrance of the hotel nor had george usurped the place  it had now happened at colmar as it has come to pass at most hotels that the public table is no longer the tabledhote  the end chair was occupied by a stout dark man with a bald head and black beard who was proudly filling a place different from that of his neighbours and who would probably have gone over to the hotel de limperatrice had anybody disturbed him  on the present occasion george seated himself next to the lad and they were soon discussing all the news from granpere  and how is marie bromar george asked at last  you have heard about her of course said edmond greisse  heard what  she is going to be married  minnie bromar to be married  and to whom  edmond at once understood that his news was regarded as being important and made the most of it  o dear yes  it was settled last week when he was there  but who is he  adrian urmand the linenbuyer from basle  marie to be married to adrian urmand  urmands journeys to granpere had been commenced before george voss had left the place and therefore the two young men had known each other  they say hes very rich said edmond  i thought he cared for nobody but himself  and are you sure  who told you  i am quite sure but i do not know who told me  they are all talking about it  did my father ever tell you  no he never told me  or marie herself  no she did not tell me  girls never tell those sort of things of themselves  nor madame voss asked george  she never talks much about anything  but you may be sure its true  ill tell you who told me first and he is sure to know because he lives in the house  it was peter veque  peter veque indeed  and who do you think would tell him  but isnt it quite likely  she has grown to be such a beauty everybody gives it to her that she is the prettiest girl round granpere  and why shouldnt he marry her  if i had a lot of money id only look to get the prettiest girl i could find anywhere  after this george said nothing farther to the young man as to the marriage  if it was talked about as edmond said it was probably true  and why should it not be true  even though it were true no one would have cared to tell him  she might have been married twice over and no one in granpere would have sent him word  so he declared to himself  and yet marie bromar had once sworn to him that she loved him and would be his for ever and ever and though he had left her in dudgeon with black looks without a kind word of farewell yet he had believed her  through all his sojourn at colmar he had told himself that she would be true to him  he believed it though he was hardly sure of himselfhad hardly resolved that he would ever go back to granpere to seek her  his father had turned him out of the house and marie had told him as he went that she would never marry him if her uncle disapproved it slight as her word had been on that morning of his departure it had rankled in his bosom and made him angry with her through a whole twelvemonth  and yet he had believed that she would be true to him  he went out in the evening when it was dusk and walked round and round the public garden of colmar thinking of the news which he had heardthe public garden in which stands the statue of general rapp  it was a terrible blow to him  though he had remained a whole year in colmar without seeing marie or hearing of her without hardly ever having had her name upon his lips without even having once assured himself during the whole time that the happiness of his life would depend on the girls constancy to himnow that he heard that she was to be married to another man he was torn to pieces by anger and regret  he had sworn to love her and had never even spoken a word of tenderness to another girl  she had given him her plighted troth and now she was prepared to break it with the first man who asked her  as he thought of this his brow became black with anger  but his regrets were as violent  what a fool he had been to leave her there open to persuasion from any man who came in the way open to persuasion from his father who would of course be his enemy  how indeed could he expect that she should be true to him  the year had been long enough to him but it must have been doubly long to her  he had expected that his father would send for him would write to him would at least transmit to him some word that would make him know that his presence was again desired at granpere  but his father had been as proud as he was and had not sent any such message  or rather perhaps the father being older and less impatient had thought that a temporary absence from granpere might be good for his son  it was late at night when george voss went to bed but he was up in the morning early to see edmond greisse before the roulage should start for munster on its road to granpere  early times in that part of the world are very early and the roulage was ready in the back court of the inn at halfpast four in the morning  what you up at this hour said edmond  why not  it is not every day we have a friend here from granpere so i thought i would see you off  that is kind of you  give my love to them at the old house edmond  of course i will  to father and madame voss and the children and to marie  all right  tell marie that you have told me of her marriage  i dont know whether shell like to talk about that to me  never mind you tell her  she wont bite you  tell her also that i shall be over at granpere soon to see her and the rest of them ill be overas soon as ever i can get away  shall i tell your father that  no  tell marie and let her tell my father  and when will you come  we shall all be so glad to see you  never you mind that  you just give my message  come in for a moment to the kitchen  theres a cup of coffee for you and a slice of ham  we are not going to let an old friend like you go away without breaking his fast  as greisse had already paid his modest bill amounting altogether to little more than three francs this was kind of the young landlord and while he was eating his bread and ham he promised faithfully that he would give the message just as george had given it to him  it was on the third day after the departure of edmond greisse that george told madame faragon that he was going home  going where george said madame faragon leaning forward on the table before her and looking like a picture of despair  to granpere madame faragon  to granpere and why and when and how  o dear  why did you not tell me before child  i told you as soon as i knew  but you are not going yet  on monday  o dear  so soon as that  lord bless me  we cant do anything before monday  and when will you be back  i cannot say with certainty  i shall not be long i daresay  and have they sent for you  no they have not sent for me but i want to see them once again and i must make up my mind what to do for the future  dont leave me george pray do not leave me exclaimed madame faragon  you shall have the business now if you choose to take itonly pray dont leave me  george explained that at any rate he would not desert her now at once and on the monday named he started for granpere  he had not been very quick in his action for a week had passed since he had given edmond greisse his breakfast in the hotel kitchen    chapter iv  adrian urmand had been three days gone from granpere before michel voss found a fitting opportunity for talking to his niece  it was not a matter as he thought in which there was need for any great hurry but there was need for much consideration  once again he spoke on the subject to his wife  if shes thinking about george she has kept it very much to herself he remarked  girls do keep it to themselves said madame voss  im not so sure of that  they generally show it somehow  marie never looks lovelorn  i dont believe a bit of it and as for him all the time he has been away he has never so much as sent a word of a message to one of us  he sent his love to you when i saw him quite dutifully said madame voss  why dont he come and see us if he cares for us  it isnt of him that marie is thinking  it isnt of anybody else then said madame voss  i never see her speak a word to any of the young men nor one of them ever speaking a word to her  pondering over all this michel voss resolved that he would have it all out with his niece on the following sunday  on the sunday he engaged marie to start with him after dinner to the place on the hillside where they were cutting wood  it was a beautiful autumn afternoon in that pleasantest of all months in the year when the sun is not too hot and the air is fresh and balmy and one is still able to linger abroad loitering either in or out of the shade when the midges cease to bite and the sun no longer scorches and glares but the sweet vestiges of summer remain and everything without doors is pleasant and friendly and there is the gentle unrecognised regret for the departing year the unconscious feeling that its glory is going from us to add the inner charm of a soft melancholy to the outer luxury of the atmosphere  i doubt whether michel voss had ever realised the fact that september is the kindliest of all the months but he felt it and enjoyed the leisure of his sunday afternoon when he could get his niece to take a stretch with him on the mountainside  on these occasions madame voss was left at home with m le cure who liked to linger over his little cup of coffee  madame voss indeed seldom cared to walk very far from the door of her own house and on sundays to go to the church and back again was certainly sufficient exercise  michel voss said no word about adrian urmand as they were ascending the hill  he was too wise for that  he could not have given effect to his experience with sufficient eloquence had he attempted the task while the burden of the rising ground was upon his lungs and chest  they turned into a sawmill as they went up and counted the scantlings of timber that had been cut and michel looked at the cradle to see that it worked well and to the wheels to see that they were in good order and observed that the channel for the water required repairs and said a word as to the injury that had come to him because george had left him  perhaps he may come back soon said marie  to this he made no answer but continued his path up the mountainside  there will be plenty of feed for the cows this autumn said marie bromar  that is a great comfort  plenty said michel plenty  but marie knew from the tone of his voice that he was not thinking about the grass and so she held her peace  but the want or plenty of the pasture was generally a subject of the greatest interest to the people of granpere at that special time of the year and one on which michel voss was ever ready to speak  marie therefore knew that there was something on her uncles mind  nevertheless he inspected the timber that was cut and made some remarks about the work of the men  they were not so careful in barking the logs as they used to be and upon the whole he thought that the wood itself was of a worse quality  what is there that we do not find to be deteriorating around us when we consider the things in detail though we are willing enough to admit a general improvement  yes said he in answer to some remarks from marie we must take it no doubt as god gives it to us but we need not spoil it in the handling  sit down my dear i want to speak to you for a few minutes  then they sat down together on a large prostrate pine which was being prepared to be sent down to the sawmill  my dear said he i want to speak to you about adrian urmand  she blushed and trembled as she placed herself beside him but he hardly noticed it  he was not quite at his ease himself and was a little afraid of the task he had undertaken adrian tells me that he asked you to take him as your lover and that you refused  yes uncle michel  but why my dear  how are you to do better  perhaps i or your aunt should have spoken to you first and told you that we thought well of the match  it wasnt that uncle  i knew you thought well of it or at least i believed that you did  and what is your objection marie  i dont object to m urmand uncleat least not particularly  but he says you do object  you would not accept him when he offered himself  no i did not accept him  but you will my dearif he comes again  no uncle  and why not  is he not a good young man  o yesthat is i daresay  and he has a good business  i do not know what more you could expect  i expect nothing uncleexcept not to go away from you  ahbut you must go away from me  i should be very wrong and so would your aunt to let you remain here till you lose your good looks and become an old woman on our hands  you are a pretty girl marie and fit to be any mans wife and you ought to take a husband  i am quite in earnest now my dear and i speak altogether for your own welfare  i know you are in earnest and i know that you speak for my welfare  wellwellwhat then  of course it is only reasonable that you should be married some day  here is a young man in a better way of business than any man old or young that comes into granpere  he has a house in basle and money to put in it whatever you want  and for the matter of that marie my niece shall not go away from me emptyhanded  she drew herself closer to him and took hold of his arm and pressed it and looked up into his face  i brought nothing with me she said and i want to take nothing away  is that it he said speaking rapidly  let me tell you then my girl that you shall have nothing but your earningsyour fair earnings  dont you take trouble about that  urmand and i will settle that between us and i will go bail there shall be no unpleasant words  as i said before my girl shant leave my house emptyhanded but lord bless you he would only be too happy to take you in your petticoat just as you are  i never saw a fellow more in love with a girl  come marie you need not mind saying the word to me though you could not bring yourself to say it to him  i cant say that word uncle either to you or to him  and why the devil not said michel voss who was beginning to be tired of being eloquent  i would rather stay at home with you and my aunt  o bother  some girls stay at home always  all girls do not get married  i dont want to be taken to basle  this is all nonsense said michel getting up  if youre a good girl you will do as you are told  it would not be good to be married to a man if i do not love him  but why shouldnt you love him  hes just the man that all the girls always love  why dont you love him  as michel voss asked this last question there was a tone of anger in his voice  he had allowed his niece considerable liberty and now she was unreasonable  marie who in spite of her devotion to her uncle was beginning to think that she was illused by this tone made no reply  i hope you havent been falling in love with any one else continued michel  no said marie in a low whisper  i do hope youre not still thinking of george who has left us without casting a thought upon you  i do hope that you are not such a fool as that  marie sat perfectly silent not moving but there was a frown on her brow and a look of sorrow mixed with anger on her face  but michel voss did not see her face  he looked straight before him as he spoke and was flinging chips of wood to a distance in his energy  if its that marie i tell you you had better get quit of it at once  it can come to no good  here is an excellent husband for you  be a good girl and say that you will accept him  i should not be a good girl to accept a man whom i do not love  is it any thought about george that makes you say so child michel paused a moment for an answer  tell me he continued with almost angry energy is it because of george that you refuse yourself to this young man  marie paused again for a moment and then she replied no it is not  it is not  no uncle  then why will you not marry adrian urmand  because i do not care for him  why wont you let me remain with you uncle  she was very close to him now and leaning against him and her throat was half choked with sobs and her eyes were full of tears michel voss was a softhearted man and inclined to be very soft of heart where marie bromar was concerned  on the other hand he was thoroughly convinced that it would be for his nieces benefit that she should marry this young trader and he thought also that it was his duty as her uncle and guardian to be round with her and make her understand that as her friends wished it and as the young trader himself wished it it was her duty to do as she was desired another uncle and guardian in his place would hardly have consulted the girl at all  between his desire to have his own way and reduce her to obedience and the temptation to put his arm round her waist and kiss away her tears he was uneasy and vacillating  she gently put her hand within his arm and pressed it very close  wont you let me remain with you uncle  i love you and aunt josey madame voss was named josephine and was generally called aunt josey and the children  i could not go away from the children  and i like the house  i am sure i am of use in the house  of course you are of use in the house  it is not that  why then should you want to send me away  what nonsense you talk marie  dont you know that a young woman like you ought to be married some daythat is if she can get a fitting man to take her  what would the neighbours say of me if we kept you at home to drudge for us instead of settling you out in the world properly  you forget marie that i have a duty to perform and you should not make it so difficult  but if i dont want to be settled said marie  who cares for the neighbours  if you and i understand each other is not that enough  i care for the neighbours said michel voss with energy  and must i marry a man i dont care a bit for because of the neighbours uncle michel asked marie with something approaching to indignation in her voice  michel voss perceived that it was of no use for him to carry on the argument  he entertained a halfformed idea that he did not quite understand the objections so strongly urged by his niece that there was something on her mind that she would not tell him and that there might be cruelty in urging the matter upon her but in opposition to this there was his assured conviction that it was his duty to provide well and comfortably for his niece and that it was her duty to obey him in acceding to such provision as he might make and then this marriage was undoubtedly a good marriagea match that would make all the world declare how well michel voss had done for the girl whom he had taken under his protection  it was a marriage that he could not bear to see go out of the family  it was not probable that the young linenmerchant who was so well to do in the world and who no doubt might have his choice in larger places than granpereit was not probable michel thought that he would put up with many refusals  the girl would lose her chance unless he by his firmness could drive this folly out of her  and yet how could he be firm when he was tempted to throw his great arms about her and swear that she should eat of his bread and drink of his cup and be unto him as a daughter till the last day of their joint existence  when she crept so close to him and pressed his arm he was almost overcome by the sweetness of her love and by the tenderness of his own heart  it seems to me that you dont understand he said at last  i didnt think that such a girl as you would be so silly  to this she made no reply and then they began to walk down the hill together  they had walked half way home he stepping a little in advancebecause he was still angry with her or angry rather with himself in that he could not bring himself to scold her properlyand she following close behind his shoulder when he stopped suddenly and asked her a question which came from the direction his thoughts were taking at the moment  you are sure he said that you are not doing this because you expect george to come back to you  quite sure she said bearing forward a moment and answering him in a whisper when she spoke  by my word then i cant understand it  i cant indeed  has urmand done anything to offend you  nothing uncle  nor said anything  not a word uncle  i am not offended  of course i am much obliged to him  only i dont love him  by my faith i dont understand it  i dont indeed  it is sheer nonsense and you must get over it  i shouldnt be doing my duty if i didnt tell you that you must get over it  he will be here again in another ten days and you must have thought better of it by that time  you must indeed marie  then they walked down the hill in silence together each thinking intently on the purpose of the other but each altogether misunderstanding the other  michel voss was assuredas she had twice implied as muchthat she was altogether indifferent to his son george  what he might have said or done had she declared her affection for her absent lover he did not himself know  he had not questioned himself on that point  though his wife had told him that marie was ever thinking of george he had not believed that it was so  he had no reason for disliking a marriage between his son and his wifes niece  when he had first thought that they were going to be lovers under his nose without his permissiongoing to commence a new kind of life between themselves without so much as a word spoken to him or by himhe had found himself compelled to interfere compelled as a father and an uncle  that kind of thing could never be allowed to take place in a wellordered house without the expressed sanction of the head of the household  he had interferedrather roughly and his son had taken him at his word he was sore now at his sons coldness to him and was disposed to believe that his son cared not at all for any one at granpere  his niece was almost as dear to him as his son and much more dutiful therefore he would do the best he could for his niece  maries declaration that george was nothing to herthat she did not think of himwas in accordance with his own ideas  his wife had been wrong  his wife was usually wrong when any headwork was required there could be no good reason why marie bromar should not marry adrian urmand  but marie as she knew very well had never declared that george voss was nothing to herthat he was forgotten or that her heart was free  he had gone from her and had forgotten her  she was quite sure of that  and should she ever hear that he was married to some one elseas it was probable that she would hear some daythen she would be free again  then she might take this man or that if her friends wished itand if she could bring herself to endure the proposed marriage  but at present her troth was plighted to george voss and where her troth was given there was her heart also  she could understand that such a circumstance affecting one of so little importance as herself should be nothing to a man like her uncle but it was everything to her  george had forgotten her and she had wept sorely over his want of constancy  but though telling herself that this certainly was so she had declared to herself that she would never be untrue till her want of truth had been put beyond the reach of doubt  who does not know how hope remains when reason has declared that there is no longer ground for hoping  such had been the state of her mind hitherto but what would be the good of entertaining hope even if there were ground for hoping when as was so evident her uncle would never permit george and her to be man and wife  and did she not owe everything to her uncle and was it not the duty of a girl to obey her guardian  would not all the world be against her if she refused this man  her mind was tormented by a thousand doubts when her uncle said another word to her just as they were entering the village  you will try and think better of itwill you not my dear  she was silent  come marie you can say that you will try  will you not try  yes unclei will try  michel voss went home in a good humour for he felt that he had triumphed and poor marie returned brokenhearted for she was aware that she had halfyielded  she knew that her uncle was triumphant    chapter v  when edmond greisse was back at granpere he well remembered his message but he had some doubt as to the expediency of delivering it  he had to reflect in the first place whether he was quite sure that matters were arranged between marie and adrian urmand  the story had been told to him as being certainly true by peter the waiter  and he had discussed the matter with other young men his associates in the place among all of whom it was believed that urmand was certainly about to carry away the young woman with whom they were all more or less in love  but when on his return to granpere he had asked a few more questions and had found that even peter was now in doubt on a point as to which he had before been so sure he began to think that there would be some difficulty in giving his message  he was not without some little fear of marie and hesitated to tell her that he had spread the report about her marriage  so he contented himself with simply announcing to her that george voss intended to visit his old home  does my uncle know marie asked  noyou are to tell him said greisse  i am to tell him  why should i tell him  you can tell him  but george said that i was to let you know and that you would tell your uncle  this was quite unintelligible to marie but it was clear to her that she could make no such announcement after the conversation which she had had with her uncle  it was quite out of the question that she should be the first to announce georges return when she had been twice warned on that sunday afternoon not to think of him  you had better let my uncle know yourself she said as she walked away  but young greisse knowing that he was already in trouble and feeling that he might very probably make it worse held his peace  when therefore one morning george voss showed himself at the door of the inn neither his father nor madame voss expected him  but his father was kind to him and his motherinlaw hovered round him with demonstrations of love and gratitude as though much were due to him for coming back at all  but you expected me said george  no indeed said his father  we did not expect you now any more than on any other day since you left us  i sent word by edmond greisse said george  edmond was interrogated and declared that he had forgotten to give the message  george was too clever to pursue the matter any farther and when he first met marie bromar there was not a word said between them beyond what might have been said between any young persons so related after an absence of twelve months  george voss was very careful to make no demonstration of affection for a girl who had forgotten him and who was now as he believed betrothed to another man and marie was determined that certainly no sign of the old love should first be shown by her  he had come backperhaps just in time  he had returned just at the moment in which something must be decided  she had felt how much there was in the little word which she had spoken to her uncle  when a girl says that she will try to reconcile herself to a mans overtures she has almost yielded  the word had escaped her without any such meaning on her parthad been spoken because she had feared to continue to contradict her uncle in the full completeness of a positive refusal she had regretted it as soon as it had been spoken but she could not recall it  she had seen in her uncles eye and had heard in the tone of his voice for how much that word had been takenbut it had gone forth from her mouth and she could not now rob it of its meaning  adrian urmand was to be back at granpere in a few daysin ten days michel voss had said and there were those ten days for her in which to resolve what she would do  now as though sent from heaven george had returned in this very interval of time  might it not be that he would help her out of her difficulty  if he would only tell her to remain single for his sake she would certainly turn her back upon her swiss lover let her uncle say what he might she would make no engagement with george unless with her uncles sanction but a word a look of love would fortify her against that other marriage  george she thought had come back a man more to be worshipped than ever as far as appearance went  what woman could doubt for a moment between two such men  adrian urmand was no doubt a pretty man with black hair of which he was very careful with white hands with bright small dark eyes which were very close together with a thin regular nose a small mouth and a black moustache which he was always pointing with his fingers  it was impossible to deny that he was goodlooking after a fashion but marie despised him in her heart  she was almost bigger than he was certainly stronger and had no aptitude for the city niceness and pointdevice fastidiousness of such a lover  george voss had come back not taller than when he had left them but broader in the shoulders and more of a man  and then he had in his eye and in his beaked nose and his large mouth and welldeveloped chin that look of command which was the peculiar character of his fathers face and which women who judge of men by their feelings rather than their thoughts always love to see  marie if she would consent to marry adrian urmand might probably have her own way in the house in everything whereas it was certain enough that george voss wherever he might be would desire to have his way  but yet there needed not a moment in maries estimation to choose between the two  george voss was a real man whereas adrian urmand tried by such a comparison was in her estimation simply a rich trader in want of a wife  in a day or two the fatted calf was killed and all went happily between george and his father  they walked together up into the mountains and looked after the woodcutting and discussed the prospects of the inn at colmar  michel was disposed to think that george had better remain at colmar and accept madame faragons offer  if you think that the house is worth anything i will give you a few thousand francs to set it in order and then you had better agree to allow her so much a year for her life  he probably felt himself to be nearly as young a man as his son and then remember too that he had other sons coming up who would be able to carry on the house at granpere when he should be past his work michel was a loving generoushearted man and all feeling of anger with his son was over before they had been together two days  you cant do better george he said  you need not always stay away from us for twelve months and i might take a turn over the mountain and get a lesson as to how you do things at colmar  if ten thousand francs will help you you shall have them  will that make things go straight with you  george voss thought the sum named would make things go very straight but as the reader knows he had another matter near to his heart  he thanked his father but not in the joyous thoroughly contented tone that michel had expected  is there anything wrong about it michel said in that sharp tone which he used when something had suddenly displeased him  there is nothing wrong nothing wrong at all said george slowly the money is much more than i could have expected  indeed i did not expect any  what is it then  i was thinking of something else  tell me father is it true that marie is going to be married to adrian urmand  what makes you ask  i heard a report of it said george  is it true  the father reflected a moment what answer he should give  it did not seem to him that george spoke of such a marriage as though the rumour of it had made him unhappy  the question had been asked almost with indifference  and then the young mans manner to marie and maries manner to him during the last two days had made him certain that he had been right in supposing that they had both forgotten the little tenderness of a year ago  and michel had thoroughly made up his mind that it would be well that marie should marry adrian  he believed that he had already vanquished maries scruples  she had promised to try and think better of it before georges return and therefore was he not justified in regarding the matter as almost settled  i think that they will be married said he to his son  then there is something in it  o yes there is a great deal in it  urmand is very eager for it and has asked me and her aunt and we have consented  but has he asked her  yes he has done that too said michel  and what answer did he get  welli dont know that it would be fair to tell that  marie is not a girl likely to jump into a mans arms at the first word  but i think there is no doubt that they will be betrothed before sunday week  he is to be here again on wednesday  she likes him then  o yes of course she likes him  michel voss had not intended to say a word that was false  he was anxious to do the best in his power for both his son and his niece  he thoroughly understood that it was his duty as a father and a guardian to start them well in the world to do all that he could for their prosperity to feed their wants with his money as a pelican feeds her young with blood from her bosom  had he known the hearts of each of them could he have understood maries constancy or the obstinate silent strength of his sons disposition he would have let adrian urmand with his business and his house at basle seek a wife in any other quarter where he listed and would have joined together the hands of these two whom he loved with a paternal blessing  but he did not understand he thought that he saw everything when he saw nothingand now he was deceiving his son for it was untrue that marie had any such liking for adrian urmand as that of which george had spoken  it is as good as settled then said george not showing by any tone of his voice the anxiety with which the question was asked  i think it is as good as settled michel answered  before they got back to the inn george had thanked his father for his liberal offer had declared that he would accede to madame faragons proposition and had made his father understand that he must return to colmar on the next mondaytwo days before that on which urmand was expected at granpere  the monday came and hitherto there had been no word of explanation between george and marie  every one in the house knew that he was about to return to colmar and every one in the house knew that he had been entirely reconciled to his father  madame voss had asked some question about him and marie and had been assured by her husband that there was nothing in that suspicion  i told you from the beginning said he that there was nothing of that sort  i only wish that george would think of marrying some one now that he is to have a large house of his own over his head  george had determined a dozen times that he would and a dozen times that he would not speak to marie about her coming marriage changing his mind as often as it was formed  of what use was it to speak to her he would say to himself  then again he would resolve that he would scorch her false heart by one withering word before he went  chance at last arranged it for him  before he started he found himself alone with her for a moment and it was almost impossible that he should not say something  then he did speak  they tell me you are going to be married marie  i hope you will be happy and prosperous  who tells you so  it is true at any rate i suppose  not that i know of  if my uncle and aunt choose to dispose of me i cannot help it  it is well for girls to be disposed of sometimes  it saves them a world of trouble  i dont know what you mean by that georgewhether it is intended to be illnatured  no indeed  why should i be illnatured to you  i heartily wish you to be well and happy  i daresay m urmand will make you a good husband  goodbye marie  i shall be off in a few minutes  will you not say farewell to me  farewell george  we used to be friends marie  yeswe used to be friends  and i have never forgotten the old days  i will not promise to come to your marriage because it would not make either of us happy but i shall wish you well  god bless you marie  then he put his arm round her and kissed her as he might have done to a sisteras it was natural that he should do to marie bromar regarding her as a cousin  she did not speak a word more and then he was gone  she had been quite unable to tell him the truth  the manner in which he had first addressed her made it impossible for her to tell him that she was not engaged to marry adrian urmandthat she was determined if possible to avoid the marriage and that she had no love for adrian urmand  had she done so she would in so doing have asked him to come back to her  that she should do this was impossible  and yet as he left her some suspicion of the truth some halfformed idea of the real state of the mans mind in reference to her flashed across her own  she seemed to feel that she was specially unfortunate but she felt at the same time that there was no means within her reach of setting things right  and she was as convinced as ever she had been that her uncle would never give his consent to a marriage between her and george voss as for george himself he left her with an assured conviction that she was the promised bride of adrian urmand    chapter vi  the world seemed very hard to marie bromar when she was left alone though there were many who loved her of whose real affection she had no doubt there was no one to whom she could go for assistance her uncle in this matter was her enemy and her aunt was completely under her uncles guidance  madame voss spoke to her often in these days of the coming of adrian urmand but the manner of her speaking was such that no comfort could be taken from it  madame voss would risk an opinion as to the room which the young man ought to occupy and the manner in which he should be fed and entertained  for it was thoroughly understood that he was coming on this occasion as a lover and not as a trader and that he was coming as the guest of michel voss and not as a customer to the inn  i suppose he can take his supper like the other people marie said to her aunt  and again when the question of wine was mooted she was almost saucy if hes thirsty she said what did for him last week will do for him next week  and if hes not thirsty he had better leave it alone  but girls are always allowed to be saucy about their lovers and madame voss did not count this for much  marie was always thinking of those last words which had been spoken between her and george and of the kiss that he had given her  we used to be friends he had said and then he had declared that he had never forgotten old days  marie was quick intelligent and ready to perceive at half a glanceto understand at half a word as is the way with clever women  a thrill had gone through her as she heard the tone of the young mans voice and she had half told herself all the truth  he had not quite ceased to think of her then he went without saying the other one word that would have been needful without even looking the truth into her face  he had gone and had plainly given her to understand that he acceded to this marriage with adrian urmand  how was she to read it all  was there more than one way in which a wounded woman so sore at heart could read it  he had told her that though he loved her still it did not suit him to trouble himself with her as a wife and that he would throw upon her head the guilt of having been false to their old vows  though she loved him better than all the world she despised him for his thoughtful treachery  in her eyes it was treachery  he must have known the truth  what right had he to suppose that she would be false to himhe who had never known her to lie to him and was it not his business as a man to speak some word to ask some question by which if he doubted the truth might be made known to him  she a woman could ask no question  she could speak no word  she could not renew her assurances to him till he should have asked her to renew them  he was either false or a traitor or a coward  she was very angry with himso angry that she was almost driven by her anger to throw herself into adrians arms  she was the more angry because she was full sure that he had not forgotten his old lovethat his heart was not altogether changed had it appeared to her that the sweet words of former days had vanished from his memory though they had clung to hersthat he had in truth learned to look upon his granpere experiences as the simple doings of his boyhoodher pride would have been hurt but she would have been angry with herself rather than with him  but it had not been so  the respectful silence of his sojourn in the house had told her that it was not so  the tremor in his voice as he reminded her that they once had been friends had plainly told her that it was not so  he had acknowledged that they had been betrothed and that the plight between them was still strong but wishing to be quit of it he had thrown the burden of breaking it upon her  she was very wretched but she did not go about the house with downcast eyes or humble looks or sit idle in a corner with her hands before her  she was quick and eager in the performance of her work speaking sharply to those who came in contact with her  peter veque her chief minister had but a poor time of it in these days and she spoke an angry word or two to edmond greisse  she had in truth spoken no words to edmond greisse that were not angry since that illstarred communication of which he had only given her the half  to her aunt she was brusque and almost illmannered  what is the matter with you marie madame voss said to her one morning when she had been snubbed rather rudely by her niece marie in answer shook her head and shrugged her shoulders  if you cannot put on a better look before m urmand comes i think he will hardly hold to his bargain said madame voss who was angry  who wants him to hold to his bargain said marie sharply  then feeling illinclined to discuss the matter with her aunt she left the room  madame voss who had been assured by her husband that marie had no real objection to adrian urmand did not understand it all  i am sure marie is unhappy she said to her husband when he came in at noon that day  yes said he  it seems strange but it is so i fancy with the best of our young women  her feeling of modestyof bashfulness if you willis outraged by being told that she is to admit this man as her lover  she wont make the worse wife on that account when he gets her home  madame voss was not quite sure that her husband was right  she had not before observed young women to be made savage in their daily work by the outrage to their modesty of an acknowledged lover  but as usual she submitted to her husband  had she not done so there would have come that glance from the corner of his eye and that curl in his lip and that gentle breath from his nostril which had become to her the expression of imperious marital authority nothing could be kinder more truly affectionate than was the heart of her husband towards her niece  therefore madame voss yielded and comforted herself by an assurance that as the best was being done for marie she need not subject herself to her husbands displeasure by contradiction or interference  michel voss himself said little or nothing to his niece at this time  she had yielded to him making him a promise that she would endeavour to accede to his wishes and he felt that he was bound in honour not to trouble her farther unless she should show herself to be disobedient when the moment of trial came  he was not himself at ease he was not comfortable at heart because he knew that marie was avoiding him  though she would still stand behind his chair at supperwhen for a moment she would be stillshe did not put her hands upon his head nor did she speak to him more than the nature of her service required  twice he tried to induce her to sit with them at table as though to show that her position was altered now that she was about to become a bride but he was altogether powerless to effect any such change as this  no words that could have been spoken would have induced marie to seat herself at the table so well did she understand all that such a change in her habits would have seemed to imply  there was now hardly one person in the supperroom of the hotel who did not instinctively understand the reason which made michel voss anxious that his niece should sit down and that other reason which made her sternly refuse to comply with his request  so day followed day and there was but little said between the uncle and the niece though heretoforeup to a time still within a fortnight of the present daythe whole business of the house had been managed by little whispered conferences between them  i think well do so and so uncle or just you manage it yourself marie  such and suchlike words had passed every morning and evening with an understanding between them full and complete  now each was afraid of the other and everything was astray  but marie was still gentle with the children  when she could be with them for half an hour she would sit with them on her lap or clustering round kissing them and saying soft words to themeven softer in her affection than had been her wont  they understood as well as everybody else that something was wrongthat there was to be some change as to marie which perhaps would not be a change for the better that there was cause for melancholy for close kissing as though such kissing were in preparation for parting and for soft strokings with their little hands as though marie were to be pitied for that which was about to come upon her  isnt somebody coming to take you away little michel asked her when they were quite alone  marie had not known how to answer him  she had therefore embraced him closely and a tear fell upon his face  ah he said i know somebody is coming to take you away  will not papa help you  she had not spoken but for the moment she had taken courage and had resolved that she would help herself  at length the day was there on which adrian urmand was to come  it was his purpose to travel by mulhouse and remiremont and michel voss drove over to the latter town to fetch him  it was felt by every oneit could not be but feltthat there was something special in his coming  his arrival now was not like the arrival of any one else  marie with all her resolution that it should be like usual arrivals at the inn could not avoid the making of some difference herself  a better supper was prepared than usual and at the last moment she herself assisted in preparing it  the young men clustered round the door of the hotel earlier than usual to welcome the newcomer  m le cure was there with a clean white collar and with his best hat  madame voss had changed her gown and appeared in her own little room before her husband returned almost in her sunday apparel  she had said a doubtful word to marie suggesting a clean ribbon or an altered frill  marie had replied only by a look  she would not have changed a pin for urmands coming had all granpere come round her to tell her that it was needful  if the man wanted more to eat than was customary let him have it  it was not for her to measure her uncles hospitality but her ribbons and her pins were her own  the carriage was driving up to the door and michel with his young friend descended among the circle of expectant admirers  urmand was rich always well dressed and now he was to be successful in love he had about him a look as of a successful prosperous lover as he jumped out of the little carriage with his portmanteau in his hand and his greatcoat with its silk linings open at the breast  there was a consciousness in him and in every one there that he had not come now to buy linen  he made his way into the little room where madame voss was standing up waiting for him and was taken by the hand by her  michel voss soon followed them  and where is marie michel asked  an answer came from some one that marie was upstairs  supper would soon be ready and marie was busy  then michel sent up an order by peter that marie should come down  but marie did not come down she had gone to her own room peter said  then there came a frown on michels brow  marie had promised to try and this was not trying  he said no more till they went up to supper  there was marie standing as usual at the soup tureen  urmand walked up to her and they touched each others hand but marie said never a word  the frown on michels brow was very black but marie went on dispensing her soup    chapter vii  adrian urmand in spite of his white hands and his wellcombed locks and the silk lining to his coat had so much of the spirit of a man that he was minded to hold his head well up before the girl whom he wished to make his wife  michel during that drive from remiremont had told him that he might probably prevail  michel had said a thousand things in favour of his niece and not a word to her prejudice but he had so spoken or had endeavoured so to speak as to make urmand understand that marie could only be won with difficulty and that she was perhaps unaccountably averse to the idea of matrimony  she is like a young filly you know that starts and plunges when she is touched he had said  you think there is nobody else urmand had asked  then michel voss had answered with confidence i am sure there is nobody else  urmand had listened and said very little but when at supper he saw that the uncle was ruffled in his temper and sat silent with a black brow that madame voss was troubled in spirit and that marie dispensed her soup without vouchsafing a look to any one he felt that it behoved him to do his best and he did it  he talked freely to madame voss telling her the news from baslehow at length he thought the french trade was reviving and how all the swiss authorities were still opposed to the german occupation of alsace and how flax was likely to be dearer than ever he had seen it and how the travelling english were fewer this year than usual to the great detriment of the innkeepers  every now and then he would say a word to marie herself as she passed near him speaking in a cheery tone and striving his best to dispel a black silence which on the present occasion would have been specially lugubrious  upon the whole he did his work well and michel voss was aware of it but marie bromar entertained no gentle thought respecting him  he was not wanted there and he ought not to have come  she had given him an answer and he ought to have taken it  nothing she declared to herself was meaner than a man who would go to a girls parents or guardians for support when the girl herself had told him that she wished to have nothing to do with him  marie had promised that she would try but every feeling of her heart was against the struggle  after supper michel with his young friend sat some time at the table for the innkeeper had brought forth a bottle of his best burgundy in honour of the occasion  when they had eaten their fruit madame voss left the room and michel and adrian were soon alone together  say nothing to her till tomorrow said michel in a low voice  i will not said adrian  i do not wonder that she should be put out of face if she knows why i have come  of course she knows  give her tonight and tomorrow and we will see how it is to be  at this time marie was upstairs with the children resolute that nothing should induce her to go down till she should be sure that their visitor had gone to his chamber there were many things about the house which it was her custom to see in their place before she went to her rest and nobody should say that she neglected her work because of this dressedup doll but she would wait till she was sure of himtill she was sure of her uncle also  in her present frame of mind she could not have spoken to the doll with ordinary courtesy  what she feared was that her uncle should seek her upstairs  but michel had some idea that her part in the play was not an easy one and was minded to spare her for that night  but she had promised to try and she must be reminded of her promise  hitherto she certainly had not tried  hitherto she had been illtempered petulant and almost rude  he would not see her himself this evening but he would send a message to her by his wife  tell her from me that i shall expect to see smiles on her face tomorrow said michel voss  and as he spoke there certainly were no smiles on his own  i suppose she is flurried said madame voss  ah flurried  that may do for tonight  i have been very good to her  had she been my own i could not have been kinder  i have loved her just as if she were my own  of course i look now for the obedience of a child  she does not mean to be undutiful michel  i do not know about meaning  i like reality and i will have it too  i consulted herself and was more forbearing than most fathers would be  i talked to her about it and she promised me that she would do her best to entertain the man  now she receives him and me with an old frock and a sulky face  who pays for her clothes  she has everything she wantsjust as a daughter and she would not take the trouble to change her dress to grace my friendas you did as any daughter would  i am angry with her  do not be angry with her  i think i can understand why she did not put on another frock  so can i understand  i can understand well enough  i am not a fool  what is it she wants i wonder  what is it she expects does she think some count from paris is to come and fetch her  nay michel i think she expects nothing of that sort  then let her behave like any other young woman and do as she is bid  he is not old or ugly or a sot or a gambler  upon my word and honour i cant conceive what it is that she wants  i cant indeed  it was perhaps the fault of michel voss that he could not understand that a young woman should live in the same house with him and have a want which he did not conceive  poor marie  all that she wanted now at this moment was to be let alone  madame voss in obedience to her husbands commands went up to marie and found her sitting in the childrens room leaning with her head on her hand and her elbow on the table while the children were asleep around her  she was waiting till the house should be quiet so that she could go down and complete her work  o is it you aunt josey she said  i am waiting till uncle and m urmand are gone that i may go down and put away the wine and the fruit  never mind that tonight marie  o yes i will go down presently  i should not be happy if the things were not put straight  everything is about the house everywhere  we need not i suppose become like pigs because m urmand has come from basle  no we need not be like pigs said madame voss  come into my room a moment marie  i want to speak to you  your uncle wont be up yet  then she led the way and marie followed her  your uncle is becoming angry marie because  because why  have i done anything to make him angry  why are you so cross to this young man  i am not cross aunt josey  i went on just the same as i always do  if uncle michel wants anything else that is his faultnot mine  of course you know what he wants and i must say that you ought to obey him  you gave him a sort of a promise and now he thinks that you are breaking it  i gave him no promise said marie stoutly  he says that you told him that you would at any rate be civil to m urmand  and i have been civil said marie  you did not speak to him  i never do speak to anybody said marie  i have got something to think of instead of talking to the people  how would the things go if i took to talking to the people and left everything to that little goose peter  uncle michel is unreasonableand unkind  he means to do the best by you in his power  he wants to treat you just as though you were his daughter  then let him leave me alone  i dont want anything to be done  if i were his daughter he would not grudge me permission to stop at home in his house  i dont want anything else  i have never complained  but my dear it is time that you should be settled in the world  i am settled  i dont want any other settlementif they will only let me alone  marie said madame voss after a short pause i sometimes think that you still have got george voss in your head  is it that aunt josey that makes my uncle go on like this asked marie  you do not answer me child  i do not know what answer you want  when george was here i hardly spoke to him  if uncle michel is afraid of me i will give him my solemn promise never to marry any one without his permission  george voss will never come back for you said madame voss  he will come when i ask him said marie flashing round upon her aunt with all the fire of her bright eyes  does any one say that i have done anything to bring him to me  if so it is false whoever says it  i have done nothing  he has gone away and let him stay i shall not send for him  uncle michel need not be afraid of me because of george  by this time marie was speaking almost in a fury of passion and her aunt was almost subdued by her  nobody is afraid of you marie she said  nobody need be  if they will let me alone i will do no harm to any one  but marie you would wish to be married some day  why should i wish to be married  if i liked him i would take him but i dont  o aunt josey i thought you would be my friend  i cannot be your friend marie if you oppose your uncle  he has done everything for you and he must know best what is good for you there can be no reason against m urmand and if you persist in being so unruly he will only think that it is because you want george to come back for you  i care nothing for george said marie as she left the room nothing at allnothing  about halfanhour afterwards listening at her own door she heard the sound of her uncles feet as he went to his room and knew that the house was quiet  then she crept forth and went about her business  nobody should say that she neglected anything because of this unhappiness  she brushed the crumbs from the long table and smoothed the cloth for the next mornings breakfast she put away bottles and dishes and she locked up cupboards and saw that the windows and the doors were fastened  then she went down to her books in the little office below stairs  in the performance of her daily duty there were entries to be made and figures to be adjusted which would have been done in the course of the evening had it not been that she had been driven upstairs by fear of her lover and her uncle  but by the time that she took herself up to bed nothing had been omitted  and after the book was closed she sat there trying to resolve what she would do  nothing had perhaps given her so sharp a pang as her aunts assurance that george voss would not come back to her as her aunts suspicion that she was looking for his return  it was not that she had been deserted but that others should be able to taunt her with her desolation  she had never whispered the name of george to any one since he had left granpere and she thought that she might have been spared this indignity  if he fancies i want to interfere with him she said to herself thinking of her uncle and of her uncles plans in reference to his son he will find that he is mistaken  then it occurred to her that she would be driven to accept adrian urmand to prove that she was heartwhole in regard to george voss  she sat there thinking of it till the night was halfspent and when she crept up cold to bed she had almost made up her mind that it would be best for her to do as her uncle wished  as for loving the man that was out of the question  but then would it not be better to do without love altogether    chapter viii  how is it to be said michel to his niece the next morning  the question was asked downstairs in the little room while urmand was sitting at table in the chamber above waiting for the landlord michel voss had begun to feel that his visitor would be very heavy on hand having come there as a visitor and not as a man of business unless he could be handed over to the womankind  but no such handing over would be possible unless marie would acquiesce how is it to be michel asked  he had so prepared himself that he was ready in accordance with a word or a look from his niece either to be very angry thoroughly imperious and resolute to have his way with the dependent girl or else to be all smiles and kindness and confidence and affection  there was nothing she should not have if she would only be amenable to reason  how is what to be uncle michel said marie  the landlord thought that he discovered an indication of concession in his nieces voice and began immediately to adapt himself to the softer courses  well marie you know what it is we all wish  i hope you understand that we love you well and think so much of you that we would not intrust you to any one living who did not bear a high character and seem to deserve you  he was looking into maries face as he spoke and saw that she was soft and thoughtful in her mood not proud and scornful as she had been on the preceding evening  you have grown up here with us marie till it has almost come upon us with surprise that you are a beautiful young woman instead of a great straggling girl  i wish i was a great straggling girl still  do not say that my darling  we must all take the world as it is you know  but here you are and of course it is my duty and your aunts duty it was always a sign of high good humour on the part of michel voss when he spoke of his wife as being anybody in the householdmy duty and your aunts duty to see and do the best for you  you have always done the best for me in letting me be here  well my dear i hope so  you had to be here and you fell into this way of life naturally  but sometimes when i have seen you waiting on the people about the house ive thought it wasnt quite right  i think it was quite right  peter couldnt do it all and hed be sure to make a mess of it  we must have two peters thats all  but as i was saying that kind of thing was natural enough before you were grown up and had becomewhat shall i saysuch a handsome young woman  marie laughed and turned up her nose and shook her head but it may be presumed that she received some comfort from her uncles compliments  and then i began to see and your aunt began to see that it wasnt right that you should spend your life handing soup to the young men here  it is peter who always hands the soup to the young men  well well but you are waiting upon them and upon us  i trust the day is never to come uncle when im to be ashamed of waiting upon you  when he heard this he put his arm round her and kissed her  had he known at that moment what her feelings were in regard to his son he would have recommended adrian urmand to go back to basle  had he known what were georges feelings he would at once have sent for his son from colmar  i hope you may give me my pipe and my cup of coffee when im such an old fellow that i cant get up to help myself  thats the sort of reward we look forward to from those we love and cherish  but marie when we see you as you are nowyour aunt and iwe feel that this kind of thing shouldnt go on  we want the world to know that you are a daughter to us not a servant  o the worldthe world uncle  why should we care for the world  we must care my dear  and you yourself my dearif this went on for a few years longer you yourself would become very tired of it it isnt what we should like for you if you were our own daughter cant you understand that  no i cant  yes my dear yes  im sure you do  very well  then there comes this young man  i am not a bit surprised that he should fall in love with youbecause i should do it myself if i were not your uncle  then she caressed his arm  how was she to keep herself from caressing him when he spoke so sweetly to her  we were not a bit surprised when he came and told us how it was  nobody could have behaved better  everybody must admit that  he spoke of you to me and to your aunt as though you were the highest lady in the land  i dont want any one to speak of me as though i were a high lady  i mean in the way of respect my dear  every young woman must wish to be treated with respect by any young man who comes after her wellhe told us that it was the great wish of his life that you should be his wife  hes a man who has a right to look for a wife because he can keep a wife  he has a house and a business and ready money  whats all that uncle  nothingnothing at all  no more than thatsaying which michel voss threw his right hand and arm loosely abroadno more than that if he were not himself wellbehaved along with it  we want to see you married to himyour aunt and ibecause we are sure that he will be a good husband to you  but if i dont love him uncle michel  ah my dear thats where i think it is that you are dreaming and will go on dreaming till youve lost yourself unless your aunt and i interfere to prevent it  love is all very well  of course you must love your husband  but it doesnt do for young women to let themselves be run away with by romantic ideasit doesnt indeed my dear  ive heard of young women whove fallen in love with statues and men in armour out of poetry and grand fellows that they put into books and there theyve been waiting waiting waiting till some man in armour should come for them  the man in armour doesnt come  but sometimes there comes somebody who looks like a man in armour and thats the worst of all  i dont want a man in armour uncle michel  no i daresay not  but the truth is you dont know what you want the proper thing for a young woman is to get herself well settled if she has the opportunity  there are people who think so much of money that theyd give a child almost to anybody as long as he was rich  i shouldnt like to see you marry a man as old as myself  i shouldnt care how old he was if i loved him  nor to a curmudgeon continued michel not caring to notice the interruption nor to an illtempered fellow or one who gambled or one who would use bad words to you  but here is a young man who has no faults at all  i hate people who have no faults said marie  now you must give him an answer today or tomorrow  you remember what you promised me when we were coming home the other day  marie remembered her promise very well and thought that a great deal more had been made of it than justice would have permitted  i dont want to hurry you at all only it makes me so sad at heart when my own girl wont come and say a kind word to me and give me a kiss before we part at night  i thought so much of that last night marie i couldnt sleep for thinking of it  on hearing this she flung her arms round his neck and kissed him on each cheek and on his lips  i get to feel so marie if theres anything wrong between you and me that i dont know what im doing  will you do this for me my dear  come and sit at table with us this evening and make one of us  at any rate come and show that we dont want to make a servant of you  then well put off the rest of it till tomorrow  when such a request was made to her in such words how could she not accede to it  she had no alternative but to say that she would do in this respect as he would have her  she smiled and nodded her head and kissed him again  and marie darling put on a pretty frockfor my sake  i like to see you gay and pretty again she nodded her head and again she kissed him  such requests so made she felt that it would be impossible she should refuse  and yet when she came to think of it as she went about the house alone the granting of such requests was in fact yielding in everything  if she made herself smart for this young man and sat next him and smiled and talked to him conscious as she would beand he would be alsothat she was so placed that she might become his wife how afterwards could she hold her ground  and if she were really resolute to hold her ground would it not be much better that she should do so by giving up no point even though her uncles anger should rise hot against her  but now she had promised her uncle and she knew that she could not go back from her word  it would be better for her she told herself to think no more about it  things must arrange themselves  what did it matter whether she were wretched at basle or wretched at granpere  the only thing that could give a charm to her life was altogether out of her reach  after this conversation michel went upstairs to his young friend and within a quarter of an hour had handed him over to his wife  it was of course understood now that marie was not to be troubled till the time came for her to sit down at table with her smart frock michel explained to his wife the full amount of his success and acknowledged that he felt that marie was already pretty nearly overcome  shell try to be pleasant for my sake this evening he said and so shell fall into the way of being intimate with him and when he asks her tomorrow shell be forced to take him  it never occurred to him as he said this that he was forming a plan for sacrificing the girl he loved  he imagined that he was doing his duty by his niece thoroughly and was rather proud of his own generosity  in the afternoon adrian urmand was taken out for a drive to the ravine by madame voss  they both no doubt felt that this was very tedious but they were by nature patientquite unlike michel voss or marieand each of them was aware that there was a duty to be done  adrian therefore was satisfied to potter about the ravine and madame voss assured him at least a dozen times that it was the dearest wish of her heart to call him her nephewinlaw  at last the time for supper came  throughout the day marie had said very little to any one after leaving her uncle  ideas flitted across her mind of various modes of escape  what if she were to run awayto her cousins house at epinal and write from thence to say that this proposed marriage was impossible  but her cousin at epinal was a stranger to her and her uncle had always been to her the same as a father  then she thought of going to colmar of telling the whole truth to george and of dying when he refused heras refuse her he would  but this was a dream rather than a plan or how would it be if she went to her uncle now at once while the young man was away at the ravine and swore to him that nothing on earth should induce her to marry adrian urmand  but brave as marie was she was afraid to do this  he had told her how he suffered when they two did not stand well together and she feared to be accused by him of unkindness and ingratitude  and how would it be with her if she did accept the man  she was sufficiently alive to the necessities of the world to know that it would be well to have a home of her own and a husband and children if god would send them she understood quite as well as michel voss did that to be headwaiter at the lion dor was not a career in life of which she could have reason to be proud  as the afternoon went on she was in great doubt  she spread the cloth and prepared the room for supper somewhat earlier than usual knowing that she should require some minutes for her toilet  it was necessary that she should explain to peter that he must take upon himself some selfaction upon this occasion and it may be doubted whether she did this with perfect good humour  she was angry when she had to look for him before she commenced her operations and scolded him because he could not understand without being told why she went away and left him twenty minutes before the bell was rung  as soon as the bell was heard through the house michel voss who was waiting below with his wife in a quiet unusual manner marshalled the way upstairs  he had partly expected that marie would join them below and was becoming fidgety lest she should break away from her engagement  he went first and then followed adrian and madame voss together  the accustomed guests were all ready because it had come to be generally understood that this supper was to be as it were a supper of betrothal  madame voss had on her black silk gown  michel had changed his coat and his cravat adrian urmand was exceedingly smart  the dullest intellect could perceive that there was something special in the wind  the two old ladies who were lodgers in the house came out from their rooms five minutes earlier than usual and met the cortege from downstairs in the passage  when michel entered the room he at once looked round for marie there she was standing at the souptureen with her back to the company  but he could see that there hung down some ribbon from her waist that her frock was not the one she had worn in the morning and that in the article of her attire she had kept her word with him  he was very awkward  when one of the old ladies was about to seat herself in the chair next to adrianin preparation for which it must be admitted that marie had made certain wicked arrangementsmichel first by signs and afterwards with audible words intended to be whispered indicated to the lady that she was required to place herself elsewhere  this was hard upon the lady as her own tablenapkin and a cup out of which she was wont to drink were placed at that spot  marie standing at the souptureen heard it all and became very spiteful  then her uncle called to her  marie my dear are you not coming  presently uncle replied marie in a clear voice as she commenced to dispense the soup  she ladled out all the soup without once turning her face towards the company then stood for a few moments as if in doubt and after that walked boldly up to her place  she had intended to sit next to her uncle opposite to her lover and there had been her chair  but michel had insisted on bringing the old lady round to the seat that marie had intended for herself and so had disarranged all her plans  the old lady had simpered and smiled and made a little speech to m urmand which everybody had heard  marie too had heard it all  but the thing had to be done and she plucked up her courage and did it  she placed herself next to her lover and as she did so felt that it was necessary that she should say something at the moment  here i am uncle michel but youll find youll miss me before supper is over  there is somebody would much rather have you than his supper said the horrid old lady opposite  then there was a pause a terrible pause  perhaps it used to be so when young men came to sup with you years ago but nowadays men like their supper said marie who was driven on by her anger to a ferocity which she could not restrain  i did not mean to give offence said the poor old lady meekly  marie as she thought of what she had said repented so bitterly that she could hardly refrain from tears  there is no offence at all said michel angrily  will you allow me to give you a little wine said adrian turning to his neighbour  marie bowed her head and held her glass but the wine remained in it to the end of the supper and there it was left  when it was all over michel felt that it had not been a success with the exception of her savage speech to the disagreeable old lady marie had behaved well  she was on her mettle and very anxious to show that she could sit at table with adrian urmand and be at her ease  she was not at her ease but she made a bold fightwhich was more than was done by her uncle or her aunt  michel was unable to speak in his ordinary voice or with his usual authority and madame voss hardly uttered a word  urmand whose position was the hardest of all struggled gallantly but was quite unable to keep up any continued conversation  the old lady had been thoroughly silenced and neither she nor her sister again opened their mouth  when madame voss rose from her chair in order that they might all retire the consciousness of relief was very great  for that night maries duty to her uncle was done  so much had been understood  she was to dress herself and sit down to supper and after that she was not to be disturbed again till the morrow  on the next morning she was to be subjected to the grand trial  she understood this so well that she went about the house fearless on that eveningfearless as regarded the moment fearful only as regarded the morrow  may i ask one question dear said her aunt coming to her after she had gone to her own room  have you made up your mind  no said marie i have not made up my mind  her aunt stood for a moment looking at her and then crept out of the room  in the morning michel voss was halfinclined to release his niece and to tell urmand that he had better go back to basle  he could see that the girl was suffering and after all what was it that he wanted  only that she should be prosperous and happy  his heart almost relented and at one moment had marie come across him he would have released her  let it go on he said to himself as he took up his cap and stick and went off to the woods  let it go on  if she finds today that she cant take him ill never say another word to press her  he went up to the woods after breakfast and did not come back till the evening  during breakfast marie did not show herself at all but remained with the children  it was not expected that she should show herself  at about noon as soon as her uncle had started her aunt came to her and asked her whether she was ready to see m urmand i am ready said marie rising from her seat and standing upright before her aunt  and where will you see him dear  wherever he pleases said marie with something that was again almost savage in her voice  shall he come upstairs to you  what here  no he cannot come here  you might go into the little sittingroom  very well  i will go into the little sitting room  then without saying another word she got up left the room and went along the passage to the chamber in question  it was a small room furnished as they all thought at granpere with parisian elegance intended for such visitors to the hotel as might choose to pay for the charm and luxury of such an apartment  it was generally found that visitors to granpere did not care to pay for the luxury of this parisian elegance and the room was almost always empty  thither marie went and seated herself at once on the centre of the red stuffy velvet sofa  there she sat perfectly motionless till there came a knock at the door  marie bromar was a very handsome girl but as she sat there all alone with her hands crossed on her lap with a hard look about her mouth with a frown on her brow and scorn and disdain for all around her in her eyes she was as little handsome as it was possible that she should make herself  she answered the knock and adrian urmand entered the room  she did not rise but waited till he had come close up to her  then she was the first to speak  aunt josey tells me that you want to see me she said  urmands task was certainly not a pleasant one  though his temper was excellent he was already beginning to think that he was being illused  marie no doubt was a very fine girl but the match that he offered her was one at which no young woman of her rank in all lorraine or alsace need have turned up her nose  he had been invited over to granpere specially that he might spend his time in making love and he had found the task before him very hard and disagreeable  he was afflicted with all the ponderous notoriety of an acknowledged suitors position but was consoled with none of the usual comforts  had he not been pledged to make the attempt he would probably have gone back to basle as it was he was compelled to renew his offer  he was aware that he could not leave the house without doing so  but he was determined that one more refusal should be the last  marie said he putting out his hand to her doubtless you know what it is that i would say  i suppose i do she answered  i hope you do not doubt my true affection for you  she paused a moment before she replied  i have no reason to doubt it she said  no indeed  i love you with all my heart  i do truly  your uncle and aunt think it would be a good thing for both of us that we should be married  what answer will you make me marie  again she paused  she had allowed him to take her hand and as he thus asked his question he was standing opposite to her still holding it you have thought about it marie since i was here last  yes i have thought about it  well dearest  i suppose it had better be so said she standing up and withdrawing her hand  she had accepted him and now it was no longer possible for him to go back to basle except as a betrothed man  she had accepted him but there came upon him a wretched feeling that none of the triumph of successful love had come to him  he was almost disappointedor if not disappointed was at any rate embarrassed  but it was necessary that he should immediately conduct himself as an engaged man  and you will love me marie he said as he again took her by the hand  i will do my best she said  then he put his arm round her waist and kissed her and she did not turn away her face from him  i will do my best also to make you happy he said  i am sure you will  i believe you  i know that you are good there was another pause during which he stood still embracing her i may go now may i not she said  you have not kissed me yet marie  then she kissed him but the touch of her lips was cold and he felt that there was no love in them  he knew though he could hardly define the knowledge to himself that she had accepted him in obedience to her uncle  he was almost angry but being cautious and eventempered by nature he repressed the feeling  he knew that he must take her now and that he had better make the best of it  she would he was sure be a good wife and the love would probably come in time  we shall be together this evening shall we not he asked  o yes said marie if you please  it was as she knew only reasonable now that they should be together  then he let her go and she walked off to her room    chapter ix  i suppose it had better be so marie bromar had said to her lover when in set form he made his proposition  she had thought very much about it and had come exactly to that state of mind  she did suppose that it had better be so  she knew that she did not love the man  she knew also that she loved another man  she did not even think that she should ever learn to love adrian urmand  she had neither ambition in the matter nor even any feeling of prudence as regarded herself  she was enticed by no desire of position or love of money  in respect to all her own feelings about herself she would sooner have remained at the lion dor and have waited upon the guests day after day and month after month  but yet she had supposed that it had better be so  her uncle wished itwished it so strongly that she believed it would be impossible that she could remain an inmate in his house unless she acceded to his wishes  her aunt manifestly thought that it was her duty to accept the man and could not understand how so manifest a duty going hand in hand as it did with so great an advantage should be made a matter of doubt  she had not one about her to counsel her to hold by her own feelings  it was the practice of the world around her that girls in such matters should do as they were bidden  and then stronger than all there was the indifference to her of the man she loved  marie bromar was a fine highspirited animated girl but it must not be thought that she was a highly educated lady or that time had been given to her amidst all her occupations in which she could allow her mind to dwell much on feelings of romance  her life had ever been practical busy and full of action  as is ever the case with those who have to do chiefly with things material she was thinking more frequently of the outer wants of those around her than of the inner workings of her own heart and personal intelligence  would the bread rise well  would that bargain she had made for poultry suffice for the house  was that lot of wine which she had persuaded her uncle to buy of a creditable quality were her efforts for increasing her uncles profits compatible with satisfaction on the part of her uncles guests  such were the questions which from day to day occupied her attention and filled her with interest  and therefore her own identity was not strong to her as it is strong to those whose business permits them to look frequently into themselves or whose occupations are of a nature to produce such introspection  if her head ached or had she lamed her hand by any accident she would think more of the injury to the household arising from her incapacity than of her own pain  it is so reader with your gardener your groom or your cook if you will think of it  till you tell them by your pity that they are the sufferers they will think that it is you who are most affected by their ailments  and the man who loses his daily wage because he is ill complains of his loss and not of his ailment  his own identity is half hidden from him by the practical wants of his life  had marie been disappointed in her love without the appearance of any rival suitor no one would have ever heard of her love  had george voss married she would have gone on with her work without a sign of outward sorrow or had he died she would have wept for him with no peculiar tears  she did not expect much from the world around her beyond this that the guests should not complain about their suppers as long as the suppers provided were reasonably good had no great undertaking been presented to her the performance of no heavy task demanded from her she would have gone on with her work without showing even by the altered colour of her cheek that she was a sufferer  but this other man had comethis adrian urmand and a great undertaking was presented to her and the performance of a heavy task was demanded from her  then it was necessary that there should be identity of self and introspection she had to ask herself whether the task was practicable whether its performance was within the scope of her powers  she told herself at first that it was not to be done that it was one which she would not even attempt  then as she looked at it more frequently as she came to understand how great was the urgency of her uncle as she came to find in performing that task of introspection how unimportant a person she was herself she began to think that the attempt might be made  i suppose it had better be so she had said  what was she that she should stand in the way of so many wishes  as she had worked for her bread in her uncles house at granpere so would she work for her bread in her husbands house at basle  no doubt there were other things to be joined to her workthings the thought of which dismayed her  she had fought against them for a while but after all what was she that she should trouble the world by fighting  when she got to basle she would endeavour to see that the bread should rise there and the wine be sufficient and the supper such as her husband might wish it to be  was it not the manifest duty of every girl to act after this fashion  were not all marriages so arranged in the world around her  among the protestants of alsace as she knew there was some greater latitude of choice than was ever allowed by the stricter discipline of roman catholic education  but then she was a roman catholic as was her aunt and she was too proud and too grateful to claim any peculiar exemption from the protestantism of her uncle she had resolved during those early hours of the morning that it had better be so  she thought that she could go through with it all if only they would not tease her and ask her to wear her sunday frock and force her to sit down with them at table  let them settle the daywith a word or two thrown in by herself to increase the distanceand she would be absolutely submissive on condition that nothing should be required of her till the day should come  there would be a bad week or two then while she was being carried off to her new home but she had looked forward and had told herself that she would fill her mind with the care of one mans house as she had hitherto filled it with the care of the house of another man  so it is all right said her aunt rushing up to her with warm congratulations ready to flatter her prone to admire her  it would be something to have a niece married to adrian urmand the successful young merchant of basle  marie bromar was already in her aunts eyes something different from her former self  i hope so aunt  hope so but it is so you have accepted him  i hope it is right i mean  of course it is right said madame voss  how can it be wrong for a girl to accept the man whom all her friends wish her to marry  it must be right  and your uncle will be so happy  dear uncle  yes indeed  he has been so good and it has made me wretched to see that he has been disturbed  he has been as anxious that you should be settled well as though you had been his own  and this will be to be settled well  i am told that m urmands house is one of those which look down upon the river from near the church the very best position in all the town  and it is full of everything they say  his father spared nothing for furniture when he was married  and they say that his mothers linen was quite a sight to be seen  and then marie everybody acknowledges that he is such a nicelooking young man  but it was not a part of maries programme to be waked up to enthusiasmat any rate by her aunt  she said little or nothing and would not even condescend to consider that interesting question of the day of the wedding  there is quite time enough for all that aunt josey she said as she got up to go about her work aunt josey was almost inclined to resent such usage and would have done so had not her respect for her niece been so great  michel did not return till near seven and walking straight through his wifes room to maries seat of office came upon his niece before he had seen any one else  there was an angry look about his brow for he had been trying to teach himself that he was illused by his niece in spite of that halfformed resolution to release her from persecution if she were still firm in her opposition to the marriage  well he said as soon as he saw herwell how is it to be  she got off her stool and coming close to him put up her face to be kissed  he understood it all in a moment and the whole tone and colour of his countenance was altered  there was no man whose face would become more radiant with satisfaction than that of michel vosswhen he was satisfied  please himand immediately there would be an effort on his part to please everybody around him my darling my own one he said it is all right  she kissed him again and pressed his arm but said not a word  i am so glad he exclaimed i am so glad  and he knocked off his cap with his hand not knowing what he was doing  we shall have but a poor house without you mariea very poor house  but it is as it ought to be  i have felt for the last year or two as you have sprung up to be such a woman among us my dear that there was only one place fit for such a one  it is proper that you should be mistress wherever you are  it has wounded mei dont mind saying it nowit has wounded me to see you waiting on the sort of people that come here  i have only been too happy uncle in doing it  thats all very well thats all very well my dear  but i am older than you and time goes quick with me  i tell you it made me unhappy  i thought i wasnt doing my duty by you  i was beginning to know that you ought to have a house and servants of your own people say that it is a great match for you but i tell them that it is a great match for him  perhaps it is because youve been my own in a way but i dont see any girl like you round the country  you shouldnt say such things to flatter me uncle michel  i choose to say what i please and think what i please about my own girl he said with his arm close wound round her  i say its a great match for adrian urmand and i am quite sure that he will not contradict me  he has had sense enough to know what sort of a young woman will make the best wife for him and i respect him for it  i shall always respect adrian urmand because he has known better than to take up with one of your townbred girls who never learn anything except how to flaunt about with as much finery on their backs as they can get their people to give them  he might have had the pick of them at basleor at strasbourg either for the matter of that but he has thought my girl better than them all and i love him for itso i do  it was to be expected that a young fellow with means to please himself should choose to have a goodlooking wife to sit at his table with him  wholl blame him for that  and he has found the prettiest in all the country round  but he has wanted something more than good looksand he has got a great deal more  yes i say it i michel voss though i am your unclethat he has got the pride of the whole country round  my darling my own one my child  all this was said with many interjections and with sundry pauses in the speech during which michel caressed his niece and pressed her to his breast and signified his joy by all the outward modes of expression which a man so demonstrative knows how to use  this was a moment of great triumph to him because he had begun to despair of success in this matter of the marriage and had told himself on this very morning that the affair was almost hopeless  while he had been up in the wood he had asked himself how he would treat marie in consequence of her disobedience to him and he had at last succeeded in producing within his own breast a state of mind that was not perhaps very reasonable but which was consonant with his character he would let her know that he was angry with hervery angry with her that she had half broken his heart by her obstinacy but after that she should be to him his own marie again  he would not throw her off because she disobeyed him  he could not throw her off because he loved her and knew of no way by which he could get rid of his love  but he would be very angry and she should know of his anger  he had come home wearing a black cloud on his brow and intending to be black  but all that was changed in a moment and his only thought now was how to give pleasure to this dear one  it is something to have a niece who brings such credit on the family  marie as she listened to his praise and his ecstasies knowing by a sure instinct every turn of his thoughts tried to take joy to herself in that she had given joy to him  though he was her uncle and had in fact been her master he was actually the one real friend whom she had made for herself in her life  there had been a month or two of something more than friendship with george voss but she was too wise to look much at that now  michel voss was the one being in the world whom she knew best of whom she thought most whose thoughts and wishes she had most closely studied whose interests were ever present to her mind  perhaps it may be said of every human heart in a sound condition that it must be specially true to some other one human heart but it may certainly be so said of every female heart  the object may be changed from time to timemay be changed very suddenly as when a girls devotion is transferred with the consent of all her friends from her mother to her lover or very slowly as when a mothers is transferred from her husband to some favourite child but unless selfworship be predominant there is always one friend to whom the womans breast is truefor whom it is the womans joy to offer herself in sacrifice  now with marie bromar that one being had been her uncle she prospered if he prospered  his comfort was her comfort  even when his palate was pleased there was some gratification akin to animal enjoyment on her part  it was ease to her that he should be at his ease in his armchair  it was mirth to her that he should laugh  when he was contented she was satisfied  when he was ruffled she was never smooth  her sympathy with him was perfect and now that he was radiant with triumph though his triumph came from his victory over herself she could not deny him the pleasure of triumphing with him  dear uncle she said still caressing him i am so glad that you are pleased  of course it will be a poor house without you marie  as for me it will be just as though i had lost my right leg and my right arm but what  a man is not always to be thinking of himself  to see you treated by all the world as you ought to be treatedas i should choose that my own daughter should be treatedthat is what i have desired  sometimes when ive thought of it all when ive been alone i have been mad with myself for letting it go on as it has done  it has gone on very nicely i think uncle michel  she knew how worse than useless it would be now to try and make him understand that it would be better for them both that she should remain with him  she knew to the moving of a feather what she could do with him and what she could not  her immediate wish was to enable him to draw all possible pleasure from his triumph of the day and therefore she would say no word to signify that his glory was founded on her sacrifice  then again came up the question of her position at supper but there was no difficulty in the arrangement made between them  the one gala evening of grand dressesthe evening which had been intended to be a gala but which had turned out to be almost funerealwas over  even michel voss himself did not think it necessary that marie should come in to supper with her silk dress two nights running and he himself had found that that changing of his coat had impaired his comfort  he could eat his dinner and his supper in his best clothes on sunday and not feel the inconvenience but on other occasions those unaccustomed garments were as heavy to him as a suit of armour  there was therefore nothing more said about clothes marie was to dispense her soup as usualexpressing a confident assurance that if peter were as yet to attempt this special branch of duty the whole supper would collapseand then she was to take her place at the table next to her uncle  everybody in the house everybody in granpere knew that the marriage had been arranged and the old lady who had been so dreadfully snubbed by marie had forgiven the offence acknowledging that maries position on that evening had been one of difficulty  but these arrangements had reference only to two days  after two days adrian was to return to basle and to be seen no more at granpere till he came to claim his bride  in regard to the choice of the day michel declared roundly that no constraint should be put upon marie  she should have her full privileges and no one should be allowed to interfere with her  on this point marie had brought herself to be almost indifferent  a long engagement was a state of things which would have been quite incompatible with such a betrothal  any delay that could have been effected would have been a delay not of months but of daysor at most of a week or two she had made up her mind that she would not be afraid of her wedding  she would teach herself to have no dread either of the man or of the thing  he was not a bad man and marriage in itself was honourable  she formed ideas also of some future true friendship for her husband  she would endeavour to have a true solicitude for his interests and would take care at any rate that nothing was squandered that came into her hands  of what avail would it be to her that she should postpone for a few days the beginning of a friendship that was to last all her life  such postponement could only be induced by a dread of the man and she was firmly determined that she would not dread him  when they asked her therefore she smiled and said very little  what did her aunt think  her aunt thought that the marriage should be settled for the earliest possible daythough she never quite expressed her thoughts  madame voss though she did not generally obtain much credit for clear seeing had a clearer insight to the state of her nieces mind than had her husband  she still believed that maries heart was not with adrian urmand  but attributing perhaps no very great importance to a young girls heart and fancying that she knew that in this instance the young girls heart could not have its own way she was quite in favour of the urmand marriage  and if they were to be married the sooner the better  of that she had no doubt  its best to have it over always as soon as possible she said to her husband in private nodding her head and looking much wiser than usual  i wont have marie hurried said michel  we had better say some day next month my dear said madame voss again nodding her head  michel struck by the peculiarity of her voice looked into her face and saw the unaccustomed wisdom  he made no answer but after a while nodded his head also and went out of the room a man convinced  there were matters between women he thought which men can never quite understand  it would be very bad if there should be any slip here between the cup and the lip and no doubt his wife was right  it was madame voss at last who settled the daythe 15th of october just four weeks from the present time  this she did in concert with adrian urmand who however was very docile in her hands  urmand after he had been accepted soon managed to bring himself back to that state of mind in which he had before regarded the possession of marie bromar as very desirable  for some fourandtwenty hours during which he had thought himself to be illused and had meditated a retreat from granpere he had contrived to teach himself that he might possibly live without her but as soon as he was accepted and when the congratulations of the men and women of granpere were showered down upon him in quick successionso that the fact that the thing was to be became assured to himhe soon came to fancy again that he was a man as successful in love as he was in the worlds good and that this acquisition of maries hand was a treasure in which he could take delight  he undoubtedly would be ready by the day named and would go home and prepare everything for maries arrival  they were very little together as lovers during those two days but it was necessary that there should be an especial parting  she is upstairs in the little sittingroom aunt josey said and upstairs to the little sittingroom adrian urmand went  i am come to say goodbye said urmand  goodbye adrian said marie putting both her hands in his and offering her cheek to be kissed  i shall come back with such joy for the 15th said he  she smiled and kissed his cheek and still held his hand adrian she said  my love  as i believe in the dear jesus i will do my best to be a good wife to you  then he took her in his arms and kissed her close and went out of the room with tears streaming down his cheeks  he knew now that he was in truth a happy man and that god had been good to him in this matter of his future wife    chapter x  so your cousin marie is to be married to adrian urmand the young linenmerchant at basle said madame faragon one morning to george voss  in this manner were the first assured tidings of the coming marriage conveyed to the rival lover  this occurred a day or two after the betrothal when adrian was back at basle  no one at granpere had thought of writing an express letter to george on the subject  georges father might have done so had the writing of letters been a customary thing with him but his correspondence was not numerous and such letters as he did write were short and always confined to matters concerning his trade  madame voss had however sent a special message to madame faragon as soon as adrian had gone thinking that it would be well that in this way george should learn the truth  it had been fully arranged by this time that george voss was to be the landlord of the hotel at colmar on and from the first day of the following year  madame faragon was to be allowed to sit in the little room downstairs to scold the servants and to make the strangers from a distance believe that her authority was unimpaired she was also to receive a moderate annual pension in money in addition to her board and lodging  for these considerations and on condition that george voss should expend a certain sum of money in renewing the faded glories of the house he was to be the landlord in full enjoyment of all real power on the first of january following  madame faragon when she had expressed her agreement to the arrangement which was indeed almost in all respects one of her own creation wept and wheezed and groaned bitterly  she declared that she would soon be dead and so trouble him no more nevertheless she especially stipulated that she should have a new armchair for her own use and that the feather bed in her own chamber should be renewed  so your cousin marie is to be married to adrian urmand the young linenmerchant at basle said madame faragon  who says so demanded george  he asked his question in a quiet voice but though the news had reached him thus suddenly he had sufficient control over himself to prevent any plain expression of his feelings  the thing which had been told him had gone into his heart like a knife but he did not intend that madame faragon should know that he had been wounded  it is quite true  there is no doubt about it  stodels man with the roulage brought me word direct from your stepmother  george immediately began to inquire within himself why stodels man with the roulage had not brought some word direct to him and answered the question to himself not altogether incorrectly  o yes continued madame faragon it is quite trueon the 15th of october i suppose you will be going over to the wedding  this she said in her usual whining tone of small complaint signifying thereby how great would be the grievance to herself to be left alone at that special time  i shall not go to the wedding said george  they can be married if they are to be married without me  they are to be married you may be quite sure of that  madame faragons grievance now consisted in the amount of doubt which was being thrown on the tidings which had been sent direct to her  of course you will choose to have a doubt because it is i who tell you  i do not doubt it at all  i think it is very likely  i was well aware before that my father wished it  of course he would wish it george  how should he not wish it marie bromar never had a franc of her own in her life and it is not to be expected that he with a family of young children at his heels is to give her a dot  he will give her something  he will treat her as though she were a daughter  then i think he ought not  but your father was always a romantic headstrong man  at any rate there she isbarmaid as we may say in the hotelmuch the same as our floschen here and of course such a marriage as this is a great thing a very great thing indeed  how should they not wish it  o if she likes him  like him  of course she will like him  why should she not like him  young and goodlooking with a fine business doesnt owe a sou ill be bound and with a houseful of furniture  of course shell like him  i dont suppose there is so much difficulty about that  i daresay not said george  i believe that womens likings go after that fashion for the most part  madame faragon not understanding this general sarcasm against her sex continued the expression of her opinion about the coming marriage  i dont suppose anybody will think of blaming marie bromar for accepting the match when it was proposed to her  of course she would do as she was bidden and could hardly be expected to say that the man was above her  he is not above her said george in a hoarse voice  marie bromar is nothing to you george nothing in blood nothing beyond a most distant cousin  they do say that she has grown up goodlooking  yesshe is a handsome girl  when i remember her as a child she was broad and dumpy and they always come back at last to what they were as children  but of course m urmand only looks to what she is now  she makes her hay while the sun shines but i hope the people wont say that your father has caught him at the lion dor and taken him in  my father is not the man to care very much what anybody says about such things  perhaps not so much as he ought george said madame faragon shaking her head  after that george voss went about the house for some hours doing his work giving his orders and going through the usual routine of his days business  as he did so no one guessed that his mind was disturbed  madame faragon had not the slightest suspicion that the matter of maries marriage was a cause of sorrow to him  she had felt the not unnatural envy of a womans mind in such an affair and could not help expressing it although marie bromar was in some sort connected with herself  but she was sure that such an arrangement would be regarded as a family triumph by georgeunless indeed he should be inclined to quarrel with his father for overgenerosity in that matter of the dot  it is lucky that you got your little bit of money before this affair was settled said she  it would not have made the difference of a copper sou said george voss as he walked angrily out of the old womans room  this was in the evening after supper and the greater part of the day had passed since he had first heard the news  up to the present moment he had endeavoured to shake the matter off from him declaring to himself that griefor at least any outward show of griefwould be unmanly and unworthy of him  with a strong resolve he had fixed his mind upon the affairs of his house and had allowed himself to meditate as little as might be possible  but the misery the agony had been then present with him during all those hoursand had been made the sharper by his endeavours to keep it down and banish it from his thoughts  now as he went out from madame faragons room having finished all that it was his duty to do he strolled into the town and at once began to give way to his thoughts  of course he must think about it  he acknowledged that it was useless for him to attempt to get rid of the matter and let it be as though there were no such persons in the world as marie bromar and adrian urmand  he must think about it but he might so give play to his feelings that no one should see him in the moments of his wretchedness  he went out therefore among the dark walks in the town garden and there as he paced one alley after another in the gloom he revelled in the agony which a passionate man feels when the woman whom he loves is to be given into the arms of another  as he thought of his own life during the past year or fifteen months he could not but tell himself that his present suffering was due in some degree to his own fault  if he really loved this girl and if it had been his intention to try and win her for himself why had he taken his father at his word and gone away from granpere and why having left granpere had he taken no trouble to let her know that he still loved her  as he asked himself these questions he was hardly able himself to understand the pride which had driven him away from his old home and which had kept him silent so long she had promised him that she would be true to him  then had come those few words from his fathers mouth words which he thought his father should never have spoken to him and he had gone away telling himself that he would come back and fetch her as soon as he could offer her a home independently of his father  if after the promises she had made to him she would not wait for him without farther words and farther vows she would not be worth the having in going he had not precisely told himself that there should be no intercourse between them for twelve months but the silence which he had maintained and his continued absence had been the consequence of the mood of his mind and the tenor of his purpose  the longer he had been away from granpere without tidings from any one there the less possible had it been that he should send tidings from himself to his old home  he had not expected messages  he had not expected any letter  but when nothing came he told himself over and over again that he too would be silent and would bide his time  then edmond greisse had come to colmar and brought the first rumour of adrian urmands proposal of marriage  the reader will perhaps remember that george when he heard this first rumour had at once made up his mind to go over to granpere and that he went  he went to granpere partly believing and partly disbelieving edmonds story  if it were untrue perhaps she might say a word to him that would comfort him and give him new hope  if it were true she would have to tell him so and then he would say a word to her that should tear her heart if her heart was to be reached  but he would never let her know that she had torn his own to rags  that was the pride of his manliness and yet he was so boyish as not to know that it should have been for him to make those overtures for a renewal of love which he hoped that marie would make to him  he had gone over to granpere and the reader will perhaps again remember what had passed then between him and marie just as he was leaving her he had asked her whether she was to be married to this man  he had made no objection to such a marriage he had spoken no word of the constancy of his own affection  in his heart there had been anger against her because she had spoken no such word to himas of course there was also in her heart against him very bitter and very hot  if he wished her to be true to him why did he not say so  if he had given her up why did he come there at all  why did he ask any questions about her marriage if on his own behalf he had no statement to makeno assurance to give  what was her marriage or her refusal to be married to him was she to tell him that as he had deserted her and as she could not busy herself to overcome her love therefore she was minded to wear the willow for ever  if my uncle and aunt choose to dispose of me i cannot help it she had said  then he had left her and she had been sure that for him that early game of love was a game altogether played out  now as he walked along the dark paths of the town garden something of the truth came upon him  he made no excuse for marie bromar  she had given him a vow and should have been true to her vow so he said to himself a dozen times  he had never been false  he had shown no sign of falseness  true of heart he had remained away from her only till he might come and claim her and bring her to a house that he could call his own this also he told himself a dozen times  but nevertheless there was a very agony of remorse a weight of repentance in that he had not striven to make sure of his prize when he had been at granpere before the marriage was settled  had she loved him as she ought to have loved him had she loved him as he loved her there should have been no question possible to her of marriage with another man  but still he repented in that he had lost that which he desired and might perhaps have then obtained it for himself  but the strong feeling of his breast the strongest next to his love was a desire to be revenged  he cared little now for his father little for that personal dignity which he had intended to return by his silence little for pecuniary advantages and prudential motives in comparison with his strong desire to punish marie for her perfidy  he would go over to granpere and fall among them like a thunderbolt  like a thunderbolt at any rate he would fall upon the head of marie bromar  the very words of her lovepromises were still firm in his memory and he would see if she also could be made to remember them  i shall go over to granpere the day after tomorrow he said to madame faragon as he caught her just before she retired for the night  to granpere the day after tomorrow  and why  well i dont know that i can say exactly why  i shall not be at the marriage but i should like to see them first  i shall go the day after tomorrow  and he went to granpere on the day he fixed    chapter xi  probably one night only but i wont make any promise george had said to madame faragon when she asked him how long he intended to stay at granpere  as he took one of the horses belonging to the inn and drove himself it seemed to be certain that he would not stay long  he started all alone early in the morning and reached granpere about twelve oclock  his mind was full of painful thoughts as he went and as the little animal ran quickly down the mountain road into the valley in which granpere lies he almost wished that his feet were not so fleet  what was he to say when he got to granpere and to whom was he to say it  when he reached the angular court along two sides of which the house was built he did not at once enter the front door  none of the family were then about the place and he could therefore go into the stable and ask a question or two of the man who came to meet him  his father the man told him had gone up early to the woodcutting and would not probably return till the afternoon madame voss was no doubt inside as was also marie bromar  then the man commenced an elaborate account of the betrothals  there never had been at granpere any marriage that had been half so important as would be this marriage no lover coming thither had ever been blessed with so beautiful and discreet a maiden and no maiden of granpere had ever before had at her feet a lover at the same time so goodlooking so wealthy so sagacious and so goodtempered  the man declared that adrian was the luckiest fellow in the world in finding such a wife but his enthusiasm rose to the highest pitch when he spoke of maries luck in finding such a husband  there was no end to the good with which she would be endowedlinen said the man holding up his hands in admiration that will last out all her grandchildren at least  george listened to it all and smiled and said a word or twowas it worth his while to come all the way to granpere to throw his thunderbolt at a girl who had been captivated by promises of a chest full of house linen  george told the man that he would go up to the woodcutting after his father but before he was out of the court he changed his mind and slowly entered the house  why should he go to his father  what had he to say to his father about the marriage that could not be better said down at the house  after all he had but little ground of complaint against his father  it was marie who had been untrue to him and it was on maries head that his wrath must fall  no doubt his father would be angry with him when he should have thrown his thunderbolt  it could not as he thought be hurled effectually without his fathers knowledge but he need not tell his father the errand on which he had come  so he changed his mind and went into the inn  he entered the house almost dreading to see her whom he was seeking in what way should he first express his wrath  how should he show her the wreck which by her inconstancy she had made of his happiness  his first words must if possible be spoken to her alone and yet alone he could hardly hope to find her  and he feared her  though he was so resolved to speak his mind yet he feared her  though he intended to fill her with remorse yet he dreaded the effect of her words upon himself  he knew how strong she could be and how steadfast  though his passion told him every hour was telling him all day long that she was as false as hell yet there was something in him of judgment something rather of instinct which told him also that she was not bad that she was a firmhearted highspirited greatminded girl who would have reasons to give for the thing that she was doing  he went through into the kitchen before he met any one and there he found madame voss with the cook and peter  immediate explanations had of course to be made as to his unexpected arrivalquestions asked and suggestions offeredcame he in peace or came he in war  had he come because he had heard of the betrothals  he admitted that it was so  and you are glad of it asked madame voss  you will congratulate her with all your heart  i will congratulate her certainly said george  then the cook and peter began with a copious flow of domestic eloquence to declare how great a marriage this was for the lion dorhow pleasing to the master how creditable to the village how satisfactory to the friends how joyous to the bridegroom how triumphant to the bride no doubt she will have plenty to eat and drink and fine clothes to wear and an excellent house over her head said george in his bitterness  and she will be married to one of the most respectable young men in all switzerland said madame voss in a tone of much anger  it was already quite clear to madame voss to the cook and to peter that george had not come over from colmar simply to express his joyous satisfaction at his cousins good fortune  he soon walked through into the little sittingroom and his stepmother followed him  george she said you will displease your father very much if you say anything unkind about marie  i know very well said he that my father cares more for marie than he does for me  that is not so george  i do not blame him for it  she lives in the house with him while i live elsewhere  it was natural that she should be more to him than i am after he had sent me away  but he has no right to suppose that i can have the same feeling that he has about this marriage  i cannot think it the finest thing in the world for all of us that marie bromar should succeed in getting a rich young man for her husband who as far as i can see never had two ideas in his head  he is a most industrious young man who thoroughly understands his business  i have heard people say that there is no one comes to granpere who can buy better than he can  very likely not  and at any rate it is no disgrace to be well off  it is a disgrace to think more about that than anything else  but never mind  it is no use talking about it words wont mend it  why then have you come here now  because i want to see my father  then he remembered how false was this excuse and remembered also how soon its falseness would appear  besides though i do not like this match i wish to see marie once again before her marriage  i shall never see her after it  that is the reason why i have come  i suppose you can give me a bed  o yes there are beds enough  after that there was some pause and madame voss hardly knew how to treat her stepson  at last she asked him whether he would have dinner and an order was given to peter to prepare something for the young master in the small room and george asked after the children and in this way the dreaded subject was for some minutes laid on one side  in the mean time information of georges arrival had been taken upstairs to marie  she had often wondered what sign he would make when he should hear of her engagement  would he send her a word of affection or such customary present as would be usual between two persons so nearly connected  would he come to her marriage  and what would be his own feelings  she too remembered well with absolute accuracy those warm delicious heavenly words of love which had passed between them  she could feel now the pressure of his hand and the warmth of his kiss when she swore to him that she would be his for ever and ever  after that he had left her and for a year had sent no token  then he had come again and had simply asked her whether she were engaged to another man had asked with a cruel indication that he at least intended that the old childish words should be forgotten  now he was in the house again and she would have to hear his congratulations  she thought for some quarter of an hour what she had better do and then she determined to go down to him at once  the sooner the first meeting was over the better  were she to remain away from him till they should be brought together at the suppertable there would almost be a necessity for her to explain her conduct  she would go down to him and treat him exactly as she might have done had there never been any special love between them  she would do so as perfectly as her strength might enable her and if she failed in aught it would be better to fail before her aunt than in the presence of her uncle  when she had resolved she waited yet another minute or two and then she went downstairs  as she entered her aunts room george voss was sitting before the stove while madame voss was in her accustomed chair and peter was preparing the table for his young masters dinner  george arose from his seat at once and then came a look of pain across his face marie saw it at once and almost loved him the more because he suffered  i am so glad to see you george she said  i am so glad that you have come  she had offered him her hand and of course he had taken it  yes he said i thought it best just to run over  we shall be very busy at the hotel before long  does that mean to say that you are not to be here for my marriage this she said with her sweetest smile making all the effort in her power to give a gracious tone to her voice  it was better she knew to plunge at the subject at once  no said he  i shall not be here then  ahyour father will miss you so much  but if it cannot be it is very good of you to come now  there would have been something sad in going away from the old house without seeing you once more  and though colmar and basle are very near it will not be the same as in the dear old homewill it george  there was a touch about her voice as she called him by his name that nearly killed him  at that moment his hatred was strongest against adrian  why had such an upstart as that a puny miserable creature come between him and the only thing that he had ever seen in the guise of a woman that could touch his heart  he turned round with his back to the table and his face to the stove and said nothing  but he was able when he no longer saw her when her voice was not sounding in his ear to swear that the thunderbolt should be hurled all the same  his journey to granpere should not be made for nothing  i must go now she said presently  i shall see you at supper shall i not george when uncle will be with us  uncle michel will be so delighted to find you  and you will tell us of the new doings at the hotel  goodbye for the present george  then she was gone before he had spoken another word  he eat his dinner and smoked a cigar about the yard and then said that he would go out and meet his father  he did go out but did not take the road by which he knew that his father was to be found he strolled off to the ravine and came back only when it was dark the meeting between him and his father was kindly but there was no special word spoken and thus they all sat down to supper    chapter xii  it became necessary as george voss sat at supper with his father and madame voss that he should fix the time of his return to colmar and he did so for the early morning of the next day but one  he had told madame faragon that he expected to stay at granpere but one night  he felt however after his arrival that it might be difficult for him to get away on the following day and therefore he told them that he would sleep two nights at the lion dor and then start early so as to reach the colmar inn by midday  i suppose you find the old lady rather fidgety george said michel voss in high good humour  george found it easier to talk about madame faragon and the hotel at colmar than he did of things at granpere and therefore became communicative as to his own affairs  michel too preferred the subject of the new doings at the house on the other side of the vosges  his wife had given him a slight hint doing her best like a good wife and discreet manager to prevent illhumour and hard words  he feels a little sore you know  i was always sure there was something  but it was wise of him to come and see her and it will go off in this way  michel swore that george had no right to be sore and that if his son did not take pride in such a family arrangement as this he should no longer be son of his  but he allowed himself to be counselled by his wife and soon talked himself into a pleasant mood discussing madame faragon and the horses belonging to the hotel de la poste and colmar affairs in general  there was a certain important ground for satisfaction between them  everybody agreed that george voss had shown himself to be a steady man of business in the affairs of the inn at colmar  marie bromar in the mean while went on with her usual occupation round the room but now and again came and stood at her uncles elbow joining in the conversation and asking a question or two about madame faragon  there was perhaps something of the guile of the serpent joined to her dovelike softness  she asked questions and listened to answersnot that in her present state of mind she could bring herself to take a deep interest in the affairs of madame faragons hotel but because it suited her that there should be some subject of easy conversation between her and george  it was absolutely necessary now that george should be nothing more to her than a cousin and an acquaintance but it was well that he should be that and not an enemy  it would be well too that he should know that he should think that he knew that she was disturbed by no remembrance of those words which had once passed between them  at last she trusted herself to a remark which perhaps she would not have made had the serpents guile been more perfect of its kind  surely you must get a wife george as soon as the house is your own  of course he will get a wife said the father  i hope he will get a good one said madame voss after a short pausewhich however had been long enough to make her feel it necessary to say something  george said never a word but lifted his glass and finished his wine  marie at once perceived that the subject was one on which she must not venture to touch again  indeed she saw farther than that and became aware that it would be inexpedient for her to fall into any special or minute conversation with her cousin during his short stay at granpere  youll go up to the woods with me tomorroweh george said the father  the son of course assented  it was hardly possible that he should not assent  the whole day moreover would not be wanted for that purpose of throwing his thunderbolt and if he could get it thrown it would be well that he should be as far away from marie as possible for the remainder of his visit  well start early marie and have a bit of breakfast before we go  will six be too early for you george with your town ways  george said that six would not be too early and as he made the engagement for the morning he resolved that he would if possible throw his thunderbolt that night marie will get us a cup of coffee and a sausage  marie is always up by that time  marie smiled and promised that they should not be compelled to start upon their walk with empty stomachs from any fault of hers if a hot breakfast at six oclock in the morning could put her cousin into a good humour it certainly should not be wanting  in two hours after supper george was with his father  michel was so full of happiness and so confidential that the son found it very difficult to keep silence about his own sorrow  had it not been that with a half obedience to his wifes hints michel said little about adrian there must have been an explosion  he endeavoured to confine himself to georges prospects as to which he expressed himself thoroughly pleased  you see said he i am so strong of my years that if you wished for my shoes there is no knowing how long you might be kept waiting  it couldnt have been too long said george  ah well i dont believe you would have been impatient to put the old fellow under the sod  but i should have been impatient i should have been unhappy  you might have had the woods to be sure but its hardly enough of a business alone  besides a young man is always more his own master away from his father  i can understand that  the only thing is georgetake a drive over and see us sometimes  this was all very well but it was not quite so well when he began to speak of marie  its a terrible loss her going you know george i shall feel it sadly  i can understand that said george  but of course i had my duty to do to the girl  i had to see that she should be well settled and she will be well settled  theres a comfort in thatisnt there george  but george could not bring himself to reply to this with goodhumoured zeal and there came for a moment a cloud between the father and son but michel was wise and swallowed his wrath and in a minute or two returned to colmar and madame faragon  at about halfpast nine george escaped from his father and returned to the house  they had been sitting in the balcony which runs round the billiardroom on the side of the court opposite to the front door  he returned to the house and caught marie in one of the passages upstairs as she was completing her work for the day  he caught her close to the door of his own room and asked her to come in that he might speak a word to her  english readers will perhaps remember that among the vosges mountains there is less of a sense of privacy attached to bedrooms than is the case with us here in england  marie knew immediately then that her cousin had not come to granpere for nothinghad not come with the innocent intention of simply pleasing his fatherhad not come to say an ordinary word of farewell to her before her marriage  there was to be something of a scene though she could not tell of what nature the scene might be  she knew however that her own conduct had been right and therefore though she would have avoided the scene had it been possible she would not fear it  she went into his room and when he closed the door she smiled and did not as yet tremble  marie he said i have come here on purpose to say a word or two to you  there was no smile on her face as he spoke now  the intention to be savage was written there as plainly as any purpose was ever written on mans countenance  marie read the writing without missing a letter  she was to be rebuked and sternly rebukedrebuked by the man who had taken her heart and then left herrebuked by the man who had crushed her hopes and made it absolutely necessary for her to give up all the sweet poetry of her life to forget her dreams to abandon every wishedfor prettiness of existence and confine herself to duties and to things material he who had so sinned against her was about to rid himself of the burden of his sin by endeavouring to cast it upon her  so much she understood but yet she did not understand all that was to come she would hear the rebuke as quietly as she might  in the interest of others she would do so  but she would not fear himand she would say a quiet word in defence of her own sex if there should be need  such was the purport of her mind as she stood opposite to him in his room  i hope they will be kind words she said  as we are to part so soon there should be none unkind spoken  i do not know much about kindness he replied  then he paused and tried to think how best the thunderbolt might be hurled  there is hardly room for kindness where there was once so much more than kindness where there was so much moreor the pretence of it then he waited again as though he expected that she should speak but she would not speak at all  if he had aught to say let him say it  perhaps marie you have in truth forgotten all the promises you once made me  though this was a direct question she would not answer it  her words to him should be as few as possible and the time for such words had not come as yet  it suits you no doubt to forget them now but i cannot forget them  you have been false to me and have broken my heart  you have been false to me when my only joy on earth was in believing in your truth  your vow was for ever and ever and within one short year you are betrothed to another man  and whybecause they tell you that he is rich and has got a house full of furniture  you may prove to be a blessing to his house  who can say  on mine you and your memory will be a curselasting all my lifetime  and so the thunderbolt had been hurled  and it fell as a thunderbolt  what she had expected had not been at all like to this  she had known that he would rebuke her but feeling strong in her own innocence and her own purity knowing or thinking that she knew that the fault had all been his not believinghaving got rid of all beliefthat he still loved her she had fancied that his rebuke would be unjust cruel but bearable  nay she had thought that she could almost triumph over him with a short word of reply  she had expected from him reproach but not love  there was reproach indeed but it came with an expression of passion of which she had not known him to be capable he stood before her telling her that she had broken his heart and as he told her so his words were half choked by sobs  he reminded her of her promises declaring that his own to her had ever remained in full force  and he told her that she she to whom he had looked for all his joy had become a curse to him and a blight upon his life  there were thoughts and feelings too beyond all these that crowded themselves upon her heart and upon her mind at the moment it had been possible for her to accept the hand of adrian urmand because she had become assured that george voss no longer regarded her as his promised bride  she would have stood firm against her uncle and her aunt she would have stood against all the world had it not seemed to her that the evidence of her cousins indifference was complete  had not that evidence been complete at all points it would have been impossible to her to think of becoming the wife of another man  now the evidence on that matter which had seemed to her to be so sufficient was all blown to the winds  it is true that had all her feelings been guided by reason only she might have been as strong as ever  in truth she had not sinned against him  in truth she had not sinned at all  she had not done that which she herself had desired  she had not been anxious for wealth or ease or position but had after painful thought endeavoured to shape her conduct by the wishes of others and by her ideas of duty as duty had been taught to her  o how willingly would she have remained as servant to her uncle and have allowed m urmand to carry the rich gift of his linenchest to the feet of some other damsel had she believed herself to be free to choose  had there been no passion in her heart she would now have known herself to be strong in duty and would have been able to have answered and to have borne the rebuke of her old lover  but passion was there hot within her aiding every word as he spoke it giving strength to his complaints telling her of all that she had lost telling her of all she had taken from him  she forgot to remember now that he had been silent for a year  she forgot now to think of the tone in which he had asked about her marriage when no such marriage was in her mind  but she remembered well the promise she had made and the words of it  your vow was for ever and ever  when she heard those words repeated from his lips her heart too was broken  all idea of holding herself before him as one injured but ready to forgive was gone from her  if by falling at his feet and owning herself to be vile and mansworn she might get his pardon she was ready now to lie there on the ground before him  o george she said o george  what is the use of that now he replied turning away from her he had thrown his thunderbolt and he had nothing more to say  he had seen that he had not thrown it quite in vain and he would have been contented to be away and back at colmar  what more was there to be said  she came to him very gently very humbly and just touched his arm with her hand  do you mean george that you have continued to care for mealways  care for you  i know not what you call caring  did i not swear to you that i would love you for ever and ever and that you should be my own  did i not leave this house and go awaytill i could earn for you one that should be fit for youbecause i loved you  why should i have broken my word  i do not believe that you thought that it was broken  by my god that knows me i did  as she said this she burst into tears and fell on her knees at his feet  marie he said mariethere is no use in this  stand up  not till you tell me that you will forgive me  by the name of the good jesus who knows all our hearts i thought that you had forgotten me  o george if you could know all  if you could know how i have loved you how i have sorrowed from day to day because i was forgotten  how i have struggled to bear it telling myself that you were away with all the world to interest you and not like me a poor girl in a village with no thing to think of but my lover how i have striven to do my duty by my uncle and have obeyed him becausebecausebecause there was nothing left  if you could know it all  if you could know it all  then she clasped her arms round his legs and hid her face upon his feet  and whom do you love now he asked  she continued to sob but did not answer him a word  then he stooped down and raised her to her feet and she stood beside him very near to him with her face averted  and whom do you love now he asked again  is it me or is it adrian urmand  but she could not answer him though she had said enough in her passionate sorrow to make any answer to such a question unnecessary as far as knowledge on the subject might be required  it might suit his views that she should confess the truth in so many words but for other purpose her answer had been full enough  this is very sad he said sad indeed but i thought that you would have been firmer  do not chide me again george  noit is to no purpose  you said that i wasa curse to you  o marie i had hopedi had so hoped that you would have been my blessing  say that i am not a curse to you george  but he would make no answer to this appeal no immediate answer but stood silent and stern while she stood still touching his arm waiting in patience for some word at any rate of forgiveness  he was using all the powers of his mind to see if there might even yet be any way to escape this great shipwreck  she had not answered his question  she had not told him in so many words that her heart was still his though she had promised her hand to the basle merchant but he could not doubt that it was so  as he stood there silent with that dark look upon his brow which he had inherited from his father and that angry fire in his eye his heart was in truth once more becoming soft and tender towards her  he was beginning to understand how it had been with her  he had told her just now that he did not believe her when she assured him that she had thought that she was forgotten  now he did believe her  and there arose in his breast a feeling that it was due to her that he should explain this change in his mind  i suppose you did think it he said suddenly  think what george  that i was a vain empty falsetongued fellow whose word was worth no reliance  i thought no evil of you georgeexcept that you were changed to me  when you came you said nothing to me  do you not remember  i came because i was told that you were to be married to this man i asked you the question and you would not deny it  then i said to myself that i would wait and see  when he had spoken she had nothing farther to say to him  the charges which he made against her were all true  they seemed at least to be true to her then in her present moodin that mood in which all that she now desired was his forgiveness  the wish to defend herself and to stand before him as one justified had gone from her  she felt that having still possessed his love having still been the owner of the one thing that she valued she had ruined herself by her own doubts and she could not forgive herself the fatal blunder  it is of no use to think of it any more he said at last  you have to become this mans wife now and i suppose you must go through with it  i suppose i must she said unless  unless what  nothing george  of course i will marry him  he has my word  and i have promised my uncle also  but george you will say that you forgive me  yesi will forgive you  but still there was the same black cloud upon his facethe same look of painthe same glance of anger in his eye  o george i am so unhappy  there can be no comfort for me now unless you will say that you will be contented  i cannot say that marie  you will have your house and your business and so many things to interest you  and in timeafter a little time  no marie after no time at all  you told me at supper tonight that i had better get a wife for myself  but i will get no wife  i could not bring myself to marry another girl i could not take a woman home as my wife if i did not love her  if she were not the person of all persons most dear to me i should loathe her  he was speaking daggers to her and he must have known how sharp were his words  he was speaking daggers to her and she must have felt that he knew how he was wounding her  but yet she did not resent his usage even by a motion of her lip  could she have brought herself to do so her agony would have been less sharp  i suppose she said at last that a woman is weaker than a man  but you say that you will forgive me  i have forgiven you  then very gently she put out her hand to him and he took it and held it for a minute  she looked up at him as though for a moment she had thought that there might be something elsethat there might be some other token of true forgiveness and then she withdrew her hand  i had better go now she said  goodnight george  goodnight marie  and then she was gone  as soon as he was alone he sat himself down on the bedside and began to think of it  everything was changed to him since he had called her into the room determining that he would crush her with his thunderbolt  let things go as they may with a man in an affair of love let him be as far as possible from the attainment of his wishes there will always be consolation to him if he knows that he is loved  to be preferred to all others even though that preference may lead to no fruition is in itself a thing enjoyable he had believed that marie had forgotten himthat she had been captivated either by the effeminate prettiness of his rival or by his wealth and standing in the world  he believed all this no more he knew now how it was with her and with him and let his countenance say what it might to the contrary he could bring himself to forgive her in his heart  she had not forgotten him she had not ceased to love him  there was merit in that which went far with him in excuse of her perfidy  but what should he do now  she was not as yet married to adrian urmand  might there not still be hope hope for her sake as well as for his own  he perfectly understood that in his countrynay for aught he knew to the contrary in all countriesa formal betrothal was half a marriage  it was half the ceremony in the eyes of all those concerned but yet in regard to that indissoluble bond which would indeed have divided marie from him beyond the reach of any hope to the contrary such betrothal was of no effect whatever this man whom she did not love was not yet maries husbandneed never become so if marie could only be sufficiently firm in resisting the influence of all her friends  no priest could marry her without her own consent  hegeorgehe himself would have to face the enmity of all those with whom he was connected  he was sure that his father having been a party to the betrothal would never consent to a breach of his promise to urmand  madame voss madame faragon the priest and their protestant pastor would all be against them  they would be as it were outcasts from their own family  but george voss sitting there on his bedside thought that he could go through it all if only he could induce marie bromar to bear the brunt of the worlds displeasure with him  as he got into bed he determined that he would begin upon the matter to his father during the mornings walk  his father would be full of wrathbut the wrath would have to be endured sooner or later    chapter xiii  on the next morning michel voss and his son met in the kitchen and found marie already there  well my girl said michel as he patted maries shoulder and kissed her forehead youve been up getting a rare breakfast for these fellows i see  marie smiled and made some goodhumoured reply  no one could have told by her face that there was anything amiss with her  its the last favour of the kind hell ever have at your hands continued michel and yet he doesnt seem to be half grateful  george stood with his back to the kitchen fire and did not say a word  it was impossible for him even to appear to be pleasant when such things were being said  marie was a better hypocrite and though she said little was able to look as though she could sympathise with her uncles pleasant mirth  the two men had soon eaten their breakfast and were gone and then marie was left alone with her thoughts  would george say anything to his father of what had passed upstairs on the previous evening  the two men started and when they were alone together and as long as michel abstained from talking about marie and her prospects george was able to converse freely with his father  when they left the house the morning was just dawning and the air was fresh and sharp  we shall soon have the frost here now said michel and then there will be no more grass for the cattle  i suppose they can have them out on the low lands till the end of november  they always used  yes they can have them out but having them out and having food for them are different things  the people here have so much stock now that directly the growth is checked by the frost the land becomes almost bare  they forget the old sayinghalf stocking whole profits whole stocking half profits  and then too i think the winters are earlier here than they used to be  theyll have to go back to the swiss plan i fancy and carry the food to the cattle in their houses  it may be oldfashioned as they say but i doubt whether the fodder does not go farther so  then as they began to ascend the mountain he got on to the subject of his own business and georges prospects  the dues to the commune are so heavy he said that in fact there is little or nothing to be made out of the timber  it looks like a business because many men are employed and its a kind of thing that spreads itself and bears looking at  but it leaves nothing behind  its not quite so bad as that i hope said george  upon my word then it is not much better my boy  when youve charged yourself with interest on the money spent on the mills there is not much to boast about  youre bound to replant every yard you strip and yet the commune expects as high a rent as when there was no planting to be done at all  they couldnt get it only that men like myself have their money in the mills and cant well get out of the trade  i dont think youd like to give it up father  well no  it gives me exercise and something to do  the women manage most of it down at the house but there must be a change when marie has gone  i have hardly looked it in the face yet but i know there must be a change  she has grown up among it till she has it all at her fingers ends  i tell you what george she is a girl in a hundreda girl in a hundred  she is going to marry a rich man and so it dont much signify but if she married a poor man she would be as good as a fortune to him  shed make a fortune for any man  thats my belief  there is nothing she doesnt know and nothing she doesnt understand  why did his father tell him all this  george thought of the day on which his father had as he was accustomed to say to himself turned him out of the house because he wanted to marry this girl who was as good as a fortune to any man  had he then been imprudent in allowing himself to love such a girl  could there be any good reason why his father should have wished that a fortune in every way so desirable should go out of the family  shell have nothing to do of that sort if she goes to basle said george moodily  that is more than you can say replied his father  a woman married to a man of business can always find her share in it if she pleases  and with such a one as adrian urmand her side of the house will not be the least considerable  i suppose he is little better than a fool said george  a fool  he is not a fool at all  if you were to see him buying you would not call him a fool  he is very far from a fool  it may be so  i do not know much of him myself  you should not be so prone to think men fools till you find them so especially those who are to be so near to yourself  nohes not a fool by any means  but he will know that he has got a clever wife and he will not be ashamed to make use of her  george was unwilling to contradict his father at the present moment as he had all but made up his mind to tell the whole story about himself and marie before he returned to the house  he had not the slightest idea that by doing so he would be able to soften his fathers heart  he was sure on the contrary that were he to do so he and his father would go back to the hotel as enemies  but he was quite resolved that the story should be told sooner or latershould be told before the day fixed for the wedding  if it was to be told by himself what occasion could be so fitting as the present  but if it were to be done on this morning it would be unwise to harass his father by any small previous contradictions  they were now up among the scattered prostrate logs and had again taken up the question of the business of woodcutting  no george it would never have done for you not as a mainstay  i thought of giving it up to you once but i knew that it would make a poor man of you  i wish you had said george who was unable to repress the feeling of his heart  why do you say that  what a fool you must be if you think it there is nothing you may not do where you are and you have got it all into your own hands with little or no outlay  the rent is nothing and the business is there ready made for you  in your position if you find the hotel is not enough there is nothing you cannot take up  they had now seated themselves on the trunk of a pine tree and michel voss having drawn a pipe from his pocket and filled it was lighting it as he sat upon the wood  no my boy he continued youll have a better life of it than your father i dont doubt  after all the towns are better than the country there is more to be seen and more to be learned  i dont complain the lord has been very good to me  ive had enough of everything and have been able to keep my head up  but i feel a little sad when i look forward  you and marie will both be gone and your stepmothers friend m le cure gondin does not make much society for me  i sometimes think when i am smoking a pipe up here all alone that this is the best of it allit will be when marie has gone  if his father thus thought of it why did he send marie away  if he thus thought of it why had he sent his son away  had it not already been within his power to keep both of them there together under his rooftree  he had insisted on dividing them and dismissing them from granpere one in one direction and the other in anotherand then he complained of being alone  surely his father was altogether unreasonable  and now one cant even get tobacco that is worth smoking continued michel in a melancholy tone  there used to be good tobacco but i dont know where it has all gone  i can send you over a little prime tobacco from colmar father  i wish you would george  this is foul stuff  but i sometimes think ill give it up  whats the use of it  a man sits and smokes and smokes and nothing comes of it  it dont feed him nor clothe him and it leaves nothing behindexcept a stink  youre a little down in the mouth father or you wouldnt talk of giving up smoking  i am down in the mouthterribly down in the mouth  till it was all settled i did not know how much i should feel maries going of course it had to be but it makes an old man of me  there will be nothing left  of course theres your stepmotheras good a woman as ever livedand the children but marie was somehow the soul of us all  give us another light george  im blessed if i can keep the fire in the pipe at all  and this thought george is in truth the state of my fathers mind  there are three of us concerned who are all equally dear to each other my father myself and marie bromar  there is not one of them who doesnt feel that the presence of the others is necessary to his happiness  here is my father declaring that the world will no longer have any savour for him because i am away in one place and marie is to be away in another  there is not the slightest real reason on earth why we should have been separated yet hehe alone has done it and wewe are to break our hearts over it  or rather he has not done it  he is about to do it  the sacrifice is not yet made and yet it must be made because my father is so unreasonable that no one will dare to point out to him where lies the way to his own happiness and to the happiness of those he loves  it was thus that george voss thought of it as he listened to his fathers wailings  but he himself though he was hot in temper was slow or at least deliberate in action  he did not even now speak out at once  when his fathers pipe was finished he suggested that they should go on to a certain run for the firlogs which he himselfgeorge vosshad madea steep grooved inclined plane by which the timber when cut in these parts could be sent down with a rush to the close neighbourhood of the sawmill below  they went and inspected the slide and discussed the question of putting new wood into the groove  michel with the melancholy tone that had prevailed with him all the morning spoke of matters as though any money spent in mending would be thrown away  there are moments in the lives of most of us in which it seems to us that there will never be more cakes and ale  george however talked of the children and reminded his father that in matters of business nothing is so ruinous as ruin  if youve got to get your money out of a thing it should always be in working order he said  michel acknowledged the truth of the rule but again declared that there was no money to be got out of the thing  he yielded however and promised that the repairs should be made  then they went down to the mill which was going at that time  george as he stood by and watched the man and boy adjusting the logs to the cradle and listened to the apparently selfacting saw as it did its work and observed the perfection of the simple machinery which he himself had adjusted and smelt the sweet scent of the newlymade sawdust and listened to the music of the little stream when between whiles the rattle of the mill would cease for half a minutegeorge as he stood in silence looking at all this listening to the sounds smelling the perfume thinking how much sweeter it all was than the little room in which madame faragon sat at colmar and in which it was at any rate for the present his duty to submit his accounts to her from time to timeresolved that he would at once make an effort  he knew his fathers temper well  might it not be that though there should be a quarrel for a time everything would come right at last  as for adrian urmand george did not believeor told himself that he did not believethat such a cur as he would suffer much because his hopes of a bride were not fulfilled  they stayed for an hour at the sawmill and michel in spite of all that he had said about tobacco smoked another pipe  while they were there george though his mind was full of other matter continued to give his father practical advice about the businesshow a new wheel should be supplied here and a lately invented improvement introduced there  each of them at the moment was careladen with special thoughts of his own but nevertheless as men of business they knew that the hour was precious and used it  to saunter into the woods and do nothing was not at all in accordance with michels usual mode of life and though he hummed and hawed and doubted and grumbled he took a note of all his son said and was quite of a mind to make use of his sons wit  i shall be over at epinal the day after tomorrow he said as they left the mill and ill see if i can get the new crank there  theyll be sure to have it at heinmans said george as they began to descend the hill  from the spot on which they had been standing the walk down to granpere would take them more than an hour  it might well be that they might make it an affair of two or three hours if they went up to other timbercuttings on their route but george was sure that as soon as he began to tell his story his father would make his way straight for home  he would be too much moved to think of his timber and too angry to desire to remain a minute longer than he could help in company with his son looking at all the circumstances as carefully as he could george thought that he had better begin at once  as you feel maries going so much he said i wonder that you are so anxious to send her away  thats a poor argument george and one that i should not have expected from you  am i to keep her here all her life doing no good for herself simply because i like to have her here  it is in the course of things that she should be married and it is my duty to see that she marries well  that is quite true father  then why do you talk to me about sending her away  i dont send her away  urmand comes and takes her away  i did the same when i was young  now im old and i have to be left behind  its the way of nature  but she doesnt want to be taken away said george rushing at once at his subject  what do you mean by that  just what i say father  she consents to be taken away but she does not wish it  i dont know what you mean  has she been talking to you  has she been complaining  i have been talking to her  i came over from colmar when i heard of this marriage on purpose that i might talk to her  i had at any rate a right to do that  right to do what  i dont know that you have any right  if you have been trying to do mischief in my house george i will never forgive younever  i will tell you the whole truth father and then you shall say yourself whether i have been trying to do mischief and shall say also whether you will forgive me  you will remember when you told me that i was not to think of marie bromar for myself  i do remember  well i had thought of her  if you wanted to prevent that you were too late  you were boys and girls together that is all  let me tell my story father and then you shall judge  before you had spoken to me at all marie had given me her troth  nonsense  let me at least tell my story  she had done so and i had given her mine and when you told me to go i went not quite knowing then what it might be best that we should do but feeling very sure that she would at least be true to me  truth to any such folly as that would be very wicked  at any rate i did nothing  i remained there month after month meaning to do something when this was settledmeaning to do something when that was settled and then there came a sort of rumour to me that marie was to be urmands wife  i did not believe it but i thought that i would come and see  it was true  noit was not true then  i came over and was very angry because she was cold to me  she would not promise that there should be no such engagement but there was none then  you see i will tell you everything as it occurred  she is at any rate engaged to adrian urmand now and for all our sakes you are bound not to interfere  but yet i must tell my story  i went back to colmar and then after a while there came tidings true tidings that she was engaged to this man  i came over again yesterday determinedyou may blame me if you will father but listen to medetermined to throw her falsehood in her teeth  then i will protect her from you said michel voss turning upon his son as though he meant to strike him with his staff  ah father said george pausing and standing opposite to the innkeeper but who is to protect her from you  if i had found that that which you are doing was making her happyi would have spoken my mind indeed i would have shown her once and once only what she had done to me how she had destroyed meand then i would have gone and troubled none of you any more  you had better go now and bring us no more trouble  you are all trouble  but her worst trouble will still cling to her  i have found that it is so  she has taken this man not because she loves him but because you have bidden her  she has taken him and she shall marry him  i cannot say that she has been right father but she deserves no such punishment as that  would you make her a wretched woman for ever because she has done wrong in striving to obey you  she has not done wrong in striving to obey me  she has done right i do not believe a word of this  you can ask her yourself  i will ask her nothingexcept that she shall not speak to you any farther about it  you have come here wilfullyminded to disturb us all  father that is unjust  i say it is true  she was contented and happy before you came she loves the man and is ready to marry him on the day fixed  of course she will marry him  you would not have us go back from our word now  certainly i would  if he be a man and she tells him that she repentsif she tells him all the truth of course he will give her back her troth  i would do so to any woman that only hinted that she wished it  no such hint shall be given  i will hear nothing of it  i shall not speak to marie on the subjectexcept to desire her to have no farther converse with you  nor will i speak of it again to yourself unless you wish me to bid you go from me altogether you will not mention the matter again  so saying michel voss strode on and would not even turn his eyes in the direction of his son he strode on making his way down the hill at the fastest pace that he could achieve every now and then raising his hat and wiping the perspiration from his brow  though he had spoken of maries departure as a loss that would be very hard to bear the very idea that anything should be allowed to interfere with the marriage which he had planned was unendurable  whatafter all that had been said and done consent that there should be no marriage between his niece and the rich young merchant  never  he did not stop for a moment to think how much of truth there might be in his sons statement he would not even allow himself to remember that he had forced adrian urmand as a suitor upon his niece  he had had his qualms of conscience upon that matterand it was possible that they might return to him  but he would not stop now to look at that side of the question  the young people were betrothed  the marriage was a thing settled and it should be celebrated  he had never broken his faith to any man and he would not break it to adrian urmand  he strode on down the mountain and there was not a word more said between him and his son till they reached the inn doors  you understand me he said then  not a word more to marie  after that he went up at once to his wifes chamber and desired that marie might be sent to him there  during his rapid walk home he had made up his mind as to what he would do  he would not be severe to his niece  he would simply ask her one question  my dear he said striving to be calm but telling her by his countenance as plainly as words could have done all that had passed between him and his sonmarie my dear i take it forgrantedthere is nothing tototo interrupt our plans  in what way uncle she asked merely wanting to gain a moment for thought  in any way  in no way  just say that there is nothing wrong and that will be sufficient  she stood silent not having a word to say to him  you know what i mean marie  you intend to marry adrian urmand  i suppose so said marie in a low whisper  look here marieif there be any doubt about it we will partand for ever  you shall never look upon my face again  my honour is pledgedand yours  then he hurried out of the room down into the kitchen and without staying there a moment went out into the yard and walked through to the stables  his passion had been so strong and uncontrollable that he had been unable to remain with his niece and exact a promise from her  george when he saw his father go through to the stables entered the house  he had already made up his mind that he would return at once to colmar without waiting to have more angry words  such words would serve him not at all  but he must if possible see marie and he must also tell his stepmother that he was about to depart  he found them both together and at once very abruptly declared that he was to start immediately  you have quarrelled with your father george said madame voss  i hope not  i hope that he has not quarrelled with me  but it is better that i should go  what is it george  i hope it is nothing serious  madame voss as she said this looked at marie but marie had turned her face away george also looked at her but could not see her countenance  he did not dare to ask her to give him an interview alone nor had he quite determined what he would say to her if they were together marie said madame voss do you know what this is about  i wish i had died said marie before i had come into this house i have made hatred and bitterness between those who should love each other better than all the world  then madame voss was able to guess what had been the cause of the quarrel  marie said george very slowly if you will only ask your own heart what you ought to do and be true to what it tells you there is no reason even yet that you should be sorry that you came to granpere  but if you marry a man whom you do not love you will sin against him and against me and against yourself and against god then he took up his hat and went out  in the courtyard he met his father  where are you going now george said his father  to colmar  it is better that i should go at once  goodbye father and he offered his hand to his parent  have you spoken to marie  my mother will tell you what i have said  i have spoken nothing in private  have you said anything about her marriage  yes  i have told her that she could not honestly marry the man she did not love  what right have you sir said michel nearly choked with wrath to interfere in the affairs of my household  you had better go and go at once  if you return again before they are married i will tell the servants to put you off the place  george voss made no answer but having found his horse and his gig drove himself off to colmar    chapter xiv  george voss as he drove back to colmar and thought of what had been done during the last twentyfour hours did not find that he had much occasion for triumph  he had indeed the consolation of knowing that the girl loved him and in that there was a certain amount of comfort  as he had ever been thinking about her since he had left granpere so also had she been thinking of him  his father had told him that they had been no more than children when they parted and had ridiculed the idea that any affection formed so long back and at so early an age should have lasted  but it had lasted and was now as strong in maries breast as it was in his own  he had learned this at any rate by his journey to granpere and there was something of consolation in the knowledge  but nevertheless he did not find that he could triumph  marie had been weak enough to yield to his father once and would yield to him he thought yet again  women in this respectas he told himselfwere different from men  they were taught by the whole tenor of their lives to submitunless they could conquer by underhand unseen means by little arts by coaxing and by tears  marie he did not doubt had tried all these and had failed  his fathers purpose had been too strong for her and she had yielded  having submitted once of course she would submit again  there was about his father a spirit of masterfulness which he was sure marie would not be able to withstand  and then there would bestrong against his interests george thoughtthat feeling so natural to a woman that as all the world had been told of her coming marriage she would be bound to go through with it  the idea of it had become familiar to her  she had conquered the repugnance which she must at first have felt and had made herself accustomed to regard this man as her future husband  and then there would be madame voss against him and m le cureboth of whom would think it infinitely better for maries future welfare that she should marry a roman catholic as was urmand than a protestant such as was he george voss  and then the money  even if he could bring himself to believe that the money was nothing to marie it would be so much to all those by whom marie would be surrounded that it would be impossible that she should be preserved from its influence  it is not often that young people really know each other but george certainly did not know marie bromar  in the first place though he had learned from her the secret of her heart he had not taught himself to understand how his own sullen silence had acted upon her he knew now that she had continued to love him but he did not know how natural it had been that she should have believed that he had forgotten her  he could not therefore understand how different must now be her feelings in reference to this marriage with adrian from what they had been when she had believed herself to be utterly deserted  and then he did not comprehend how thoroughly unselfish she had beenhow she had struggled to do her duty to others let the cost be what it might to herself  she had plighted herself to adrian urmand not because there had seemed to her to be any brightness in the prospect which such a future promised to her but because she did verily believe that circumstanced as she was it would be better that she should submit herself to her friends  all this george voss did not understand  he had thrown his thunderbolt and had seen that it had been efficacious  its efficacy had been such that his wrath had been turned into tenderness  he had been so changed in his purpose that he had been induced to make an appeal to his father at the cost of his fathers enmity  but that appeal had been in vain and as he thought of it all he told himself that on the appointed day marie bromar would become the wife of adrian urmand  he knew well enough that a girl betrothed is a girl already half married  he was very wretched as he drove his horse along  though there was a solace in the thought that the memory of him had still remained in maries heart there was a feeling akin to despair in this also his very tenderness towards her was more unendurable than would have been his wrath  the pity of it  the pity of it  it was that which made him sore of heart and faint of spirit  if he could have reproached her as cold mercenary unworthy heartless even though he had still loved her he could have supported himself by his anger against her unworthiness  but as it was there was no such support for him  though she had been in fault her virtue towards him was greater than her fault  she still loved him  she still loved himthough she could not be his wife  then he thought of adrian urmand and of the mans success and wealth and general prosperity in the world  what if he should go over to basle and take adrian urmand by the throat and choke him what if he should at least half choke the successful man and make it well understood that the other half would come unless the successful man would consent to relinquish his bride  george though he did not expect success for himself was fully purposed that urmand should not succeed without some interference from himby means of choking or otherwise  he would find some way of making himself disagreeable  if it were only by speaking his mind he thought that he could speak it in such a way that the basle merchant would not like it  he would tell urmand in the first place that marie was won not at all by affection not in the least by any personal regard for her suitor but altogether by a feeling of duty towards her uncle  and he would point out to this suitor how dastardly a thing it would be to take advantage of a girl so placed he planned a speech or two as he drove along which he thought that even urmand thickskinned as he believed him to be would dislike to hear  you may have her perhaps he would say to him as so much goods that you would buy because she is as a thing in her uncles hands to be bought  she believes it to be her duty as being altogether dependent to be disposed of as her uncle may choose  and she will go to you as she would to any other man who might make the purchase  but as for loving you you dont even believe that she loves you  she will keep your house for you but she will never love you  she will keep your house for youunless indeed she should find you to be so intolerable to her that she should be forced to leave you  it is in that way that you will have herif you are so low a thing as to be willing to take her so he planned various speeches of such a naturenot intending to trust entirely to speeches but to proceed to some attempt at choking afterwards if it should be necessary  marie bromar should not become adrian urmands wife without some effort on his part  so resolving he drove into the yard of the hotel at colmar  as soon as he entered the house madame faragon began to ask him questions about the wedding  when was it to be  george thought for a moment and then remembered that he had not even heard the day named  why dont you answer me george said the old woman angrily  you must know when its going to be  i dont know that its going to be at all said george  not going to be at all  why not  there is not anything wrong is there  were they not betrothed  why dont you tell me george  yes they were betrothed  and is he crying off  i should have thought michel voss was the man to strangle him if he did that  and i am the man to strangle him if he dont said george walking out of the room  he knew that he had been silly and absurd but he knew also that he was so moved as to have hardly any control over himself  in the few words that he had now said to madame faragon he had as he felt told the story of his own disappointment and yet he had not in the least intended to take the old woman into his confidence  he had not meant to have said a word about the quarrel between himself and his father and now he had told everything  when she saw him again in the evening of course she asked him some farther questions  george she said i am afraid things are not going pleasantly at granpere  not altogether he answered  but i suppose the marriage will go on  to this he made no answer but shook his head showing how impatient he was at being thus questioned  you ought to tell me said madame faragon plaintively considering how interested i must be in all that concerns you  i have nothing to tell  but is the marriage to be put off again demanded madame faragon with extreme anxiety  not that i know of madame faragon  they will not ask me whether it is to be put off or not  but have they quarrelled with m urmand  no nobody has quarrelled with m urmand  was he there george  what with me  no he was not there with me  i have never seen the man since i first left granpere to come here  and then george voss began to think what might have happened had adrian urmand been at the hotel while he was there himself  after all what could he have said to adrian urmand or what could he have done to him  he hasnt written has he to say that he is off his bargain poor madame faragon was almost pathetic in her anxiety to learn what had really occurred at the lion dor  certainly not  he has not written at all  then what is it george  i suppose it is thisthat marie bromar cares nothing for him  but so rich as he is  and they say too such a goodlooking young man  it is wonderful is it not  it is next to a miracle that there should be a girl deaf and blind to such charms  but nevertheless i believe it is so  they will probably make her marry him whether she likes it or not  but she is betrothed to him  of course she will marry him  then there will be an end of it said george  there was one other question which madame faragon longed to ask but she was almost too much afraid of her young friend to put it into words  at last she plucked up courage and did ask her question after an ambiguous way  but i suppose it is nothing to you george  nothing at all  nothing on earth said he  how should it be anything to me  then he hesitated for a while pausing to think whether or not he would tell the truth to madame faragon  he knew that there was no one on earth setting aside his father and marie bromar to whom he was really so dear as he was to this old woman she would probably do more for him if it might possibly be in her power to do anything than any other of his friends  and moreover he did not like the idea of being false to her even on such a subject as this  it is only this to me he said that she had promised to be my wife before they had ever mentioned urmands name to her  o george  and why should she not have promised  but georgeduring all this time you have never mentioned it  there are some things madame faragon which one doesnt mention and i do not know why i should have mentioned it at all  but you understand all about it now  of course she will marry the man  it is not likely that my father should fail to have his own way with a girl who is dependent on him  but hem urmand he would give her up if he knew it all would he not  to this george made no instant answer but the idea was there in his mindthat the linen merchant might perhaps be induced to abandon his purpose if he could be made to understand that marie wished it  if he have any touch of manhood about him he would do so said he  and what will you do george  do  i shall do nothing  what should i do  my father has turned me out of the house  that is the whole of it  i do not know that there is anything to be done  then he went out and there was nothing more said upon the question  for the next three or four days there was nothing said  as he went in and out madame faragon would look at him with anxious eyes questioning herself how far such a feeling of love might in truth make this young man forlorn and wretched  as far as she could judge by his manner he was very forlorn and very wretched  he did his work indeed and was busy about the place as was his wont  but there was a look of pain in his face which made her old heart grieve and by degrees her good wishes for the object which seemed to be so much to him became eager and hot  is there nothing to be done she asked at last putting out her fat hand to take hold of his in sympathy  there is nothing to be done said george who however hated himself because he was doing nothing and still thought occasionally of that plan of choking his rival  if you were to go to basle and see the man  what could i say to him if i did see him  after all it is not him that i can blame  i have no just ground of quarrel with him he has done nothing that is not fair  why should he not love her if it suits him  unless he were to fight me indeed  o george let there be no fighting  it would do no good i fear  none none none said she  if i were to kill him she could not be my wife then  no no certainly not  and if i wounded him it would make her like him perhaps  if he were to kill me indeed there might be some comfort in that  after this madame faragon made no farther suggestions that her young friend should go to basle    chapter xv  during the remainder of the day on which george had left granpere the hours did not fly very pleasantly at the lion dor  michel voss had gone to his niece immediately upon his return from his walk intending to obtain a renewed pledge from her that she would be true to her engagement  but he had been so full of passion so beside himself with excitement so disturbed by all that he had heard that he had hardly waited with marie long enough to obtain such pledge or to learn from her that she refused to give it  he had only been able to tell her that if she hesitated about marrying adrian she should never look upon his face again and then without staying for a reply he had left her  he had been in such a tremor of passion that he had been unable to demand an answer  after that when george was gone he kept away from her during the remainder of the morning  once or twice he said a few words to his wife and she counselled him to take no farther outward notice of anything that george had said to him  it will all come right if you will only be a little calm with her madame voss had said  he had tossed his head and declared that he was calmthe calmest man in all lorraine  then he had come to his wife again and she had again given him some good practical advice  dont put it into her head that there is to be a doubt said madame voss  i havent put it into her head he answered angrily  no my dear no but do not allow her to suppose that anybody else can put it there either  let the matter go on  she will see the things bought for her wedding and when she remembers that she has allowed them to come into the house without remonstrating she will be quite unable to object  dont give her an opportunity of objecting  michel voss again shook his head as though his wife were an unreasonable woman and swore that it was not he who had given marie such opportunity  but he made up his mind to do as his wife recommended  speak softly to her my dear said madame voss  dont i always speak softly said he turning sharply round upon his spouse  he made his attempt to speak softly when he met marie about the house just before supper  he put his hand upon her shoulder and smiled and murmured some word of love  he was by no means crafty in what he did  craft indeed was not the strong point of his character  she took his rough hand and kissed it and looked up lovingly beseechingly into his face  she knew that he was asking her to consent to the sacrifice and he knew that she was imploring him to spare her  this was not what madame voss had meant by speaking softly  could she have been allowed to dilate upon her own convictions or had she been able adequately to express her own ideas she would have begged that there might be no sentiment no romance no kissing of hands no looking into each others facesno halfmurmured tones of love  madame voss believed strongly that the everyday work of the world was done better without any of these glancings and glimmerings of moonshine  but then her husband was by nature of a fervid temperament given to the influence of unexpressed poetic emotionsand thus subject in spite of the strength of his will to much weakness of purpose  madame voss perhaps condemned her husband in this matter the more because his romantic disposition never showed itself in his intercourse with her  he would kiss maries hand and press maries wrist and hold dialogues by the eye with marie  but with his wife his speech wasnot exactly yea yea and nay naybut yes yes and no no it was not unnatural therefore that she should specially dislike this weakness of his which came from his emotional temperament  i would just let things go as though there were nothing special at all she said again to him before supper in a whisper  and so i do  what would you have me say  dont mind petting her but just be as you would be any other day  i am as i would be any other day he replied  however he knew that his wife was right and was in a certain way aware that if he could only change himself and be another sort of man he might manage the matter better  he could be fiercely angry or caressingly affectionate  but he was unable to adopt that safe and golden mean which his wife recommended  he could not keep himself from interchanging a piteous glance or two with marie at supper and put a great deal too much unction into his caress to please madame voss when marie came to kiss him before she went to bed  in the mean time marie was quite aware that it was incumbent on her to determine what she would do  it may be as well to declare at once that she had determinedhad determined fully before her uncle and george had started for their walk up to the woodcutting  when she was giving them their breakfast that morning her mind was fully made up  she had had the night to lie awake upon it to think it over and to realise all that george had told her  it had come to her as quite a new thing that the man whom she worshipped worshipped her too while she believed that nobody else loved herwhen she could tell herself that her fate was nothing to anybodyas long as it had seemed to her that the world for her must be cold and hard and materialso long could she reconcile to herself after some painful dubious fashion the idea of being the wife either of adrian urmand or of any other man  some kind of servitude was needful and if her uncle was decided that she must be banished from his house the kind of servitude which was proposed to her at basle would do as well as another  but when she had learned the trutha truth so unexpectedthen such servitude became impossible to her  on that morning when she came down to give the men their breakfast she had quite determined that let the consequences be what they might she would never become the wife of adrian urmand  madame voss had told her husband that when marie saw the things purchased for her wedding coming into the house the very feeling that the goods had been bought would bind her to her engagement  marie had thought of that also and was aware that she must lose no time in making her purpose known so that articles which would be unnecessary might not be purchased  on that very morning while the men had been up in the mountain she had sat with her aunt hemming sheetsintended as an addition to the already overflowing stock possessed by m urmand  it was with difficulty that she had brought herself to do thattelling herself however that as the linen was there it must be hemmed when there had come a question of marking the sheets she had evaded the tasknot without raising suspicion in the bosom of madame voss  but it was as she knew absolutely necessary that her uncle should be informed of her purpose  when he had come to her after the walk and demanded of her whether she still intended to marry adrian urmand she had answered him falsely  i suppose so she had said the questionsuch a question as it washad been put to her too abruptly to admit of a true answer on the spur of the moment  but the falsehood almost stuck in her throat and was a misery to her till she could set it right by a clear declaration of the truth she had yet to determine what she would dohow she would tell this truth in what way she would insure to herself the power of carrying out her purpose  her mind the reader must remember was somewhat dark in the matter  she was betrothed to the man and she had always heard that a betrothal was half a marriage  and yet she knew of instances in which marriages had been broken off after betrothal quite as ceremonious as her ownhad been broken off without scandal or special censure from the church  her aunt indeed and m le cure had ever since the plighting of her troth to m urmand spoken of the matter in her presence as though the wedding were a thing already nearly donenot suggesting by the tenor of their speech that any one could wish in any case to make a change but pointing out incidentally that any change was now out of the question  but marie had been sharp enough to understand perfectly the gist of her aunts manoeuvres and of the priests incidental information  the thing could be done she know and she feared no one in the doing of itexcept her uncle  but she did fear that if she simply told him that it must be done he would have such a power over her that she would not succeed  in what way could she do it first and then tell him afterwards  at last she determined that she would write a letter to m urmand and show a copy of the letter to her uncle when the post should have taken it so far out of granpere on its way to basle as to make it impossible that her uncle should recall it  much of the day after georges departure and much of the night was spent in the preparation of this letter  marie bromar was not so well practised in the writing of letters as will be the majority of the young ladies who may perhaps read her history  it was a difficult thing for her to begin the letter and a difficult thing for her to bring it to its end  but the letter was written and sent  the post left granpere at about eight in the morning taking all letters by way of remiremont and on the day following georges departure the post took marie bromars letter to m urmand  when it was gone her state of mind was very painful  then it was necessary that she should show the copy to her uncle  she had posted the letter between six and seven with her own hands and had then come trembling back to the inn fearful that her uncle should discover what she had done before her letter should be beyond his reach  when she saw the mail conveyance go by on its route to remiremont then she knew that she must begin to prepare for her uncles wrath  she thought that she had heard that the letters were detained some time at remiremont before they went on to epinal in one direction and to mulhouse in the other  she looked at the railway timetable which was hung up in one of the passages of the inn and saw the hour of the departure of the diligence from remiremont to catch the train at mulhouse for basle  when that hour was passed the conveyance of her letter was insured and then she must show the copy to her uncle  he came into the house about twelve and eat his dinner with his wife in the little chamber marie who was in and out of the room during the time would not sit down with them  when pressed to do so by her uncle she declared that she had eaten lately and was not hungry  it was seldom that she would sit down to dinner and this therefore gave rise to no special remark  as soon as his meal was over michel voss got up to go out about his business as was usual with him  then marie followed him into the passage  uncle michel she said i want to speak to you for a moment will you come with me  what is it about marie  if you will come i will show you  show me  what will you show me  its a letter uncle michel  come upstairs and you shall see it then he followed her upstairs and in the long public room which was at that hour deserted she took out of her pocket the copy of her letter to adrian urmand and put it into her uncles hands  it is a letter uncle michel which i have written to m urmand  it went this morning and you must see it  a letter to urmand he said as he took the paper suspiciously into his hands  yes uncle michel  i was obliged to write it  it is the truth and i was obliged to let him know it  i am afraid you will be angry with me andturn me away but i cannot help it  the letter was as follows                            the hotel lion dor granpere                                          october 1 186  m urmand  i take up my pen in great sorrow and remorse to write you a letter and to prevent you from coming over here for me as you intended on this day fortnight  i have promised to be your wife but it cannot be  i know that i have behaved very badly but it would be worse if i were to go on and deceive you  before i knew you i had come to be fond of another man and i find now though i have struggled hard to do what my uncle wishes that i could not promise to love you and be your wife  i have not told uncle michel yet but i shall as soon as this letter is gone  i am very very sorry for the trouble i have given you  i did not mean to be bad  i hope that you will forget me and try to forgive me  no one knows better than i do how bad i have been  your most humble servant         with the greatest respect                        marie bromar  the letter had taken her long to write and it took her uncle long to read before he came to the end of it  he did not get through a line without sundry interruptions which all arose from his determination to contradict at once every assertion which she made you cannot prevent his coming he said and it shall not be prevented  of course you have promised to be his wife and it must be  nonsense about deceiving him  he is not deceived at all  trashyou are not fond of another man  it is all nonsense  you must do what your uncle wishes  you must now you must  of course you will love him  why cant you let all that come as it does with others  letter goneyes indeed and now i must go after it  troubleyes  why could you not tell me before you sent it  have i not always been good to you  you have not been bad not before  you have been very good  it is this that is bad  forget you indeed  of course he wont  how should he are you not betrothed to him  hell forgive you fast enough when you just say that you did not know what you were about when you were writing it  thus her uncle went on and as the outburst of his wrath was as it were chopped into little bits by his having to continue the reading of the letter the storm did not fall upon maries head so violently as she had expected  theres a pretty kettle of fish youve made said he as soon as he had finished reading the letter  of course it means nothing  but it must mean something uncle michel  i say it means nothing  now ill tell you what i shall do marie i shall start for basle directly  i shall get there by twelve oclock tonight by going through colmar and i shall endeavour to intercept the letter before urmand would receive it tomorrow this was a cruel blow to marie after all her precautions  if i cannot do that i shall at any rate see him before he gets it  that is what i shall do and you must let me tell him marie that you repent having written the letter  but i dont repent it uncle michel i dont indeed  i cant repent it  how can i repent it when i really mean it  i shall never become his wifeindeed i shall not  o uncle michel pray pray pray do not go to basle  but michel voss resolved that he would go to basle and to basle he went  the immediate weight too of maries misery was aggravated by the fact that in order to catch the train for basle at colmar her uncle need not start quite immediately  there was an hour during which he could continue to exercise his eloquence upon his niece and endeavour to induce her to authorise him to contradict her own letter  he appealed first to her affection and then to her duty and after that having failed in these appeals he poured forth the full vials of his wrath upon her head  she was ungrateful obstinate false unwomanly disobedient irreligious sacrilegious and an idiot  in the fury of his anger there was hardly any epithet of severe rebuke which he spared and yet as every cruel word left his mouth he assured her that it should all be taken to mean nothing if she would only now tell him that he might nullify the letter  though she had deserved all these bad things which he had spoken of her yet she should be regarded as having deserved none of them should again be accepted as having in all points done her duty if she would only even now be obedient but she was not to be shaken  she had at last formed a resolution and her uncles words had no effect towards turning her from it uncle michel she said at last speaking with much seriousness of purpose and a dignity of person that was by no means thrown away upon him if i am what you say i had better go away from your house  i know i have been bad  i was bad to say that i would marry m urmand  i will not defend myself  but nothing on earth shall make me marry him  you had better let me go away and get a place as a servant among our friends at epinal  but michel voss though he was heaping abuse upon her with the hope that he might thus achieve his purpose had not the remotest idea of severing the connection which bound him and her together  he wanted to do her good not evil  she was exquisitely dear to him  if she would only let him have his way and provide for her welfare as he saw in his wisdom would be best he would at once take her in his arms again and tell her that she was the apple of his eye  but she would not and he went at last off on his road to colmar and basle gnashing his teeth in anger    chapter xvi  nothing was said to marie about her sins on that afternoon after her uncle had started on his journey  everything in the hotel was blank and sad and gloomy but there was at any rate the negative comfort of silence and marie was allowed to go about the house and do her work without rebuke  but she observed that the curem le cure gondinsat much with her aunt during the evening and she did not doubt but that she herself and her iniquities made the subject of their discourse  m le cure gondin as he was generally called at granperebeing always so spoken of with his full name and title by the large protestant portion of the communitywas a man very much respected by all the neighbourhood  he was respected by the protestants because he never interfered with them never told them either behind their backs or before their faces that they would be damned as heretics and never tried the hopeless task of converting them in his intercourse with them he dropped the subject of religion altogetheras a philologist or an entomologist will drop his grammar or his insects in his intercourse with those to whom grammar and insects are matters of indifference  and he was respected by the catholics of both sortsby those who did not and by those who did adhere with strictness to the letter of their laws of religion with the former he did his duty perhaps without much enthusiasm he preached to them if they would come and listen to him  he christened them confessed them and absolved them from their sinsof course after due penitence  but he lived with them too in a friendly way pronouncing no anathemas against them because they were not as attentive to their religious exercises as they might have been  but with those who took a comfort in sacred things who liked to go to early masses in cold weather to be punctual at ceremonies to say the rosary as surely as the evening came who knew and performed all the intricacies of fasting as ordered by the bishop down to the refinement of an egg more or less in the whole lent or the absence of butter from the days cookerywith these he had all that enthusiasm which such people like to encounter in their priest  we may say therefore that he was a wise manand probably on the whole a good man that he did good service in his parish and helped his people along in their lives not inefficiently  he was a small man with dark hair very closely cut with a tonsure that was visible but not more than visible with a black beard that was shaved every tuesday friday and saturday evenings but which was very black indeed on the tuesday and friday mornings  he always wore the black gown of his office but would go about his parish with an ordinary soft slouch hatthus subjecting his appearance to an absence of ecclesiastical trimness which perhaps the most enthusiastic of his friends regretted  madame voss certainly would have wished that he would have had himself shaved at any rate every other day and that he would have abstained from showing himself in the streets of granpere without his clerical hat  but though she was very intimate with her cure and had conferred upon him much material kindness she had never dared to express her opinion to him upon these matters  during much of that afternoon m le cure sat with madame voss but not a word was said to marie about her disobedience either by him or by her  nevertheless marie felt that her sins were being discussed and that the lecture was coming  she herself had never quite liked m le curenot having any special reason for disliking him but regarding him as a man who was perhaps a little deficient in spirit and perhaps a trifle too mindful of his creature comforts  m le cure took a great deal of snuff and marie did not like snuff taking  her uncle smoked a great deal of tobacco and that she thought very nice and proper in a man  had her uncle taken the snuff and the priest smoked the tobacco she would probably have equally approved of her uncles practice and disapproved that of the priestbecause she loved the one and did not love the other  she had thought it probable that she might be sent for during the evening and had therefore made for herself an immensity of household work the performance of all which on that very evening the interests of the lion dor would imperatively demand  the work was all done but no message from aunt josey summoned marie into the little parlour  nevertheless marie had been quite right in her judgment  on the following morning between eight and nine m le cure was again in the house and had a cup of coffee taken to him in the little parlour  marie who felt angry at his return would not take it herself but sent it in by the hands of peter veque  peter veque returned in a few minutes with a message to marie saying that m le cure wished to see her  tell him that i am very busy said marie  say that uncle is away and that there is a deal to do  ask him if another day wont suit as well  she knew when she sent this message that another day would not suit as well  and she must have known also that her uncles absence made no difference in her work  peter came back with a request from madame voss that marie would go to her at once  marie pressed her lips together clenched her fists and walked down into the room without the delay of an instant  marie my dear said madame voss m le cure wishes to speak to you  i will leave you for a few minutes  there was nothing for it but to listen  marie could not refuse to be lectured by the priest but she told herself that having had the courage to resist her uncle it certainly was out of the question that any one else should have the power to move her  my dear marie began the cure your aunt has been telling me of this little difference between you and your affianced husband wont you sit down marie because we shall be able so to talk more comfortably  i dont want to talk about it at all said marie  but she sat down as she was bidden  but my dear it is needful that your friends should talk to you i am sure that you have too much sense to think that a young woman like yourself should refuse to hear her friends  marie had it almost on her tongue to tell the priest that the only friends to whom she chose to listen were her uncle and her aunt but she thought that it might perhaps be better that she should remain silent  of course my dear a young person like you must know that she must walk by advice and i am sure you must feel that no one can give it you more fittingly than your own priest  then he took a large pinch of snuff  if it were anything to do with the churchyes she said  and this has to do with the church very much  indeed i do not know how any of our duties in this life cannot have to do with the church  there can be no duty omitted as to which you would not acknowledge that it was necessary that you should get absolution from your priest  but that would be in the church said marie not quite knowing how to make good her point  whether you are in the church or out of it is just the same  if you were sick and in bed would your priest be nothing to you then  but i am quite well father gondin  well in health but sick in spiritas i am sure you must own and i must explain to you my dear that this is a matter in which your religious duty is specially in question  you have been betrothed you know to m urmand  but people betrothed are very often not married said marie quickly  there was annette lolme at saint die  she was betrothed to jean stein at pugnac  that was only last winter  and then there was something wrong about the money and the betrothal went for nothing and father carrier himself said it was all right  if it was all right for annette lolme it must be all right for me as far as betrothing goes  the story that marie told so clearly was perfectly true and m le cure gondin knew that it was true  he wished now to teach marie that if certain circumstances should occur after a betrothal which would make the marriage inexpedient in the eyes of the parents of the young people then the authority of the church would not exert itself to insist on the sacred nature of the pledgebut that if the pledge was to be called in question simply at the instance of a capricious young woman then the church would have full power  his object in short was to insist on parental authority giving to parental authority some little additional strength from his own sacerdotal recognition of the sanctity of the betrothing promise but he feared that marie would be too strong for him if not also too clearheaded  you cannot mean to tell me said he that you think such a solemn promise as you have given to this young man taking one from him as solemn in return is to go for nothing  i am very sorry that i promisedvery sorry indeed but i cannot keep my promise  you are bound to keep it especially as all your friends wish the marriage and think that it will be good for you  annette lolmes friends wished her not to marry  it is my duty to tell you marie that if you break your faith to m urmand you will commit a very grievous sin and you will commit it with your eyes open  if annette lolme might change her mind because her lover had not got as much money as people wanted i am sure i may change mine because i dont love a man  annette did what her friends advised her  then a girl must always do what her friends tell her  if i dont marry m urmand i shant be wicked for breaking my promise but for disobeying uncle michel  you will be wicked in every way said the priest  no m le cure  if i had married m urmand i know i should be wicked to leave him and i would do my best to live with him and make him a good wife  but i have found out in time that i cant love him and therefore i am sure that i ought not to marry him and i wont  there was much more said between them but m le cure gondin was not able to prevail in the least  he tried to cajole her and he tried to persuade by threats and he tried to conquer her by gratitude and affection towards her uncle  but he could not prevail at all  it is of no use my staying here any longer m le cure she said at last because i am quite sure that nothing on earth will induce me to consent  i am very sorry for what i have done  if you tell me that i have sinned i will repent and confess it  i have repented and am very very sorry  i know now that i was very wrong ever to think it possible that i could be his wife  but you cant make me think that i am wrong in this  then she left him and as soon as she was gone madame voss returned to hear the priests report as to his success  in the mean time michel voss had reached basle arriving there some five hours before maries letter and in his ignorance of the law had made his futile attempt to intercept the letter before it reached the hands of m urmand  but he was with urmand when the letter was delivered and endeavoured to persuade his young friend not to open it  but in doing this he was obliged to explain to a certain extent what was the nature of the letter  he was obliged to say so much about it as to justify the unhappy lover in asserting that it would be better for them all that he should know the contents  at any rate you will promise not to believe it said michel  and he did succeed in obtaining from m urmand a sort of promise that he would not regard the words of the letter as in truth expressing maries real resolution  girls you know are such queer cattle said michel  they think about all manner of things and then they dont know what they are thinking  but who is the other man demanded adrian as soon as he had finished the letter  any one judging from his countenance when he asked the question would have imagined that in spite of his promise he believed every word that had been written to him  his face was a picture of blank despair and his voice was low and hoarse  you must know whom she means he added when michel did not at once reply  yes i know whom she means  who is it then m voss  it is george of course replied the innkeeper  i did not know said poor adrian urmand  she never spoke a dozen words to any other man in her life and as for him she has hardly seen him for the last eighteen months  he has come over and said something to her like a traitorhas reminded her of some childish promise some old vow something said when they were children and meaning nothing and so he has frightened her  i was never told that there was anything between them said urmand beginning to think that it would become him to be indignant  there was nothing to tellliterally nothing  they must have been writing to each other  never a line on my word as a man  it was just as i tell you when george went from home there had been some fooling as i thought between them and i was glad that he should go  i didnt think it meant anything or ever would  as michel voss said this there did occur to him an idea that perhaps after all he had been wrong to interfere in the first instancethat there had then been no really valid reason why george should not have married marie bromar but that did not in the least influence his judgment as to what it might be expedient to do now  he was still as sure as ever that as things stood now it was his duty to do all in his power to bring about the marriage between his niece and adrian urmand  but since that there has been nothing continued he absolutely nothing  ask her and she will tell you so  it is some romantic idea of hers that she ought to stick to her first promise now that she has been reminded of it  all this did not convince adrian urmand who for a while expressed his opinion that it would be better for him to take maries refusal and thus to let the matter drop  it would be very bitter to him because all basle had now heard of his proposed marriage and a whole shower of congratulations had already fallen upon him from his fellowtownspeople  but he thought that it would be more bitter to be rejected again in person by marie bromar and then to be stared at by all the natives of granpere  he acknowledged that george voss was a traitor and would have been ready to own that marie was another had michel voss given him any encouragement in that direction  but michel throughout the whole morningand they were closeted together for hoursdeclared that poor marie was more sinned against than sinning  if adrian was but once more over at granpere all would be made right  at last michel voss prevailed and persuaded the young man to return with him to the lion dor  they started early on the following morning and travelled to granpere by way of colmar and the mountain  the father thus passed twice through colmar but on neither occasion did he call upon his son    chapter xvii  there had been very little said between michel voss and urmand on their journey towards granpere till they were at the top of the vosges on the mountain road at which place they had to leave their little carriage and bait their horse  indeed michel had been asleep during almost the entire time  on the night but one before he had not been in bed at all having reached basle after midnight and having passed the hours twixt that and his morning visit to urmands house in his futile endeavours to stop poor maries letter and the departure of the travellers from basle on this morning had been very early so that the poor innkeeper had been robbed of his proper allowance of natural rest  he had slept soundly in the train to colmar and had afterwards slept in the little caleche which had taken them to the top of the mountain  urmand had sat silent by his sideby no means anxious to disturb his companion because he had no determined plan ready to communicate  once or twice before he reached colmar he had thought that he would go back again  he had been he felt badly treated and though he was very fond of marie it would be better for him perhaps to wash his hands of the whole affair  he was so thinking the whole way to colmar  but he was afraid of michel voss and when they got out upon the platform there he had no resolution ready to be declared as fixed  then they had hired the little carriage and michel voss had slept again he had slept all through munster and up the steep mountain and was not thoroughly awake till they were summoned to get out at the wonderfully fine house for refreshment which the late emperor caused to be built at the top of the hill  here they went into the restaurant and as michel voss was known to the man who kept it he ordered a bottle of wine  what a terrible place to live in all the winter he said as he looked down through the window right into the deep valley below  from the spot on which the house is built you can see all the broken wooded ground of the steep descent and then the broad plain that stretches away to the valley of the rhine there is nothing but snow here after christmas continued michel and perhaps not a christian over the road for days together  i shouldnt like it i know  it may be all very well just now  but adrian urmand was altogether inattentive either to the scenery now before him or to the prospect of the mountain innkeepers winter life  he knew that two hours and a half would take them down the mountain into granpere and that when there it would be at once necessary that he should begin a task the idea of which was by no means pleasant to him  he was quite sure now that he wished he had remained at basle and that he had accepted maries letter as final he told himself again and again that he could not make her marry him if she chose to change her mind  what was he to say and what was he to do when he got to granpere a place which he almost wished that he had never seen in spite of those profitable linenbuyings and now when michel voss began to talk to him about the scenery and what this man up in the mountain did in the winterat this moment when his terrible trouble was so very near himhe felt it to be an insult or at least a cruelty  what can he do from december till april except smoke and drink asked michel voss  i dont care what he does said urmand turning away  i only know i wish id never come here  take a glass of wine my friend said michel  the mountain air has made you chill  urmand took the glass of wine but it did not cheer him much  we shall have it all right before the day is over continued michel  i dont think it will ever be all right said the other  and why not  the fact is you dont understand young women as how should you seeing that you have not had to manage them  you do as i tell you and just be round with her  you tell her that you dont desire any change yourself and that after what has passed you cant allow her to think of such a thing  you speak as though you had a downright claim as you have and all will come right  its not that she cares for him you know  you must remember that  she has never even said a word of that kind  i havent a doubt on my mind as to which she really likes best but its that stupid promise and the way that george has had of making her believe that she is bound by the first word she ever spoke to a young man  its only nonsense and of course we must get over it  then they were summoned out the horse having finished his meal and were rattled down the hill into granpere without many more words between them  one other word was spoken and that word was hardly pleasant in its tone  urmand at least did not relish it  i shall go away at once if she doesnt treat me as she ought said he just as they were entering the village  michel was silent for a moment before he answered  youll behave im sure as a man ought to behave to a young woman whom he intends to make his wife  the words themselves were civil enough but there was a tone in the innkeepers voice and a flame in his eye which made urmand almost feel that he had been threatened  then they drove into the space in front of the door of the lion dor  michel had made for himself no plan whatsoever  he led the way at once into the house and urmand followed hardly daring to look up into the faces of the persons around him  they were both of them soon in the presence of madame voss but marie bromar was not there marie had been sharp enough to perceive who was coming before they were out of the carriage and was already ensconced in some safer retreat upstairs in which she could meditate on her plan of the campaign  look lively and get us something to eat said michel meaning to be cheerful and selfpossessed  we left basle at five and have not eaten a mouthful since  it was now nearly four oclock and the bread and cheese which had been served with the wine on the top of the mountain had of course gone for nothing madame voss immediately began to bustle about calling the cook and peter veque to her assistance  but nothing for a while was said about marie  urmand trying to look as though he were selfpossessed stood with his back to the stove and whistled  for a few minutes during which the bustling about the table went on michel was wrapped in thought and said nothing  at last he had made up his mind and spoke  we might as well make a dash at it at once said he where is marie  no one answered him  where is marie bromar he asked again angrily  he knew that it behoved him now to take upon himself at once the real authority of a master of a house  she is upstairs said peter who was straightening a tablecloth  tell her to come down to me said her uncle  peter departed immediately and for a while there was silence in the little room adrian urmand felt his heart to palpitate disagreeably  indeed the manner in which it would appear that the innkeeper proposed to manage the business was distressing enough to him  it seemed as though it were intended that he should discuss his little difficulties with marie in the presence of the whole household  but he stood his ground and sounded one more ineffectual little whistle  in a few minutes peter returned but said nothing  where is marie bromar again demanded michel in an angry voice  i told her to come down said peter  well  i dont think shes coming said peter  what did she say  not a word she only bade me go down  then michel walked into the kitchen as though he were about to fetch the recusant himself  but he stopped himself and asked his wife to go up to marie  madame voss did go up and after her return there was some whispering between her and her husband  she is upset by the excitement of your return michel said at last and we must give her a little grace  come we will eat our dinner  in the mean time marie was sitting on her bed upstairs in a most unhappy plight  she really loved her uncle and almost feared him she did fear him with that sort of fear which is produced by reverence and habits of obedience but which when softened by affection hardly makes itself known as fear except on troublous occasions  and she was oppressed by the remembrance of all that was due from her to him and to her aunt feeling as it was natural that she should do in compliance with the manners and habits of her people that she owed a duty of obedience in this matter of marriage  though she had been able to hold her own against the priest and had been quite firm in opposition to her auntwho was in truth a woman much less strong by nature than herselfshe dreaded a farther dispute with her uncle  she could not bear to think that he should be enabled to accuse her with justice of ingratitude  it had been her great pleasure to be true to him and he had answered her truth by a perfect confidence which had given a charm to her life  now this would all be over and she would be driven again to beg him to send her away that she might become a household drudge elsewhere  and now that this very moment of her agony had come and that this man to whom she had given a promise was there to claim her how was she to go down and say what she had to say before all the world  it was perfectly clear to her that in accordance with her reception of urmand at the first moment of their meeting so must be her continued conduct towards him till he should leave her or else take her away with him  she could not smile on him and shake hands with him and cut his bread for him and pour out his wine after such a letter as she had written to him without signifying thereby that the letter was to go for nothing now let what might happen the letter was not to go for nothing the letter was to remain a true fact and a true letter  i cant go down aunt josey indeed i cant she said  i am not well and i should drop  pray tell uncle michel with my best love and with my duty that i cant go to him now  and she sat still upon her bed not weeping but clasping her hands and trying to see her way out of her misfortune  the dinner was eaten in grim silence and after the dinner michel still grimly silent sat with his friend on the bench before the door and smoked a cigar  while he was smoking michel said never a word  but he was thinking of the difficulty he had to overcome and he was thinking also at odd moments whether his own son george was not after all a better sort of lover for a young woman than this young man who was seated by his side  but it never occurred to him that he might find a solution of the difficulty by encouraging this second idea  urmand during this time was telling himself that it behoved him to be a man and that his sitting there in silence was hardly proof of his manliness  he knew that he was being illtreated and that he must do something to redress his own wrongs if he only knew how to do it  he was quite determined that he would not be a coward that he would stand up for his own rights  but if a young woman wont marry a man a man cant make her do so either by scolding her or by fighting any of her friends  in this case the young ladys friends were all on his side  but the weight of that half hour of silence and of michels gloom was intolerable to him  at last he got up and declared he would go and see an old woman who would have linen to sell  as i am here i might as well do a stroke of work he said striving to be jocose  do said michel and in the mean time i will see marie bromar  whenever michel voss was heard to call his niece marie bromar using the two names it was understood by all who heard him about the hotel that he was not in a good humour  as soon as urmand was gone he rose slowly from his seat and with heavy steps he went upstairs in search of the refractory girl  he went straight to her own bedroom and there he found her still sitting on her bedside she jumped up as soon as he was in the room and running up to him took him by the arm  uncle michel she said pray pray be good to me  pray spare me  i am good to you he said  i try to be good to you  you know that i love you  do you not know that i love you  then she paused but he made no answer to her  he was surer of nothing in the world than he was of her affection but it did not suit him to acknowledge it at that moment  i would do anything for you that i could do uncle michel but pray do not ask me to do this  then she clasped him tightly and hung upon him and put up her face to be kissed  but he would not kiss her  ah said she you mean to be hard to me  then i must go then i must go then i must go  that is nonsense marie  you cannot go till you go to your husband  where would you go to  it matters not where i go to now  marie you are betrothed to this man and you must consent to become his wife  say that you will consent and all this nonsense shall be forgotten  she did not say that she would consent but she did not say that she would not and he thought that he might persuade her if he could speak to her as he ought  but he doubted which might be most efficacious affection or severity  he had assured himself that it would be his duty to be very severe before he gave up the point but it might be possible as she was so sweet with him so loving and so gracious that affection might prevail if so how much easier would the task be to himself  so he put his arm round her and stooped down and kissed her  o uncle michel she said dear dear uncle michel say that you will spare me and be on my side and be good to me  my darling girl it is for your own good for the good of us all that you should marry this man  do you not know that i would not tell you so if it were not true  i cannot be more good to you than that  i cannot uncle michel  tell me why now  what is it  has anybody been bringing tales to you  nobody has brought any tales  is there anything amiss with him  it is not that  it is not that at all  i am sure he is an excellent young man and i wish with all my heart he had a better wife than i can ever be  he thinks you will be quite good enough for him  i am not good for anybody  i am very bad  leave him to judge of that  but i cannot do it uncle michel  i can never be adrian urmands wife  but why why why repeated michel who was beginning to be again angered by his own want of success  you have said that a dozen times but have never attempted to give a reason  i will tell you the reason  it is because i love george with all my heart and with all my soul  he is so dear to me that i should always be thinking of him  i could not help myself  i should always have him in my heart  would that be right uncle michel if i were married to another man  then why did you accept the other man  there is nothing changed since then  i was wicked then  i dont think you were wicked at allbut at any rate you did it you didnt think anything about having george in your heart then  it was very hard for her to answer this and for a moment or two she was silenced  at last she found a reply  i thought everything was dead within me thenand that it didnt signify  since that he has been here and he has told me all  i wish he had stayed where he was with all my heart  we did not want him here said the innkeeper in his anger  but he did come uncle michel  i did not send for him but he did come  yes he cameand he has disturbed everything that i had arranged so happily  look here marie  i lay my commands upon you as your uncle and guardian and i may say also as your best and stanchest friend to be true to the solemn engagement which you have made with this young man  i will not hear any answer from you now but i leave you with that command  urmand has come here at my request because i told him that you would be obedient  if you make a fool of me and of yourself and of us all it will be impossible that i should forgive you  he will see you this evening and i will trust to your good sense to receive him with propriety  then michel voss left the room and descended with ponderous steps indicative of a heavy heart  marie when she was alone again seated herself on the bedside  of course she must see adrian urmand  she was quite aware that she could not encounter him now with that halfsaucy independent air which had come to her quite naturally before she had accepted him she would willingly humble herself in the dust before him if by so doing she could induce him to relinquish his suit  but if she could not do so if she could not talk over either her uncle or him to be on what she called her side then what should she do  her uncles entreaties to her joined to his too evident sorrow had upon her an effect so powerful that she could hardly overcome it  she had as she thought resolved most positively that nothing should induce her to marry adrian urmand  she had of course been very firm in this resolution when she wrote her letter  but nownow she was almost shaken  when she thought only of herself she would almost task herself to believe that after all it did not much matter what of happiness or of unhappiness might befall her  if she allowed herself to be taken to a new home at basle she could still work and eat and drinkand working eating and drinking she could wait till her unhappiness should be removed  she was sufficiently wise to understand that as she became a middleaged woman with perhaps children around her her sorrow would melt into a soft regret which would be at least endurable  and what did it signify after all how much one such a being as herself might suffer  the world would go on in the same way and her small troubles would be of but little significance  work would save her from utter despondence  but when she thought of george and the words in which he had expressed the constancy of his own love and the shipwreck which would fall upon him if she were untrue to himthen again she would become strong in her determination  her uncle had threatened her with his lasting displeasure  he had said that it would be impossible that he should forgive her  that would be unbearable  yet when she thought of george she told herself that it must be borne  before the hour of supper came her aunt had been with her and she had promised to see her suitor alone  there had been some doubt on this point between michel and his wife madame voss thinking that either she or her husband ought to be present  but michel had prevailed  i dont care what any people may say he replied  i know my own girland i know also what he has a right to expect so it was settled and marie understood that adrian was to come to her in the little brightly furnished sittingroom upstairs  on this occasion she took no notice of the hotel supper at all  it is to be hoped that peter veque proved himself equal to the occasion  at about nine she was seated in the appointed place and madame voss brought her lover up into the room  here is m urmand come to speak to you she said  your uncle thinks that you had better see him alone  i am sure you will bear in mind what it is that he and i wish  then she closed the door and adrian and marie were left together  i need hardly tell you said he what were my feelings when your uncle came to me yesterday morning  and when i opened your letter and read it i could hardly believe that it had come from you  yes m urmandit did come from me  and whywhat have i done  the last word you had spoken to me was to declare that you would be my loving wife  not that m urmand never that  when i thought it was to be so i told you that i would do my best to do my duty by you  say that once more and all shall be right  but i never promised that i would love you  i could not promise that and i was very wicked to allow them to give you my troth  you cant think worse of me than i think of myself  but marie why should you not love me  i am sure you would love me  listen to me m urmand listen to me and be generous to me  i think you can be generous to a poor girl who is very unhappy  i do not love you  i do not say that i should not have loved you if you had been the first  why should not any girl love you  you are above me in every way and rich and well spoken of and your life has been less rough and poor than mine  it is not that i have been proud  what is there that i can be proud ofexcept my uncles trust in me  but george voss had come to me before and had made me promise that i would love himand i do love him  how can i help it if i wished to help it  o m urmand can you not be generous think how little it is that you will lose  but adrian urmand did not like to be told of the girls love for another man  his generosity would almost have been more easily reached had she told him of georges love for her  people had assured him since he was engaged that marie bromar was the handsomest girl in lorraine or alsace and he felt it to be an injury that this handsome girl should prefer such a one as george voss to himself  marie with a womans sharpness perceived all this accurately  remember said she that i had hardly seen you when george and i werewhen he and i became such friends  your uncle doesnt want you to marry his son  i shall never become georges wife without consent never  then what would be the use of my giving way asked urmand  he would never consent  she paused for a moment before she replied  to save yourself said she from living with a woman who cannot love you and to save me from living with a man i cannot love  and is this to be all the answer you will give me  it is the request that i have to make to you said marie  then i had better go down to your uncle  and he went down to michel voss leaving marie bromar again alone    chapter xviii  the people of colmar think colmar to be a considerable place and far be it from us to hint that it is not so  it isor was in the days when alsace was frenchthe chief town of the department of the haut rhine  it bristles with barracks and is busy with cotton factories  it has been accustomed to the presence of a prefet and is no doubt important  but it is not so large that people going in and out of it can pass without attention and this we take to be the really true line of demarcation between a big town and a little one had michel voss and adrian urmand passed through lyons or strasbourg on their journey to granpere no one would have noticed them and their acquaintances in either of those cities would not have been a bit the wiser  but it was not probable that they should leave the train at the colmar station and hire daniel bredins caleche for the mountain journey thence to granpere without all the facts of the case coming to the ears of madame faragon  and when she had heard the news of course she told it to george voss  she had interested herself very keenly in the affair of georges love partly because she had a soft heart of her own and loved a ray of romance to fall in upon her as she sat fat and helpless in her easychair and partly because she thought that the future landlord of the hotel de la poste at colmar ought to be regarded as a bigger man and a better match than any swiss linenmerchant in the world i cant think what it is that your father means she had said when he and i were young he used not to be so fond of the people of basle and he didnt think so much then of a peddling buyer of sheetings and shirtings  madame faragon was rather fond of alluding to past times and of hinting to george that in early days had she been willing she might have been mistress of the lion dor at granpere instead of the poste at colmar  george never quite believed the boast as he knew that madame faragon was at least ten years older than his father  he used to think continued madame faragon that there was nothing better than a good house in the public line with a wellspirited woman inside it to stand her ground and hold her own  but everything is changed now since the railroads came up  the pedlars become merchants and the respectable old shopkeepers must go to the wall  george would hear all this in silence though he knew that his old friend was endeavouring to comfort him by making little of the basle linenmerchant  now when madame faragon learned that michel voss and adrian urmand had gone through colmar back from basle on their way to granpere she immediately foresaw what was to happen  maries marriage was to be hurried on george was to be thrown overboard and the pedlars pack was to be triumphant over the sign of the innkeeper  if i were you george i would dash in among them at once said madame faragon  george was silent for a minute or two leaving the room and returning to it before he made any answer  then he declared that he would dash in among them at granpere  it will be better to go over and see it all settled he said  but george you wont quarrel  what do you mean by quarrelling  i dont suppose that this man and i can be very dear friends when we meet each other  you wont have any fighting  o george if i thought there was going to be fighting i would go myself to prevent it  madame faragon no doubt was sincere in her desire that there should be no fighting but nevertheless there was a life and reality about this little affair which had a gratifying effect upon her  if i thought i could do any good i really would go she said again afterwards but george did not encourage her to make the attempt  no more was said about it but early on the following morning or in truth long before the morning had dawned george had started upon his journey following his father and m urmand in their route over the mountain  this was the third time he had gone to granpere in the course of the present autumn and on each time he had gone without invitation and without warning  and yet previous to this he had remained above a year at colmar without taking any notice of his family  he knew that his father would not make him welcome and he almost doubted whether it would be proper for him to drive himself direct to the door of the hotel  his father had told him when they were last parting from each other that he was nothing but a trouble  you are all trouble his father had said to him  and then his father had threatened to have him turned from the door by the servants if he should come to the house again before marie and adrian were married  he was not afraid of his father but he felt that he had no right to treat the lion dor as his own home unless he was prepared to obey his father  and he knew nothing as to marie and her purpose  he had learned from her that were she left to herself she would give herself with all her heart to him  but she would not be left to herself and he only knew now that adrian urmand was being taken back to granpereof course with the intention that the marriage should be at once perfected  madame faragon had no doubt been right in her advice as to dashing in among them at once  whatever was to be done must be done now  but it was by no means clear to him how he was to carry on the war when he found himself among them all at granpere  it was now october and the morning on the mountain was very dark and cold  he had started from colmar between three and four so that he had passed through munster and was ascending the hill before six  he stopped too and fed his horse at the emperors house at the top and fortified himself with a tumbler of wine and a hunch of bread  he meant to go into granpere and claim marie as his own  he would go to the priest and to the pastor if necessary and forbid all authorities to lend their countenance to the proposed marriage  he would speak his mind plainly and would accuse his father of extreme cruelty  he would call upon madame voss to save her niece  he would be very savage with marie hoping that he might thereby save her from herselfdefying her to say either before man or god that she loved the man whom she was about to make her husband  and as to adrian urmand himself he still thought that should the worst come to the worst he would try some process of choking upon adrian urmand  any use of personal violence would be distasteful to him and contrary to his nature  he was not a man who in the ordinary way of his life would probably lift his hand against another  such liftings of hands on the part of other men he regarded as a falling back to the truculence of savage life  men should manage and coerce each other either with the tongue or with money or with the lawaccording to his theory of life  but on such an occasion as this he found himself obliged to acknowledge that if the worst should come to the worst some attempt at choking his enemy must be made  it must be made for maries sake if not for his own  in this mood of mind he drove down to granpere and not knowing where else to stop drew up his horse in the middle of the road before the hotel  the stableservant who was hanging about immediately came to himand there was his father standing all alone at the door of the house  it was now ten oclock and he had expected that his father would have been away from home as was his custom at that hour  but the innkeepers mind was at present too full of trouble to allow of his going off either to the woodcutting or to the farm  adrian urmand after his failure with marie on the preceding evening had not again gone downstairs  he had taken himself at once to his bedroom and had remained there gloomy and unhappy very angry with marie bromar but if possible more angry with michel voss  knowing as he must have known how the land lay why had the innkeeper brought him from basle to granpere  he found himself to have been taken in from first to last by the whole household and he would at this moment have been glad to obliterate granpere altogether from among the valleys of the vosges  and so he went to bed in his wrath  michel and madame voss sat below waiting for him above an hour  madame voss more than once proposed that she should go up and see what was happening  it was impossible she declared that they should be talking together all that time  but her husband had stayed her  whatever they have to say let them say it out it seemed to him that marie must be giving way if she submitted herself to so long an interview  when at last madame voss did go upstairs she learned from the maid that m urmand had been in bed ever so long and on going to maries chamber she found her sitting where she had sat before  yes aunt josey i will go to bed at once she said  give uncle my love  then aunt josey had returned to her husband and neither of them had been able to extract any comfort from the affairs of the evening  early on the following morning m le cure was called to a consultation  this was very distasteful to michel voss because he was himself a protestant and having lived all his life with a protestant son and two roman catholic women in the house he had come to feel that father gondins religion was a religion for the weaker sex  he troubled himself very little with the doctrinal differences having no slightest touch of an idea that he was to be saved because he was a protestant and that they were in peril because they were roman catholics  nor indeed was there any such idea on either side prevalent in the valley  what m le cure himself may have believed who can say  but he never taught his parishioners that their protestant uncles and wives and children were to be damned  michel voss was averse to priestly assistance but now he submitted to it  he hardly knew himself how far that betrothal was a binding ceremony  but he felt strongly that he had committed himself to the marriage that it did not become him to allow that his son had been right and also that if marie would only marry the man she would find herself quite happy in her new home so m le cure was called in and there was a consultation  m le cure was quite as hot in favour of the marriage as were the other persons concerned  it was in the first place infinitely preferable in his eyes that his young parishioner should marry a roman catholic  but he was not able to undertake to use any special thunders of the church  he could tell the young woman what was her duty and he had done so  if her guardians wished it he would do so again very strongly  but he did not know how he was to do more then the priest told the story of annette lolme pointing out how well marie was acquainted with all the bearings of the case  but both consented to break it off in that case said michel  it was singular to observe how cruel he had become against the girl whom he so dearly loved  the cure explained to him again that neither the church nor the law could interfere to make her marry m urmand  it might be explained to her that she would commit a sin requiring penitence and absolution if she did not marry him  the church could go no farther than that  butsuch was the cures opinionthere was no power at the command of michel voss by which he could force his niece to marry the man unless his own internal power as a friend and a protector might enable him to do so  she doesnt care a straw for that now said he  not a straw  since that fellow was over here she thinks nothing of me and nothing of her word  then he went out to the hotel door leaving the priest with his wife and he had not stood there for a minute or two before he saw his sons arrival  marie in the mean time had not left her room  she had sent word down to her uncle that she was ill and that she would beg him to go up to her  as yet he had not seen her but a message had been taken to her saying that he would come soon adrian urmand had breakfasted alone and had since been wandering about the house by himself  he also from the windows of the billiardroom had seen the arrival of george voss  michel voss when he saw george did not move from his place  he was still very angry with his son vehemently angry because his son stood in the way of the completion of his desires  but he had forgotten all his threats spoken now nearly a week ago  he was altogether oblivious of his declaration that he would have george turned away from the door by the servants of the inn  that his own son should treat his house as a home was so natural to him that it did not even occur to him now that he could bid him not to enter there he was again creating more trouble and as far as our friend the innkeeper could see likely enough to be successful in his object  michel stood his ground with his hands in his pockets because he would not even shake hands with his son  but when george came up he bowed a recognition with his head as though he should have said i see you but i cannot say that you are welcome to granpere  george stood for a moment or two and then addressed his father  adrian urmand is here with you is he not father  he is in the house somewhere said michel sullenly  may i speak to him  i am not his keeper not his and michel put a special accent on the last word by which he implied that though he was not the keeper of adrian urmand he was the keeper of somebody else  george stood awhile hesitating by his fathers side and as he stood he saw through the window of the billiardroom the figure of urmand who was watching them  your mother is in her own room you had better go to her said michel  then george entered the hotel and his father went across the court to seek urmand in his retreat  in this way the difficulty of the first meeting was overcome and george did not find himself turned out of the lion dor  he knew of course nothing of the state of affairs at the inn  it might be that marie had already given way and was still the promised bride of this man  indeed to him it seemed most probable that such should be the case  he had been sent to look for madame voss and madame voss he found in the kitchen  o george who expected to see you here today she exclaimed  nobody i daresay he replied  the cook was there and two or three other servants and hangerson  it was impossible that he should speak out before so many persons and he had not a friend about the place unless marie was his friend  after a few moments he went into the inner room and madame voss followed him  well said he has anything been settled  i am sorry to say that everything is as unsettled as it can be said madame voss  then marie must be true to him  and if so she must be the grandest woman the finest girl that had ever been created  if so would he not be true to her  if so with what a true worship would he offer her all that he had to give in the world  he had come there before determined to crush her with his thunderbolt  now he would swear to cherish her and keep her warm with his love for ever and ever  is she here he asked  she is upstairs in bed  you cannot see her  she is not ill  she is making everybody else ill about the place i know that said madame voss  and as for you george you owe a different kind of treatment to your father you do indeed  it will make an old man of him  he has set his heart upon this and you ought to have yielded  it was at any rate evident that marie was holding out was true to her first love in spite of that betrothal which had appeared to george to be so wicked but which had in truth been caused by his own fault  if marie would hold out there would be no need that he should lay violent hands upon adrian urmand or have resort to any process of choking  if she would only be firm they could not succeed in making her marry the linenmerchant  he was not in the least afraid of m le cure gondin nor was he afraid of adrian urmand  he was not much afraid of madame voss  he was afraid only of his father  a man cannot yield on such a matter he said  no man yields in such an affairthough he may be beaten  madame voss listened to him but said nothing farther  she was busy with her work and went on intently with her needle  he had asked to see urmand and he now went out in quest of him  he passed across the court and in at the door of the cafe and up into the billiardroom  here he found both his father and the young man urmand got up to salute him and george took off his hat  nothing could be more ceremonious than the manner in which the two rivals greeted each other  they had not seen each other for nearly two years and had never been intimate  when george had been living at granpere urmand had only been an occasional sojourner at the inn and had not as yet fallen into habits of friendship with the voss family  have you seen your mother michel asked  yes i have seen her  then there was silence for awhile  urmand knew not how to speak and george was doubtful how to proceed in presence of his father  then michel asked another question  are you going to stay long with us george  certainly not long father  i have brought nothing with me but what you see  you have brought too much if you have come to give us trouble  then there was another pause during which george sat down in a corner apart from them  urmand took out a cigar and lit it offering one to the innkeeper  but michel voss shook his head  he was very unhappy feeling that everything around him was wrong here was a son of his of whom he was proud the only living child of his first wife a young man of whom all people said good things a son whom he had always loved and trusted and who even now at this very moment was showing himself to be a real man and yet he was forced to quarrel with this son and say harsh things to him and sit away from him with a man who was after all no more than a stranger to him with whom he had no sympathy when it would have made him so happy to be leaning on his sons shoulder and discussing their joint affairs with unreserved confidence asking questions about wages and suggesting possible profits  he was beginning to hate adrian urmand  he was beginning to hate the young man although he knew that it was his duty to go on with the marriage  urmand as soon as his cigar was lighted got up and began to knock the balls about on the table  that gloom of silence was to him most painful  if you would not mind it m urmand said george i should like to take a walk with you  to take a walk  if it would not be disagreeable  perhaps it would be well that you and i should have a few minutes of conversation  i will leave you together here said the father if you george will promise me that there shall be no violence  urmand looked at the innkeeper as though he did not like the proposition but michel took no notice of his look  there certainly shall be none on my part said george  i dont know what m urmands feelings may be  o dear no nothing of the kind said urmand  but i dont exactly see what we are to talk about  michel however paid no attention to this but walked slowly out of the room  i really dont know what there is to say continued urmand as he knocked the balls about with his cue  there is this to say  that girl up there was induced to promise that she would be your wife when she believed thati had forgotten her  o dear no nothing of the kind  that is her story  go and ask her  if it is so or even if it suits her now to say so you will hardly as a man endeavour to drive her into a marriage which she does not wish  you will never do it even if you do try  though you go on trying till you drive her mad she will never be your wife  but if you are a man you will not continue to torment her simply because you have got her uncle to back you  who says she will never marry me  i say so  she says so  we are betrothed to each other  why should she not marry me  simply because she does not wish it  she does not love you  is not that enough  she does love another man mememe  is not that enough  heaven and earth i would sooner go to the galleys or break stones upon the roads than take a woman to my bosom who was thinking of some other man  that is all very fine  let me tell you that the other thing that which you propose to do is by no means fine  but i will not quarrel with you if i can help it  will you go away and leave us at peace  they say you are rich and have a grand house  surely you can do better than marry a poor innkeepers niecea girl that has worked hard all her life  i could do better if i chose said adrian urmand  then go and do better  do you not perceive that even my father is becoming tired of all the trouble you are making  surely you will not wait till you are turned out of the house  who will turn me out of the house  marie will and my father  do you think hell see her wither and droop and die or perhaps go mad in order that a promise may be kept to you  take the matter into your own hands at once and say you will have no more to do with it  that will be the manly way  is that all you have to say my friend asked urmand assuming a voice that was intended to be indifferent  yesthat is all  but i mean to do something more if i am driven to it  very well  when i want advice from you i will come to you for it and as for your doing i believe you are not master here as yet goodmorning  so saying adrian urmand left the room and george voss in a few minutes followed him down the stairs  the rest of the day was passed in gloom and wretchedness  george hardly spoke to his father but the two sat at table together and there was no open quarrel between them  urmand also sat with them and tried to converse with michel and madame voss  but michel would say very little to him and the mistress of the house was so cowed by the circumstances of the day that she was hardly able to talk marie still kept her room and it was stated to them that she was not well and was in bed  her uncle had gone to see her twice but had made no report to any one of what had passed between them  it had come to be understood that george would sleep there at any rate for that night and a bed had been prepared for him  the party broke up very early for there was nothing in common among them to keep them together  madame voss sat murmuring with the priest for half an hour or so but it seemed that the gloom attendant upon the young lovers had settled also upon m le cure  even he escaped as early as he could  when george was about to undress himself there came a knock at his door and one of the servantgirls put into his hand a scrap of paper on it was written i will never marry him nevernevernever upon my honour    chapter xix  michel voss at this time was a very unhappy man  he had taught himself to believe that it would be a good thing that his niece should marry adrian urmand and that it was his duty to achieve this good thing in her behalf  he had had it on his mind for the last year and had nearly brought it to pass  there was moreover now at this present moment a clear duty on him to be true to the young man who with his consent and indeed very much at his instance had become betrothed to marie bromar  the reader will understand how ideas of duty not very clearly looked into or analysed acted upon his mind  and then there was always present to him a recurrence of that early caution which had made him lay a parental embargo upon anything like love between his son and his wifes niece  without much thinking about itfor he probably never thought very much about anythinghe had deemed it prudent to separate two young people brought up together when they began as he fancied to be foolish  an elderly man is so apt to look upon his own son as a boy and on a girl who has grown up under his nose as little more than a child  and then george in those days had had no business of his own and should not have thought of such a thing  in this way the mind of michel voss had been forced into strong hostility against the idea of a marriage between marie and his son and had filled itself with the spirit of a partisan on the side of adrian urmand  but now as things had gone he had been made very unhappy by the state of his own mind and consequently was beginning to feel a great dislike for the merchant from basle  the stupid mean little fellow with his white pockethandkerchief and his scent and his black greasy hair had made his way into the house and had destroyed all comfort and pleasure  that was the light in which michel was now disposed to regard his previously honoured guest  when he made a comparison between adrian and george he could not but acknowledge that any girl of spirit and sense would prefer his son  he was very proud of his sonproud even of the lads disobedience to himself on such a subject and this feeling added to his discomfort  he had twice seen marie in her bed during that day spoken of in the last chapter  on both occasions he had meant to be very firm but it was not easy for such a one as michel voss to be firm to a young woman in her nightcap rather pale whose eyes were red with weeping  a woman in bed was to him always an object of tenderness and a woman in tears as his wife well knew could on most occasions get the better of him  when he first saw marie he merely told her to lie still and take a little broth  he kissed her however and patted her cheek and then got out of the room as quickly as he could  he knew his own weakness and was afraid to trust himself to her prayers while she lay before him in that guise  when he went again he had been unable not to listen to a word or two which she had prepared and had ready for instant speech  uncle michel she said i will never marry any one without your leave if you will let m urmand go away  he had almost come to wish by this time that m urmand would go away and never come back again  how am i to send him away he had said crossly  if you tell him i know he will goat once said marie  michel had muttered something about maries illness and the impossibility of doing anything at present and again had left the room  then marie began to take heart of grace and to think that victory might yet be on her side  but how was george to know that she was firmly determined to throw those odious betrothals to the wind  feeling it to be absolutely incumbent on her to convey to him this knowledge she wrote the few words which the servant conveyed to her lovermaking no promise in regard to him but simply assuring him that she would nevernevernever become the wife of that other man  early on the following morning michel voss went off by himself  he could not stay in bed and he could not hang about the house  he did not know how to demean himself to either of the young men when he met them  he could not be cordial as he ought to be with urmand nor could he be austere to george with that austerity which he felt would have been proper on his part  he was becoming very tired of his dignity and authority  hitherto the exercise of power in his household had generally been easy enough his wife and marie had always been loving and pleasant in their obedience  till within these last weeks there had even been the most perfect accordance between him and his niece  send him awaythats very easily said he muttered to himself as he went up towards the mountains but he has got my engagement and of course hell hold me to it he trudged on he hardly knew whither  he was so unhappy that the mills and the timbercutting were nothing to him  when he had walked himself into a heat he sat down and took out his pipe but he smoked more by habit than for enjoyment  supposing that he did bring himself to change his mindwhich he did not think he ever wouldhow could he break the matter to urmand  he told himself that he was sure he would not change his mind because of his solemn engagement to the young man but he did acknowledge that the young man was not what he had taken him to be  he was effeminate and wanted spirit and smelt of hairgrease  michel had discovered none of these defectshad perhaps regarded the characteristics as meritorious rather than otherwisewhile he had been hotly in favour of the marriage  then the hairgrease and the rest of it had in his eyes simply been signs of the civilisation of the town as contrasted with the rusticity of the country  it was then a great thing in his eyes that marie should marry a man so polished though much of the polish may have come from pomade  now his ideas were altered and as he sat alone upon the log he continued to turn up his nose at poor m urmand  but how was he to be rid of himand if not of him what was he to do then  was he to let all authority go by the board and allow the two young people to marry although the whole village heard how he had pledged himself in this matter  as he was sitting there suddenly his son came upon him  he frowned and went on smoking though at heart he felt grateful to george for having found him out and followed him  he was altogether tired of being alone or worse than that of being left together with adrian urmand  but the overtures for a general reconciliation could not come first from him nor could any be entertained without at least some show of obedience  i thought i should find you up here said george  and now you have found me what of that  i fancy we can talk better father up among the woods than we can down there when that young man is hanging about  we always used to have a chat up here you know  it was different then said michel  that was before you had learned to think it a fine thing to be your own master and to oppose me in everything  i have never opposed you but in one thing father  ah yes in one thing  but that one thing is everything  here ive been doing the best i could for both of you striving to put you upon your legs and make you a man and her a woman and this is the return i get  but what would you have had me do  what would i have had you do  not come here and oppose me in everything  but when this adrian urmand  i am sick of adrian urmand said michel voss  george raised his eyebrows and stared  i dont mean that said he but i am beginning to hate the very sight of the man  if hed had the pluck of a wren he would have carried her off long ago  i dont know how that may be but he hasnt done it yet  come father you dont like the man any more than she does  if you get tired of him in three days what would she do in her whole life  why did she accept him then  perhaps father we were all to blame a little in that  i was not to blamenot in the least  i wont admit it  i did the best i could for her  she accepted him and they are betrothed the cure down there says its nearly as good as being married  who cares what father gondin says asked george  im sure i dont said michel voss  the betrothal means nothing father if either of them choose to change their minds  there was that girl over at saint die  dont tell me of the girl at saint die  im sick of hearing of the girl at saint die  what the mischief is the girl at saint die to us  weve got to do our duty if we can like honest men and women and not follow vagaries learned from saint die  the two men walked down the hill together reaching the hotel about noon  long before that time the innkeeper had fallen into a way of acknowledging that adrian urmand was an incubus but he had not as yet quite admitted that there was any way of getting rid of the incubus  the idea of having the marriage on the 1st of the present month was altogether abandoned and michel had already asked how they might manage among them to send adrian urmand back to basle he must come again if he chooses he had said but i suppose he had better go now  marie is ill and she mustnt be worried george proposed that his father should tell this to urmand himself but it seemed that michel who had never yet been known to be afraid of any man was in some degree afraid of the little swiss merchant  suppose my mother says a word to him suggested george  she wouldnt dare for her life answered the father  i would do it  no indeed george you shall do no such thing  then george suggested the priest but nothing had been settled when they reached the inndoor  there he was swinging a cane at the foot of the billiardroom stairsthe little bugaboo who was now so much in the way of all of them  the innkeeper muttered some salutation and george just touched his hat  then they both passed on and went into the house  unfortunately the plea of maries illness was in part cut from under their feet by the appearance of marie herself  george who had not as yet seen her went up quickly to her and without saying a word took her by the hand and held it  marie murmured some pretence at a salutation but what she said was heard by no one  when her uncle came to her and kissed her her hand was still grasped in that of george  all this had taken place in the passage and before michels embrace was over adrian urmand was standing in the doorway looking on  george when he saw him held tighter by the hand and marie made no attempt to draw it away  what is the meaning of all this said urmand coming up  meaning of what asked michel  i dont understand iti dont understand it at all said urmand  dont understand what said michel  the two lovers were still holding each others hands but michel had not seen it or seeing it had not observed it  am i to understand that marie bromar is betrothed to me or not demanded adrian  when i get an answer either way i shall know what to do  there was in this an assumption of more spirit than had been expected on his part by his enemies at the lion dor  why shouldnt you be betrothed to her said michel  of course you are betrothed to her but i dont see what is the use of your talking so much about it  it is the first time i have said a word on the subject since ive been here said urmand  which was true but as michel was continually thinking of the betrothal he imagined that everybody was always talking to him of the matter  marie had now managed to get her hand free and had retired into the kitchen  michel followed her and stood meditative with his back to the large stove  as it happened there was no one else present there at the moment  tell him to go back to basle whispered marie to her uncle michel only shook his head and groaned  i dont think i am at all welltreated here among you said adrian urmand to george as soon as they were alone  any special friendship from me you can hardly expect said george as to my father and the rest of them if they illtreat you i suppose you had better leave them  i wont put up with illtreatment from anybody  its not what im used to  look here m urmand said george  i quite admit you have been badly used and on the part of the family i am ready to apologise  i dont want any apology  what do you want m urmand  i wanti wantnever mind what i want  it is from your father that i shall demand it not from you  i shall take care to see myself righted  i know the french law as well as the swiss  if youre talking of law you had better go back to basle and get a lawyer said george  there had been no word spoken of george returning to colmar on that morning  he had told his father that he had brought nothing with him but what he had on and in truth when he left colmar he had not looked forward to any welcome which would induce him to remain at granpere  but the course of things had been different from that which he had expected  he was much too good a general to think of returning now and he had friends in the house who knew how to supply him with what was most necessary to him  nobody had asked him to stay  his father had not uttered a word of welcome  but he did stay and michel would have been very much surprised indeed if he had heard that he had gone  the man in the stable had ventured to suggest that the old mare would not be wanted to go over the mountain that day  to this george assented and made special request that the old mare might receive gentle treatment  and so the day passed away  marie who had recovered her health was busy as usual about the house  george and urmand though they did not associate were rarely long out of each others sight and neither the one nor the other found much opportunity for pressing his suit  george probably felt that there was not much need to do so and urmand must have known that any pressing of his suit in the ordinary way would be of no avail  the innkeeper tried to make work for himself about the place had the carriages out and washed inspected the horses and gave orders as to the future slaughter of certain pigs  everybody about the house nevertheless down to the smallest boy attached to the inn knew that the landlords mind was preoccupied with the love affairs of those two men  there was hardly an inhabitant of granpere who did not understand what was going on and had it been the custom of the place to make bets on such matters very long odds would have been wanted before any one would have backed adrian urmand  and yet two days ago he was considered to be sure of the prize  m le cure gondin was a good deal at the hotel during the day and perhaps he was the stanchest supporter of the swiss aspirant  he endeavoured to support madame voss having that strong dislike to yield an inch in practice or in doctrine which is indicative of his order  he strove hard to make madame voss understand that if only she would be firm and cause her husband to be firm also marie would of course yield at last  i have ever so many young women just in the same way said the cure and you would have thought they were going to break their hearts but as soon as ever they have been married they have forgotten all that  madame voss would have been quite contented to comply with the priests counsel could she have seen the way with her husband but it had become almost manifest even to her with the cure to support her that the star of adrian urmand was on the wane  she felt from every word that marie spoke to her that marie herself was confident of success  and it may be said of madame voss that although she had been forced by michel into a kind of enthusiasm on behalf of the swiss marriage she had no very eager wishes of her own on the subject  marie was her own niece and was dear to her but the girl was sure of a welltodo husband whichever way the war went and what aunt need desire more for her most favourite niece than a welltodo husband  the day went by and the supper was eaten and the cigars were smoked and then they all went to bed  but nothing more had been settled  that obstinate young man m adrian urmand though he had talked of his lawyer had said not a word of going back to basle    chapter xx  it is probable that all those concerned in the matter who slept at the lion dor that night made up their minds that on the following day the powers of the establishment must come to some decision  it was not right that a young woman should have to live in the house with two favoured lovers nor as regarded the young men was it right that they should be allowed to go on glaring at each other both michel and madame voss feared that they would do more than glare seeing that they were so like two dogs with one bone between them who in such an emergency will generally fight  urmand himself was quite alive to the necessity of putting an end to his present exceptionally disagreeable position  he was very angry very angry naturally with marie who had he thought treated him villainously  why had she made that little soft languid promise to him when he was last at granpere if she had not then loved him and of course he was angry with george voss  what unsuccessful lover fails of being angry with his happy rival  and then george had behaved with outrageous impropriety  urmand was beginning now to have a clear insight of the circumstances  george and marie had been lovers and then george having been sent away had forgotten his love for a year or more  but when the girl had been accommodated with another lover then he thrust himself forward and disturbed everybodys arrangements  no conduct could have been worse than this  but nevertheless urmands anger was the hottest against michel voss himself  had he been left alone at basle had he been allowed to receive maries letter and act upon it in accordance with his own judgment he would never have made himself ridiculous by appearing at granpere as a discomfited lover but the innkeeper had come and dragged him away from home had misrepresented everything had carried him away as it were by force to the scene of his disgrace and nowthrew him over  he at any rate he michel voss should as adrian urmand felt very bitterly have been true and constant but michel whose face could not lie whatever his words might do was clearly as anxious to be rid of his young friend as were any of the others in the hotel urmand himself would have been very glad to be back at basle  he had come to regard any farther connection with the inn at granpere as extremely undesirable  the voss family was low  he had found that out during his present visit  but how was he to get away and not look as he was going like a dog with his tail between his legs  he had so clear a right to demand maries hand that he could not bring himself to bear to be robbed of his claim  and yet he had come to perceive how very foolish such a marriage would be  he had been told that he could do better  of course he could do better but how could he be rid of his bargain without submitting to illtreatment  if michel had not come and fetched him away from his home the illtreatment would have been by comparison slight and of that normal kind to which young men are accustomed  but to be brought over to the house and then to be deserted by everybody in the house  how o how was he to get out of the house  such were his reflections as he sat solitary in the long public room drinking his coffee and eating an omelet with which peter veque had supplied him but which had in truth been cooked for him very carefully by marie bromar herself  in her present frame of mind marie would have cooked ortolans for him had he wished for them  and while urmand was eating his omelet and thinking of his wrongs michel voss and his son were standing together at the stable door michel had been there some time before his son had joined him and when george came up to him he put out his hand almost furtively george grasped it instantly and then there came a tear into the innkeepers eye  i have brought you a little of that tobacco we were talking of said george taking a small packet out of his pocket  thank ye george thank ye but it does not much matter now what i smoke  things are going wrong and i dont get satisfaction out of anything  dont say that father  how can i help saying it  look at that fellow up there  what am i to do with him  what am i to say to him  he means to stay there till he gets his wife  hell never get a wife here if he stays till the house falls on him  i can see that now  but what am i to say to him  how am i to get rid of him  there is no denying you know that he has been treated badly among us  would he take a little money father  no  hes not so bad as that  i should not have thought so only he talked to me about his lawyer  ahhe did that in his anger  by george if i was in his position i should try and raise the very devil  but dont talk of giving him money george  hes not bad in that way  he shouldnt have said anything about his lawyer  you wait till youre placed as he is and youll find that youll say anything that comes uppermost  but what are we to do with him george  then the matter was discussed in the utmost confidence and in all its bearings  george offered to have a carriage and pair of horses got ready for remiremont and then to tell the young man that he was expected to get into it and go away but michel felt that there must be some more ceremonious treatment than that  george then suggested that the cure should give the message but michel again objected  the message he felt must be given by himself  the doing this would be very bitter to him because it would be necessary that he should humble himself before the scented shiny head of the little man  but michel knew that it must be so  urmand had been undoubtedly illtreated among them and the apology for that illtreatment must be made by the chief of the family himself i suppose i might as well go to him alone said michel groaning  well yes i should say so replied his son  soonest begun soonest overand i suppose i might as well order the horses  to this latter suggestion the father made no reply but went slowly into the house  he turned for a moment into maries little office and stood there hesitating whether he would tell her his mission as she was to be made happy why should she not know it  you two have got the better of me among you he said  which two uncle michel  which two  why you and george  and what im to do with the gentleman upstairs it passes me to think  thank heaven it will be a great many years before flos wants a husband  flos was the little daughter upstairs who was as yet no more than five years old  i hope uncle michel youll never have anybody else as naughty and troublesome as i have been said marie pressing close to him  she was indescribably happy  she was to be saved from the lover whom she did not want  she was to have the lover whom she did want and over and above all this a spirit of kind feeling and full sympathy existed once more between her and her dear friend  as she offered no advice in regard to the disposal of the gentleman upstairs michel was obliged to go upon his painful duty trusting to his own wit  in the long room upstairs he found adrian urmand sitting at the closed window looking out at the ducks who were paddling in a temporary pool made by the late rains  he had been painfully in want of something to doso much so that he had more than once almost resolved to put his things into his bag and leave the house without saying a word of farewell to any one  had there been any means for him to escape from granpere without saying a word he would have done so  but at granpere there was no railway and the only public conveyance in and out of the place started from the door of the lion dor started every morning with much ceremony so that it was impossible for him to fly unobserved  there he was watching the ducks when michel entered the room and very much disposed to quarrel with any one who approached him  im afraid you find it rather dull here said michel beginning the conversation  it is dull very dull indeed  that is the worst of it  we are dull people here in the country we have not the distractions which you town folk can always find theres not much to do and nothing to look at  very little to look at thats worth the trouble of looking said urmand  there was a malignity of satire intended in this for the young man in his wrath and with a full conviction of what was coming upon him had intended to include his betrothed in the catalogue of things of granpere not worthy of inspection  but michel voss did not at all follow him so far as that  i never saw such a place continued urmand  there isnt a soul even to play a game of billiards with  now michel voss although for a purpose he had been willing to make little of his own village did in truth consider that granpere was at any rate as good a place to live in as basle  and he felt that though he might abuse granpere it was very uncourteous in adrian urmand to do so  i dont think much of playing billiards in the morning i must own said he  i daresay not said urmand still looking at the ducks  michel had made no progress as yet so he sat down and scratched his head  the more he thought of it the larger the difficulty seemed to be  he was quite aware now that it was his own unfortunate journey to basle which had brought so heavy a burden on him  it was as yet no more than three or four days since he had taken upon himself to assure the young man that he by his own authority would make everything right and now he was forced to acknowledge that everything was wrong  m urmand he said at last it has been a very great grief to me a very great grief indeed that you should have found things so uncomfortable  what things do you mean said urmand  welleverythingabout marie you know  when i went over to basle the other day i didnt think how it was going to turn out  i didnt indeed  and how is it going to turn out  i cant make the young woman consent you know said the innkeeper  let me tell you m voss that i wouldnt have the young woman as you call her if she consented ever so much  she has disgraced me  to this michel listened with perfect equanimity  she has disgraced you  at hearing this michel bit his lips telling himself however that there had been mistakes made and that he was bound to bear a good deal  and she has disgraced herself said adrian urmand with all the emphasis that he had at command  i deny it said maries uncle coming close up to his opponent and standing before him  i deny it  it is not true  that shall not be said in my hearing even by you  but i do say it  she has disgraced herself  did she not give me her troth when all the time she intended to marry another man  no  she did nothing of the kind  and look here my friend if you wish to be treated like a man in this house you had better not say anything against any of the women who live in it  you may abuse me as much as you pleaseand george too if it will do you any good there have been mistakes made and we owe you something  by heavens yes you do  but you shant take it out in saying anything against marie bromarnot in my hearing  whywhat will you do  dont drive me to do anything m urmand  if there is any compensation possible  of course there must be compensation  what is it you will take  is it money  moneyno  as for money im better off than any of you  what is it then  you dont want the girl herself  nocertainly not  i would not take her if she came and knelt to me  what can we do then  if you will only say  i wanti wanti dont know what i want  i have been cruelly illused and made a fool of before everybody  i never heard of such a case beforenever  and i have been so generous and honest to you i did not ask for a franc of dot and now you come and offer me money  i dont think any man ever was so badly used anywhere  and on saying this adrian urmand in very truth burst into tears  the innkeepers heart was melted at once  it was all so true between them they had treated him very badly  but then there had been so many unfortunate and unavoidable mistakes  when the young man talked of compensation what was michel voss to think  his son had been led into exactly the same error  nevertheless he repented himself bitterly in that he had said anything about money and was prepared to make the most abject apologies  adrian urmand had fallen into a chair and michel voss came and seated himself close beside him  i beg your pardon urmand i do indeed  i ought not to have mentioned money  but when you spoke of compensation  it wasnt that  it wasnt that  its my feelings  then the white cambric handkerchief was taken out and used with considerable vehemence  from that moment the innkeepers goodwill towards urmand returned though of course he was quite aware that there was no place for him in that family  if there is anything i can do i will do it said michel piteously  it has been unfortunate  i know it has been very unfortunate  but we didnt mean to be untrue  if you had only left me alone when i was at home said the unfortunate young man who was still sobbing bitterly  they two remained in the long room together for a considerable time during all of which michel voss was as gentle as though urmand had been a child  nor did the poor rejected lover again have recourse to any violence of abuse though he would over and over again repeat his opinion that surely since lovers were first known in the world and betrothals of marriage first made no one had ever been so illused as was he  it soon became clear to michel that his great grief did not come from the loss of his wife but from the feeling that everybody would know that he had been illused  there wasnt a shopkeeper in his own town he said who hadnt heard of his approaching marriage  and what was he to say when he went back  just say that you found us so rough and rustic said michel voss  but urmand knew well that no such saying on his part would be believed  i think i shall go to lyons said he and stay there for six months  whats the business to me  i dont care for the business  there they sat all the morning  two or three times peter veque opened the door peeped in at them and then brought down word that the conference was still going on  the master is sitting just over him like said peter and theyre as close and loving as birds  marie listened and said not a word to any one  george had made two or three little attempts during the morning to entice her into some loverlike privacy  but marie would not be enticed  the man to whom she was betrothed was still in the house and though she was quite secure that the betrothals would now be absolutely annulled still she would not actually entertain another lover till this was done  at length the door of the long room was opened and the two men came out  adrian urmand who was the first to be seen in the passage went at once to his bedroom and then michel descended to the little parlour  marie was at the moment sitting on her stool of authority in the office from whence she could hear what was said in the parlour  satisfied with this she did not come down from her seat in the parlour was madame voss and the cure and george who had seen his father from the front door at once joined them  well said madame voss how is it to be  ive arranged that were to have a little picnic up the ravine tomorrow said michel  a picnic said the cure  im all for a picnic said george  a picnic said madame voss and the ground as wet as a sop and the wind from the mountains enough to cut one in two  never mind about the wind  well take coats and umbrellas  its better to have some kind of an outing and then hell recover himself  marie as she heard all this made up her mind that if any possible store of provisions packed in hampers could bring her late lover round to equanimity no efforts on her part should be wanting  she would pack up cold chickens and champagne bottles with the greatest pleasure and would eat her dinner sitting on a rock even though the wind from the mountains should cut her in two  and so its all to end in a picnic said m le cure with evident disgust  it appeared from michels description of what had taken place during that very long interview that adrian urmand had at last become quite gentle and confidential  in what way could he be let down the most easily  that was the question for the answering which these two heads were kept together in conference so long  how could it be made to appear that the betrothal had been annulled by mutual consent  at last the happy idea of a picnic occurred to michel himself  i never thought about the time of the year he said but when friends are here and we want to do our best for them we always take them to the ravine and have dinners on the rocks  it had seemed to him and as he declared to urmand also that if something like a jubilee could be got up before the young mans departure it would appear as though there could not have been much disappointment  we shall all catch our death of cold said madame voss  we neednt stay long you know said michel  and marie said he going into the little office in which his niece was still seated marie mind you behave yourself  o i will uncle michel she said  you shall see    chapter xxi  they all sat down together at supper that evening marie dispensing her soup as usual before she went to the table  she sat next to her uncle on one side and below her there were vacant seats  urmand took a chair on the left hand of madame voss next to him was the cure and below the cure the happy rival  it had all been arranged by marie herself with the greatest care  urmand seemed to have got over the worst of his trouble and when marie came to the table bowed to her graciously  she bowed in return and then eat her soup in silence  michel voss overdid his part a little by too much talking but his wife restored the balance by her prudence  george told them how strong the french party was at colmar and explained that the germans had not a leg to stand upon as far as general opinion went  before the supper was over adrian urmand was talking glibly enough and it really seemed as though the terrible misfortunes of the lion dor would arrange themselves comfortably after all  when supper was done the father son and the discarded lover smoked their pipes together amicably in the billiard room there was not a word said then by either of them in connection with marie bromar  on the next morning the sun was bright and the air was as warm as it ever is in october  the day perhaps might not have been selected for an outofdoors party had there been no special reason for such an arrangement but seeing how strong a reason existed even madame voss acknowledged that the morning was favourable while those pipes of peace were being smoked over night marie had been preparing the hampers  on the next morning nobody except marie herself was very early  it was intended that the day should be got through at any rate with a pretence of pleasure and they were all to be as idle and genteel and agreeable as possible  it had been settled that they should start at twelve  the drive unfortunately would not consume much more than half an hour  then what with unpacking climbing about the rocks and throwing stones down into the river they would get through the time till two  at two they would eat their dinnerwith all their shawls and greatcoats around themthen smoke their cigars and come back when they found it impossible to drag out the day any longer  marie was not to talk to george and was to be specially courteous to m urmand  the two old ladies accompanied them as did also m le cure gondin  the programme for the day did not seem to be very delightful but it appeared to michel voss that in this way better than in any other could some little halo be thrown over the parting hours of poor adrian urmand  everything went as well as could have been anticipated  they managed to delay their departure till nearly halfpast twelve and were so lost in wonder at the quantity of water running down the fall in the ravine that there had hardly been any heaviness of time when they seated themselves on the rocks at halfpast two  now for the business of the day said michel as standing up he plunged a knife and fork into a large pie which he had placed on a boulder before him  marie has got no soup for us here so we must begin with the solids at once  soon after that one cork might have been heard to fly and then another and no stranger looking on would have believed how dreadful had been the enmity existing on the previous dayor indeed how great a cause for enmity there had been  michel himself was very hilarious  if he could only obliterate in any way the evil which he had certainly inflicted on that unfortunate young man  urmand my friend another glass of wine  george fill our friend urmands glass not so quickly george not so quickly you give him nothing but the froth  adrian urmand your very good health  may you always be a happy and successful man  so saying michel voss drained his own tumbler  urmand at the moment was seated in a niche among the rocks in which a cushion out of the carriage had been placed for his special accommodation  indeed every comfort and luxury had been showered upon his head to compensate him for his lost bride  this was the third time that he had been by name invited to drink his wine and three times he had obeyed  now feeling himself to be summoned in a very peculiar wayfeeling also perhaps that that which might have made others drunk had made him bold he extricated himself from his niche and stood upon his legs among the rocks  he stood upon his legs among the rocks and with a graceful movement of his arm waved the glass above his head  we are delighted to have you here among us my friend said michel voss who also perhaps had been made bold  madame voss who was close to her husband pulled him by the sleeve  then he seated himself but adrian urmand was left standing among them  my friend said he and you madame voss particularly i feel particularly obliged to you for this charming entertainment  then the innkeeper cheered his guest whereupon madame voss pulled her husbands sleeve harder than before  i am indeed continued urmand  the best thing will be said he to make a clean breast of it at once  you all know why i came hereand you all know how im going back  at this moment his voice faltered a little and he almost sobbed  both the old ladies immediately put their handkerchiefs to their eyes  marie blushed and turned away her face on to her uncles shoulder  madame voss remained immovable  she dreaded greatly any symptoms of that courage which follows the flying of corks  in truth however she had nothing now to fear of course i feel it a little continued adrian urmand  that is only natural  i suppose it was a mistake but it has been rather trying to me  but i am ready to forget and forgive and that is all ive got to say  this speech which astonished them all exceedingly remained unanswered for some few moments during which urmand had sunk back into his niche  michel voss was not readywitted enough to reply to his guest at the moment and george was aware that it would not be fitting for him the triumphant lover to make any reply  he could hardly have spoken without showing his triumph during this short interval no one said a word and urmand endeavoured to assume a look of gloomy dignity  but at last michel voss got upon his legs his wife giving him various twitches on the sleeve as he did so  i never was so much affected in my life said he and upon my word i think that our excellent friend adrian urmand has behaved as well in a trying difficulty asasas any man ever did  i neednt say much about it for we all know what it was  and we all know that young women will be young women and that they are very hard to manage dont uncle michel said marie in a whisper  but michel was too bold to attend either to whisperings or pullings of the sleeve and went on with his speech  there has been a slight mistake but i hope sincerely that everything has now been made right  here is our friend adrian urmands health and i am quite sure that we all hope that he may get an excellent beautiful young wife with a good dowry and that before long  then he too sat down and all the ladies drank to the health and future fortunes of m adrian urmand  upon the whole the rejected lover liked it  at any rate it was better so than being alone and moody and despised of all people  he would know now how to get away from granpere without having to plan a surreptitious escape  of course he had come out intending to be miserable to be known as an illused man who had been treated with an amount of cruelty surpassing all that had ever been told of in love histories  to be depressed by the weight of the illusage which he had borne was a part of the play which he had to act  but the play when acted after this fashion had in it something of pleasing excitement and he felt assured that he was exhibiting dignity in very adverse circumstances  george voss was probably thinking ill of the young man all the while but every one else there conceived that m urmand bore himself well under most trying circumstances  after the banquet was over marie expressed herself so much touched as almost to incur the jealousy of her more fortunate lover  when the speeches were finished the men made themselves happy with their cigars and wine till madame voss declared that she was already halfdead with the cold and damp and then they all returned to the inn in excellent spirits  that which had made so bold both michel and his guest had not been allowed to have any more extended or more deleterious effect  on the next morning m urmand returned home to basle taking the public conveyance as far as remiremont  everybody was up to see him off and marie herself gave him his cup of coffee at parting  it was pretty to see the mingled grace and shame with which the little ceremony was performed  she hardly said a word indeed what word she did say was heard by no one but she crossed her hands on her breast and the gravest smile came over her face and she turned her eyes down to the ground and if any one ever begged pardon without a word spoken marie bromar then asked adrian urmand to pardon her the evil she had wrought upon him  o yesof course he said its all right  its all right  then she gave him her hand and said goodbye and ran away up into her room  though she had got rid of one lover not a word had yet been said as to her uncles acceptance of that other lover on her behalf nor had any words more tender been spoken between her and george than those with which the reader has been made acquainted  and now said george as soon as the diligence had started out of the yard  welland what now asked the father  i must be off to colmar next  not today george  yes todayor this evening at least  but i must settle something first  what do you say father  michel voss stood for a while with his hands in his pockets and his head turned away  you know what i mean father  o yes i know what you mean  i dont suppose youll say anything against it now  it wouldnt be any good i suppose if i did said michel crossing over the courtyard to the other part of the establishment he gave no farther permission than this but george thought that so much was sufficient  george did return to colmar that evening being in all matters of business a man accurate and resolute but he did not go till he had been thoroughly scolded for his misconduct by marie bromar  it was your fault said marie  your fault from beginning to end  it shall be if you say so answered george but i cant say that i see it  if a person goes away for more than twelve months and never sends a word or a message or a sign what is a person to think george  he could only promise her that he would never leave her again even for a month  how they were married in november and how madame faragon was brought over to granpere with infinite trouble and how the household linen got itself marked at last with a v instead of a u the reader can understand without the narration of farther details
