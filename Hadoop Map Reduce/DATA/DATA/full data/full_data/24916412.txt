sole through all our land     our task is hardwith sword and flame    to hold thine earth forever the same    and with sharp crooks of steel to keep    still as thou leftest them thy sheep     then christ sought out an artisan    a lowbrowed stunted haggard man    and a motherless girl whose fingers thin    crushed from her faintly want and sin     these set he in the midst of them    and as they drew back their garment hem    for fear of defilement lo here said he    the images ye have made of me     james russell lowell     preface   the experiences related in this volume fell to me in the summer of 1902 i went down into the underworld of london with an attitude of mind which i may best liken to that of the explorer  i was open to be convinced by the evidence of my eyes rather than by the teachings of those who had not seen or by the words of those who had seen and gone before  further i took with me certain simple criteria with which to measure the life of the underworld  that which made for more life for physical and spiritual health was good that which made for less life which hurt and dwarfed and distorted life was bad  it will be readily apparent to the reader that i saw much that was bad yet it must not be forgotten that the time of which i write was considered good times in england  the starvation and lack of shelter i encountered constituted a chronic condition of misery which is never wiped out even in the periods of greatest prosperity  following the summer in question came a hard winter  great numbers of the unemployed formed into processions as many as a dozen at a time and daily marched through the streets of london crying for bread  mr justin mccarthy writing in the month of january 1903 to the new york independent briefly epitomises the situation as follows     the workhouses have no space left in which to pack the starving    crowds who are craving every day and night at their doors for food and    shelter  all the charitable institutions have exhausted their means    in trying to raise supplies of food for the famishing residents of the    garrets and cellars of london lanes and alleys  the quarters of the    salvation army in various parts of london are nightly besieged by    hosts of the unemployed and the hungry for whom neither shelter nor    the means of sustenance can be provided  it has been urged that the criticism i have passed on things as they are in england is too pessimistic  i must say in extenuation that of optimists i am the most optimistic  but i measure manhood less by political aggregations than by individuals  society grows while political machines rack to pieces and become scrap  for the english so far as manhood and womanhood and health and happiness go i see a broad and smiling future  but for a great deal of the political machinery which at present mismanages for them i see nothing else than the scrap heap  jack london piedmont california     chapter ithe descent   but you cant do it you know friends said to whom i applied for assistance in the matter of sinking myself down into the east end of london  you had better see the police for a guide they added on second thought painfully endeavouring to adjust themselves to the psychological processes of a madman who had come to them with better credentials than brains  but i dont want to see the police i protested  what i wish to do is to go down into the east end and see things for myself  i wish to know how those people are living there and why they are living there and what they are living for  in short i am going to live there myself  you dont want to live down there everybody said with disapprobation writ large upon their faces  why it is said there are places where a mans life isnt worth tupence  the very places i wish to see i broke in  but you cant you know was the unfailing rejoinder  which is not what i came to see you about i answered brusquely somewhat nettled by their incomprehension  i am a stranger here and i want you to tell me what you know of the east end in order that i may have something to start on  but we know nothing of the east end  it is over there somewhere  and they waved their hands vaguely in the direction where the sun on rare occasions may be seen to rise  then i shall go to cooks i announced  oh yes they said with relief  cooks will be sure to know  but o cook o thomas cook  son pathfinders and trailclearers living signposts to all the world and bestowers of first aid to bewildered travellersunhesitatingly and instantly with ease and celerity could you send me to darkest africa or innermost thibet but to the east end of london barely a stones throw distant from ludgate circus you know not the way  you cant do it you know said the human emporium of routes and fares at cooks cheapside branch  it is sohemso unusual  consult the police he concluded authoritatively when i had persisted we are not accustomed to taking travellers to the east end we receive no call to take them there and we know nothing whatsoever about the place at all  never mind that i interposed to save myself from being swept out of the office by his flood of negations  heres something you can do for me  i wish you to understand in advance what i intend doing so that in case of trouble you may be able to identify me  ah i see should you be murdered we would be in position to identify the corpse  he said it so cheerfully and coldbloodedly that on the instant i saw my stark and mutilated cadaver stretched upon a slab where cool waters trickle ceaselessly and him i saw bending over and sadly and patiently identifying it as the body of the insane american who would see the east end  no no i answered merely to identify me in case i get into a scrape with the bobbies  this last i said with a thrill truly i was gripping hold of the vernacular  that he said is a matter for the consideration of the chief office  it is so unprecedented you know he added apologetically  the man at the chief office hemmed and hawed  we make it a rule he explained to give no information concerning our clients  but in this case i urged it is the client who requests you to give the information concerning himself  again he hemmed and hawed  of course i hastily anticipated i know it is unprecedented but  as i was about to remark he went on steadily it is unprecedented and i dont think we can do anything for you  however i departed with the address of a detective who lived in the east end and took my way to the american consulgeneral  and here at last i found a man with whom i could do business  there was no hemming and hawing no lifted brows open incredulity or blank amazement  in one minute i explained myself and my project which he accepted as a matter of course  in the second minute he asked my age height and weight and looked me over  and in the third minute as we shook hands at parting he said all right jack  ill remember you and keep track  i breathed a sigh of relief  having burnt my ships behind me i was now free to plunge into that human wilderness of which nobody seemed to know anything  but at once i encountered a new difficulty in the shape of my cabby a greywhiskered and eminently decorous personage who had imperturbably driven me for several hours about the city  drive me down to the east end i ordered taking my seat  where sir he demanded with frank surprise  to the east end anywhere  go on  the hansom pursued an aimless way for several minutes then came to a puzzled stop  the aperture above my head was uncovered and the cabman peered down perplexedly at me  i say he said wot plyce yer wanter go  east end i repeated  nowhere in particular  just drive me around anywhere  but wots the haddress sir  see here i thundered  drive me down to the east end and at once  it was evident that he did not understand but he withdrew his head and grumblingly started his horse  nowhere in the streets of london may one escape the sight of abject poverty while five minutes walk from almost any point will bring one to a slum but the region my hansom was now penetrating was one unending slum  the streets were filled with a new and different race of people short of stature and of wretched or beersodden appearance  we rolled along through miles of bricks and squalor and from each cross street and alley flashed long vistas of bricks and misery  here and there lurched a drunken man or woman and the air was obscene with sounds of jangling and squabbling  at a market tottery old men and women were searching in the garbage thrown in the mud for rotten potatoes beans and vegetables while little children clustered like flies around a festering mass of fruit thrusting their arms to the shoulders into the liquid corruption and drawing forth morsels but partially decayed which they devoured on the spot  not a hansom did i meet with in all my drive while mine was like an apparition from another and better world the way the children ran after it and alongside  and as far as i could see were the solid walls of brick the slimy pavements and the screaming streets and for the first time in my life the fear of the crowd smote me  it was like the fear of the sea and the miserable multitudes street upon street seemed so many waves of a vast and malodorous sea lapping about me and threatening to well up and over me  stepney sir stepney station the cabby called down  i looked about  it was really a railroad station and he had driven desperately to it as the one familiar spot he had ever heard of in all that wilderness  well i said  he spluttered unintelligibly shook his head and looked very miserable im a strynger ere he managed to articulate  an if yer dont want stepney station im blessed if i know wotcher do want  ill tell you what i want i said  you drive along and keep your eye out for a shop where old clothes are sold  now when you see such a shop drive right on till you turn the corner then stop and let me out  i could see that he was growing dubious of his fare but not long afterwards he pulled up to the curb and informed me that an oldclothes shop was to be found a bit of the way back  wontcher py me he pleaded  theres seven an six owin me  yes i laughed and it would be the last id see of you  lord lumme but itll be the last i see of you if yer dont py me he retorted  but a crowd of ragged onlookers had already gathered around the cab and i laughed again and walked back to the oldclothes shop  here the chief difficulty was in making the shopman understand that i really and truly wanted old clothes  but after fruitless attempts to press upon me new and impossible coats and trousers he began to bring to light heaps of old ones looking mysterious the while and hinting darkly this he did with the palpable intention of letting me know that he had piped my lay in order to bulldose me through fear of exposure into paying heavily for my purchases  a man in trouble or a highclass criminal from across the water was what he took my measure forin either case a person anxious to avoid the police  but i disputed with him over the outrageous difference between prices and values till i quite disabused him of the notion and he settled down to drive a hard bargain with a hard customer  in the end i selected a pair of stout though wellworn trousers a frayed jacket with one remaining button a pair of brogans which had plainly seen service where coal was shovelled a thin leather belt and a very dirty cloth cap  my underclothing and socks however were new and warm but of the sort that any american waif down in his luck could acquire in the ordinary course of events  i must sy yer a sharp un he said with counterfeit admiration as i handed over the ten shillings finally agreed upon for the outfit blimey if you aint ben up an down petticut lane afore now  yer trouseys is wuth five bob to hany man an a docker ud give two an six for the shoes to sy nothin of the coat an cap an new stokers singlet an hother things  how much will you give me for them i demanded suddenly  i paid you ten bob for the lot and ill sell them back to you right now for eight  come its a go  but he grinned and shook his head and though i had made a good bargain i was unpleasantly aware that he had made a better one  i found the cabby and a policeman with their heads together but the latter after looking me over sharply and particularly scrutinizing the bundle under my arm turned away and left the cabby to wax mutinous by himself  and not a step would he budge till i paid him the seven shillings and sixpence owing him  whereupon he was willing to drive me to the ends of the earth apologising profusely for his insistence and explaining that one ran across queer customers in london town  but he drove me only to highbury vale in north london where my luggage was waiting for me  here next day i took off my shoes not without regret for their lightness and comfort and my soft grey travelling suit and in fact all my clothing and proceeded to array myself in the clothes of the other and unimaginable men who must have been indeed unfortunate to have had to part with such rags for the pitiable sums obtainable from a dealer  inside my stokers singlet in the armpit i sewed a gold sovereign an emergency sum certainly of modest proportions and inside my stokers singlet i put myself  and then i sat down and moralised upon the fair years and fat which had made my skin soft and brought the nerves close to the surface for the singlet was rough and raspy as a hair shirt and i am confident that the most rigorous of ascetics suffer no more than i did in the ensuing twentyfour hours  the remainder of my costume was fairly easy to put on though the brogans or brogues were quite a problem  as stiff and hard as if made of wood it was only after a prolonged pounding of the uppers with my fists that i was able to get my feet into them at all  then with a few shillings a knife a handkerchief and some brown papers and flake tobacco stowed away in my pockets i thumped down the stairs and said goodbye to my foreboding friends  as i paused out of the door the help a comely middleaged woman could not conquer a grin that twisted her lips and separated them till the throat out of involuntary sympathy made the uncouth animal noises we are wont to designate as laughter  no sooner was i out on the streets than i was impressed by the difference in status effected by my clothes  all servility vanished from the demeanour of the common people with whom i came in contact  presto in the twinkling of an eye so to say i had become one of them  my frayed and outatelbows jacket was the badge and advertisement of my class which was their class  it made me of like kind and in place of the fawning and too respectful attention i had hitherto received i now shared with them a comradeship  the man in corduroy and dirty neckerchief no longer addressed me as sir or governor  it was mate nowand a fine and hearty word with a tingle to it and a warmth and gladness which the other term does not possess  governor  it smacks of mastery and power and high authoritythe tribute of the man who is under to the man on top delivered in the hope that he will let up a bit and ease his weight which is another way of saying that it is an appeal for alms  this brings me to a delight i experienced in my rags and tatters which is denied the average american abroad  the european traveller from the states who is not a croesus speedily finds himself reduced to a chronic state of selfconscious sordidness by the hordes of cringing robbers who clutter his steps from dawn till dark and deplete his pocketbook in a way that puts compound interest to the blush  in my rags and tatters i escaped the pestilence of tipping and encountered men on a basis of equality  nay before the day was out i turned the tables and said most gratefully thank you sir to a gentleman whose horse i held and who dropped a penny into my eager palm  other changes i discovered were wrought in my condition by my new garb in crossing crowded thoroughfares i found i had to be if anything more lively in avoiding vehicles and it was strikingly impressed upon me that my life had cheapened in direct ratio with my clothes  when before i inquired the way of a policeman i was usually asked bus or ansom sir  but now the query became walk or ride  also at the railway stations a thirdclass ticket was now shoved out to me as a matter of course  but there was compensation for it all  for the first time i met the english lower classes face to face and knew them for what they were when loungers and workmen at street corners and in publichouses talked with me they talked as one man to another and they talked as natural men should talk without the least idea of getting anything out of me for what they talked or the way they talked  and when at last i made into the east end i was gratified to find that the fear of the crowd no longer haunted me  i had become a part of it the vast and malodorous sea had welled up and over me or i had slipped gently into it and there was nothing fearsome about itwith the one exception of the stokers singlet     chapter iijohnny upright   i shall not give you the address of johnny upright  let it suffice that he lives in the most respectable street in the east enda street that would be considered very mean in america but a veritable oasis in the desert of east london  it is surrounded on every side by closepacked squalor and streets jammed by a young and vile and dirty generation but its own pavements are comparatively bare of the children who have no other place to play while it has an air of desertion so few are the people that come and go  each house in this street as in all the streets is shoulder to shoulder with its neighbours  to each house there is but one entrance the front door and each house is about eighteen feet wide with a bit of a brick walled yard behind where when it is not raining one may look at a slatecoloured sky  but it must be understood that this is east end opulence we are now considering  some of the people in this street are even so welltodo as to keep a slavey  johnny upright keeps one as i well know she being my first acquaintance in this particular portion of the world  to johnny uprights house i came and to the door came the slavey  now mark you her position in life was pitiable and contemptible but it was with pity and contempt that she looked at me  she evinced a plain desire that our conversation should be short  it was sunday and johnny upright was not at home and that was all there was to it  but i lingered discussing whether or not it was all there was to it till mrs johnny upright was attracted to the door where she scolded the girl for not having closed it before turning her attention to me  no mr johnny upright was not at home and further he saw nobody on sunday  it is too bad said i  was i looking for work  no quite the contrary in fact i had come to see johnny upright on business which might be profitable to him  a change came over the face of things at once  the gentleman in question was at church but would be home in an hour or thereabouts when no doubt he could be seen  would i kindly step inno the lady did not ask me though i fished for an invitation by stating that i would go down to the corner and wait in a publichouse  and down to the corner i went but it being church time the pub was closed  a miserable drizzle was falling and in lieu of better i took a seat on a neighbourly doorstep and waited  and here to the doorstep came the slavey very frowzy and very perplexed to tell me that the missus would let me come back and wait in the kitchen  so many people come ere lookin for work mrs johnny upright apologetically explained  so i ope you wont feel bad the way i spoke  not at all not at all i replied in my grandest manner for the nonce investing my rags with dignity  i quite understand i assure you  i suppose people looking for work almost worry you to death  that they do she answered with an eloquent and expressive glance and thereupon ushered me into not the kitchen but the dining rooma favour i took it in recompense for my grand manner  this diningroom on the same floor as the kitchen was about four feet below the level of the ground and so dark it was midday that i had to wait a space for my eyes to adjust themselves to the gloom  dirty light filtered in through a window the top of which was on a level with a sidewalk and in this light i found that i was able to read newspaper print  and here while waiting the coming of johnny upright let me explain my errand  while living eating and sleeping with the people of the east end it was my intention to have a port of refuge not too far distant into which could run now and again to assure myself that good clothes and cleanliness still existed  also in such port i could receive my mail work up my notes and sally forth occasionally in changed garb to civilisation  but this involved a dilemma  a lodging where my property would be safe implied a landlady apt to be suspicious of a gentleman leading a double life while a landlady who would not bother her head over the double life of her lodgers would imply lodgings where property was unsafe  to avoid the dilemma was what had brought me to johnny upright  a detective of thirtyodd years continuous service in the east end known far and wide by a name given him by a convicted felon in the dock he was just the man to find me an honest landlady and make her rest easy concerning the strange comings and goings of which i might be guilty  his two daughters beat him home from churchand pretty girls they were in their sunday dresses withal it was the certain weak and delicate prettiness which characterises the cockney lasses a prettiness which is no more than a promise with no grip on time and doomed to fade quickly away like the colour from a sunset sky  they looked me over with frank curiosity as though i were some sort of a strange animal and then ignored me utterly for the rest of my wait  then johnny upright himself arrived and i was summoned upstairs to confer with him  speak loud he interrupted my opening words  ive got a bad cold and i cant hear well  shades of old sleuth and sherlock holmes  i wondered as to where the assistant was located whose duty it was to take down whatever information i might loudly vouchsafe  and to this day much as i have seen of johnny upright and much as i have puzzled over the incident i have never been quite able to make up my mind as to whether or not he had a cold or had an assistant planted in the other room  but of one thing i am sure though i gave johnny upright the facts concerning myself and project he withheld judgment till next day when i dodged into his street conventionally garbed and in a hansom  then his greeting was cordial enough and i went down into the diningroom to join the family at tea  we are humble here he said not given to the flesh and you must take us for what we are in our humble way  the girls were flushed and embarrassed at greeting me while he did not make it any the easier for them  ha ha he roared heartily slapping the table with his open hand till the dishes rang  the girls thought yesterday you had come to ask for a piece of bread  ha ha ho ho ho  this they indignantly denied with snapping eyes and guilty red cheeks as though it were an essential of true refinement to be able to discern under his rags a man who had no need to go ragged  and then while i ate bread and marmalade proceeded a play at cross purposes the daughters deeming it an insult to me that i should have been mistaken for a beggar and the father considering it as the highest compliment to my cleverness to succeed in being so mistaken  all of which i enjoyed and the bread the marmalade and the tea till the time came for johnny upright to find me a lodging which he did not halfa dozen doors away in his own respectable and opulent street in a house as like to his own as a pea to its mate     chapter iiimy lodging and some others   from an east london standpoint the room i rented for six shillings or a dollar and a half per week was a most comfortable affair  from the american standpoint on the other hand it was rudely furnished uncomfortable and small  by the time i had added an ordinary typewriter table to its scanty furnishing i was hard put to turn around at the best i managed to navigate it by a sort of vermicular progression requiring great dexterity and presence of mind  having settled myself or my property rather i put on my knockabout clothes and went out for a walk  lodgings being fresh in my mind i began to look them up bearing in mind the hypothesis that i was a poor young man with a wife and large family  my first discovery was that empty houses were few and far betweenso far between in fact that though i walked miles in irregular circles over a large area i still remained between  not one empty house could i finda conclusive proof that the district was saturated  it being plain that as a poor young man with a family i could rent no houses at all in this most undesirable region i next looked for rooms unfurnished rooms in which i could store my wife and babies and chattels  there were not many but i found them usually in the singular for one appears to be considered sufficient for a poor mans family in which to cook and eat and sleep  when i asked for two rooms the sublettees looked at me very much in the manner i imagine that a certain personage looked at oliver twist when he asked for more  not only was one room deemed sufficient for a poor man and his family but i learned that many families occupying single rooms had so much space to spare as to be able to take in a lodger or two  when such rooms can be rented for from three to six shillings per week it is a fair conclusion that a lodger with references should obtain floor space for say from eightpence to a shilling  he may even be able to board with the sublettees for a few shillings more  this however i failed to inquire intoa reprehensible error on my part considering that i was working on the basis of a hypothetical family  not only did the houses i investigated have no bathtubs but i learned that there were no bathtubs in all the thousands of houses i had seen under the circumstances with my wife and babies and a couple of lodgers suffering from the too great spaciousness of one room taking a bath in a tin washbasin would be an unfeasible undertaking  but it seems the compensation comes in with the saving of soap so alls well and gods still in heaven  however i rented no rooms but returned to my own johnny uprights street  what with my wife and babies and lodgers and the various cubbyholes into which i had fitted them my minds eye had become narrow angled and i could not quite take in all of my own room at once  the immensity of it was aweinspiring  could this be the room i had rented for six shillings a week  impossible  but my landlady knocking at the door to learn if i were comfortable dispelled my doubts  oh yes sir she said in reply to a question  this street is the very last  all the other streets were like this eight or ten years ago and all the people were very respectable  but the others have driven our kind out  those in this street are the only ones left  its shocking sir  and then she explained the process of saturation by which the rental value of a neighbourhood went up while its tone went down  you see sir our kind are not used to crowding in the way the others do  we need more room  the others the foreigners and lowerclass people can get five and six families into this house where we only get one  so they can pay more rent for the house than we can afford  it is shocking sir and just to think only a few years ago all this neighbourhood was just as nice as it could be  i looked at her  here was a woman of the finest grade of the english workingclass with numerous evidences of refinement being slowly engulfed by that noisome and rotten tide of humanity which the powers that be are pouring eastward out of london town  bank factory hotel and office building must go up and the city poor folk are a nomadic breed so they migrate eastward wave upon wave saturating and degrading neighbourhood by neighbourhood driving the better class of workers before them to pioneer on the rim of the city or dragging them down if not in the first generation surely in the second and third  it is only a question of months when johnny uprights street must go  he realises it himself  in a couple of years he says my lease expires  my landlord is one of our kind  he has not put up the rent on any of his houses here and this has enabled us to stay  but any day he may sell or any day he may die which is the same thing so far as we are concerned  the house is bought by a money breeder who builds a sweat shop on the patch of ground at the rear where my grapevine is adds to the house and rents it a room to a family  there you are and johnny uprights gone  and truly i saw johnny upright and his good wife and fair daughters and frowzy slavey like so many ghosts flitting eastward through the gloom the monster city roaring at their heels  but johnny upright is not alone in his flitting  far far out on the fringe of the city live the small business men little managers and successful clerks  they dwell in cottages and semidetached villas with bits of flower garden and elbow room and breathing space  they inflate themselves with pride and throw out their chests when they contemplate the abyss from which they have escaped and they thank god that they are not as other men  and lo down upon them comes johnny upright and the monster city at his heels  tenements spring up like magic gardens are built upon villas are divided and subdivided into many dwellings and the black night of london settles down in a greasy pall     chapter iva man and the abyss   i say can you let a lodging  these words i discharged carelessly over my shoulder at a stout and elderly woman of whose fare i was partaking in a greasy coffeehouse down near the pool and not very far from limehouse  oh yus she answered shortly my appearance possibly not approximating the standard of affluence required by her house  i said no more consuming my rasher of bacon and pint of sickly tea in silence  nor did she take further interest in me till i came to pay my reckoning fourpence when i pulled all of ten shillings out of my pocket  the expected result was produced  yus sir she at once volunteered i ave nice lodgins youd likely tyke a fancy to  back from a voyage sir  how much for a room i inquired ignoring her curiosity  she looked me up and down with frank surprise  i dont let rooms not to my reglar lodgers much less casuals  then ill have to look along a bit i said with marked disappointment  but the sight of my ten shillings had made her keen  i can let you have a nice bed in with two hother men she urged  good respectable men an steady  but i dont want to sleep with two other men i objected  you dont ave to  theres three beds in the room an hits not a very small room  how much i demanded  arf a crown a week two an six to a regular lodger  youll fancy the men im sure  one works in the wareouse an es been with me two years now  an the hothers bin with me sixsix years sir an two months comin nex saturday  es a sceneshifter she went on  a steady respectable man never missin a nights work in the time es bin with me  an e likes the ouse e says as its the best e can do in the wy of lodgins  i board im an the hother lodgers too  i suppose hes saving money right along i insinuated innocently  bless you no  nor can e do as well helsewhere with is money  and i thought of my own spacious west with room under its sky and unlimited air for a thousand londons and here was this man a steady and reliable man never missing a nights work frugal and honest lodging in one room with two other men paying two dollars and a half per month for it and out of his experience adjudging it to be the best he could do and here was i on the strength of the ten shillings in my pocket able to enter in with my rags and take up my bed with him  the human soul is a lonely thing but it must be very lonely sometimes when there are three beds to a room and casuals with ten shillings are admitted  how long have you been here i asked  thirteen years sir an dont you think youll fancy the lodgin  the while she talked she was shuffling ponderously about the small kitchen in which she cooked the food for her lodgers who were also boarders  when i first entered she had been hard at work nor had she let up once throughout the conversation  undoubtedly she was a busy woman  up at halfpast five to bed the last thing at night workin fit ter drop thirteen years of it and for reward grey hairs frowzy clothes stooped shoulders slatternly figure unending toil in a foul and noisome coffeehouse that faced on an alley ten feet between the walls and a waterside environment that was ugly and sickening to say the least  youll be hin hagain to ave a look she questioned wistfully as i went out of the door  and as i turned and looked at her i realized to the full the deeper truth underlying that very wise old maxim virtue is its own reward  i went back to her  have you ever taken a vacation i asked  vycytion  a trip to the country for a couple of days fresh air a day off you know a rest  lor lumme she laughed for the first time stopping from her work  a vycytion eh for the likes o me  just fancy nowmind yer feetthis last sharply and to me as i stumbled over the rotten threshold  down near the west india dock i came upon a young fellow staring disconsolately at the muddy water  a firemans cap was pulled down across his eyes and the fit and sag of his clothes whispered unmistakably of the sea  hello mate i greeted him sparring for a beginning  can you tell me the way to wapping  worked yer way over on a cattle boat he countered fixing my nationality on the instant  and thereupon we entered upon a talk that extended itself to a public house and a couple of pints of arf an arf  this led to closer intimacy so that when i brought to light all of a shillings worth of coppers ostensibly my all and put aside sixpence for a bed and sixpence for more arf an arf he generously proposed that we drink up the whole shilling  my mate e cut up rough las night he explained  an the bobbies got m so you can bunk in wi me  wotcher say  i said yes and by the time we had soaked ourselves in a whole shillings worth of beer and slept the night on a miserable bed in a miserable den i knew him pretty fairly for what he was  and that in one respect he was representative of a large body of the lowerclass london workman my later experience substantiates  he was londonborn his father a fireman and a drinker before him  as a child his home was the streets and the docks  he had never learned to read and had never felt the need for ita vain and useless accomplishment he held at least for a man of his station in life  he had had a mother and numerous squalling brothers and sisters all crammed into a couple of rooms and living on poorer and less regular food than he could ordinarily rustle for himself  in fact he never went home except at periods when he was unfortunate in procuring his own food petty pilfering and begging along the streets and docks a trip or two to sea as messboy a few trips more as coaltrimmer and then a fullfledged fireman he had reached the top of his life  and in the course of this he had also hammered out a philosophy of life an ugly and repulsive philosophy but withal a very logical and sensible one from his point of view  when i asked him what he lived for he immediately answered booze  a voyage to sea for a man must live and get the wherewithal and then the paying off and the big drunk at the end  after that haphazard little drunks sponged in the pubs from mates with a few coppers left like myself and when sponging was played out another trip to sea and a repetition of the beastly cycle  but women i suggested when he had

to sea  so i say lets ave another pint  arf an arfs good enough for me  without going further with the speech of this young fellow of twoand twenty i think i have sufficiently indicated his philosophy of life and the underlying economic reason for it  home life he had never known  the word home aroused nothing but unpleasant associations  in the low wages of his father and of other men in the same walk in life he found sufficient reason for branding wife and children as encumbrances and causes of masculine misery  an unconscious hedonist utterly unmoral and materialistic he sought the greatest possible happiness for himself and found it in drink  a young sot a premature wreck physical inability to do a stokers work the gutter or the workhouse and the endhe saw it all as clearly as i but it held no terrors for him  from the moment of his birth all the forces of his environment had tended to harden him and he viewed his wretched inevitable future with a callousness and unconcern i could not shake  and yet he was not a bad man  he was not inherently vicious and brutal he had normal mentality and a more than average physique  his eyes were blue and round shaded by long lashes and wide apart  and there was a laugh in them and a fund of humour behind  the brow and general features were good the mouth and lips sweet though already developing a harsh twist  the chin was weak but not too weak i have seen men sitting in the high places with weaker  his head was shapely and so gracefully was it poised upon a perfect neck that i was not surprised by his body that night when he stripped for bed i have seen many men strip in gymnasium and training quarters men of good blood and upbringing but i have never seen one who stripped to better advantage than this young sot of twoandtwenty this young god doomed to rack and ruin in four or five short years and to pass hence without posterity to receive the splendid heritage it was his to bequeath  it seemed sacrilege to waste such life and yet i was forced to confess that he was right in not marrying on four pounds ten in london town  just as the sceneshifter was happier in making both ends meet in a room shared with two other men than he would have been had he packed a feeble family along with a couple of men into a cheaper room and failed in making both ends meet  and day by day i became convinced that not only is it unwise but it is criminal for the people of the abyss to marry  they are the stones by the builder rejected  there is no place for them in the social fabric while all the forces of society drive them downward till they perish  at the bottom of the abyss they are feeble besotted and imbecile  if they reproduce the life is so cheap that perforce it perishes of itself  the work of the world goes on above them and they do not care to take part in it nor are they able  moreover the work of the world does not need them  there are plenty far fitter than they clinging to the steep slope above and struggling frantically to slide no more  in short the london abyss is a vast shambles  year by year and decade after decade rural england pours in a flood of vigorous strong life that not only does not renew itself but perishes by the third generation  competent authorities aver that the london workman whose parents and grandparents were born in london is so remarkable a specimen that he is rarely found  mr a c pigou has said that the aged poor and the residuum which compose the submerged tenth constitute 71 per cent of the population of london  which is to say that last year and yesterday and today at this very moment 450000 of these creatures are dying miserably at the bottom of the social pit called london  as to how they die i shall take an instance from this mornings paper     selfneglect     yesterday dr wynn westcott held an inquest at shoreditch respecting    the death of elizabeth crews aged 77 years of 32 east street    holborn who died on wednesday last  alice mathieson stated that she    was landlady of the house where deceased lived  witness last saw her    alive on the previous monday  she lived quite alone  mr francis    birch relieving officer for the holborn district stated that    deceased had occupied the room in question for thirtyfive years  when    witness was called on the 1st he found the old woman in a terrible    state and the ambulance and coachman had to be disinfected after the    removal  dr chase fennell said death was due to bloodpoisoning from    bedsores due to selfneglect and filthy surroundings and the jury    returned a verdict to that effect  the most startling thing about this little incident of a womans death is the smug complacency with which the officials looked upon it and rendered judgment  that an old woman of seventyseven years of age should die of selfneglect is the most optimistic way possible of looking at it  it was the old dead womans fault that she died and having located the responsibility society goes contentedly on about its own affairs  of the submerged tenth mr pigou has said either through lack of bodily strength or of intelligence or of fibre or of all three they are inefficient or unwilling workers and consequently unable to support themselves    they are often so degraded in intellect as to be incapable of distinguishing their right from their left hand or of recognising the numbers of their own houses their bodies are feeble and without stamina their affections are warped and they scarcely know what family life means  four hundred and fifty thousand is a whole lot of people  the young fireman was only one and it took him some time to say his little say  i should not like to hear them all talk at once  i wonder if god hears them     chapter vthose on the edge   my first impression of east london was naturally a general one  later the details began to appear and here and there in the chaos of misery i found little spots where a fair measure of happiness reignedsometimes whole rows of houses in little outoftheway streets where artisans dwell and where a rude sort of family life obtains  in the evenings the men can be seen at the doors pipes in their mouths and children on their knees wives gossiping and laughter and fun going on  the content of these people is manifestly great for relative to the wretchedness that encompasses them they are well off  but at the best it is a dull animal happiness the content of the full belly  the dominant note of their lives is materialistic  they are stupid and heavy without imagination  the abyss seems to exude a stupefying atmosphere of torpor which wraps about them and deadens them religion passes them by  the unseen holds for them neither terror nor delight  they are unaware of the unseen and the full belly and the evening pipe with their regular arf an arf is all they demand or dream of demanding from existence  this would not be so bad if it were all but it is not all  the satisfied torpor in which they are sunk is the deadly inertia that precedes dissolution  there is no progress and with them not to progress is to fall back and into the abyss  in their own lives they may only start to fall leaving the fall to be completed by their children and their childrens children  man always gets less than he demands from life and so little do they demand that the less than little they get cannot save them  at the best city life is an unnatural life for the human but the city life of london is so utterly unnatural that the average workman or workwoman cannot stand it  mind and body are sapped by the undermining influences ceaselessly at work  moral and physical stamina are broken and the good workman fresh from the soil becomes in the first city generation a poor workman and by the second city generation devoid of push and go and initiative and actually unable physically to perform the labour his father did he is well on the way to the shambles at the bottom of the abyss  if nothing else the air he breathes and from which he never escapes is sufficient to weaken him mentally and physically so that he becomes unable to compete with the fresh virile life from the country hastening on to london town to destroy and be destroyed  leaving out the disease germs that fill the air of the east end consider but the one item of smoke  sir william thiseltondyer curator of kew gardens has been studying smoke deposits on vegetation and according to his calculations no less than six tons of solid matter consisting of soot and tarry hydrocarbons are deposited every week on every quarter of a square mile in and about london  this is equivalent to twentyfour tons per week to the square mile or 1248 tons per year to the square mile  from the cornice below the dome of st pauls cathedral was recently taken a solid deposit of crystallised sulphate of lime  this deposit had been formed by the action of the sulphuric acid in the atmosphere upon the carbonate of lime in the stone  and this sulphuric acid in the atmosphere is constantly being breathed by the london workmen through all the days and nights of their lives  it is incontrovertible that the children grow up into rotten adults without virility or stamina a weakkneed narrowchested listless breed that crumples up and goes down in the brute struggle for life with the invading hordes from the country  the railway men carriers omnibus drivers corn and timber porters and all those who require physical stamina are largely drawn from the country while in the metropolitan police there are roughly 12000 countryborn as against 3000 london born  so one is forced to conclude that the abyss is literally a huge mankilling machine and when i pass along the little outoftheway streets with the fullbellied artisans at the doors i am aware of a greater sorrow for them than for the 450000 lost and hopeless wretches dying at the bottom of the pit  they at least are dying that is the point while these have yet to go through the slow and preliminary pangs extending through two and even three generations  and yet the quality of the life is good  all human potentialities are in it  given proper conditions it could live through the centuries and great men heroes and masters spring from it and make the world better by having lived  i talked with a woman who was representative of that type which has been jerked out of its little outoftheway streets and has started on the fatal fall to the bottom  her husband was a fitter and a member of the engineers union  that he was a poor engineer was evidenced by his inability to get regular employment  he did not have the energy and enterprise necessary to obtain or hold a steady position  the pair had two daughters and the four of them lived in a couple of holes called rooms by courtesy for which they paid seven shillings per week  they possessed no stove managing their cooking on a single gasring in the fireplace  not being persons of property they were unable to obtain an unlimited supply of gas but a clever machine had been installed for their benefit  by dropping a penny in the slot the gas was forthcoming and when a pennys worth had forthcome the supply was automatically shut off  a penny gawn in no time she explained an the cookin not arf done  incipient starvation had been their portion for years  month in and month out they had arisen from the table able and willing to eat more and when once on the downward slope chronic innutrition is an important factor in sapping vitality and hastening the descent  yet this woman was a hard worker  from 430 in the morning till the last light at night she said she had toiled at making cloth dressskirts lined up and with two flounces for seven shillings a dozen  cloth dress skirts mark you lined up with two flounces for seven shillings a dozen  this is equal to 175 per dozen or 1475 cents per skirt  the husband in order to obtain employment had to belong to the union which collected one shilling and sixpence from him each week  also when strikes were afoot and he chanced to be working he had at times been compelled to pay as high as seventeen shillings into the unions coffers for the relief fund  one daughter the elder had worked as green hand for a dressmaker for one shilling and sixpence per week375 cents per week or a fraction over 5 cents per day  however when the slack season came she was discharged though she had been taken on at such low pay with the understanding that she was to learn the trade and work up  after that she had been employed in a bicycle store for three years for which she received five shillings per week walking two miles to her work and two back and being fined for tardiness  as far as the man and woman were concerned the game was played  they had lost handhold and foothold and were falling into the pit  but what of the daughters  living like swine enfeebled by chronic innutrition being sapped mentally morally and physically what chance have they to crawl up and out of the abyss into which they were born falling  as i write this and for an hour past the air has been made hideous by a freeforall roughandtumble fight going on in the yard that is back to back with my yard  when the first sounds reached me i took it for the barking and snarling of dogs and some minutes were required to convince me that human beings and women at that could produce such a fearful clamour  drunken women fighting  it is not nice to think of it is far worse to listen to  something like this it runs  incoherent babble shrieked at the top of the lungs of several women a lull in which is heard a child crying and a young girls voice pleading tearfully a womans voice rises harsh and grating you it me  jest you it me then swat challenge accepted and fight rages afresh  the back windows of the houses commanding the scene are lined with enthusiastic spectators and the sound of blows and of oaths that make ones blood run cold are borne to my ears  happily i cannot see the combatants  a lull you let that child alone child evidently of few years screaming in downright terror  awright repeated insistently and at top pitch twenty times straight running youll git this rock on the ead and then rock evidently on the head from the shriek that goes up  a lull apparently one combatant temporarily disabled and being resuscitated childs voice audible again but now sunk to a lower note of terror and growing exhaustion  voices begin to go up the scale something like this  yes  yes  yes  yes  yes  yes  yes  yes  sufficient affirmation on both sides conflict again precipitated  one combatant gets overwhelming advantage and follows it up from the way the other combatant screams bloody murder  bloody murder gurgles and dies out undoubtedly throttled by a strangle hold  entrance of new voices a flank attack strangle hold suddenly broken from the way bloody murder goes up half an octave higher than before general hullaballoo everybody fighting  lull new voice young girls im goin ter tyke my mothers part dialogue repeated about five times ill do as i like blankety blank blank  id like ter see yer blankety blank blank renewed conflict mothers daughters everybody during which my landlady calls her young daughter in from the back steps while i wonder what will be the effect of all that she has heard upon her moral fibre     chapter vifryingpan alley and a glimpse of inferno   three of us walked down mile end road and one was a hero  he was a slender lad of nineteen so slight and frail in fact that like fra lippo lippi a puff of wind might double him up and turn him over  he was a burning young socialist in the first throes of enthusiasm and ripe for martyrdom  as platform speaker or chairman he had taken an active and dangerous part in the many indoor and outdoor proboer meetings which have vexed the serenity of merry england these several years back  little items he had been imparting to me as he walked along of being mobbed in parks and on tramcars of climbing on the platform to lead the forlorn hope when brother speaker after brother speaker had been dragged down by the angry crowd and cruelly beaten of a siege in a church where he and three others had taken sanctuary and where amid flying missiles and the crashing of stained glass they had fought off the mob till rescued by platoons of constables of pitched and giddy battles on stairways galleries and balconies of smashed windows collapsed stairways wrecked lecture halls and broken heads and bonesand then with a regretful sigh he looked at me and said how i envy you big strong men  im such a little mite i cant do much when it comes to fighting  and i walking head and shoulders above my two companions remembered my own husky west and the stalwart men it had been my custom in turn to envy there  also as i looked at the mite of a youth with the heart of a lion i thought this is the type that on occasion rears barricades and shows the world that men have not forgotten how to die  but up spoke my other companion a man of twentyeight who eked out a precarious existence in a sweating den  im a earty man i am he announced  not like the other chaps at my shop i aint  they consider me a fine specimen of manhood  wy d ye know i weigh ten stone  i was ashamed to tell him that i weighed one hundred and seventy pounds or over twelve stone so i contented myself with taking his measure poor misshapen little man  his skin an unhealthy colour body gnarled and twisted out of all decency contracted chest shoulders bent prodigiously from long hours of toil and head hanging heavily forward and out of place  a earty man e was  how tall are you  five foot two he answered proudly an the chaps at the shop      let me see that shop i said  the shop was idle just then but i still desired to see it  passing leman street we cut off to the left into spitalfields and dived into fryingpan alley  a spawn of children cluttered the slimy pavement for all the world like tadpoles just turned frogs on the bottom of a dry pond  in a narrow doorway so narrow that perforce we stepped over her sat a woman with a young babe nursing at breasts grossly naked and libelling all the sacredness of motherhood  in the black and narrow hall behind her we waded through a mess of young life and essayed an even narrower and fouler stairway  up we went three flights each landing two feet by three in area and heaped with filth and refuse  there were seven rooms in this abomination called a house  in six of the rooms twentyodd people of both sexes and all ages cooked ate slept and worked  in size the rooms averaged eight feet by eight or possibly nine  the seventh room we entered  it was the den in which five men sweated  it was seven feet wide by eight long and the table at which the work was performed took up the major portion of the space  on this table were five lasts and there was barely room for the men to stand to their work for the rest of the space was heaped with cardboard leather bundles of shoe uppers and a miscellaneous assortment of materials used in attaching the uppers of shoes to their soles  in the adjoining room lived a woman and six children  in another vile hole lived a widow with an only son of sixteen who was dying of consumption  the woman hawked sweetmeats on the street i was told and more often failed than not to supply her son with the three quarts of milk he daily required  further this son weak and dying did not taste meat oftener than once a week and the kind and quality of this meat cannot possibly be imagined by people who have never watched human swine eat  the wy e coughs is somethin terrible volunteered my sweated friend referring to the dying boy  we ear im ere wile were workin an its terrible i say terrible  and what of the coughing and the sweetmeats i found another menace added to the hostile environment of the children of the slum  my sweated friend when work was to be had toiled with four other men in his eightbyseven room  in the winter a lamp burned nearly all the day and added its fumes to the overloaded air which was breathed and breathed and breathed again  in good times when there was a rush of work this man told me that he could earn as high as thirty bob a weekthirty shillings  seven dollars and a half  but its only the best of us can do it he qualified  an then we work twelve thirteen and fourteen hours a day just as fast as we can an you should see us sweat  just running from us  if you could see us itd dazzle your eyestacks flyin out of mouth like from a machine look at my mouth  i looked  the teeth were worn down by the constant friction of the metallic brads while they were coalblack and rotten  i clean my teeth he added else theyd be worse  after he had told me that the workers had to furnish their own tools brads grindery cardboard rent light and what not it was plain that his thirty bob was a diminishing quantity  but how long does the rush season last in which you receive this high wage of thirty bob i asked  four months was the answer and for the rest of the year he informed me they average from half a quid to a quid a week which is equivalent to from two dollars and a half to five dollars  the present week was half gone and he had earned four bob or one dollar  and yet i was given to understand that this was one of the better grades of sweating  i looked out of the window which should have commanded the back yards of the neighbouring buildings  but there were no back yards or rather they were covered with onestorey hovels cowsheds in which people lived  the roofs of these hovels were covered with deposits of filth in some places a couple of feet deepthe contributions from the back windows of the second and third storeys  i could make out fish and meat bones garbage pestilential rags old boots broken earthenware and all the general refuse of a human sty  this is the last year of this trade theyre getting machines to do away with us said the sweated one mournfully as we stepped over the woman with the breasts grossly naked and waded anew through the cheap young life  we next visited the municipal dwellings erected by the london county council on the site of the slums where lived arthur morrisons child of the jago  while the buildings housed more people than before it was much healthier  but the dwellings were inhabited by the betterclass workmen and artisans  the slum people had simply drifted on to crowd other slums or to form new slums  an now said the sweated one the earty man who worked so fast as to dazzle ones eyes ill show you one of londons lungs  this is spitalfields garden  and he mouthed the word garden with scorn  the shadow of christs church falls across spitalfields garden and in the shadow of christs church at three oclock in the afternoon i saw a sight i never wish to see again  there are no flowers in this garden which is smaller than my own rose garden at home  grass only grows here and it is surrounded by a sharpspiked iron fencing as are all the parks of london town so that homeless men and women may not come in at night and sleep upon it  as we entered the garden an old woman between fifty and sixty passed us striding with sturdy intention if somewhat rickety action with two bulky bundles covered with sacking slung fore and aft upon her  she was a woman tramp a houseless soul too independent to drag her failing carcass through the workhouse door  like the snail she carried her home with her  in the two sackingcovered bundles were her household goods her wardrobe linen and dear feminine possessions  we went up the narrow gravelled walk  on the benches on either side arrayed a mass of miserable and distorted humanity the sight of which would have impelled dore to more diabolical flights of fancy than he ever succeeded in achieving  it was a welter of rags and filth of all manner of loathsome skin diseases open sores bruises grossness indecency leering monstrosities and bestial faces  a chill raw wind was blowing and these creatures huddled there in their rags sleeping for the most part or trying to sleep  here were a dozen women ranging in age from twenty years to seventy  next a babe possibly of nine months lying asleep flat on the hard bench with neither pillow nor covering nor with any one looking after it  next halfadozen men sleeping bolt upright or leaning against one another in their sleep  in one place a family group a child asleep in its sleeping mothers arms and the husband or male mate clumsily mending a dilapidated shoe  on another bench a woman trimming the frayed strips of her rags with a knife and another woman with thread and needle sewing up rents  adjoining a man holding a sleeping woman in his arms  farther on a man his clothing caked with gutter mud asleep with head in the lap of a woman not more than twentyfive years old and also asleep  it was this sleeping that puzzled me  why were nine out of ten of them asleep or trying to sleep  but it was not till afterwards that i learned  it is a law of the powers that be that the homeless shall not sleep by night  on the pavement by the portico of christs church where the stone pillars rise toward the sky in a stately row were whole rows of men lying asleep or drowsing and all too deep sunk in torpor to rouse or be made curious by our intrusion  a lung of london i said nay an abscess a great putrescent sore  oh why did you bring me here demanded the burning young socialist his delicate face white with sickness of soul and stomach sickness  those women there said our guide will sell themselves for thrupence or tupence or a loaf of stale bread  he said it with a cheerful sneer  but what more he might have said i do not know for the sick man cried for heavens sake let us get out of this     chapter viia winner of the victoria cross   i have found that it is not easy to get into the casual ward of the workhouse  i have made two attempts now and i shall shortly make a third  the first time i started out at seven oclock in the evening with four shillings in my pocket  herein i committed two errors  in the first place the applicant for admission to the casual ward must be destitute and as he is subjected to a rigorous search he must really be destitute and fourpence much less four shillings is sufficient affluence to disqualify him  in the second place i made the mistake of tardiness  seven oclock in the evening is too late in the day for a pauper to get a paupers bed  for the benefit of gently nurtured and innocent folk let me explain what a ward is  it is a building where the homeless bedless penniless man if he be lucky may casually rest his weary bones and then work like a navvy next day to pay for it  my second attempt to break into the casual ward began more auspiciously i started in the middle of the afternoon accompanied by the burning young socialist and another friend and all i had in my pocket was thrupence  they piloted me to the whitechapel workhouse at which i peered from around a friendly corner  it was a few minutes past five in the afternoon but already a long and melancholy line was formed which strung out around the corner of the building and out of sight  it was a most woeful picture men and women waiting in the cold grey end of the day for a paupers shelter from the night and i confess it almost unnerved me  like the boy before the dentists door i suddenly discovered a multitude of reasons for being elsewhere  some hints of the struggle going on within must have shown in my face for one of my companions said dont funk you can do it  of course i could do it but i became aware that even thrupence in my pocket was too lordly a treasure for such a throng and in order that all invidious distinctions might be removed i emptied out the coppers then i bade goodbye to my friends and with my heart going pitapat slouched down the street and took my place at the end of the line  woeful it looked this line of poor folk tottering on the steep pitch to death how woeful it was i did not dream  next to me stood a short stout man  hale and hearty though aged strongfeatured with the tough and leathery skin produced by long years of sunbeat and weatherbeat his was the unmistakable sea face and eyes and at once there came to me a bit of kiplings galley slave     by the brand upon my shoulder by the gall of clinging steel    by the welt the whips have left me by the scars that never heal    by eyes grown old with staring through the sunwash on the brine    i am paid in full for service      how correct i was in my surmise and how peculiarly appropriate the verse was you shall learn  i wont stand it much longer i wont he was complaining to the man on the other side of him  ill smash a windy a big un an get run in for fourteen days  then ill have a good place to sleep never fear an better grub than you get here  though id miss my bit of baceythis as an afterthought and said regretfully and resignedly  ive been out two nights now he went on wet to the skin night before last an i cant stand it much longer  im gettin old an some mornin theyll pick me up dead  he whirled with fierce passion on me dont you ever let yourself grow old lad  die when youre young or youll come to this  im tellin you sure  seven an eighty years am i an served my country like a man three goodconduct stripes and the victoria cross an this is what i get for it  i wish i was dead i wish i was dead  cant come any too quick for me i tell you  the moisture rushed into his eyes but before the other man could comfort him he began to hum a lilting sea song as though there was no such thing as heartbreak in the world  given encouragement this is the story he told while waiting in line at the workhouse after two nights of exposure in the streets  as a boy he had enlisted in the british navy and for two score years and more served faithfully and well  names dates commanders ports ships engagements and battles rolled from his lips in a steady stream but it is beyond me to remember them all for it is not quite in keeping to take notes at the poorhouse door  he had been through the first war in china as he termed it had enlisted with the east india company and served ten years in india was back in india again in the english navy at the time of the mutiny had served in the burmese war and in the crimea and all this in addition to having fought and toiled for the english flag pretty well over the rest of the globe  then the thing happened  a little thing it could only be traced back to first causes perhaps the lieutenants breakfast had not agreed with him or he had been up late the night before or his debts were pressing or the commander had spoken brusquely to him  the point is that on this particular day the lieutenant was irritable  the sailor with others was setting up the fore rigging  now mark you the sailor had been over forty years in the navy had three goodconduct stripes and possessed the victoria cross for distinguished service in battle so he could not have been such an altogether bad sort of a sailorman  the lieutenant was irritable the lieutenant called him a namewell not a nice sort of name  it referred to his mother  when i was a boy it was our boys code to fight like little demons should such an insult be given our mothers and many men have died in my part of the world for calling other men this name  however the lieutenant called the sailor this name  at that moment it chanced the sailor had an iron lever or bar in his hands  he promptly struck the lieutenant over the head with it knocking him out of the rigging and overboard  and then in the mans own words i saw what i had done  i knew the regulations and i said to myself its all up with you jack my boy so here goes  an i jumped over after him my mind made up to drown us both  an id ha done it too only the pinnace from the flagship was just comin alongside  up we came to the top me a hold of him an punchin him  this was what settled for me  if i hadnt ben strikin him i could have claimed that seein what i had done i jumped over to save him  then came the courtmartial or whatever name a sea trial goes by  he recited his sentence word for word as though memorised and gone over in bitterness many times  and here it is for the sake of discipline and respect to officers not always gentlemen the punishment of a man who was guilty of manhood  to be reduced to the rank of ordinary seaman to be debarred all prizemoney due him to forfeit all rights to pension to resign the victoria cross to be discharged from the navy with a good character this being his first offence to receive fifty lashes and to serve two years in prison  i wish i had drowned that day i wish to god i had he concluded as the line moved up and we passed around the corner  at last the door came in sight through which the paupers were being admitted in bunches  and here i learned a surprising thing this being wednesday none of us would be released till friday morning furthermore and oh you tobacco users take heed we would not be permitted to take in any tobacco  this we would have to surrender as we entered  sometimes i was told it was returned on leaving and sometimes it was destroyed  the old manofwars man gave me a lesson  opening his pouch he emptied the tobacco a pitiful quantity into a piece of paper  this snugly and flatly wrapped went down his sock inside his shoe  down went my piece of tobacco inside my sock for forty hours without tobacco is a hardship all tobacco users will understand  again and again the line moved up and we were slowly but surely approaching the wicket  at the moment we happened to be standing on an iron grating and a man appearing underneath the old sailor called down to him  how many more do they want  twentyfour came the answer  we looked ahead anxiously and counted  thirtyfour were ahead of us disappointment and consternation dawned upon the faces about me  it is not a nice thing hungry and penniless to face a sleepless night in the streets  but we hoped against hope till when ten stood outside the wicket the porter turned us away  full up was what he said as he banged the door  like a flash for all his eightyseven years the old sailor was speeding away on the desperate chance of finding shelter elsewhere  i stood and debated with two other men wise in the knowledge of casual wards as to where we should go  they decided on the poplar workhouse three miles away and we started off  as we rounded the corner one of them said i could a got in ere to day  i come by at one oclock an the line was beginnin to form thenpets thats what they are  they let m in the same ones night upon night     chapter viiithe carter and the carpenter   the carter with his cleancut face chin beard and shaved upper lip i should have taken in the united states for anything from a master workman to a welltodo farmer  the carpenterwell i should have taken him for a carpenter  he looked it lean and wiry with shrewd observant eyes and hands that had grown twisted to the handles of tools through forty seven years work at the trade  the chief difficulty with these men was that they were old and that their children instead of growing up to take care of them had died  their years had told on them and they had been forced out of the whirl of industry by the younger and stronger competitors who had taken their places  these two men turned away from the casual ward of whitechapel workhouse were bound with me for poplar workhouse  not much of a show they thought but to chance it was all that remained to us  it was poplar or the streets and night  both men were anxious for a bed for they were about gone as they phrased it  the carter fiftyeight years of age had spent the last three nights without shelter or sleep while the carpenter sixtyfive years of age had been out five nights  but o dear soft people full of meat and blood with white beds and airy rooms waiting you each night how can i make you know what it is to suffer as you would suffer if you spent a weary night on londons streets  believe me you would think a thousand centuries had come and gone before the east paled into dawn you would shiver till you were ready to cry aloud with the pain of each aching muscle and you would marvel that you could endure so much and live  should you rest upon a bench and your tired eyes close depend upon it the policeman would rouse you and gruffly order you to move on  you may rest upon the bench and benches are few and far between but if rest means sleep on you must go dragging your tired body through the endless streets  should you in desperate slyness seek some forlorn alley or dark passageway and lie down the omnipresent policeman will rout you out just the same  it is his business to rout you out  it is a law of the powers that be that you shall be routed out  but when the dawn came the nightmare over you would hale you home to refresh yourself and until you died you would tell the story of your adventure to groups of admiring friends  it would grow into a mighty story  your little eighthour night would become an odyssey and you a homer  not so with these homeless ones who walked to poplar workhouse with me and there are thirtyfive thousand of them men and women in london town this night  please dont remember it as you go to bed if you are as soft as you ought to be you may not rest so well as usual  but for old men of sixty seventy and eighty illfed with neither meat nor blood to greet the dawn unrefreshed and to stagger through the day in mad search for crusts with relentless night rushing down upon them again and to do this five nights and dayso dear soft people full of meat and blood how can you ever understand  i walked up mile end road between the carter and the carpenter  mile end road is a wide thoroughfare cutting the heart of east london and there were tens of thousands of people abroad on it  i tell you this so that you may fully appreciate what i shall describe in the next paragraph  as i say we walked along and when they grew bitter and cursed the land i cursed with them cursed as an american waif would curse stranded in a strange and terrible land  and as i tried to lead them to believe and succeeded in making them believe they took me for a seafaring man who had spent his money in riotous living lost his clothes no unusual occurrence with seafaring men ashore and was temporarily broke while looking for a ship  this accounted for my ignorance of english ways in general and casual wards in particular and my curiosity concerning the same  the carter was hard put to keep the pace at which we walked he told me that he had eaten nothing that day but the carpenter lean and hungry his grey and ragged overcoat flapping mournfully in the breeze swung on in a long and tireless stride which reminded me strongly of the plains wolf or coyote  both kept their eyes upon the pavement as they walked and talked and every now and then one or the other would stoop and pick something up never missing the stride the while  i thought it was cigar and cigarette stumps they were collecting and for some time took no notice  then i did notice  from the slimy spittledrenched sidewalk they were picking up bits of orange peel apple skin and grape stems and they were eating them  the pits of greengage plums they cracked between their teeth for the kernels inside  they picked up stray bits of bread the size of peas apple cores so black and dirty one would not take them to be apple cores and these things these two men took into their mouths and chewed them and swallowed them and this between six and seven oclock in the evening of august 20 year of our lord 1902 in the heart of the greatest wealthiest and most powerful empire the world has ever seen  these two men talked  they were not fools they were merely old  and naturally their guts areek with pavement offal they talked of bloody revolution  they talked as anarchists fanatics and madmen would talk and who shall blame them  in spite of my three good meals that day and the snug bed i could occupy if i wished and my social philosophy and my evolutionary belief in the slow development and metamorphosis of thingsin spite of all this i say i felt impelled to talk rot with them or hold my tongue  poor fools  not of their sort are revolutions bred  and when they are dead and dust which will be shortly other fools will talk bloody revolution as they gather offal from the spittle drenched sidewalk along mile end road to poplar workhouse  being a foreigner and a young man the carter and the carpenter explained things to me and advised me  their advice by the way was brief and to the point it was to get out of the country  as fast as godll let me i assured them ill hit only the high places till you wont be able to see my trail for smoke  they felt the force of my figures rather than understood them and they nodded their heads approvingly  actually make a man a criminal against is will said the carpenter ere i am old younger men takin my place my clothes gettin shabbier an shabbier an makin it arder every day to get a job  i go to the casual ward for a bed  must be there by two or three in the afternoon or i wont get in  you saw what happened today  what chance does that give me to look for work  spose i do get into the casual ward  keep me in all day tomorrow let me out mornin o next day  what then  the law sez i cant get in another casual ward that night lessn ten miles distant  have to hurry an walk to be there in time that day  what chance does that give me to look for a job  spose i dont walk  spose i look for a job  in no time theres night come an no bed  no sleep all night nothin to eat what shape am i in the mornin to look for work  got to make up my sleep in the park somehow the vision of christs church spitalfield was strong on me an get something to eat  an there i am  old down an no chance to get up  used to be a tollgate ere said the carter  manys the time ive paid my toll ere in my cartin days  ive ad three apenny rolls in two days the carpenter announced after a long pause in the conversation  two of them i ate yesterday an the third today he concluded after another long pause  i aint ad anything today said the carter  an im fagged out  my legs is hurtin me something fearful  the roll you get in the spike is that ard you cant eat it nicely with lessn a pint of water said the carpenter for my benefit  and on asking him what the spike was he answered the casual ward  its a cant word you know  but what surprised me was that he should have the word cant in his vocabulary a vocabulary that i found was no mean one before we parted  i asked them what i might expect in the way of treatment if we succeeded in getting into the poplar workhouse and between them i was supplied with much information  having taken a cold bath on entering i would be given for supper six ounces of bread and three parts of skilly  three parts means threequarters of a pint and skilly is a fluid concoction of three quarts of oatmeal stirred into three buckets and a half of hot water  milk and sugar i suppose and a silver spoon i queried  no fear  salts what youll get an ive seen some places where youd not get any spoon  old er up an let er run down thats ow they do it  you do get good skilly at ackney said the carter  oh wonderful skilly that praised the carpenter and each looked eloquently at the other  flour an water at st georges in the east said the carter  the carpenter nodded  he had tried them all  then what i demanded  and i was informed that i was sent directly to bed  call you at half after five in the mornin an you get up an take a sluiceif theres any soap  then breakfast same as supper three parts o skilly an a sixounce loaf  tisnt always six ounces corrected the carter  tisnt no an often that sour you can ardly eat it  when first i started i couldnt eat the skilly nor the bread but now i can eat my own an another mans portion  i could eat three other mens portions said the carter  i avent ad a bit this blessed day  then what  then youve got to do your task pick four pounds of oakum or clean an scrub or break ten to eleven hundredweight o stones  i dont ave to break stones im past sixty you see  theyll make you do it though youre young an strong  what i dont like grumbled the carter is to be locked up in a cell to pick oakum  its too much like prison  but suppose after youve had your nights sleep you refuse to pick oakum or break stones or do any work at all i asked  no fear youll refuse the second time theyll run you in answered the carpenter  wouldnt advise you to try it on my lad  then comes dinner he went on  eight ounces of bread one and a arf ounces of cheese an cold water  then you finish your task an ave supper same as before three parts o skilly any six ounces o bread then to bed six oclock an next mornin youre turned loose provided youve finished your task  we had long since left mile end road and after traversing a gloomy maze of narrow winding streets we came to poplar workhouse  on a low stone wall we spread our handkerchiefs and each in his handkerchief put all his worldly possessions with the exception of the bit o baccy down his sock  and then as the last light was fading from the drabcoloured sky the wind blowing cheerless and cold we stood with our pitiful little bundles in our hands a forlorn group at the workhouse door  three working girls came along and one looked pityingly at me as she passed i followed her with my eyes and she still looked pityingly back at me  the old men she did not notice  dear christ she pitied me young and vigorous and strong but she had no pity for the two old men who stood by my side  she was a young woman and i was a young man and what vague sex promptings impelled her to pity me put her sentiment on the lowest plane  pity for old men is an altruistic feeling and besides the workhouse door is the accustomed place for old men  so she showed no pity for them only for me who deserved it least or not at all  not in honour do grey hairs go down to the grave in london town  on one side the door was a bell handle on the other side a press button  ring the bell said the carter to me  and just as i ordinarily would at anybodys door i pulled out the handle and rang a peal  oh  oh they cried in one terrified voice  not so ard  i let go and they looked reproachfully at me as though i had imperilled their chance for a bed and three parts of skilly  nobody came  luckily it was the wrong bell and i felt better  press the button i said to the carpenter  no no wait a bit the carter hurriedly interposed  from all of which i drew the conclusion that a poorhouse porter who commonly draws a yearly salary of from seven to nine pounds is a very finicky and important personage and cannot be treated too fastidiously bypaupers  so we waited ten times a decent interval when the carter stealthily advanced a timid forefinger to the button and gave it the faintest shortest possible push  i have looked at waiting men where life or death was in the issue but anxious suspense showed less plainly on their faces than it showed on the faces of these two men as they waited on the coming of the porter  he came  he barely looked at us  full up he said and shut the door  another night of it groaned the carpenter  in the dim light the carter looked wan and grey  indiscriminate charity is vicious say the professional philanthropists well i resolved to be vicious  come on get your knife out and come here i said to the carter drawing him into a dark alley  he glared at me in a frightened manner and tried to draw back  possibly he took me for a latterday jacktheripper with a penchant for elderly male paupers  or he may have thought i was inveigling him into the commission of some desperate crime  anyway he was frightened  it will be remembered at the outset that i sewed a pound inside my stokers singlet under the armpit  this was my emergency fund and i was now called upon to use it for the first time  not until i had gone through the acts of a contortionist and shown the round coin sewed in did i succeed in getting the carters help  even then his hand was trembling so that i was afraid he would cut me instead of the stitches and i was forced to take the knife away and do it myself  out rolled the gold piece a fortune in their hungry eyes and away we stampeded for the nearest coffeehouse  of course i had to explain to them that i was merely an investigator a social student seeking to find out how the other half lived  and at once they shut up like clams  i was not of their kind my speech had changed the tones of my voice were different in short i was a superior and they were superbly class conscious  what will you have i asked as the waiter came for the order  two slices an a cup of tea meekly said the carter  two slices an a cup of tea meekly said the carpenter  stop a moment and consider the situation  here were two men invited by me into the coffeehouse  they had seen my gold piece and they could understand that i was no pauper  one had eaten a hapenny roll that day the other had eaten nothing  and they called for two slices an a cup of tea  each man had given a tupenny order  two slices by the way means two slices of bread and butter  this was the same degraded humility that had characterised their attitude toward the poorhouse porter  but i wouldnt have it  step by step i increased their ordereggs rashers of bacon more eggs more bacon more tea more slices and so forththey denying wistfully all the while that they cared for anything more and devouring it ravenously as fast as it arrived  first cup o tea ive ad in a fortnight said the carter  wonderful tea that said the carpenter  they each drank two pints of it and i assure you that it was slops  it resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne  nay it was waterbewitched and did not resemble tea at all  it was curious after the first shock to notice the effect the food had on them  at first they were melancholy and talked of the divers times they had contemplated suicide  the carter not a week before had stood on the bridge and looked at the water and pondered the question  water the carpenter insisted with heat was a bad route  he for one he knew would struggle  a bullet was andier but how under the sun was he to get hold of a revolver  that was the rub  they grew more cheerful as the hot tea soaked in and talked more about themselves  the carter had buried his wife and children with the exception of one son who grew to manhood and helped him in his little business  then the thing happened  the son a man of thirtyone died of the smallpox  no sooner was this over than the father came down with fever and went to the hospital for three months  then he was done for he came out weak debilitated no strong young son to stand by him his little business gone glimmering and not a farthing  the thing had happened and the game was up  no chance for an old man to start again friends all poor and unable to help  he had tried for work when they were putting up the stands for the first coronation parade  an i got fair sick of the answer no no no  it rang in my ears at night when i tried to sleep always the same no no no  only the past week he had answered an advertisement in hackney and on giving his age was told oh too old too old by far  the carpenter had been born in the army where his father had served twentytwo years  likewise his two brothers had gone into the army one troop sergeantmajor of the seventh hussars dying in india after the mutiny the other after nine years under roberts in the east had been lost in egypt  the carpenter had not gone into the army so here he was still on the planet  but ere give me your and he said ripping open his ragged shirt im fit for the anatomist thats all  im wastin away sir actually wastin away for want of food  feel my ribs an youll see  i put my hand under his shirt and felt  the skin was stretched like parchment over the bones and the sensation produced was for all the world like running ones hand over a washboard  seven years o bliss i ad he said  a good missus and three bonnie lassies  but they all died  scarlet fever took the girls inside a fortnight  after this sir said the carter indicating the spread and desiring to turn the conversation into more cheerful channels after this i wouldnt be able to eat a workhouse breakfast in the morning  nor i agreed the carpenter and they fell to discussing belly delights and the fine dishes their respective wives had cooked in the old days  ive gone three days and never broke my fast said the carter  and i five his companion added turning gloomy with the memory of it five days once with nothing on my stomach but a bit of orange peel an outraged nature wouldnt stand it sir an i near died  sometimes walkin the streets at night ive ben that desperate ive made up my mind to win the horse or lose the saddle  you know what i mean sirto commit some big robbery  but when mornin come there was i too weak from unger an cold to arm a mouse  as their poor vitals warmed to the food they began to expand and wax boastful and to talk politics  i can only say that they talked politics as well as the average middleclass man and a great deal better than some of the middleclass men i have heard  what surprised me was the hold they had on the world its geography and peoples and on recent and contemporaneous history  as i say they were not fools these two men they were merely old and their children had undutifully failed to grow up and give them a place by the fire  one last incident as i bade them goodbye on the corner happy with a couple of shillings in their pockets and the certain prospect of a bed for the night  lighting a cigarette i was about to throw away the burning match when the carter reached for it  i proffered him the box but he said never mind wont waste it sir  and while he lighted the cigarette i had given him the carpenter hurried with the filling of his pipe in order to have a go at the same match  its wrong to waste said he  yes i said but i was thinking of the washboard ribs over which i had run my hand     chapter ixthe spike   first of all i must beg forgiveness of my body for the vileness through which i have dragged it and forgiveness of my stomach for the vileness which i have thrust into it  i have been to the spike and slept in the spike and eaten in the spike also i have run away from the spike  after my two unsuccessful attempts to penetrate the whitechapel casual ward i started early and joined the desolate line before three oclock in the afternoon  they did not let in till six but at that early hour i was number twenty while the news had gone forth that only twentytwo were to be admitted  by four oclock there were thirtyfour in line the last ten hanging on in the slender hope of getting in by some kind of a miracle  many more came looked at the line and went away wise to the bitter fact that the spike would be full up  conversation was slack at first standing there till the man on one side of me and the man on the other side of me discovered that they had been in the smallpox hospital at the same time though a full house of sixteen hundred patients had prevented their becoming acquainted  but they made up for it discussing and comparing the more loathsome features of their disease in the most coldblooded matteroffact way  i learned that the average mortality was one in six that one of them had been in three months and the other three months and a half and that they had been rotten wi it  whereat my flesh began to creep and crawl and i asked them how long they had been out  one had been out two weeks and the other three weeks  their faces were badly pitted though each assured the other that this was not so and further they showed me in their hands and under the nails the smallpox seeds still working out  nay one of them worked a seed out for my edification and pop it went right out of his flesh into the air  i tried to shrink up smaller inside my clothes and i registered a fervent though silent hope that it had not popped on me  in both instances i found that the smallpox was the cause of their being on the doss which means on the tramp  both had been working when smitten by the disease and both had emerged from the hospital broke with the gloomy task before them of hunting for work  so far they had not found any and they had come to the spike for a rest up after three days and nights on the street  it seems that not only the man who becomes old is punished for his involuntary misfortune but likewise the man who is struck by disease or accident  later on i talked with another manginger we called himwho stood at the head of the linea sure indication that he had been waiting since one oclock  a year before one day while in the employ of a fish dealer he was carrying a heavy box of fish which was too much for him  result something broke and there was the box on the ground and he on the ground beside it  at the first hospital whither he was immediately carried they said it was a rupture reduced the swelling gave him some vaseline to rub on it kept him four hours and told him to get along  but he was not on the streets more than two or three hours when he was down on his back again this time he went to another hospital and was patched up  but the point is the employer did nothing positively nothing for the man injured in his employment and even refused him a light job now and again when he came out  as far as ginger is concerned he is a broken man  his only chance to earn a living was by heavy work  he is now incapable of performing heavy work and from now until he dies the spike the peg and the streets are all he can look forward to in the way of food and shelter  the thing happenedthat is all  he put his back under too great a load of fish and his chance for happiness in life was crossed off the books  several men in the line had been to the united states and they were wishing that they had remained there and were cursing themselves for their folly in ever having left  england had become a prison to them a prison from which there was no hope of escape  it was impossible for them to get away  they could neither scrape together the passage money nor get a chance to work their passage  the country was too overrun by poor devils on that lay  i was on the seafaringmanwhohadlosthisclothesandmoney tack and they all condoled with me and gave me much sound advice  to sum it up the advice was something like this to keep out of all places like the spike  there was nothing good in it for me  to head for the coast and bend every effort to get away on a ship  to go to work if possible and scrape together a pound or so with which i might bribe some steward or underling to give me chance to work my passage  they envied me my youth and strength which would sooner or later get me out of the country these they no longer possessed  age and english hardship had broken them and for them the game was played and up  there was one however who was still young and who i am sure will in the end make it out  he had gone to the united states as a young fellow and in fourteen years residence the longest period he had been out of work was twelve hours  he had saved his money grown too prosperous and returned to the mothercountry  now he was standing in line at the spike  for the past two years he told me he had been working as a cook  his hours had been from 7 am to 1030 pm and on saturday to 1230 pmninetyfive hours per week for which he had received twenty shillings or five dollars  but the work and the long hours was killing me he said and i had to chuck the job  i had a little money saved but i spent it living and looking for another place  this was his first night in the spike and he had come in only to get rested  as soon as he emerged he intended to start for bristol a one hundredandtenmile walk where he thought he would eventually get a ship for the states  but the men in the line were not all of this calibre  some were poor wretched beasts inarticulate and callous but for all of that in many ways very human  i remember a carter evidently returning home after the days work stopping his cart before us so that his young hopeful who had run to meet him could climb in  but the cart was big the young hopeful little and he failed in his several attempts to swarm up whereupon one of the most degradedlooking men stepped out of the line and hoisted him in  now the virtue and the joy of this act lies in that it was service of love not hire  the carter was poor and the man knew it and the man was standing in the spike line and the carter knew it and the man had done the little act and the carter had thanked him even as you and i would have done and thanked  another beautiful touch was that displayed by the hopper and his ole woman  he had been in line about halfanhour when the ole woman his mate came up to him  she was fairly clad for her class with a weather worn bonnet on her grey head and a sackingcovered bundle in her arms  as she talked to him he reached forward caught the one stray wisp of the white hair that was flying wild deftly twirled it between his fingers and tucked it back properly behind her ear  from all of which one may conclude many things  he certainly liked her well enough to wish her to be neat and tidy  he was proud of her standing there in the spike line and it was his desire that she should look well in the eyes of the other unfortunates who stood in the spike line  but last and best and underlying all these motives it was a sturdy affection he bore her for man is not prone to bother his head over neatness and tidiness in a woman for whom he does not care nor is he likely to be proud of such a woman  and i found myself questioning why this man and his mate hard workers i knew from their talk should have to seek a pauper lodging  he had pride pride in his old woman and pride in himself  when i asked him what he thought i a greenhorn might expect to earn at hopping he sized me up and said that it all depended  plenty of people were too slow to pick hops and made a failure of it  a man to succeed must use his head and be quick with his fingers must be exceeding quick with his fingers  now he and his old woman could do very well at it working the one bin between them and not going to sleep over it but then they had been at it for years  i ad a mate as went down last year spoke up a man  it was is fust time but e come back wi two poun ten in is pockit an e was only gone a month  there you are said the hopper a wealth of admiration in his voice e was quick  e was jest natrally born to it e was  two pound tentwelve dollars and a halffor a months work when one is jest natrally born to it  and in addition sleeping out without blankets and living the lord knows how  there are moments when i am thankful that i was not jest natrally born a genius for anything not even hoppicking  in the matter of getting an outfit for the hops the hopper gave me some sterling advice to which same give heed you soft and tender people in case you should ever be stranded in london town  if you aint got tins an cookin things all as you can getll be bread and cheese  no bloomin good that  you must ave ot tea an wegetables an a bit o meat now an again if youre goin to do work as is work  cawnt do it on cold wittles  tell you wot you do lad  run around in the mornin an look in the dust pans  youll find plenty o tins to cook in  fine tins wonderful good some o them  me an the ole woman got ours that way  he pointed at the bundle she held while she nodded proudly beaming on me with goodnature and consciousness of success and prosperity  this overcoat is as good as a blanket he went on advancing the skirt of it that i might feel its thickness  an oo knows i may find a blanket before long  again the old woman nodded and beamed this time with the dead certainty that he would find a blanket before long  i call it a oliday oppin he concluded rapturously  a tidy way o gettin two or three pounds together an fixin up for winter  the only thing i dont likeand here was the rift within the luteis paddin the oof down there  it was plain the years were telling on this energetic pair and while they enjoyed the quick work with the fingers paddin the oof which is walking was beginning to bear heavily upon them  and i looked at their grey hairs and ahead into the future ten years and wondered how it would be with them  i noticed another man and his old woman join the line both of them past fifty  the woman because she was a woman was admitted into the spike but he was too late and separated from his mate was turned away to tramp the streets all night  the street on which we stood from wall to wall was barely twenty feet wide  the sidewalks were three feet wide  it was a residence street  at least workmen and their families existed in some sort of fashion in the houses across from us  and each day and every day from one in the afternoon till six our ragged spike line is the principal feature of the view commanded by their front doors and windows  one workman sat in his door directly opposite us taking his rest and a breath of air after the toil of the day  his wife came to chat with him  the doorway was too small for two so she stood up  their babes sprawled before them  and here was the spike line less than a score of feet awayneither privacy for the workman nor privacy for the pauper  about our feet played the children of the neighbourhood  to them our presence was nothing unusual we were not an intrusion  we were as natural and ordinary as the brick walls and stone curbs of their environment  they had been born to the sight of the spike line and all their brief days they had seen it  at six oclock the line moved up and we were admitted in groups of three  name age occupation place of birth condition of destitution and the previous nights doss were taken with lightninglike rapidity by the superintendent and as i turned i was startled by a mans thrusting into my hand something that felt like a brick and shouting into my ear any knives matches or tobacco  no sir i lied as lied every man who entered  as i passed downstairs to the cellar i looked at the brick in my hand and saw that by doing violence to the language it might be called bread  by its weight and hardness it certainly must have been unleavened  the light was very dim down in the cellar and before i knew it some other man had thrust a pannikin into my other hand  then i stumbled on to a still darker room where were benches and tables and men  the place smelled vilely and the sombre gloom and the mumble of voices from out of the obscurity made it seem more like some anteroom to the infernal regions  most of the men were suffering from tired feet and they prefaced the meal by removing their shoes and unbinding the filthy rags with which their feet were wrapped  this added to the general noisomeness while it took away from my appetite  in fact i found that i had made a mistake  i had eaten a hearty dinner five hours before and to have done justice to the fare before me i should have fasted for a couple of days  the pannikin contained skilly threequarters of a pint a mixture of indian corn and hot water  the men were dipping their bread into heaps of salt scattered over the dirty tables  i attempted the same but the bread seemed to stick in my mouth and i remembered the words of the carpenter you need a pint of water to eat the bread nicely  i went over into a dark corner where i had observed other men going and found the water  then i returned and attacked the skilly  it was coarse of texture unseasoned gross and bitter  this bitterness which lingered persistently in the mouth after the skilly had passed on i found especially repulsive  i struggled manfully but was mastered by my qualms and halfadozen mouthfuls of skilly and bread was the measure of my success  the man beside me ate his own share and mine to boot scraped the pannikins and looked hungrily for more  i met a towny and he stood me too good a dinner i explained  an i avent ad a bite since yesterday mornin he replied  how about tobacco i asked  will the bloke bother with a fellow now  oh no he answered me  no bloomin fear  this is the easiest spike goin  youghto see some of them  search you to the skin  the pannikins scraped clean conversation began to spring up  this supertendent ere is always writin to the papers bout us mugs said the man on the other side of me  what does he say i asked  oh e sez were no good a lot o blackguards an scoundrels as wont work  tells all the ole tricks ive bin earin for twenty years an wich i never seen a mug ever do  las thing of is i see e was tellin ow a mug gets out o the spike wi a crust in is pockit  an wen e sees a nice ole gentleman comin along the street e chucks the crust into the drain an borrows the old gents stick to poke it out an then the ole gent gies im a tanner  a roar of applause greeted the timehonoured yarn and from somewhere over in the deeper darkness came another voice orating angrily  talk o the country bein good for tommy food id like to see it  i jest came up from dover an blessed little tommy i got  they wont gi ye a drink o water they wont much less tommy  theres mugs never go out of kent spoke a second voice they live bloomin fat all along  i come through kent went on the first voice still more angrily an gawd blimey if i see any tommy  an i always notices as the blokes as talks about ow much they can get wen theyre in the spike can eat my share o skilly as well as their bleedin own  theres chaps in london said a man across the table from me that get all the tommy they want an they never think o goin to the country stay in london the year round  nor do they think of lookin for a kip place to sleep till nine or ten oclock at night  a general chorus verified this statement  but theyre bloomin clever them chaps said an admiring voice  course they are said another voice  but its not the likes of me an you can do it  you got to be born to it i say  them chaps ave ben openin cabs an sellin papers since the day they was born an their fathers an mothers before em  its all in the trainin i say an the likes of me an you ud starve at it  this also was verified by the general chorus and likewise the statement that there were mugs as lives the twelvemonth round in the spike an never get a blessed bit o tommy other than spike skilly an bread  i once got arf a crown in the stratford spike said a new voice silence fell on the instant and all listened to the wonderful tale there was three of us breakin stones  wintertime an the cold was cruel  tother two said theyd be blessed if they do it an they didnt but i kept wearin into mine to warm up you know  an then the guardians come an tother chaps got run in for fourteen days an the guardians wen they see wot id been doin gives me a tanner each five o them an turns me up  the majority of these men nay all of them i found do not like the spike and only come to it when driven in  after the rest up they are good for two or three days and nights on the streets when they are driven in again for another rest  of course this continuous hardship quickly breaks their constitutions and they realise it though only in a vague way while it is so much the common run of things that they do not worry about it  on the doss they call vagabondage here which corresponds to on the road in the united states  the agreement is that kipping or dossing or sleeping is the hardest problem they have to face harder even than that of food  the inclement weather and the harsh laws are mainly responsible for this while the men themselves ascribe their homelessness to foreign immigration especially of polish and russian jews who take their places at lower wages and establish the sweating system  by seven oclock we were called away to bathe and go to bed  we stripped our clothes wrapping them up in our coats and buckling our belts about them and deposited them in a heaped rack and on the floora beautiful scheme for the spread of vermin  then two by two we entered the bathroom  there were two ordinary tubs and this i know the two men preceding had washed in that water we washed in the same water and it was not changed for the two men that followed us  this i know but i am also certain that the twentytwo of us washed in the same water  i did no more than make a show of splashing some of this dubious liquid at myself while i hastily brushed it off with a towel wet from the bodies of other men  my equanimity was not restored by seeing the back of one poor wretch a mass of blood from attacks of vermin and retaliatory scratching  a shirt was handed mewhich i could not help but wonder how many other men had worn and with a couple of blankets under my arm i trudged off to the sleeping apartment  this was a long narrow room traversed by two low iron rails  between these rails were stretched not hammocks but pieces of canvas six feet long and less than two feet wide  these were the beds and they were six inches apart and about eight inches above the floor  the chief difficulty was that the head was somewhat higher than the feet which caused the body constantly to slip down  being slung to the same rails when one man moved no matter how slightly the rest were set rocking and whenever i dozed somebody was sure to struggle back to the position from which he had slipped and arouse me again  many hours passed before i won to sleep  it was only seven in the evening and the voices of children in shrill outcry playing in the street continued till nearly midnight  the smell was frightful and sickening while my imagination broke loose and my skin crept and crawled till i was nearly frantic  grunting groaning and snoring arose like the sounds emitted by some sea monster and several times afflicted by nightmare one or another by his shrieks and yells aroused the lot of us  toward morning i was awakened by a rat or some similar animal on my breast  in the quick transition from sleep to waking before i was completely myself i raised a shout to wake the dead  at any rate i woke the living and they cursed me roundly for my lack of manners  but morning came with a six oclock breakfast of bread and skilly which i gave away and we were told off to our various tasks  some were set to scrubbing and cleaning others to picking oakum and eight of us were convoyed across the street to the whitechapel infirmary where we were set at scavenger work  this was the method by which we paid for our skilly and canvas and i for one know that i paid in full many times over  though we had most revolting tasks to perform our allotment was considered the best and the other men deemed themselves lucky in being chosen to perform it  dont touch it mate the nurse sez its deadly warned my working partner as i held open a sack into which he was emptying a garbage can  it came from the sick wards and i told him that i purposed neither to touch it nor to allow it to touch me  nevertheless i had to carry the sack and other sacks down five flights of stairs and empty them in a receptacle where the corruption was speedily sprinkled with strong disinfectant  perhaps there is a wise mercy in all this  these men of the spike the peg and the street are encumbrances  they are of no good or use to any one nor to themselves  they clutter the earth with their presence and are better out of the way  broken by hardship ill fed and worse nourished they are always the first to be struck down by disease as they are likewise the quickest to die  they feel themselves that the forces of society tend to hurl them out of existence  we were sprinkling disinfectant by the mortuary when the dead waggon drove up and five bodies were packed into it  the conversation turned to the white potion and black jack and i found they were all agreed that the poor person man or woman who in the infirmary gave too much trouble or was in a bad way was polished off that is to say the incurables and the obstreperous were given a dose of black jack or the white potion and sent over the divide  it does not matter in the least whether this be actually so or not  the point is they have the feeling that it is so and they have created the language with which to express that feelingblack jack white potion polishing off  at eight oclock we went down into a cellar under the infirmary where tea was brought to us and the hospital scraps  these were heaped high on a huge platter in an indescribable messpieces of bread chunks of grease and fat pork the burnt skin from the outside of roasted joints bones in short all the leavings from the fingers and mouths of the sick ones suffering from all manner of diseases  into this mess the men plunged their hands digging pawing turning over examining rejecting and scrambling for  it wasnt pretty  pigs couldnt have done worse but the poor devils were hungry and they ate ravenously of the swill and when they could eat no more they bundled what was left into their handkerchiefs and thrust it inside their shirts  once wen i was ere before wot did i find out there but a ole lot of porkribs said ginger to me  by out there he meant the place where the corruption was dumped and sprinkled with strong disinfectant  they was a prime lot no end o meat on em an i ad em into my arms an was out the gate an down the street alookin for some un to gi em to  couldnt see a soul an i was runnin round clean crazy the bloke runnin after me an thinkin i was slingin my ook running away but jest before e got me i got a ole woman an poked em into er apron  o charity o philanthropy descend to the spike and take a lesson from ginger  at the bottom of the abyss he performed as purely an altruistic act as was ever performed outside the abyss  it was fine of ginger and if the old woman caught some contagion from the no end o meat on the porkribs it was still fine though not so fine  but the most salient thing in this incident it seems to me is poor ginger clean crazy at sight of so much food going to waste  it is the rule of the casual ward that a man who enters must stay two nights and a day but i had seen sufficient for my purpose had paid for my skilly and canvas and was preparing to run for it  come on lets sling it i said to one of my mates pointing toward the open gate through which the dead waggon had come  an get fourteen days  no get away  aw i come ere for a rest he said complacently  an another nights kip wont urt me none  they were all of this opinion so i was forced to sling it alone  you cawnt ever come back ere again for a doss they warned me  no fear said i with an enthusiasm they could not comprehend and dodging out the gate i sped down the street  straight to my room i hurried changed my clothes and less than an hour from my escape in a turkish bath i was sweating out whatever germs and other things had penetrated my epidermis and wishing that i could stand a temperature of three hundred and twenty rather than two hundred and twenty     chapter xcarrying the banner   to carry the banner means to walk the streets all night and i with the figurative emblem hoisted went out to see what i could see  men and women walk the streets at night all over this great city but i selected the west end making leicester square my base and scouting about from the thames embankment to hyde park  the rain was falling heavily when the theatres let out and the brilliant throng which poured from the places of amusement was hard put to find cabs  the streets were so many wild rivers of cabs most of which were engaged however and here i saw the desperate attempts of ragged men and boys to get a shelter from the night by procuring cabs for the cabless ladies and gentlemen  i use the word desperate advisedly for these wretched homeless ones were gambling a soaking against a bed and most of them i took notice got the soaking and missed the bed  now to go through a stormy night with wet clothes and in addition to be ill nourished and not to have tasted meat for a week or a month is about as severe a hardship as a man can undergo  well fed and well clad i have travelled all day with the spirit thermometer down to seventyfour degrees below zeroone hundred and six degrees of frost 1 and though i suffered it was a mere nothing compared with carrying the banner for a night ill fed ill clad and soaking wet  the streets grew very quiet and lonely after the theatre crowd had gone home  only were to be seen the ubiquitous policemen flashing their dark lanterns into doorways and alleys and men and women and boys taking shelter in the lee of buildings from the wind and rain  piccadilly however was not quite so deserted  its pavements were brightened by welldressed women without escort and there was more life and action there than elsewhere due to the process of finding escort  but by three oclock the last of them had vanished and it was then indeed lonely  at halfpast one the steady downpour ceased and only showers fell thereafter  the homeless folk came away from the protection of the buildings and slouched up and down and everywhere in order to rush up the circulation and keep warm  one old woman between fifty and sixty a sheer wreck i had noticed earlier in the night standing in piccadilly not far from leicester square  she seemed to have neither the sense nor the strength to get out of the rain or keep walking but stood stupidly whenever she got the chance meditating on past days i imagine when life was young and blood was warm  but she did not get the chance often  she was moved on by every policeman and it required an average of six moves to send her doddering off one mans beat and on to anothers  by three oclock she had progressed as far as st james street and as the clocks were striking four i saw her sleeping soundly against the iron railings of green park  a brisk shower was falling at the time and she must have been drenched to the skin  now said i at one oclock to myself consider that you are a poor young man penniless in london town and that tomorrow you must look for work  it is necessary therefore that you get some sleep in order that you may have strength to look for work and to do work in case you find it  so i sat down on the stone steps of a building  five minutes later a policeman was looking at me  my eyes were wide open so he only grunted and passed on  ten minutes later my head was on my knees i was dozing and the same policeman was saying gruffly ere you get outa that  i got  and like the old woman i continued to get for every time i dozed a policeman was there to rout me along again  not long after when i had given this up i was walking with a young londoner who had been out to the colonies and wished he were out to them again when i noticed an open passage leading under a building and disappearing in darkness  a low iron gate barred the entrance  come on i said  lets climb over and get a good sleep  wot he answered recoiling from me  an get run in fer three months blimey if i do  later on i was passing hyde park with a young boy of fourteen or fifteen a most wretchedlooking youth gaunt and holloweyed and sick  lets go over the fence i proposed and crawl into the shrubbery for a sleep  the bobbies couldnt find us there  no fear he answered  theres the park guardians and theyd run you in for six months  times have changed alas  when i was a youngster i used to read of homeless boys sleeping in doorways  already the thing has become a tradition  as a stock situation it will doubtless linger in literature for a century to come but as a cold fact it has ceased to be  here are the doorways and here are the boys but happy conjunctions are no longer effected  the doorways remain empty and the boys keep awake and carry the banner  i was down under the arches grumbled another young fellow  by arches he meant the shore arches where begin the bridges that span the thames  i was down under the arches wen it was ryning its ardest an a bobby comes in an chyses me out  but i come back an e come too ere sez e wot you doin ere  an out i goes but i sez think i want ter pinch steal the bleedin bridge  among those who carry the banner green park has the reputation of opening its gates earlier than the other parks and at quarterpast four in the morning i and many more entered green park  it was raining again but they were worn out with the nights walking and they were down on the benches and asleep at once  many of the men stretched out full length on the dripping wet grass and with the rain falling steadily upon them were sleeping the sleep of exhaustion  and now i wish to criticise the powers that be  they are the powers therefore they may decree whatever they please so i make bold only to criticise the ridiculousness of their decrees  all night long they make the homeless ones walk up and down  they drive them out of doors and passages and lock them out of the parks  the evident intention of all this is to deprive them of sleep  well and good the powers have the power to deprive them of sleep or of anything else for that matter but why under the sun do they open the gates of the parks at five oclock in the morning and let the homeless ones go inside and sleep  if it is their intention to deprive them of sleep why do they let them sleep after five in the morning  and if it is not their intention to deprive them of sleep why dont they let them sleep earlier in the night  in this connection i will say that i came by green park that same day at one in the afternoon and that i counted scores of the ragged wretches asleep in the grass  it was sunday afternoon the sun was fitfully appearing and the welldressed west enders with their wives and progeny were out by thousands taking the air  it was not a pleasant sight for them those horrible unkempt sleeping vagabonds while the vagabonds themselves i know would rather have done their sleeping the night before  and so dear soft people should you ever visit london town and see these men asleep on the benches and in the grass please do not think they are lazy creatures preferring sleep to work  know that the powers that be have kept them walking all the night long and that in the day they have nowhere else to sleep     chapter xithe peg   but after carrying the banner all night i did not sleep in green park when morning dawned  i was wet to the skin it is true and i had had no sleep for twentyfour hours but still adventuring as a penniless man looking for work i had to look about me first for a breakfast and next for the work  during the night i had heard of a place over on the surrey side of the thames where the salvation army every sunday morning gave away a breakfast to the unwashed  and by the way the men who carry the banner are unwashed in the morning and unless it is raining they do not have much show for a wash either  this thought i is the very thingbreakfast in the morning and then the whole day in which to look for work  it was a weary walk  down st james street i dragged my tired legs along pall mall past trafalgar square to the strand  i crossed the waterloo bridge to the surrey side cut across to blackfriars road coming out near the surrey theatre and arrived at the salvation army barracks before seven oclock  this was the peg  and by the peg in the argot is meant the place where a free meal may be obtained  here was a motley crowd of woebegone wretches who had spent the night in the rain  such prodigious misery and so much of it  old men young men all manner of men and boys to boot and all manner of boys  some were drowsing standing up half a score of them were stretched out on the stone steps in most painful postures all of them sound asleep the skin of their bodies showing red through the holes and rents in their rags and up and down the street and across the street for a block either way each doorstep had from two to three occupants all asleep their heads bent forward on their knees  and it must be remembered these are not hard times in england  things are going on very much as they ordinarily do and times are neither hard nor easy  and then came the policeman  get outa that you bloomin swine  eigh eigh  get out now  and like swine he drove them from the doorways and scattered them to the four winds of surrey  but when he encountered the crowd asleep on the steps he was astounded  shocking he exclaimed shocking  and of a sunday morning  a pretty sight  eigh eigh  get outa that you bleeding nuisances  of course it was a shocking sight i was shocked myself  and i should not care to have my own daughter pollute her eyes with such a sight or come within half a mile of it butand there we were and there you are and but is all that can be said  the policeman passed on and back we clustered like flies around a honey jar  for was there not that wonderful thing a breakfast awaiting us we could not have clustered more persistently and desperately had they been giving away milliondollar banknotes  some were already off to sleep when back came the policeman and away we scattered only to return again as soon as the coast was clear  at halfpast seven a little door opened and a salvation army soldier stuck out his head  aynt no sense blockin the wy up that wy he said  those as as tickets cawn come hin now an those as asnt cawnt come hin till nine  oh that breakfast  nine oclock  an hour and a half longer  the men who held tickets were greatly envied  they were permitted to go inside have a wash and sit down and rest until breakfast while we waited for the same breakfast on the street  the tickets had been distributed the previous night on the streets and along the embankment and the possession of them was not a matter of merit but of chance  at eightthirty more men with tickets were admitted and by nine the little gate was opened to us  we crushed through somehow and found ourselves packed in a courtyard like sardines  on more occasions than one as a yankee tramp in yankeeland i have had to work for my breakfast but for no breakfast did i ever work so hard as for this one for over two hours i had waited outside and for over another hour i waited in this packed courtyard  i had had nothing to eat all night and i was weak and faint while the smell of the soiled clothes and unwashed bodies steaming from pent animal heat and blocked solidly about me nearly turned my stomach  so tightly were we packed that a number of the men took advantage of the opportunity and went soundly asleep standing up  now about the salvation army in general i know nothing and whatever criticism i shall make here is of that particular portion of the salvation army which does business on blackfriars road near the surrey theatre  in the first place this forcing of men who have been up all night to stand on their feet for hours longer is as cruel as it is needless  we were weak famished and exhausted from our nights hardship and lack of sleep and yet there we stood and stood and stood without rhyme or reason  sailors were very plentiful in this crowd  it seemed to me that one man in four was looking for a ship and i found at least a dozen of them to be american sailors  in accounting for their being on the beach i received the same story from each and all and from my knowledge of sea affairs this story rang true  english ships sign their sailors for the voyage which means the round trip sometimes lasting as long as three years and they cannot sign off and receive their discharges until they reach the home port which is england  their wages are low their food is bad and their treatment worse  very often they are really forced by their captains to desert in the new world or the colonies leaving a handsome sum of wages behind thema distinct gain either to the captain or the owners or to both  but whether for this reason alone or not it is a fact that large numbers of them desert  then for the home voyage the ship engages whatever sailors it can find on the beach  these men are engaged at the somewhat higher wages that obtain in other portions of the world under the agreement that they shall sign off on reaching england  the reason for this is obvious for it would be poor business policy to sign them for any longer time since seamens wages are low in england and england is always crowded with sailormen on the beach  so this fully accounted for the american seamen at the salvation army barracks  to get off the beach in other outlandish places they had come to england and gone on the beach in the most outlandish place of all  there were fully a score of americans in the crowd the nonsailors being tramps royal the men whose mate is the wind that tramps the world they were all cheerful facing things with the pluck which is their chief characteristic and which seems never to desert them withal they were cursing the country with lurid metaphors quite refreshing after a month of unimaginative monotonous cockney swearing  the cockney has one oath and one oath only the most indecent in the language which he uses on any and every occasion  far different is the luminous and varied western swearing which runs to blasphemy rather than indecency  and after all since men will swear i think i prefer blasphemy to indecency there is an audacity about it an adventurousness and defiance that is better than sheer filthiness  there was one american tramp royal whom i found particularly enjoyable  i first noticed him on the street asleep in a doorway his head on his knees but a hat on his head that one does not meet this side of the western ocean  when the policeman routed him out he got up slowly and deliberately looked at the policeman yawned and stretched himself looked at the policeman again as much as to say he didnt know whether he would or wouldnt and then sauntered leisurely down the sidewalk  at the outset i was sure of the hat but this made me sure of the wearer of the hat  in the jam inside i found myself alongside of him and we had quite a chat  he had been through spain italy switzerland and france and had accomplished the practically impossible feat of beating his way three hundred miles on a french railway without being caught at the finish where was i hanging out he asked  and how did i manage for kippingwhich means sleeping  did i know the rounds yet  he was getting on though the country was horstyl and the cities were bum fierce wasnt it  couldnt batter beg anywhere without being pinched  but he wasnt going to quit it  buffalo bills show was coming over soon and a man who could drive eight horses was sure of a job any time  these mugs over here didnt know beans about driving anything more than a span  what was the matter with me hanging on and waiting for buffalo bill  he was sure i could ring in somehow  and so after all blood is thicker than water  we were fellowcountrymen and strangers in a strange land  i had warmed to his battered old hat at sight of it and he was as solicitous for my welfare as if we were blood brothers  we swapped all manner of useful information concerning the country and the ways of its people methods by which to obtain food and shelter and what not and we parted genuinely sorry at having to say goodbye  one thing particularly conspicuous in this crowd was the shortness of stature  i who am but of medium height looked over the heads of nine out of ten  the natives were all short as were the foreign sailors there were only five or six in the crowd who could be called fairly tall and they were scandinavians and americans  the tallest man there however was an exception  he was an englishman though not a londoner candidate for the life guards i remarked to him  youve hit it mate was his reply ive served my bit in that same and the way things are ill be back at it before long  for an hour we stood quietly in this packed courtyard  then the men began to grow restless  there was pushing and shoving forward and a mild hubbub of voices  nothing rough however nor violent merely the restlessness of weary and hungry men  at this juncture forth came the adjutant  i did not like him  his eyes were not good  there was nothing of the lowly galilean about him but a great deal of the centurion who said for i am a man in authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it  well he looked at us in just that way and those nearest to him quailed then he lifted his voice  stop this ere now or ill turn you the other wy an march you out an youll get no breakfast  i cannot convey by printed speech the insufferable way in which he said this  he seemed to me to revel in that he was a man in authority able to say to half a thousand ragged wretches you may eat or go hungry as i elect  to deny us our breakfast after standing for hours  it was an awful threat and the pitiful abject silence which instantly fell attested its awfulness  and it was a cowardly threat  we could not strike back for we were starving and it is the way of the world that when one man feeds another he is that mans master  but the centurioni mean the adjutantwas not satisfied  in the dead silence he raised his voice again and repeated the threat and amplified it  at last we were permitted to enter the feasting hall where we found the ticket men washed but unfed  all told there must have been nearly seven hundred of us who sat downnot to meat or bread but to speech song and prayer  from all of which i am convinced that tantalus suffers in many guises this side of the infernal regions  the adjutant made the prayer but i did not take note of it being too engrossed with the massed picture of misery before me  but the speech ran something like this you will feast in paradise  no matter how you starve and suffer here you will feast in paradise that is if you will follow the directions  and so forth and so forth  a clever bit of propaganda i took it but rendered of no avail for two reasons  first the men who received it were unimaginative and materialistic unaware of the existence of any unseen and too inured to hell on earth to be frightened by hell to come  and second weary and exhausted from the nights sleeplessness and hardship suffering from the long wait upon their feet and faint from hunger they were yearning not for salvation but for grub  the soulsnatchers as these men call all religious propagandists should study the physiological basis of psychology a little if they wish to make their efforts more effective  all in good time about eleven oclock breakfast arrived  it arrived not on plates but in paper parcels  i did not have all i wanted and i am sure that no man there had all he wanted or half of what he wanted or needed  i gave part of my bread to the tramp royal who was waiting for buffalo bill and he was as ravenous at the end as he was in the beginning  this is the breakfast two slices of bread one small piece of bread with raisins in it and called cake a wafer of cheese and a mug of water bewitched  numbers of the men had been waiting since five oclock for it while all of us had waited at least four hours and in addition we had been herded like swine packed like sardines and treated like curs and been preached at and sung to and prayed for  nor was that all  no sooner was breakfast over and it was over almost as quickly as it takes to tell than the tired heads began to nod and droop and in five minutes half of us were sound asleep  there were no signs of our being dismissed while there were unmistakable signs of preparation for a meeting  i looked at a small clock hanging on the wall  it indicated twentyfive minutes to twelve  heighho thought i time is flying and i have yet to look for work  i want to go i said to a couple of waking men near me  got ter sty fer the service was the answer  do you want to stay i asked  they shook their heads  then let us go and tell them we want to get out i continued  come on  but the poor creatures were aghast  so i left them to their fate and went up to the nearest salvation army man  i want to go i said  i came here for breakfast in order that i might be in shape to look for work  i didnt think it would take so long to get breakfast  i think i have a chance for work in stepney and the sooner i start the better chance ill have of getting it  he was really a good fellow though he was startled by my request  wy he said were goin to old services and youd better sty  but that will spoil my chances for work i urged  and work is the most important thing for me just now  as he was only a private he referred me to the adjutant and to the adjutant i repeated my reasons for wishing to go and politely requested that he let me go  but it cawnt be done he said waxing virtuously indignant at such ingratitude  the idea he snorted  the idea  do you mean to say that i cant get out of here i demanded  that you will keep me here against my will  yes he snorted  i do not know what might have happened for i was waxing indignant myself but the congregation had piped the situation and he drew me over to a corner of the room and then into another room  here he again demanded my reasons for wishing to go  i want to go i said because i wish to look for work over in stepney and every hour lessens my chance of finding work  it is now twentyfive minutes to twelve  i did not think when i came in that it would take so long to get a breakfast  you ave business eh he sneered  a man of business you are eh then wot did you come ere for  i was out all night and i needed a breakfast in order to strengthen me to find work  that is why i came here  a nice thing to do he went on in the same sneering manner  a man with business shouldnt come ere  youve tyken some poor mans breakfast ere this morning thats wot youve done  which was a lie for every mothers son of us had come in  now i submit was this christianlike or even honestafter i had plainly stated that i was homeless and hungry and that i wished to look for work for him to call my looking for work business to call me therefore a business man and to draw the corollary that a man of business and well off did not require a charity breakfast and that by taking a charity breakfast i had robbed some hungry waif who was not a man of business  i kept my temper but i went over the facts again and clearly and concisely demonstrated to him how unjust he was and how he had perverted the facts  as i manifested no signs of backing down and i am sure my eyes were beginning to snap he led me to the rear of the building where in an open court stood a tent  in the same sneering tone he informed a couple of privates standing there that ere is a fellow that as business an e wants to go before services  they were duly shocked of course and they looked unutterable horror while he went into the tent and brought out the major  still in the same sneering manner laying particular stress on the business he brought my case before the commanding officer  the major was of a different stamp of man  i liked him as soon as i saw him and to him i stated my case in the same fashion as before  didnt you know you had to stay for services he asked  certainly not i answered or i should have gone without my breakfast you have no placards posted to that effect nor was i so informed when i entered the place  he meditated a moment  you can go he said  it was twelve oclock when i gained the street and i couldnt quite make up my mind whether i had been in the army or in prison  the day was half gone and it was a far fetch to stepney  and besides it was sunday and why should even a starving man look for work on sunday  furthermore it was my judgment that i had done a hard nights work walking the streets and a hard days work getting my breakfast so i disconnected myself from my working hypothesis of a starving young man in search of employment hailed a bus and climbed aboard  after a shave and a bath with my clothes all off i got in between clean white sheets and went to sleep  it was six in the evening when i closed my eyes  when they opened again the clocks were striking nine next morning  i had slept fifteen straight hours  and as i lay there drowsily my mind went back to the seven hundred unfortunates i had left waiting for services  no bath no shave for them no clean white sheets and all clothes off and fifteen hours straight sleep  services over it was the weary streets again the problem of a crust of bread ere night and the long sleepless night in the streets and the pondering of the problem of how to obtain a crust at dawn     chapter xiicoronation day      o thou that seawalls sever    from lands unwalled by seas    wilt thou endure forever    o miltons england these    thou that wast his republic    wilt thou clasp their knees    these royalties rusteaten    these wormcorroded lies    that keep thy head stormbeaten    and sunlike strength of eyes    from the open air and heaven    of intercepted skies     swinburne  vivat rex eduardus  they crowned a king this day and there has been great rejoicing and elaborate tomfoolery and i am perplexed and saddened  i never saw anything to compare with the pageant except yankee circuses and alhambra ballets nor did i ever see anything so hopeless and so tragic  to have enjoyed the coronation procession i should have come straight from america to the hotel cecil and straight from the hotel cecil to a fiveguinea seat among the washed  my mistake was in coming from the unwashed of the east end  there were not many who came from that quarter  the east end as a whole remained in the east end and got drunk  the socialists democrats and republicans went off to the country for a breath of fresh air quite unaffected by the fact that four hundred millions of people were taking to themselves a crowned and anointed ruler  six thousand five hundred prelates priests statesmen princes and warriors beheld the crowning and anointing and the rest of us the pageant as it passed  i saw it at trafalgar square the most splendid site in europe and the very innermost heart of the empire  there were many thousands of us all checked and held in order by a superb display of armed power  the line of march was doublewalled with soldiers  the base of the nelson column was triplefringed with bluejackets  eastward at the entrance to the square stood the royal marine artillery  in the triangle of pall mall and cockspur street the statue of george iii was buttressed on either side by the lancers and hussars  to the west were the redcoats of the royal marines and from the union club to the embouchure of whitehall swept the glittering massive curve of the 1st life guardsgigantic men mounted on gigantic chargers steelbreastplated steelhelmeted steel caparisoned a great warsword of steel ready to the hand of the powers that be  and further throughout the crowd were flung long lines of the metropolitan constabulary while in the rear were the reservestall wellfed men with weapons to wield and muscles to wield them in ease of need  and as it was thus at trafalgar square so was it along the whole line of marchforce overpowering force myriads of men splendid men the pick of the people whose sole function in life is blindly to obey and blindly to kill and destroy and stamp out life  and that they should be well fed well clothed and well armed and have ships to hurl them to the ends of the earth the east end of london and the east end of all england toils and rots and dies  there is a chinese proverb that if one man lives in laziness another will die of hunger and montesquieu has said the fact that many men are occupied in making clothes for one individual is the cause of there being many people without clothes  so one explains the other  we cannot understand the starved and runty 2 toiler of the east end living with his family in a oneroom den and letting out the floor space for lodgings to other starved and runty toilers till we look at the strapping life guardsmen of the west end and come to know that the one must feed and clothe and groom the other  and while in westminster abbey the people were taking unto themselves a king i jammed between the life guards and constabulary of trafalgar square was dwelling upon the time when the people of israel first took unto themselves a king  you all know how it runs  the elders came to the prophet samuel and said make us a king to judge us like all the nations     and the lord said unto samuel now therefore hearken unto their voice    howbeit thou shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign    over them     and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked    of him a king and he said     this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will    take your sons and appoint them unto him for his chariots and to be    his horsemen and they shall run before his chariots     and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands and    captains of fifties and he will set some to plough his ground and to    reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and the    instruments of his chariots     and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be    cooks and to be bakers     and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards    even the best of them and give them to his servants     and he will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give    to his officers and to his servants     and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your    goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work     he will take a tenth of your flocks and ye shall be his servants     and ye shall call out in that day because of your king which ye shall    have chosen you and the lord will not answer you in that day  all of which came to pass in that ancient day and they did cry out to samuel saying pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king and after saul david and solomon came rehoboam who answered the people roughly saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions  and in these latter days five hundred hereditary peers own onefifth of england and they and the officers and servants under the king and those who go to compose the powers that be yearly spend in wasteful luxury 1850000000 or 370000000 pounds which is thirtytwo per cent of the total wealth produced by all the toilers of the country  at the abbey clad in wonderful golden raiment amid fanfare of trumpets and throbbing of music surrounded by a brilliant throng of masters lords and rulers the king was being invested with the insignia of his sovereignty  the spurs were placed to his heels by the lord great chamberlain and a sword of state in purple scabbard was presented him by the archbishop of canterbury with these words     receive this kingly sword brought now from the altar of god and    delivered to you by the hands of the bishops and servants of god    though unworthy  whereupon being girded he gave heed to the archbishops exhortation     with this sword do justice stop the growth of iniquity protect the    holy church of god help and defend widows and orphans restore the    things that are gone to decay maintain the things that are restored    punish and reform what is amiss and confirm what is in good order  but hark  there is cheering down whitehall the crowd sways the double walls of soldiers come

check myself with a rush striving to convince myself that it is all real and rational and not some glimpse of fairyland  this i cannot succeed in doing and it is better so  i much prefer to believe that all this pomp and vanity and show and mumbojumbo foolery has come from fairyland than to believe it the performance of sane and sensible people who have mastered matter and solved the secrets of the stars  princes and princelings dukes duchesses and all manner of coroneted folk of the royal train are flashing past more warriors and lackeys and conquered peoples and the pagent is over  i drift with the crowd out of the square into a tangle of narrow streets where the publichouses are aroar with drunkenness men women and children mixed together in colossal debauch  and on every side is rising the favourite song of the coronation     oh on coronation day on coronation day    well have a spree a jubilee and shout hip hip hooray    for well all be marry drinking whisky wine and sherry    well all be merry on coronation day  the rain is pouring down  up the street come troops of the auxiliaries black africans and yellow asiatics beturbaned and befezed and coolies swinging along with machine guns and mountain batteries on their heads and the bare feet of all in quick rhythm going slish slish slish through the pavement mud  the publichouses empty by magic and the swarthy allegiants are cheered by their british brothers who return at once to the carouse  and how did you like the procession mate i asked an old man on a bench in green park  ow did i like it  a bloomin good chawnce sez i to myself for a sleep wi all the coppers awy so i turned into the corner there along wi fifty others  but i couldnt sleep alyin there an thinkin ow id worked all the years o my life an now ad no plyce to rest my ead an the music comin to me an the cheers an cannon till i got almost a hanarchist an wanted to blow out the brains o the lord chamberlain  why the lord chamberlain i could not precisely see nor could he but that was the way he felt he said conclusively and them was no more discussion  as night drew on the city became a blaze of light  splashes of colour green amber and ruby caught the eye at every point and e r in great crystal letters and backed by flaming gas was everywhere  the crowds in the streets increased by hundreds of thousands and though the police sternly put down mafficking drunkenness and rough play abounded the tired workers seemed to have gone mad with the relaxation and excitement and they surged and danced down the streets men and women old and young with linked arms and in long rows singing i may be crazy but i love you dolly gray and the honeysuckle and the beethe last rendered something like this     yew aw the enny ennyseckle oi em ther bee    oid like ter sip ther enny from those red lips yew see  i sat on a bench on the thames embankment looking across the illuminated water  it was approaching midnight and before me poured the better class of merrymakers shunning the more riotous streets and returning home  on the bench beside me sat two ragged creatures a man and a woman nodding and dozing  the woman sat with her arms clasped across the breast holding tightly her body in constant playnow dropping forward till it seemed its balance would be overcome and she would fall to the pavement now inclining to the left sideways till her head rested on the mans shoulder and now to the right stretched and strained till the pain of it awoke her and she sat bolt upright whereupon the dropping forward would begin again and go through its cycle till she was aroused by the strain and stretch  every little while boys and young men stopped long enough to go behind the bench and give vent to sudden and fiendish shouts  this always jerked the man and woman abruptly from their sleep and at sight of the startled woe upon their faces the crowd would roar with laughter as it flooded past  this was the most striking thing the general heartlessness exhibited on every hand  it is a commonplace the homeless on the benches the poor miserable folk who may be teased and are harmless  fifty thousand people must have passed the bench while i sat upon it and not one on such a jubilee occasion as the crowning of the king felt his heartstrings touched sufficiently to come up and say to the woman heres sixpence go and get a bed  but the women especially the young women made witty remarks upon the woman nodding and invariably set their companions laughing  to use a briticism it was cruel the corresponding americanism was more appropriateit was fierce  i confess i began to grow incensed at this happy crowd streaming by and to extract a sort of satisfaction from the london statistics which demonstrate that one in every four adults is destined to die on public charity either in the workhouse the infirmary or the asylum  i talked with the man  he was fiftyfour and a brokendown docker  he could only find odd work when there was a large demand for labour for the younger and stronger men were preferred when times were slack  he had spent a week now on the benches of the embankment but things looked brighter for next week and he might possibly get in a few days work and have a bed in some dosshouse  he had lived all his life in london save for five years when in 1878 he saw foreign service in india  of course he would eat so would the girl  days like this were uncommon hard on such as they though the coppers were so busy poor folk could get in more sleep  i awoke the girl or woman rather for she was eyght an twenty sir and we started for a coffeehouse  wot a lot o work puttin up the lights said the man at sight of some building superbly illuminated  this was the keynote of his being  all his life he had worked and the whole objective universe as well as his own soul he could express in terms only of work  coronations is some good he went on  they give work to men  but your belly is empty i said  yes he answered  i tried but there wasnt any chawnce  my age is against me  wot do you work at  seafarin chap eh  i knew it from yer clothes  i know wot you are said the girl an eyetalian  no e aynt the man cried heatedly  es a yank thats wot e is  i know  lord lumne look a that she exclaimed as we debauched upon the strand choked with the roaring reeling coronation crowd the men bellowing and the girls singing in high throaty notes     oh on coronation dy on coronation dy    well ave a spree a jubilee an shout ip ip ooray    for well all be merry drinkin whisky wine and sherry    well all be merry on coronation dy  ow dirty i am bein around the wy i ave the woman said as she sat down in a coffeehouse wiping the sleep and grime from the corners of her eyes  an the sights i ave seen this dy an i enjoyed it though it was lonesome by myself  an the duchesses an the lydies ad sich gran wite dresses  they was jest buful buful  im irish she said in answer to a question  my nymes eyethorne  what i asked  eyethorne sir eyethorne  spell it  haythorne eyethorne  oh i said irish cockney  yes sir londonborn  she had lived happily at home till her father died killed in an accident when she had found herself on the world  one brother was in the army and the other brother engaged in keeping a wife and eight children on twenty shillings a week and unsteady employment could do nothing for her  she had been out of london once in her life to a place in essex twelve miles away where she had picked fruit for three weeks an i was as brown as a berry wen i come back  you wont blieve it but i was  the last place in which she had worked was a coffeehouse hours from seven in the morning till eleven at night and for which she had received five shillings a week and her food  then she had fallen sick and since emerging from the hospital had been unable to find anything to do  she wasnt feeling up to much and the last two nights had been spent in the street  between them they stowed away a prodigious amount of food this man and woman and it was not till i had duplicated and triplicated their original orders that they showed signs of easing down  once she reached across and felt the texture of my coat and shirt and remarked upon the good clothes the yanks wore  my rags good clothes  it put me to the blush but on inspecting them more closely and on examining the clothes worn by the man and woman i began to feel quite well dressed and respectable  what do you expect to do in the end i asked them  you know youre growing older every day  workouse said he  gawd blimey if i do said she  theres no ope for me i know but ill die on the streets  no workouse for me thank you  no indeed she sniffed in the silence that fell  after you have been out all night in the streets i asked what do you do in the morning for something to eat  try to get a penny if you avent one saved over the man explained then go to a coffeeouse an get a mug o tea  but i dont see how that is to feed you i objected  the pair smiled knowingly  you drink your tea in little sips he went on making it last its longest  an you look sharp an theres some as leaves a bit beind em  its sprisin the food wot some people leaves the woman broke in  the thing said the man judicially as the trick dawned upon me is to get old o the penny  as we started to leave miss haythorne gathered up a couple of crusts from the neighbouring tables and thrust them somewhere into her rags  cawnt wyste em you know said she to which the docker nodded tucking away a couple of crusts himself  at three in the morning i strolled up the embankment  it was a gala night for the homeless for the police were elsewhere and each bench was jammed with sleeping occupants  there were as many women as men and the great majority of them male and female were old  occasionally a boy was to be seen  on one bench i noticed a family a man sitting upright with a sleeping babe in his arms his wife asleep her head on his shoulder and in her lap the head of a sleeping youngster  the mans eyes were wide open  he was staring out over the water and thinking which is not a good thing for a shelterless man with a family to do  it would not be a pleasant thing to speculate upon his thoughts but this i know and all london knows that the cases of outofworks killing their wives and babies is not an uncommon happening  one cannot walk along the thames embankment in the small hours of morning from the houses of parliament past cleopatras needle to waterloo bridge without being reminded of the sufferings seven and twenty centuries old recited by the author of job     there are that remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks    and feed them     they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widows ox    for a pledge     they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide    themselves together     behold as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their work    seeking diligently for meat the wilderness yieldeth them food for    their children     they cut their provender in the field and they glean the vintage of    the wicked     they lie all night naked without clothing and have no covering in the    cold     they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock    for want of a shelter     there are that pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge    of the poor     so that they go about naked without clothing and being an hungered    they carry the sheavesjob xxiv 210  seven and twenty centuries agone  and it is all as true and apposite to day in the innermost centre of this christian civilisation whereof edward vii is king     chapter xiiidan cullen docker   i stood yesterday in a room in one of the municipal dwellings not far from leman street  if i looked into a dreary future and saw that i would have to live in such a room until i died i should immediately go down plump into the thames and cut the tenancy short  it was not a room  courtesy to the language will no more permit it to be called a room than it will permit a hovel to be called a mansion  it was a den a lair  seven feet by eight were its dimensions and the ceiling was so low as not to give the cubic air space required by a british soldier in barracks  a crazy couch with ragged coverlets occupied nearly half the room  a rickety table a chair and a couple of boxes left little space in which to turn around  five dollars would have purchased everything in sight  the floor was bare while the walls and ceiling were literally covered with blood marks and splotches  each mark represented a violent deathof an insect for the place swarmed with vermin a plague with which no person could cope singlehanded  the man who had occupied this hole one dan cullen docker was dying in hospital  yet he had impressed his personality on his miserable surroundings sufficiently to give an inkling as to what sort of man he was  on the walls were cheap pictures of garibaldi engels dan burns and other labour leaders while on the table lay one of walter besants novels  he knew his shakespeare i was told and had read history sociology and economics  and he was selfeducated  on the table amidst a wonderful disarray lay a sheet of paper on which was scrawled mr cullen please return the large white jug and corkscrew i lent youarticles loaned during the first stages of his sickness by a woman neighbour and demanded back in anticipation of his death  a large white jug and a corkscrew are far too valuable to a creature of the abyss to permit another creature to die in peace  to the last dan cullens soul must be harrowed by the sordidness out of which it strove vainly to rise  it is a brief little story the story of dan cullen but there is much to read between the lines  he was born lowly in a city and land where the lines of caste are tightly drawn  all his days he toiled hard with his body and because he had opened the books and been caught up by the fires of the spirit and could write a letter like a lawyer he had been selected by his fellows to toil hard for them with his brain  he became a leader of the fruitporters represented the dockers on the london trades council and wrote trenchant articles for the labour journals  he did not cringe to other men even though they were his economic masters and controlled the means whereby he lived and he spoke his mind freely and fought the good fight  in the great dock strike he was guilty of taking a leading part  and that was the end of dan cullen from that day he was a marked man and every day for ten years and more he was paid off for what he had done  a docker is a casual labourer  work ebbs and flows and he works or does not work according to the amount of goods on hand to be moved  dan cullen was discriminated against  while he was not absolutely turned away which would have caused trouble and which would certainly have been more merciful he was called in by the foreman to do not more than two or three days work per week  this is what is called being disciplined or drilled  it means being starved  there is no politer word  ten years of it broke his heart and brokenhearted men cannot live  he took to his bed in his terrible den which grew more terrible with his helplessness  he was without kith or kin a lonely old man embittered and pessimistic fighting vermin the while and looking at garibaldi engels and dan burns gazing down at him from the bloodbespattered walls  no one came to see him in that crowded municipal barracks he had made friends with none of them and he was left to rot  but from the far reaches of the east end came a cobbler and his son his sole friends  they cleansed his room brought fresh linen from home and took from off his limbs the sheets greyishblack with dirt  and they brought to him one of the queens bounty nurses from aldgate  she washed his face shook up his conch and talked with him  it was interesting to talk with himuntil he learned her name  oh yes blank was her name she replied innocently and sir george blank was her brother  sir george blank eh thundered old dan cullen on his death bed sir george blank solicitor to the docks at cardiff who more than any other man had broken up the dockers union of cardiff and was knighted  and she was his sister  thereupon dan cullen sat up on his crazy couch and pronounced anathema upon her and all her breed and she fled to return no more strongly impressed with the ungratefulness of the poor  dan cullens feet became swollen with dropsy  he sat up all day on the side of the bed to keep the water out of his body no mat on the floor a thin blanket on his legs and an old coat around his shoulders  a missionary brought him a pair of paper slippers worth fourpence i saw them and proceeded to offer up fifty prayers or so for the good of dan cullens soul  but dan cullen was the sort of man that wanted his soul left alone  he did not care to have tom dick or harry on the strength of fourpenny slippers tampering with it  he asked the missionary kindly to open the window so that he might toss the slippers out  and the missionary went away to return no more likewise impressed with the ungratefulness of the poor  the cobbler a brave old hero himself though unaneled and unsung went privily to the head office of the big fruit brokers for whom dan cullen had worked as a casual labourer for thirty years  their system was such that the work was almost entirely done by casual hands  the cobbler told them the mans desperate plight old broken dying without help or money reminded them that he had worked for them thirty years and asked them to do something for him  oh said the manager remembering dan cullen without having to refer to the books you see we make it a rule never to help casuals and we can do nothing  nor did they do anything not even sign a letter asking for dan cullens admission to a hospital  and it is not so easy to get into a hospital in london town  at hampstead if he passed the doctors at least four months would elapse before he could get in there were so many on the books ahead of him  the cobbler finally got him into the whitechapel infirmary where he visited him frequently  here he found that dan cullen had succumbed to the prevalent feeling that being hopeless they were hurrying him out of the way  a fair and logical conclusion one must agree for an old and broken man to arrive at who has been resolutely disciplined and drilled for ten years  when they sweated him for brights disease to remove the fat from the kidneys dan cullen contended that the sweating was hastening his death while brights disease being a wasting away of the kidneys there was therefore no fat to remove and the doctors excuse was a palpable lie  whereupon the doctor became wroth and did not come near him for nine days  then his bed was tilted up so that his feet and legs were elevated  at once dropsy appeared in the body and dan cullen contended that the thing was done in order to run the water down into his body from his legs and kill him more quickly  he demanded his discharge though they told him he would die on the stairs and dragged himself more dead than alive to the cobblers shop  at the moment of writing this he is dying at the temperance hospital into which place his staunch friend the cobbler moved heaven and earth to have him admitted  poor dan cullen  a jude the obscure who reached out after knowledge who toiled with his body in the day and studied in the watches of the night who dreamed his dream and struck valiantly for the cause a patriot a lover of human freedom and a fighter unafraid and in the end not gigantic enough to beat down the conditions which baffled and stifled him a cynic and a pessimist gasping his final agony on a paupers couch in a charity wardfor a man to die who might have been wise and was not this i call a tragedy     chapter xivhops and hoppers   so far has the divorcement of the worker from the soil proceeded that the farming districts the civilised world over are dependent upon the cities for the gathering of the harvests  then it is when the land is spilling its ripe wealth to waste that the street folk who have been driven away from the soil are called back to it again  but in england they return not as prodigals but as outcasts still as vagrants and pariahs to be doubted and flouted by their country brethren to sleep in jails and casual wards or under the hedges and to live the lord knows how  it is estimated that kent alone requires eighty thousand of the street people to pick her hops  and out they come obedient to the call which is the call of their bellies and of the lingering dregs of adventurelust still in them  slum stews and ghetto pour them forth and the festering contents of slum stews and ghetto are undiminished  yet they overrun the country like an army of ghouls and the country does not want them  they are out of place  as they drag their squat misshapen bodies along the highways and byways they resemble some vile spawn from underground  their very presence the fact of their existence is an outrage to the fresh bright sun and the green and growing things  the clean upstanding trees cry shame upon them and their withered crookedness and their rottenness is a slimy desecration of the sweetness and purity of nature  is the picture overdrawn  it all depends  for one who sees and thinks life in terms of shares and coupons it is certainly overdrawn  but for one who sees and thinks life in terms of manhood and womanhood it cannot be overdrawn  such hordes of beastly wretchedness and inarticulate misery are no compensation for a millionaire brewer who lives in a west end palace sates himself with the sensuous delights of londons golden theatres hobnobs with lordlings and princelings and is knighted by the king  wins his spursgod forbid  in old time the great blonde beasts rode in the battles van and won their spurs by cleaving men from pate to chine  and after all it is finer to kill a strong man with a clean slicing blow of singing steel than to make a beast of him and of his seed through the generations by the artful and spidery manipulation of industry and politics  but to return to the hops  here the divorcement from the soil is as apparent as in every other agricultural line in england  while the manufacture of beer steadily increases the growth of hops steadily decreases  in 1835 the acreage under hops was 71327  today it stands at 48024 a decrease of 3103 from the acreage of last year  small as the acreage is this year a poor summer and terrible storms reduced the yield  this misfortune is divided between the people who own hops and the people who pick hops  the owners perforce must put up with less of the nicer things of life the pickers with less grub of which in the best of times they never get enough  for weary weeks headlines like the following have appeared in the london papers     tramps plentiful but the hops are few and not yet ready  then there have been numberless paragraphs like this     from the neighbourhood of the hop fields comes news of a distressing    nature  the bright outburst of the last two days has sent many    hundreds of hoppers into kent who will have to wait till the fields    are ready for them  at dover the number of vagrants in the workhouse    is treble the number there last year at this time and in other towns    the lateness of the season is responsible for a large increase in the    number of casuals  to cap their wretchedness when at last the picking had begun hops and hoppers were wellnigh swept away by a frightful storm of wind rain and hail  the hops were stripped clean from the poles and pounded into the earth while the hoppers seeking shelter from the stinging hail were close to drowning in their huts and camps on the lowlying ground  their condition after the storm was pitiable their state of vagrancy more pronounced than ever for poor crop that it was its destruction had taken away the chance of earning a few pennies and nothing remained for thousands of them but to pad the hoof back to london  we aynt crossinsweepers they said turning away from the ground carpeted ankledeep with hops  those that remained grumbled savagely among the halfstripped poles at the seven bushels for a shillinga rate paid in good seasons when the hops are in prime condition and a rate likewise paid in bad seasons by the growers because they cannot afford more  i passed through teston and east and west farleigh shortly after the storm and listened to the grumbling of the hoppers and saw the hops rotting on the ground  at the hothouses of barham court thirty thousand panes of glass had been broken by the hail while peaches plums pears apples rhubarb cabbages mangolds everything had been pounded to pieces and torn to shreds  all of which was too bad for the owners certainly but at the worst not one of them for one meal would have to go short of food or drink  yet it was to them that the newspapers devoted columns of sympathy their pecuniary losses being detailed at harrowing length  mr herbert l calculates his loss at 8000 pounds mr f of brewery fame who rents all the land in this parish loses 10000 pounds and mr l the wateringbury brewer brother to mr herbert l is another heavy loser  as for the hoppers they did not count  yet i venture to assert that the several almostsquare meals lost by underfed william buggles and underfed mrs buggles and the underfed buggles kiddies was a greater tragedy than the 10000 pounds lost by mr f  and in addition underfed william buggles tragedy might be multiplied by thousands where mr fs could not be multiplied by five  to see how william buggles and his kind fared i donned my seafaring togs and started out to get a job  with me was a young east london cobbler bert who had yielded to the lure of adventure and joined me for the trip  acting on my advice he had brought his worst rags and as we hiked up the london road out of maidstone he was worrying greatly for fear we had come too illdressed for the business  nor was he to be blamed  when we stopped in a tavern the publican eyed us gingerly nor did his demeanour brighten till we showed him the colour of our cash  the natives along the coast were all dubious and bean feasters from london dashing past in coaches cheered and jeered and shouted insulting things after us  but before we were done with the maidstone district my friend found that we were as well clad if not better than the average hopper  some of the bunches of rags we chanced upon were marvellous  the tide is out called a gypsylooking woman to her mates as we came up a long row of bins into which the pickers were stripping the hops  do you twig bert whispered  shes on to you  i twigged  and it must be confessed the figure was an apt one  when the tide is out boats are left on the beach and do not sail and a sailor when the tide is out does not sail either  my seafaring togs and my presence in the hop field proclaimed that i was a seaman without a ship a man on the beach and very like a craft at low water  can yer give us a job governor bert asked the bailiff a kindly faced and elderly man who was very busy  his no was decisively uttered but bert clung on and followed him about and i followed after pretty well all over the field  whether our persistency struck the bailiff as anxiety to work or whether he was affected by our hardluck appearance and tale neither bert nor i succeeded in making out but in the end he softened his heart and found us the one unoccupied bin in the placea bin deserted by two other men from what i could learn because of inability to make living wages  no bad conduct mind ye warned the bailiff as he left us at work in the midst of the women  it was saturday afternoon and we knew quitting time would come early so we applied ourselves earnestly to the task desiring to learn if we could at least make our salt  it was simple work womans work in fact and not mans  we sat on the edge of the bin between the standing hops while a polepuller supplied us with great fragrant branches  in an hours time we became as expert as it is possible to become  as soon as the fingers became accustomed automatically to differentiate between hops and leaves and to strip halfadozen blossoms at a time there was no more to learn  we worked nimbly and as fast as the women themselves though their bins filled more rapidly because of their swarming children each of which picked with two hands almost as fast as we picked  dontcher pick too clean its against the rules one of the women informed us and we took the tip and were grateful  as the afternoon wore along we realised that living wages could not be madeby men  women could pick as much as men and children could do almost as well as women so it was impossible for a man to compete with a woman and halfadozen children  for it is the woman and the halfdozen children who count as a unit and by their combined capacity determine the units pay  i say matey im beastly hungry said i to bert  we had not had any dinner  blimey but i could eat the ops he replied  whereupon we both lamented our negligence in not rearing up a numerous progeny to help us in this day of need  and in such fashion we whiled away the time and talked for the edification of our neighbours  we quite won the sympathy of the polepuller a young country yokel who now and again emptied a few picked blossoms into our bin it being part of his business to gather up the stray clusters torn off in the process of pulling  with him we discussed how much we could sub and were informed that while we were being paid a shilling for seven bushels we could only sub or have advanced to us a shilling for every twelve bushels  which is to say that the pay for five out of every twelve bushels was withhelda method of the grower to hold the hopper to his work whether the crop runs good or bad and especially if it runs bad  after all it was pleasant sitting there in the bright sunshine the golden pollen showering from our hands the pungent aromatic odour of the hops biting our nostrils and the while remembering dimly the sounding cities whence these people came  poor street people  poor gutter folk even they grow earthhungry and yearn vaguely for the soil from which they have been driven and for the free life in the open and the wind and rain and sun all undefiled by city smirches  as the sea calls to the sailor so calls the land to them and deep down in their aborted and decaying carcasses they are stirred strangely by the peasant memories of their forbears who lived before cities were  and in incomprehensible ways they are made glad by the earth smells and sights and sounds which their blood has not forgotten though unremembered by them  no more ops matey bert complained  it was five oclock and the polepullers had knocked off so that everything could be cleaned up there being no work on sunday  for an hour we were forced idly to wait the coming of the measurers our feet tingling with the frost which came on the heels of the setting sun  in the adjoining bin two women and halfadozen children had picked nine bushels so that the five bushels the measurers found in our bin demonstrated that we had done equally well for the halfdozen children had ranged from nine to fourteen years of age  five bushels  we worked it out to eightpence hapenny or seventeen cents for two men working three hours and a half  fourpence farthing apiece a little over a penny an hour  but we were allowed only to sub fivepence of the total sum though the tallykeeper short of change gave us sixpence  entreaty was in vain  a hardluck story could not move him  he proclaimed loudly that we had received a penny more than our due and went his way  granting for the sake of the argument that we were what we represented ourselves to benamely poor men and brokethen here was out position night was coming on we had had no supper much less dinner and we possessed sixpence between us  i was hungry enough to eat three sixpennorths of food and so was bert  one thing was patent  by doing 163 per cent justice to our stomachs we would expend the sixpence and our stomachs would still be gnawing under 833 per cent injustice  being broke again we could sleep under a hedge which was not so bad though the cold would sap an undue portion of what we had eaten  but the morrow was sunday on which we could do no work though our silly stomachs would not knock off on that account  here then was the problem how to get three meals on sunday and two on monday for we could not make another sub till monday evening  we knew that the casual wards were overcrowded also that if we begged from farmer or villager there was a large likelihood of our going to jail for fourteen days  what was to be done  we looked at each other in despair  not a bit of it  we joyfully thanked god that we were not as other men especially hoppers and went down the road to maidstone jingling in our pockets the halfcrowns and florins we had brought from london     chapter xvthe sea wife   you might not expect to find the sea wife in the heart of kent but that is where i found her in a mean street in the poor quarter of maidstone in her window she had no sign of lodgings to let and persuasion was necessary before she could bring herself to let me sleep in her front room  in the evening i descended to the semisubterranean kitchen and talked with her and her old man thomas mugridge by name  and as i talked to them all the subtleties and complexities of this tremendous machine civilisation vanished away  it seemed that i went down through the skin and the flesh to the naked soul of it and in thomas mugridge and his old woman gripped hold of the essence of this remarkable english breed  i found there the spirit of the wanderlust which has lured albions sons across the zones and i found there the colossal unreckoning which has tricked the english into foolish squabblings and preposterous fights and the doggedness and stubbornness which have brought them blindly through to empire and greatness and likewise i found that vast incomprehensible patience which has enabled the home population to endure under the burden of it all to toil without complaint through the weary years and docilely to yield the best of its sons to fight and colonise to the ends of the earth  thomas mugridge was seventyone years old and a little man  it was because he was little that he had not gone for a soldier  he had remained at home and worked  his first recollections were connected with work  he knew nothing else but work  he had worked all his days and at seventyone he still worked  each morning saw him up with the lark and afield a day labourer for as such he had been born  mrs mugridge was seventythree  from seven years of age she had worked in the fields doing a boys work at first and later a mans  she still worked keeping the house shining washing boiling and baking and with my advent cooking for me and shaming me by making my bed  at the end of threescore years and more of work they possessed nothing had nothing to look forward to save more work  and they were contented  they expected nothing else desired nothing else  they lived simply  their wants were fewa pint of beer at the end of the day sipped in the semisubterranean kitchen a weekly paper to pore over for seven nights handrunning and conversation as meditative and vacant as the chewing of a heifers cud  from a wood engraving on the wall a slender angelic girl looked down upon them and underneath was the legend our future queen  and from a highly coloured lithograph alongside looked down a stout and elderly lady with underneath our queendiamond jubilee  what you earn is sweetest quoth mrs mugridge when i suggested that it was about time they took a rest  no an we dont want help said thomas mugridge in reply to my question as to whether the children lent them a hand  well work till we dry up and blow away mother an me he added and mrs mugridge nodded her head in vigorous indorsement  fifteen children she had borne and all were away and gone or dead  the baby however lived in maidstone and she was twentyseven  when the children married they had their hands full with their own families and troubles like their fathers and mothers before them  where were the children  ah where were they not  lizzie was in australia mary was in buenos ayres poll was in new york joe had died in indiaand so they called them up the living and the dead soldier and sailor and colonists wife for the travellers sake who sat in their kitchen  they passed me a photograph  a trim young fellow in soldiers garb looked out at me  and which son is this i asked  they laughed a hearty chorus  son  nay grandson just back from indian service and a soldiertrumpeter to the king  his brother was in the same regiment with him  and so it ran sons and daughters and grand sons and daughters worldwanderers and empirebuilders all of them while the old folks stayed at home and worked at building empire too     there dwells a wife by the northern gate       and a wealthy wife is she    she breeds a breed o rovin men       and casts them over sea     and some are drowned in deep water       and some in sight of shore    and word goes back to the weary wife       and ever she sends more  but the sea wifes childbearing is about done  the stock is running out and the planet is filling up  the wives of her sons may carry on the breed but her work is past  the erstwhile men of england are now the men of australia of africa of america  england has sent forth the best she breeds for so long and has destroyed those that remained so fiercely that little remains for her to do but to sit down through the long nights and gaze at royalty on the wall  the true british merchant seaman has passed away  the merchant service is no longer a recruiting ground for such sea dogs as fought with nelson at trafalgar and the nile  foreigners largely man the merchant ships though englishmen still continue to officer them and to prefer foreigners forard  in south africa the colonial teaches the islander how to shoot and the officers muddle and blunder while at home the street people play hysterically at mafficking and the war office lowers the stature for enlistment  it could not be otherwise  the most complacent britisher cannot hope to draw off the lifeblood and underfeed and keep it up forever  the average mrs thomas mugridge has been driven into the city and she is not breeding very much of anything save an anaemic and sickly progeny which cannot find enough to eat  the strength of the englishspeaking race today is not in the tight little island but in the new world overseas where are the sons and daughters of mrs thomas mugridge  the sea wife by the northern gate has just about done her work in the world though she does not realize it  she must sit down and rest her tired loins for a space and if the casual ward and the workhouse do not await her it is because of the sons and daughters she has reared up against the day of her feebleness and decay     chapter xviproperty versus person   in a civilisation frankly materialistic and based upon property not soul it is inevitable that property shall be exalted over soul that crimes against property shall be considered far more serious than crimes against the person  to pound ones wife to a jelly and break a few of her ribs is a trivial offence compared with sleeping out under the naked stars because one has not the price of a doss  the lad who steals a few pears from a wealthy railway corporation is a greater menace to society than the young brute who commits an unprovoked assault upon an old man over seventy years of age  while the young girl who takes a lodging under the pretence that she has work commits so dangerous an offence that were she not severely punished she and her kind might bring the whole fabric of property clattering to the ground  had she unholily tramped piccadilly and the strand after midnight the police would not have interfered with her and she would have been able to pay for her lodging  the following illustrative

hard labour     chapter xviiinefficiency   i stopped a moment to listen to an argument on the mile end waste  it was nighttime and they were all workmen of the better class  they had surrounded one of their number a pleasantfaced man of thirty and were giving it to him rather heatedly  but ow about this ere cheap immigration one of them demanded  the jews of whitechapel say acutting our throats right along  you cant blame them was the answer  theyre just like us and theyve got to live  dont blame the man who offers to work cheaper than you and gets your job  but ow about the wife an kiddies his interlocutor demanded  there you are came the answer  how about the wife and kiddies of the man who works cheaper than you and gets your job  eh  how about his wife and kiddies  hes more interested in them than in yours and he cant see them starve  so he cuts the price of labour and out you go but you mustnt blame him poor devil  he cant help it  wages always come down when two men are after the same job  thats the fault of competition not of the man who cuts the price  but wyges dont come down where theres a union the objection was made  and there you are again right on the head  the union cheeks competition among the labourers but makes it harder where there are no unions  theres where your cheap labour of whitechapel comes in  theyre unskilled and have no unions and cut each others throats and ours in the bargain if we dont belong to a strong union  without going further into the argument this man on the mile end waste pointed the moral that when two men were after the one job wages were bound to fall  had he gone deeper into the matter he would have found that even the union say twenty thousand strong could not hold up wages if twenty thousand idle men were trying to displace the union men  this is admirably instanced just now by the return and disbandment of the soldiers from south africa  they find themselves by tens of thousands in desperate straits in the army of the unemployed  there is a general decline in wages throughout the land which giving rise to labour disputes and strikes is taken advantage of by the unemployed who gladly pick up the tools thrown down by the strikers  sweating starvation wages armies of unemployed and great numbers of the homeless and shelterless are inevitable when there are more men to do work than there is work for men to do  the men and women i have met upon the streets and in the spikes and pegs are not there because as a mode of life it may be considered a soft snap  i have sufficiently outlined the hardships they undergo to demonstrate that their existence is anything but soft  it is a matter of sober calculation here in england that it is softer to work for twenty shillings a week and have regular food and a bed at night than it is to walk the streets  the man who walks the streets suffers more and works harder for far less return  i have depicted the nights they spend and how driven in by physical exhaustion they go to the casual ward for a rest up  nor is the casual ward a soft snap  to pick four pounds of oakum break twelve hundredweight of stones or perform the most revolting tasks in return for the miserable food and shelter they receive is an unqualified extravagance on the part of the men who are guilty of it  on the part of the authorities it is sheer robbery  they give the men far less for their labour than do the capitalistic employers  the wage for the same amount of labour performed for a private employer would buy them better beds better food more good cheer and above all greater freedom  as i say it is an extravagance for a man to patronise a casual ward  and that they know it themselves is shown by the way these men shun it till driven in by physical exhaustion  then why do they do it  not because they are discouraged workers  the very opposite is true they are discouraged vagabonds  in the united states the tramp is almost invariably a discouraged worker  he finds tramping a softer mode of life than working  but this is not true in england  here the powers that be do their utmost to discourage the tramp and vagabond and he is in all truth a mightily discouraged creature  he knows that two shillings a day which is only fifty cents will buy him three fair meals a bed at night and leave him a couple of pennies for pocket money  he would rather work for those two shillings than for the charity of the casual ward for he knows that he would not have to work so hard and that he would not be so abominably treated  he does not do so however because there are more men to do work than there is work for men to do  when there are more men than there is work to be done a siftingout process must obtain  in every branch of industry the less efficient are crowded out  being crowded out because of inefficiency they cannot go up but must descend and continue to descend until they reach their proper level a place in the industrial fabric where they are efficient it follows therefore and it is inexorable that the least efficient must descend to the very bottom which is the shambles wherein they perish miserably  a glance at the confirmed inefficients at the bottom demonstrates that they are as a rule mental physical and moral wrecks  the exceptions to the rule are the late arrivals who are merely very inefficient and upon whom the wrecking process is just beginning to operate  all the forces here it must be remembered are destructive  the good body which is there because its brain is not quick and capable is speedily wrenched and twisted out of shape the clean mind which is there because of its weak body is speedily fouled and contaminated  the mortality is excessive but even then they die far too lingering deaths  here then we have the construction of the abyss and the shambles throughout the whole industrial fabric a constant elimination is going on  the inefficient are weeded out and flung downward  various things constitute inefficiency  the engineer who is irregular or irresponsible will sink down until he finds his place say as a casual labourer an occupation irregular in its very nature and in which there is little or no responsibility  those who are slow and clumsy who suffer from weakness of body or mind or who lack nervous mental and physical stamina must sink down sometimes rapidly sometimes step by step to the bottom  accident by disabling an efficient worker will make him inefficient and down he must go  and the worker who becomes aged with failing energy and numbing brain must begin the frightful descent which knows no stoppingplace short of the bottom and death  in this last instance the statistics of london tell a terrible tale  the population of london is oneseventh of the total population of the united kingdom and in london year in and year out one adult in every four dies on public charity either in the workhouse the hospital or the asylum  when the fact that the welltodo do not end thus is taken into consideration it becomes manifest that it is the fate of at least one in every three adult workers to die on public charity  as an illustration of how a good worker may suddenly become inefficient and what then happens to him i am tempted to give the case of mgarry a man thirtytwo years of age and an inmate of the workhouse  the extracts are quoted from the annual report of the trade union     i worked at sullivans place in widnes better known as the british    alkali chemical works  i was working in a shed and i had to cross    the yard  it was ten oclock at night and there was no light about    while crossing the yard i felt something take hold of my leg and screw    it off  i became unconscious i didnt know what became of me for a    day or two  on the following sunday night i came to my senses and    found myself in the hospital  i asked the nurse what was to do with    my legs and she told me both legs were off     there was a stationary crank in the yard let into the ground the    hole was 18 inches long 15 inches deep and 15 inches wide  the    crank revolved in the hole three revolutions a minute  there was no    fence or covering over the hole  since my accident they have stopped    it altogether and have covered the hole up with a piece of sheet    iron    they gave me 25 pounds  they didnt reckon that as    compensation they said it was only for charitys sake  out of that i    paid 9 pounds for a machine by which to wheel myself about     i was labouring at the time i got my legs off  i got twentyfour    shillings a week rather better pay than the other men because i used    to take shifts  when there was heavy work to be done i used to be    picked out to do it  mr manton the manager visited me at the    hospital several times  when i was getting better i asked him if he    would be able to find me a job  he told me not to trouble myself as    the firm was not coldhearted  i would be right enough in any case       mr manton stopped coming to see me and the last time he said he    thought of asking the directors to give me a fiftypound note so i    could go home to my friends in ireland  poor mgarry  he received rather better pay than the other men because he was ambitious and took shifts and when heavy work was to be done he was the man picked out to do it  and then the thing happened and he went into the workhouse  the alternative to the workhouse is to go home to ireland and burden his friends for the rest of his life  comment is superfluous  it must be understood that efficiency is not determined by the workers themselves but is determined by the demand for labour  if three men seek one position the most efficient man will get it  the other two no matter how capable they may be will none the less be inefficients  if germany japan and the united states should capture the entire world market for iron coal and textiles at once the english workers would be thrown idle by hundreds of thousands  some would emigrate but the rest would rush their labour into the remaining industries  a general shaking up of the workers from top to bottom would result and when equilibrium had been restored the number of the inefficients at the bottom of the abyss would have been increased by hundreds of thousands  on the other hand conditions remaining constant and all the workers doubling their efficiency there would still be as many inefficients though each inefficient were twice as capable as he had been and more capable than many of the efficients had previously been  when there are more men to work than there is work for men to do just as many men as are in excess of work will be inefficients and as inefficients they are doomed to lingering and painful destruction  it shall be the aim of future chapters to show by their work and manner of living not only how the inefficients are weeded out and destroyed but to show how inefficients are being constantly and wantonly created by the forces of industrial society as it exists today     chapter xviiiwages   when i learned that in lesser london there were 1292737 people who received twentyone shillings or less a week per family i became interested as to how the wages could best be spent in order to maintain the physical efficiency of such families  families of six seven eight or ten being beyond consideration i have based the following table upon a family of fivea father mother and three children while i have made twentyone shillings equivalent to 525 though actually twentyone shillings are equivalent to about 511  rent       150    or 60 bread       100     40 meat        o875   36 vegetables  o625   26 coals       025     10 tea         018     09 oil         016     08 sugar       018     09 milk        012     06 soap        008     04 butter      020     010 firewood    008     04 total      525     212  an analysis of one item alone will show how little room there is for waste  bread 1 for a family of five for seven days one dollars worth of bread will give each a daily ration of 28 cents and if they eat three meals a day each may consume per meal 95 mills worth of bread a little less than one halfpennyworth  now bread is the heaviest item  they will get less of meat per mouth each meal and still less of vegetates while the smaller items become too microscopic for consideration  on the other hand these food articles are all bought at small retail the most expensive and wasteful method of purchasing  while the table given above will permit no extravagance no overloading of stomachs it will be noticed that there is no surplus  the whole guinea is spent for food and rent  there is no pocketmoney left over does the man buy a glass of beer the family must eat that much less and in so far as it eats less just that far will it impair its physical efficiency  the members of this family cannot ride in busses or trams cannot write letters take outings go to a tupenny gaff for cheap vaudeville join social or benefit clubs nor can they buy sweetmeats tobacco books or newspapers  and further should one child and there are three require a pair of shoes the family must strike meat for a week from its bill of fare  and since there are five pairs of feet requiring shoes and five heads requiring hats and five bodies requiring clothes and since there are laws regulating indecency the family must constantly impair its physical efficiency in order to keep warm and out of jail  for notice when rent coals oil soap and firewood are extracted from the weekly income there remains a daily allowance for food of 45d to each person and that 45d cannot be lessened by buying clothes without impairing the physical efficiency  all of which is hard enough  but the thing happens the husband and father breaks his leg or his neck  no 45d a day per mouth for food is coming in no halfpennyworth of bread per meal and at the end of the week no six shillings for rent  so out they must go to the streets or the workhouse or to a miserable den somewhere in which the mother will desperately endeavour to hold the family together on the ten shillings she may possibly be able to earn  while in london there are 1292737 people who receive twentyone shillings or less a week per family it must be remembered that we have investigated a family of five living on a twentyone shilling basis there are larger families there are many families that live on less than twentyone shillings and there is much irregular employment  the question naturally arises how do they live  the answer is that they do not live  they do not know what life is  they drag out a subterbestial existence until mercifully released by death  before descending to the fouler depths let the case of the telephone girls be cited  here are clean fresh english maids for whom a higher standard of living than that of the beasts is absolutely necessary otherwise they cannot remain clean fresh english maids  on entering the service a telephone girl receives a weekly wage of eleven shillings  if she be quick and clever she may at the end of five years attain a minimum wage of one pound  recently a table of such a girls weekly expenditure was furnished to lord londonderry  here it is                        s   d rent fire and light 7    6 board at home         3    6 board at the office   4    6 street car fare       1    6 laundry               1    0 total                18    0  this leaves nothing for clothes recreation or sickness  and yet many of the girls are receiving not eighteen shillings but eleven shillings twelve shillings and fourteen shillings per week  they must have clothes and recreation and     man to man so oft unjust    is always so to woman  at the trades union congress now being held in london the gasworkers union moved that instructions be given the parliamentary committee to introduce a bill to prohibit the employment of children under fifteen years of age  mr shackleton member of parliament and a representative of the northern counties weavers opposed the resolution on behalf of the textile workers who he said could not dispense with the earnings of their children and live on the scale of wages which obtained  the representatives of 514000 workers voted against the resolution while the representatives of 535000 workers voted in favour of it  when 514000 workers oppose a resolution prohibiting childlabour under fifteen it is evident that a lessthanliving wage is being paid to an immense number of the adult workers of the country  i have spoken with women in whitechapel who receive right along less than one shilling for a twelvehour day in the coatmaking sweat shops and with women trousers finishers who receive an average princely and weekly wage of three to four shillings  a case recently cropped up of men in the employ of a wealthy business house receiving their board and six shillings per week for six working days of sixteen hours each  the sandwich men get fourteenpence per day and find themselves  the average weekly earnings of the hawkers and costermongers are not more than ten to twelve shillings  the average of all common labourers outside the dockers is less than sixteen shillings per week while the dockers average from eight to nine shillings  these figures are taken from a royal commission report and are authentic  conceive of an old woman broken and dying supporting herself and four children and paying three shillings per week rent by making match boxes at 225d per gross  twelve dozen boxes for 225d and in addition finding her own paste and thread  she never knew a day off either for sickness rest or recreation  each day and every day sundays as well she toiled fourteen hours  her days stint was seven gross for which she received 1s 375d  in the week of ninetyeight hours work she made 7066 match boxes and earned 4s 1025d less per paste and thread  last year mr thomas holmes a policecourt missionary of note after writing about the condition of the women workers received the following letter dated april 18 1901     sirpardon the liberty i am taking but having read what you said    about poor women working fourteen hours a day for ten shillings per    week i beg to state my case  i am a tiemaker who after working    all the week cannot earn more than five shillings and i have a poor    afflicted husband to keep who hasnt earned a penny for more than ten    years  imagine a woman capable of writing such a clear sensible grammatical letter supporting her husband and self on five shillings per week  mr holmes visited her  he had to squeeze to get into the room  there lay her sick husband there she worked all day long there she cooked ate washed and slept and there her husband and she performed all the functions of living and dying  there was no space for the missionary to sit down save on the bed which was partially covered with ties and silk  the sick mans lungs were in the last stages of decay  he coughed and expectorated constantly the woman ceasing from her work to assist him in his paroxysms  the silken fluff from the ties was not good for his sickness nor was his sickness good for the ties and the handlers and wearers of the ties yet to come  another case mr holmes visited was that of a young girl twelve years of age charged in the police court with stealing food  he found her the deputy mother of a boy of nine a crippled boy of seven and a younger child  her mother was a widow and a blousemaker  she paid five shillings a week rent  here are the last items in her housekeeping account tea 05d sugar 05d bread 025d margarine 1d oil 15d and firewood 1d  good housewives of the soft and tender folk imagine yourselves marketing and keeping house on such a scale setting a table for five and keeping an eye on your deputy mother of twelve to see that she did not steal food for her little brothers and sisters the while you stitched stitched stitched at a nightmare line of blouses which stretched away into the gloom and down to the paupers coffin a yawn for you     chapter xixthe ghetto      is it well that while we range with science glorying in the time    city children soak and blacken soul and sense in city slime    there among the gloomy alleys progress halts on palsied feet    crime and hunger cast out maidens by the thousand on the street     there the master scrimps his haggard seamstress of her daily bread    there the single sordid attic holds the living and the dead    there the smouldering fire of fever creeps across the rotted floor    and the crowded couch of incest in the warrens of the poor  at one time the nations of europe confined the undesirable jews in city ghettos  but today the dominant economic class by less arbitrary but none the less rigorous methods has confined the undesirable yet necessary workers into ghettos of remarkable meanness and vastness  east london is such a ghetto where the rich and the powerful do not dwell and the traveller cometh not and where two million workers swarm procreate and die  it must not be supposed that all the workers of london are crowded into the east end but the tide is setting strongly in that direction  the poor quarters of the city proper are constantly being destroyed and the main stream of the unhoused is toward the east  in the last twelve years one district london over the border as it is called which lies well beyond aldgate whitechapel and mile end has increased 260000 or over sixty per cent  the churches in this district by the way can seat but one in every thirtyseven of the added population  the city of dreadful monotony the east end is often called especially by wellfed optimistic sightseers who look over the surface of things and are merely shocked by the intolerable sameness and meanness of it all  if the east end is worthy of no worse title than the city of dreadful monotony and if working people are unworthy of variety and beauty and surprise it would not be such a bad place in which to live but the east end does merit a worse title  it should be called the city of degradation  while it is not a city of slums as some people imagine it may well be said to be one gigantic slum  from the standpoint of simple decency and clean manhood and womanhood any mean street of all its mean streets is a slum  where sights and sounds abound which neither you nor i would care to have our children see and hear is a place where no mans children should live and see and hear  where you and i would not care to have our wives pass their lives is a place where no other mans wife should have to pass her life  for here in the east end the obscenities and brute vulgarities of life are rampant  there is no privacy  the bad corrupts the good and all fester together  innocent childhood is sweet and beautiful but in east london innocence is a fleeting thing and you must catch them before they crawl out of the cradle or you will find the very babes as unholily wise as you  the application of the golden rule determines that east london is an unfit place in which to live  where you would not have your own babe live and develop and gather to itself knowledge of life and the things of life is not a fit place for the babes of other men to live and develop and gather to themselves knowledge of life and the things of life  it is a simple thing this golden rule and all that is required political economy and the survival of the fittest can go hang if they say otherwise  what is not good enough for you is not good enough for other men and theres no more to be said  there are 300000 people in london divided into families that live in oneroom tenements  far far more live in two and three rooms and are as badly crowded regardless of sex as those that live in one room  the law demands 400 cubic feet of space for each person  in army barracks each soldier is allowed 600 cubic feet  professor huxley at one time himself a medical officer in east london always held that each person should have 800 cubic feet of space and that it should be well ventilated with pure air  yet in london there are 900000 people living in less than the 400 cubic feet prescribed by the law  mr charles booth who engaged in a systematic work of years in charting and classifying the toiling city population estimates that there are 1800000 people in london who are poor and very poor  it is of interest to mark what he terms poor  by poor he means families which have a total weekly income of from eighteen to twentyone shillings  the very poor fall greatly below this standard  the workers as a class are being more and more segregated by their economic masters and this process with its jamming and overcrowding tends not so much toward immorality as unmorality  here is an extract from a recent meeting of the london county council terse and bald but with a wealth of horror to be read between the lines     mr bruce asked the chairman of the public health committee whether    his attention had been called to a number of cases of serious    overcrowding in the east end  in st georgesintheeast a man and    his wife and their family of eight occupied one small room  this    family consisted of five daughters aged twenty seventeen eight    four and an infant and three sons aged fifteen thirteen and    twelve  in whitechapel a man and his wife and their three daughters    aged sixteen eight and four and two sons aged ten and twelve    years occupied a smaller room  in bethnal green a man and his wife    with four sons aged twentythree twentyone nineteen and sixteen    and two daughters aged fourteen and seven were also found in one    room  he asked whether it was not the duty of the various local    authorities to prevent such serious overcrowding  but with 900000 people actually living under illegal conditions the authorities have their hands full  when the overcrowded folk are ejected they stray off into some other hole and as they move their belongings by night on handbarrows one handbarrow accommodating the entire household goods and the sleeping children it is next to impossible to keep track of them  if the public health act of 1891 were suddenly and completely enforced 900000 people would receive notice to clear out of their houses and go on to the streets and 500000 rooms would have to be built before they were all legally housed again  the mean streets merely look mean from the outside but inside the walls are to be found squalor misery and tragedy  while the following tragedy may be revolting to read it must not be forgotten that the existence of it is far more revolting  in devonshire place lisson grove a short while back died an old woman of seventyfive years of age  at the inquest the coroners officer stated that all he found in the room was a lot of old rags covered with vermin  he had got himself smothered with the vermin  the room was in a shocking condition and he had never seen anything like it  everything was absolutely covered with vermin  the doctor said he found deceased lying across the fender on her back she had one garment and her stockings on  the body was quite alive with vermin and all the clothes in the room were absolutely grey with insects  deceased was very badly nourished and was very emaciated  she had extensive sores on her legs and her stockings were adherent to those sores  the sores were the result of vermin  a man present at the inquest wrote i had the evil fortune to see the body of the unfortunate woman as it lay in the mortuary and even now the memory of that gruesome sight makes me shudder  there she lay in the mortuary shell so starved and emaciated that she was a mere bundle of skin and bones  her hair which was matted with filth was simply a nest of vermin  over her bony chest leaped and rolled hundreds thousands myriads of vermin  if it is not good for your mother and my mother so to die then it is not good for this woman whosoevers mother she might be so to die  bishop wilkinson who has lived in zululand recently said no human of an african village would allow such a promiscuous mixing of young men and women boys and girls  he had reference to the children of the overcrowded folk who at five have nothing to learn and much to unlearn which they will never unlearn  it is notorious that here in the ghetto the houses of the poor are greater profit earners than the mansions of the rich  not only does the poor worker have to live like a beast but he pays proportionately more for it than does the rich man for his spacious comfort  a class of house sweaters has been made possible by the competition of the poor for houses  there are more people than there is room and numbers are in the workhouse because they cannot find shelter elsewhere  not only are houses let but they are sublet and subsublet down to the very rooms  a part of a room to let  this notice was posted a short while ago in a window not five minutes walk from st jamess hall  the rev hugh price hughes is authority for the statement that beds are let on the threerelay systemthat is three tenants to a bed each occupying it eight hours so that it never grows cold while the floor space underneath the bed is likewise let on the threerelay system  health officers are not at all unused to finding such cases as the following in one room having a cubic capacity of 1000 feet three adult females in the bed and two adult females under the bed and in one room of 1650 cubic feet one adult male and two children in the bed and two adult females under the bed  here is a typical example of a room on the more respectable tworelay system  it is occupied in the daytime by a young woman employed all night in a hotel  at seven oclock in the evening she vacates the room and a bricklayers labourer comes in  at seven in the morning he vacates and goes to his work at which time she returns from hers  the rev w n davies rector of spitalfields took a census of some of the alleys in his parish  he says     in one alley there are ten housesfiftyone rooms nearly all about 8    feet by 9 feetand 254 people  in six instances only do 2 people    occupy one room and in others the number varied from 3 to 9  in    another court with six houses and twentytwo rooms were 84    peopleagain 6 7 8 and 9 being the number living in one room in    several instances  in one house with eight rooms are 45 peopleone    room containing 9 persons one 8 two 7 and another 6  this ghetto crowding is not through inclination but compulsion  nearly fifty per cent of the workers pay from onefourth to onehalf of their earnings for rent  the average rent in the larger part of the east end is from four to six shillings per week for one room while skilled mechanics earning thirtyfive shillings per week are forced to part with fifteen shillings of it for two or three pokey little dens in which they strive desperately to obtain some semblance of home life  and rents are going up all the time  in one street in stepney the increase in only two years has been from thirteen to eighteen shillings in another street from eleven to sixteen shillings and in another street from eleven to fifteen shillings while in whitechapel tworoom houses that recently rented for ten shillings are now costing twentyone shillings  east west north and south the rents are going up  when land is worth from 20000 to 30000 pounds an acre some one must pay the landlord  mr w c steadman in the house of commons in a speech concerning his constituency in stepney related the following     this morning not a hundred yards from where i am myself living a    widow stopped me  she has six children to support and the rent of    her house was fourteen shillings per week  she gets her living by    letting the house to lodgers and doing a days washing or charring    that woman with tears in her eyes told me that the landlord had    increased the rent from fourteen shillings to eighteen shillings  what    could the woman do  there is no accommodation in stepney  every    place is taken up and overcrowded  class supremacy can rest only on class degradation and when the workers are segregated in the ghetto they cannot escape the consequent degradation  a short and stunted people is createda breed strikingly differentiated from their masters breed a pavement folk as it were lacking stamina and strength  the men become caricatures of what physical men ought to be and their women and children are pale and anaemic with eyes ringed darkly who stoop and slouch and are early twisted out of all shapeliness and beauty  to make matters worse the men of the ghetto are the men who are lefta deteriorated stock left to undergo still further deterioration  for a hundred and fifty years at least they have been drained of their best the strong men the men of pluck initiative and ambition have been faring forth to the fresher and freer portions of the globe to make new lands and nations  those who are lacking the weak of heart and head and hand as well as the rotten and hopeless have remained to carry on the breed  and year by year in turn the best they breed are taken from them  wherever a man of vigour and stature manages to grow up he is haled forthwith into the army  a soldier as bernard shaw has said ostensibly a heroic and patriotic defender of his country is really an unfortunate man driven by destitution to offer himself as food for powder for the sake of regular rations shelter and clothing  this constant selection of the best from the workers has impoverished those who are left a sadly degraded remainder for the great part which in the ghetto sinks to the deepest depths  the wine of life has been drawn off to spill itself in blood and progeny over the rest of the earth  those that remain are the lees and they are segregated and steeped in themselves  they become indecent and bestial  when they kill they kill with their hands and then stupidly surrender themselves to the executioners  there is no splendid audacity about their transgressions  they gouge a mate with a dull knife or beat his head in with an iron pot and then sit down and wait for the police  wifebeating is the masculine prerogative of matrimony  they wear remarkable boots of brass and iron and when they have polished off the mother of their children with a black eye or so they knock her down and proceed to trample her very much as a western stallion tramples a rattlesnake  a woman of the lower ghetto classes is as much the slave of her husband as is the indian squaw  and i for one were i a woman and had but the two choices should prefer being a squaw  the men are economically dependent on their masters and the women are economically dependent on the men  the result is the woman gets the beating the man should give his master and she can do nothing  there are the kiddies and he is the breadwinner and she dare not send him to jail and leave herself and children to starve  evidence to convict can rarely be obtained when such cases come into the courts as a rule the trampled wife and mother is weeping and hysterically beseeching the magistrate to let her husband off for the kiddies sakes  the wives become screaming harridans or brokenspirited and doglike lose what little decency and selfrespect they have remaining over from their maiden days and all sink together unheeding in their degradation and dirt  sometimes i become afraid of my own generalizations upon the massed misery of this ghetto life and feel that my impressions are exaggerated that i am too close to the picture and lack perspective  at such moments i find it well to turn to the testimony of other men to prove to myself that i am not becoming overwrought and addlepated  frederick harrison has always struck me as being a levelheaded wellcontrolled man and he says     to me at least it would be enough to condemn modern society as    hardly an advance on slavery or serfdom if the permanent condition of    industry were to be that which we behold that ninety per cent of the    actual producers of wealth have no home that they can call their own    beyond the end of the week have no bit of soil or so much as a room    that belongs to them have nothing of value of any kind except as    much old furniture as will go into a cart have the precarious chance    of weekly wages which barely suffice to keep them in health are    housed for the most part in places that no man thinks fit for his    horse are separated by so narrow a margin from destitution that a    month of bad trade sickness or unexpected loss brings them face to    face with hunger and pauperism    but below this normal state of    the average workman in town and country there is found the great band    of destitute outcaststhe camp followers of the army of industryat    least onetenth the whole proletarian population whose normal    condition is one of sickening wretchedness  if this is to be the    permanent arrangement of modern society civilization must be held to    bring a curse on the great majority of mankind  ninety per cent  the figures are appalling yet mr stopford brooke after drawing a frightful london picture finds himself compelled to multiply it by half a million  here it is     i often used to meet when i was curate at kensington families    drifting into london along the hammersmith road  one day there came    along a labourer and his wife his son and two daughters  their    family had lived for a long time on an estate in the country and    managed with the help of the commonland and their labour to get on    but the time came when the common was encroached upon and their    labour was not needed on the estate and they were quietly turned out    of their cottage  where should they go  of course to london where    work was thought to be plentiful  they had a little savings and they    thought they could get two decent rooms to live in  but the    inexorable land question met them in london  they tried the decent    courts for lodgings and found that two rooms would cost ten shillings    a week  food was dear and bad water was bad and in a short time    their health suffered  work was hard to get and its wage was so low    that they were soon in debt  they became more ill and more despairing    with the poisonous surroundings the darkness and the long hours of    work and they were driven forth to seek a cheaper lodging  they    found it in a court i knew wella hotbed of crime and nameless    horrors  in this they got a single room at a cruel rent and work was    more difficult for them to get now as they came from a place of such    bad repute and they fell into the hands of those who sweat the last    drop out of man and woman and child for wages which are the food only    of despair  and the darkness and the dirt the bad food and the    sickness and the want of water was worse than before and the crowd    and the companionship of the court robbed them of the last shreds of    selfrespect  the drink demon seized upon them  of course there was    a publichouse at both ends of the court  there they fled one and    all for shelter and warmth and society and forgetfulness  and    they came out in deeper debt with inflamed senses and burning brains    and an unsatisfied craving for drink they would do anything to    satiate  and in a few months the father was in prison the wife    dying the son a criminal and the daughters on the street  multiply    this by half a million and you will be beneath the truth  no more dreary spectacle can be found on this earth than the whole of the awful east with its whitechapel hoxton spitalfields bethnal green and wapping to the east india docks  the colour of life is grey and drab  everything is helpless hopeless unrelieved and dirty  bath tubs are a thing totally unknown as mythical as the ambrosia of the gods  the people themselves are dirty while any attempt at cleanliness becomes howling farce when it is not pitiful and tragic  strange vagrant odours come drifting along the greasy wind and the rain when it falls is more like grease than water from heaven  the very cobblestones are scummed with grease  here lives a population as dull and unimaginative as its long grey miles of dingy brick  religion has virtually passed it by and a gross and stupid materialism reigns fatal alike to the things of the spirit and the finer instincts of life  it used to be the proud boast that every englishmans home was his castle  but today it is an anachronism  the ghetto folk have no homes they do not know the significance and the sacredness of home life  even the municipal dwellings where live the betterclass workers are overcrowded barracks  they have no home life  the very language proves it  the father returning from work asks his child in the street where her mother is and back the answer comes in the buildings  a new race has sprung up a street people  they pass their lives at work and in the streets  they have dens and lairs into which to crawl for sleeping purposes and that is all  one cannot travesty the word by calling such dens and lairs homes  the traditional silent and reserved englishman has passed away  the pavement folk are noisy voluble high strung excitablewhen they are yet young  as they grow older they become steeped and stupefied in beer  when they have nothing else to do they ruminate as a cow ruminates  they are to be met with everywhere standing on curbs and corners and staring into vacancy  watch one of them  he will stand there motionless for hours and when you go away you will leave him still staring into vacancy  it is most absorbing  he has no money for beer and his lair is only for sleeping purposes so what else remains for him to do  he has already solved the mysteries of girls love and wifes love and childs love and found them delusions and shams vain and fleeting as dewdrops quickvanishing before the ferocious facts of life  as i say the young are highstrung nervous excitable the middleaged are emptyheaded stolid and stupid  it is absurd to think for an instant that they can compete with the workers of the new world brutalised degraded and dull the ghetto folk will be unable to render efficient service to england in the world struggle for industrial supremacy which economists declare has already begun  neither as workers nor as soldiers can they come up to the mark when england in her need calls upon them her forgotten ones and if england be flung out of the worlds industrial orbit they will perish like flies at the end of summer  or with england critically situated and with them made desperate as wild beasts are made desperate they may become a menace and go swelling down to the west end to return the slumming the west end has done in the east  in which case before rapidfire guns and the modern machinery of warfare they will perish the more swiftly and easily     chapter xxcoffeehouses and dosshouses   another phrase gone glimmering shorn of romance and tradition and all that goes to make phrases worth keeping  for me henceforth coffee house will possess anything but an agreeable connotation  over on the other side of the world the mere mention of the word was sufficient to conjure up whole crowds of its historic frequenters and to send trooping through my imagination endless groups of wits and dandies pamphleteers and bravos and bohemians of grub street  but here on this side of the world alas and alack the very name is a misnomer  coffeehouse a place where people drink coffee  not at all you cannot obtain coffee in such a place for love or money  true you may call for coffee and you will have brought you something in a cup purporting to be coffee and you will taste it and be disillusioned for coffee it certainly is not  and what is true of the coffee is true of the coffeehouse  workingmen in the main frequent these places and greasy dirty places they are without one thing about them to cherish decency in a man or put selfrespect into him  tablecloths and napkins are unknown  a man eats in the midst of the debris left by his predecessor and dribbles his own scraps about him and on the floor  in rush times in such places i have positively waded through the muck and mess that covered the floor and i have managed to eat because i was abominably hungry and capable of eating anything  this seems to be the normal condition of the workingman from the zest with which he addresses himself to the board  eating is a necessity and there are no frills about it  he brings in with him a primitive voraciousness and i am confident carries away with him a fairly healthy appetite  when you see such a man on his way to work in the morning order a pint of tea which is no more tea than it is ambrosia pull a hunk of dry bread from his pocket and wash the one down with the other depend upon it that man has not the right sort of stuff in his belly nor enough of the wrong sort of stuff to fit him for big days work  and further depend upon it he and a thousand of his kind will not turn out the quantity or quality of work that a thousand men will who have eaten heartily of meat and potatoes and drunk coffee that is coffee  as a vagrant in the hobo of a california jail i have been served better food and drink than the london workman receives in his coffeehouses while as an american labourer i have eaten a breakfast for twelvepence such as the british labourer would not dream of eating  of course he will pay only three or four pence for his which is however as much as i paid for i would be earning six shillings to his two or two and a half  on the other hand though and in return i would turn out an amount of work in the course of the day that would put to shame the amount he turned out  so there are two sides to it  the man with the high standard of living will always do more work and better than the man with the low standard of living  there is a comparison which sailormen make between the english and american merchant services  in an english ship they say it is poor grub poor pay and easy work in an american ship good grub good pay and hard work  and this is applicable to the working populations of both countries  the ocean greyhounds have to pay for speed and steam and so does the workman  but if the workman is not able to pay for it he will not have the speed and steam that is all  the proof of it is when the english workman comes to america  he will lay more bricks in new york than he will in london still more bricks in st louis and still more bricks when he gets to san francisco 3  his standard of living has been rising all the time  early in the morning along the streets frequented by workmen on the way to work many women sit on the sidewalk with sacks of bread beside them no end of workmen purchase these and eat them as they walk along  they do not even wash the dry bread down with the tea to be obtained for a penny in the coffeehouses  it is incontestable that a man is not fit to begin his days work on a meal like that and it is equally incontestable that the loss will fall upon his employer and upon the nation  for some time now statesmen have been crying wake up england  it would show more hardheaded common sense if they changed the tune to feed up england  not only is the worker poorly fed but he is filthily fed  i have stood outside a butchershop and watched a horde of speculative housewives turning over the trimmings and scraps and shreds of beef and muttondog meat in the states  i would not vouch for the clean fingers of these housewives no more than i would vouch for the cleanliness of the single rooms in which many of them and their families lived yet they raked and pawed and scraped the mess about in their anxiety to get the worth of their coppers  i kept my eye on one particularly offensivelooking bit of meat and followed it through the clutches of over twenty women till it fell to the lot of a timidappearing little woman whom the butcher bluffed into taking it  all day long this heap of scraps was added to and taken away from the dust and dirt of the street falling upon it flies settling on it and the dirty fingers turning it over and over  the costers wheel loads of specked and decaying fruit around in the barrows all day and very often store it in their one living and sleeping room for the night  there it is exposed to the sickness and disease the effluvia and vile exhalations of overcrowded and rotten life and next day it is carted about again to be sold  the poor worker of the east end never knows what it is to eat good wholesome meat or fruitin fact he rarely eats meat or fruit at all while the skilled workman has nothing to boast of in the way of what he eats  judging from the coffeehouses which is a fair criterion they never know in all their lives what tea coffee or cocoa tastes like  the slops and waterwitcheries of the coffeehouses varying only in sloppiness and witchery never even approximate or suggest what you and i are accustomed to drink as tea and coffee  a little incident comes to me connected with a coffeehouse not far from jubilee street on the mile end road  cawn yer let me ave somethin for this daughter  anythin hi dont mind  hi avent ad a bite the blessed dy an him that fynt      she was an old woman clad in decent black rags and in her hand she held a penny  the one she had addressed as daughter was a careworn woman of forty proprietress and waitress of the house  i waited possibly as anxiously as the old woman to see how the appeal would be received  it was four in the afternoon and she looked faint and sick  the woman hesitated an instant then brought a large plate of stewed lamb and young peas  i was eating a plate of it myself and it is my judgment that the lamb was mutton and that the peas might have been younger without being youthful  however the point is the dish was sold at sixpence and the proprietress gave it for a penny demonstrating anew the old truth that the poor are the most charitable  the old woman profuse in her gratitude took a seat on the other side of the narrow table and ravenously attacked the smoking stew  we ate steadily and silently the pair of us when suddenly explosively and most gleefully she cried out to me  hi sold a box o matches  yus she confirmed if anything with greater and more explosive glee  hi sold a box o matches  thats ow hi got the penny  you must be getting along in years i suggested  seventyfour yesterday she replied and returned with gusto to her plate  blimey id like to do something for the old girl that i would but this is the first ive ad tody the young fellow alongside volunteered to me  an i only ave this because i appened to make an odd shilling washin out lord lumme i dont know ow many pots  no work at my own tryde for six weeks he said further in reply to my questions nothin but odd jobs a blessed long wy between        one meets with all sorts of adventures in coffeehouse and i shall not soon forget a cockney amazon in a place near trafalgar square to whom i tendered a sovereign when paying my score  by the way one is supposed to pay before he begins to eat and if he be poorly dressed he is compelled to pay before he eats  the girl bit the gold piece between her teeth rang it on the counter and then looked me and my rags witheringly up and down  whered you find it she at length demanded  some mug left it on the table when he went out eh dont you think i retorted  wots yer gyme she queried looking me calmly in the eyes  i makes em quoth i  she sniffed superciliously and gave me the change in small silver and i had my revenge by biting and ringing every piece of it  ill give you a hapenny for another lump of sugar in the tea i said  ill see you in ell first came the retort courteous  also she amplified the retort courteous in divers vivid and unprintable ways  i never had much talent for repartee but she knocked silly what little i had and i gulped down my tea a beaten man while she gloated after me even as i passed out to the street  while 300000 people of london live in oneroom tenements and 900000 are illegally and viciously housed 38000 more are registered as living in common lodginghousesknown in the vernacular as dosshouses  there are many kinds of dosshouses but in one thing they are all alike from the filthy little ones to the monster big ones paying five per cent and blatantly lauded by smug middleclass men who know but one thing about them and that one thing is their uninhabitableness  by this i do not mean that the roofs leak or the walls are draughty but what i do mean is that life in them is degrading and unwholesome  the poor mans hotel they are often called but the phrase is caricature  not to possess a room to ones self in which sometimes to sit alone to be forced out of bed willynilly the first thing in the morning to engage and pay anew for a bed each night and never to have any privacy surely is a mode of existence quite different from that of hotel life  this must not be considered a sweeping condemnation of the big private and municipal lodginghouses and workingmens homes  far from it  they have remedied many of the atrocities attendant upon the irresponsible small dosshouses and they give the workman more for his money than he ever received before but that does not make them as habitable or wholesome as the dwellingplace of a man should be who does his work in the world  the little private dosshouses as a rule are unmitigated horrors  i have slept in them and i know but let me pass them by and confine myself to the bigger and better ones  not far from middlesex street whitechapel i entered such a house a place inhabited almost entirely by working men  the entrance was by way of a flight of steps descending from the sidewalk to what was properly the cellar of the building  here were two large and gloomily lighted rooms in which men cooked and ate  i had intended to do some cooking myself but the smell of the place stole away my appetite or rather wrested it from me so i contented myself with watching other men cook and eat  one workman home from work sat down opposite me at the rough wooden table and began his meal  a handful of salt on the not overclean table constituted his butter  into it he dipped his bread mouthful by mouthful and washed it down with tea from a big mug  a piece of fish completed his bill of fare  he ate silently looking neither to right nor left nor across at me  here and there at the various tables other men were eating just as silently  in the whole room there was hardly a note of conversation  a feeling of gloom pervaded the illlighted place many of them sat and brooded over the crumbs of their repast and made me wonder as childe roland wondered what evil they had done that they should be punished so  from the kitchen came the sounds of more genial life and i ventured into the range where the men were cooking  but the smell i had noticed on entering was stronger here and a rising nausea drove me into the street for fresh air  on my return i paid fivepence for a cabin took my receipt for the same in the form of a huge brass check and went upstairs to the smokingroom here a couple of small billiard tables and several checkerboards were being used by young workingmen who waited in relays for their turn at the games while many men were sitting around smoking reading and mending their clothes  the young men were hilarious the old men were gloomy  in fact there were two types of men the cheerful and the sodden or blue and age seemed to determine the classification  but no more than the two cellar rooms did this room convey the remotest suggestion of home  certainly there could be nothing homelike about it to you and me who know what home really is  on the walls were the most preposterous and insulting notices regulating the conduct of the guests and at ten oclock the lights were put out and nothing remained but bed this was gained by descending again to the cellar by surrendering the brass check to a burly doorkeeper and by climbing a long flight of stairs into the upper regions  i went to the top of the building and down again passing several floors filled with sleeping men  the cabins were the best accommodation each cabin allowing space for a tiny bed and room alongside of it in which to undress  the bedding was clean and with neither it nor the bed do i find any fault  but there was no privacy about it no being alone  to get an adequate idea of a floor filled with cabins you have merely to magnify a layer of the pasteboard pigeonholes of an eggcrate till each pigeonhole is seven feet in height and otherwise properly dimensioned then place the magnified layer on the floor of a large barnlike room and there you have it  there are no ceilings to the pigeonholes the walls are thin and the snores from all the sleepers and every move and turn of your nearer neighbours come plainly to your ears  and this cabin is yours only for a little while  in the morning out you go  you cannot put your trunk in it or come and go when you like or lock the door behind you or anything of the sort  in fact there is no door at all only a doorway  if you care to remain a guest in this poor mans hotel you must put up with all this and with prison regulations which impress upon you constantly that you are nobody with little soul of your own and less to say about it  now i contend that the least a man who does his days work should have is a room to himself where he can lock the door and be safe in his possessions where he can sit down and read by a window or look out where he can come and go whenever he wishes where he can accumulate a few personal belongings other than those he carries about with him on his back and in his pockets where he can hang up pictures of his mother sister sweetheart ballet dancers or bulldogs as his heart listethin short one place of his own on the earth of which he can say this is mine my castle the world stops at the threshold here am i lord and master  he will be a better citizen this man and he will do a better days work  i stood on one floor of the poor mans hotel and listened  i went from bed to bed and looked at the sleepers  they were young men from twenty to forty most of them  old men cannot afford the workingmans home they go to the workhouse  but i looked at the young men scores of them and they were not badlooking fellows  their faces were made for womens kisses their necks for womens arms  they were lovable as men are lovable  they were capable of love  a womans touch redeems and softens and they needed such redemption and softening instead of each day growing harsh and harsher  and i wondered where these women were and heard a harlots ginny laugh  leman street waterloo road piccadilly the strand answered me and i knew where they were     chapter xxithe precariousness of life   i was talking with a very vindictive man  in his opinion his wife had wronged him and the law had wronged him  the merits and morals of the case are immaterial  the meat of the matter is that she had obtained a separation and he was compelled to pay ten shillings each week for the support of her and the five children  but look you said he to me wotll appen to er if i dont py up the ten shillings  sposin now just sposin a accident appens to me so i cawnt work  sposin i get a rupture or the rheumatics or the cholera  wots she goin to do eh wots she goin to do  he shook his head sadly  no ope for er  the best she cawn do is the workouse an thats ell  an if she dont go to the workouse itll be a worse ell  come along ith me an ill show you women sleepin in a passage a dozen of em  an ill show you worse wot shell come to if anythin appens to me and the ten shillings  the certitude of this mans forecast is worthy of consideration  he knew conditions sufficiently to know the precariousness of his wifes grasp on food and shelter  for her game was up when his working capacity was impaired or destroyed  and when this state of affairs is looked at in its larger aspect the same will be found true of hundreds of thousands and even millions of men and women living amicably together and cooperating in the pursuit of food and shelter  the figures are appalling 1800000 people in london live on the poverty line and below it and 1000000 live with one weeks wages between them and pauperism  in all england and wales eighteen per cent of the whole population are driven to the parish for relief and in london according to the statistics of the london county council twentyone per cent of the whole population are driven to the parish for relief  between being driven to the parish for relief and being an outandout pauper there is a great difference yet london supports 123000 paupers quite a city of folk in themselves  one in every four in london dies on public charity while 939 out of every 1000 in the united kingdom die in poverty 8000000 simply struggle on the ragged edge of starvation and 20000000 more are not comfortable in the simple and clean sense of the word  it is interesting to go more into detail concerning the london people who die on charity  in 1886 and up to 1893 the percentage of pauperism to population was less in london than in all england but since 1893 and for every succeeding year the percentage of pauperism to population has been greater in london than in all england  yet from the registrargenerals report for 1886 the following figures are taken  out of 81951 deaths in london 1884  in workhouses            9909 in hospitals             6559 in lunatic asylums         278 total in public refuges 16746  commenting on these figures a fabian writer says considering that comparatively few of these are children it is probable that one in every three london adults will be driven into one of these refuges to die and the proportion in the case of the manual labour class must of course be still larger  these figures serve somewhat to indicate the proximity of the average worker to pauperism  various things make pauperism  an advertisement for instance such as this appearing in yesterday mornings paper  clerk wanted with knowledge of shorthand typewriting and invoicing wages ten shillings 250 a week  apply by letter c  and in todays paper i read of a clerk thirtyfive years of age and an inmate of a london workhouse brought before a magistrate for nonperformance of task  he claimed that he had done his various tasks since he had been an inmate but when the master set him to breaking stones his hands blistered and he could not finish the task  he had never been used to an implement heavier than a pen he said  the magistrate sentenced him and his blistered hands to seven days hard labour  old age of course makes pauperism  and then there is the accident the thing happening the death or disablement of the husband father and breadwinner  here is a man with a wife and three children living on the ticklish security of twenty shillings per weekand there are hundreds of thousands of such families in london  perforce to even half exist they must live up to the last penny of it so that a weeks wages one pound is all that stands between this family and pauperism or starvation  the thing happens the father is struck down and what then a mother with three children can do little or nothing  either she must hand her children over to society as juvenile paupers in order to be free to do something adequate for herself or she must go to the sweat shops for work which she can perform in the vile den possible to her reduced income  but with the sweatshops married women who eke out their husbands earnings and single women who have but themselves miserably to support determine the scale of wages  and this scale of wages so determined is so low that the mother and her three children can live only in positive beastliness and semistarvation till decay and death end their suffering  to show that this mother with her three children to support cannot compete in the sweating industries i instance from the current newspapers the two following cases  a father indignantly writes that his daughter and a girl companion receive 85d per gross for making boxes  they made each day four gross their expenses were 8d for car fare 2d for stamps 25d for glue and 1d for string so that all they earned between them was 1s 9d or a daily wage each of 105d  in the second ewe before the luton guardians a few days ago an old woman of seventytwo appeared asking for relief  she was a strawhat maker but had been compelled to give up the work owing to the price she obtained for themnamely 225d each  for that price she had to provide plait trimmings and make and finish the hats  yet this mother and her three children we are considering have done no wrong that they should be so punished  they have not sinned  the thing happened that is all the husband father and breadwinner was struck down  there is no guarding against it  it is fortuitous  a family stands so many chances of escaping the bottom of the abyss and so many chances of falling plump down to it  the chance is reducible to cold pitiless figures and a few of these figures will not be out of place  sir a forwood calculates that  1 of every 1400 workmen is killed annually 1 of every 2500 workmen is totally disabled 1 of every 300 workmen is permanently partially disabled 1 of every 8 workmen is temporarily disabled 3 or 4 weeks  but these are only the accidents of industry  the high mortality of the people who live in the ghetto plays a terrible part  the average age at death among the people of the west end is fiftyfive years the average age at death among the people of the east end is thirty years  that is to say the person in the west end has twice the chance for life that the person has in the east end  talk of war  the mortality in south africa and the philippines fades away to insignificance  here in the heart of peace is where the blood is being shed and here not even the civilised rules of warfare obtain for the women and children and babes in the arms are killed just as ferociously as the men are killed  war  in england every year 500000 men women and children engaged in the various industries are killed and disabled or are injured to disablement by disease  in the west end eighteen per cent of the children die before five years of age in the east end fiftyfive per cent of the children die before five years of age  and there are streets in london where out of every one hundred children born in a year fifty die during the next year and of the fifty that remain twentyfive die before they are five years old slaughter  herod did not do quite so badly  that industry causes greater havoc with human life than battle does no better substantiation can be given than the following extract from a recent report of the liverpool medical officer which is not applicable to liverpool alone     in many instances little if any sunlight could get to the courts and    the atmosphere within the dwellings was always foul owing largely to    the saturated condition of the walls and ceilings which for so many    years had absorbed the exhalations of the occupants into their porous    material  singular testimony to the absence of sunlight in these    courts was furnished by the action of the parks and gardens committee    who desired to brighten the homes of the poorest class by gifts of    growing flowers and windowboxes but these gifts could not be made in    courts such as these as flowers and plants were susceptible to the    unwholesome surroundings and would not live  mr george haw has compiled the following table on the three st georges parishes london parishes                     percentage of                    population      deathrate                    overcrowded      per 1000 st georges

life is indeed precariousfar far more precarious than the hold of the twentiethcentury soldier on life  in the linen trade in the preparation of the flax wet feet and wet clothes cause an unusual amount of bronchitis pneumonia and severe rheumatism while in the carding and spinning departments the fine dust produces lung disease in the majority of cases and the woman who starts carding at seventeen or eighteen begins to break up and go to pieces at thirty  the chemical labourers picked from the strongest and most splendidlybuilt men to be found live on an average less than fortyeight years  says dr arlidge of the potters trade potters dust does not kill suddenly but settles year after year a little more firmly into the lungs until at length a case of plaster is formed  breathing becomes more and more difficult and depressed and finally ceases  steel dust stone dust clay dust alkali dust fluff dust fibre dustall these things kill and they are more deadly than machineguns and pompoms  worst of all is the lead dust in the whitelead trades here is a description of the typical dissolution of a young healthy welldeveloped girl who goes to work in a whitelead factory     here after a varying degree of exposure she becomes anaemic  it may    be that her gums show a very faint blue line or perchance her teeth    and gums are perfectly sound and no blue line is discernible    coincidently with the anaemia she has been getting thinner but so    gradually as scarcely to impress itself upon her or her friends    sickness however ensues and headaches growing in intensity are    developed  these are frequently attended by obscuration of vision or    temporary blindness  such a girl passes into what appears to her    friends and medical adviser as ordinary hysteria  this gradually    deepens without warning until she is suddenly seized with a    convulsion beginning in one half of the face then involving the arm    next the leg of the same side of the body until the convulsion    violent and purely epileptic form in character becomes universal    this is attended by loss of consciousness out of which she passes    into a series of convulsions gradually increasing in severity in one    of which she diesor consciousness partial or perfect is regained    either it may be for a few minutes a few hours or days during    which violent headache is complained of or she is delirious and    excited as in acute mania or dull and sullen as in melancholia and    requires to be roused when she is found wandering and her speech is    somewhat imperfect  without further warning save that the pulse    which has become soft with nearly the normal number of beats all at    once becomes low and hard she is suddenly seized with another    convulsion in which she dies or passes into a state of coma from    which she never rallies  in another case the convulsions will    gradually subside the headache disappears and the patient recovers    only to find that she has completely lost her eyesight a loss that    may be temporary or permanent  and here are a few specific cases of whitelead poisoning     charlotte rafferty a fine wellgrown young woman with a splendid    constitutionwho had never had a days illness in her lifebecame a    whitelead worker  convulsions seized her at the foot of the ladder    in the works  dr oliver examined her found the blue line along her    gums which shows that the system is under the influence of the lead    he knew that the convulsions would shortly return  they did so and    she died     mary ann tolera girl of seventeen who had never had a fit in her    lifethree times became ill and had to leave off work in the    factory  before she was nineteen she showed symptoms of lead    poisoninghad fits frothed at the mouth and died     mary a an unusually vigorous woman was able to work in the lead    factory for twenty years having colic once only during that time    her eight children all died in early infancy from convulsions  one    morning whilst brushing her hair this woman suddenly lost all power    in both her wrists     eliza h aged twentyfive after five months at lead works was    seized with colic  she entered another factory after being refused    by the first one and worked on uninterruptedly for two years  then    the former symptoms returned she was seized with convulsions and    died in two days of acute lead poisoning  mr vaughan nash speaking of the unborn generation says the children of the whitelead worker enter the world as a rule only to die from the convulsions of lead poisoningthey are either born prematurely or die within the first year  and finally let me instance the case of harriet a walker a young girl of seventeen killed while leading a forlorn hope on the industrial battlefield  she was employed as an enamelled ware brusher wherein lead poisoning is encountered  her father and brother were both out of employment  she concealed her illness walked six miles a day to and from work earned her seven or eight shillings per week and died at seventeen  depression in trade also plays an important part in hurling the workers into the abyss  with a weeks wages between a family and pauperism a months enforced idleness means hardship and misery almost indescribable and from the ravages of which the victims do not always recover when work is to be had again  just now the daily papers contain the report of a meeting of the carlisle branch of the dockers union wherein it is stated that many of the men for months past have not averaged a weekly income of more than from four to five shillings  the stagnated state of the shipping industry in the port of london is held accountable for this condition of affairs  to the young workingman or workingwoman or married couple there is no assurance of happy or healthy middle life nor of solvent old age  work as they will they cannot make their future secure  it is all a matter of chance  everything depends upon the thing happening the thing with which they have nothing to do  precaution cannot fend it off nor can wiles evade it  if they remain on the industrial battlefield they must face it and take their chance against heavy odds  of course if they are favourably made and are not tied by kinship duties they may run away from the industrial battlefield  in which event the safest thing the man can do is to join the army and for the woman possibly to become a red cross nurse or go into a nunnery  in either case they must forego home and children and all that makes life worth living and old age other than a nightmare     chapter xxiisuicide   with life so precarious and opportunity for the happiness of life so remote it is inevitable that life shall be cheap and suicide common  so common is it that one cannot pick up a daily paper without running across it while an attemptatsuicide case in a police court excites no more interest than an ordinary drunk and is handled with the same rapidity and unconcern  i remember such a case in the thames police court  i pride myself that i have good eyes and ears and a fair working knowledge of men and things but i confess as i stood in that courtroom that i was half bewildered by the amazing despatch with which drunks disorderlies vagrants brawlers wifebeaters thieves fences gamblers and women of the street went through the machine of justice  the dock stood in the centre of the court where the light is best and into it and out again stepped men women and children in a stream as steady as the stream of sentences which fell from the magistrates lips  i was still pondering over a consumptive fence who had pleaded inability to work and necessity for supporting wife and children and who had received a year at hard labour when a young boy of about twenty appeared in the dock  alfred freeman i caught his name but failed to catch the charge  a stout and motherlylooking woman bobbed up in the witnessbox and began her testimony  wife of the britannia lockkeeper i learned she was  time night a splash she ran to the lock and found the prisoner in the water  i flashed my gaze from her to him  so that was the charge selfmurder he stood there dazed and unheeding his bonny brown hair rumpled down his forehead his face haggard and careworn and boyish still  yes sir the lockkeepers wife was saying  as fast as i pulled to get im out e crawled back  then i called for elp and some workmen appened along and we got im out and turned im over to the constable  the magistrate complimented the woman on her muscular powers and the courtroom laughed but all i could see was a boy on the threshold of life passionately crawling to muddy death and there was no laughter in it  a man was now in the witnessbox testifying to the boys good character and giving extenuating evidence  he was the boys foreman or had been alfred was a good boy but he had had lots of trouble at home money matters  and then his mother was sick  he was given to worrying and he worried over it till he laid himself out and wasnt fit for work  he the foreman for the sake of his own reputation the boys work being bad had been forced to ask him to resign  anything to say the magistrate demanded abruptly  the boy in the dock mumbled something indistinctly  he was still dazed  what does he say constable the magistrate asked impatiently  the stalwart man in blue bent his ear to the prisoners lips and then replied loudly he says hes very sorry your worship  remanded said his worship and the next case was under way the first witness already engaged in taking the oath  the boy dazed and unheeding passed out with the jailer  that was all five minutes from start to finish and two hulking brutes in the dock were trying strenuously to shift the responsibility of the possession of a stolen fishingpole worth probably ten cents  the chief trouble with these poor folk is that they do not know how to commit suicide and usually have to make two or three attempts before they succeed  this very naturally is a horrid nuisance to the constables and magistrates and gives them no end of trouble  sometimes however the magistrates are frankly outspoken about the matter and censure the prisoners for the slackness of their attempts  for instance mr r s chairman of the s b magistrates in the case the other day of ann wood who tried to make away with herself in the canal if you wanted to do it why didnt you do it and get it done with demanded the indignant mr r s  why did you not get under the water and make an end of it instead of giving us all this trouble and bother  poverty misery and fear of the workhouse are the principal causes of suicide among the working classes  ill drown myself before i go into the workhouse said ellen hughes hunt aged fiftytwo  last wednesday they held an inquest on her body at shoreditch  her husband came from the islington workhouse to testify  he had been a cheesemonger but failure in business and poverty had driven him into the workhouse whither his wife had refused to accompany him  she was last seen at one in the morning  three hours later her hat and jacket were found on the towing path by the regents canal and later her body was fished from the water  verdict suicide during temporary insanity  such verdicts are crimes against truth  the law is a lie and through it men lie most shamelessly  for instance a disgraced woman forsaken and spat upon by kith and kin doses herself and her baby with laudanum  the baby dies but she pulls through after a few weeks in hospital is charged with murder convicted and sentenced to ten years penal servitude  recovering the law holds her responsible for her actions yet had she died the same law would have rendered a verdict of temporary insanity  now considering the case of ellen hughes hunt it is as fair and logical to say that her husband was suffering from temporary insanity when he went into the islington workhouse as it is to say that she was suffering from temporary insanity when she went into the regents canal  as to which is the preferable sojourning place is a matter of opinion of intellectual judgment  i for one from what i know of canals and workhouses should choose the canal were i in a similar position  and i make bold to contend that i am no more insane than ellen hughes hunt her husband and the rest of the human herd  man no longer follows instinct with the old natural fidelity  he has developed into a reasoning creature and can intellectually cling to life or discard life just as life happens to promise great pleasure or pain  i dare to assert that ellen hughes hunt defrauded and bilked of all the joys of life which fiftytwo years service in the world has earned with nothing but the horrors of the workhouse before her was very rational and levelheaded when she elected to jump into the canal  and i dare to assert further that the jury had done a wiser thing to bring in a verdict charging society with temporary insanity for allowing ellen hughes hunt to be defrauded and bilked of all the joys of life which fiftytwo years service in the world had earned  temporary insanity  oh these cursed phrases these lies of language under which people with meat in their bellies and whole shirts on their backs shelter themselves and evade the responsibility of their brothers and sisters empty of belly and without whole shirts on their backs  from one issue of the observer an east end paper i quote the following commonplace events     a ships fireman named johnny king was charged with attempting to    commit suicide  on wednesday defendant went to bow police station and    stated that he had swallowed a quantity of phosphor paste as he was    hard up and unable to obtain work  king was taken inside and an    emetic administered when he vomited up a quantity of the poison    defendant now said he was very sorry  although he had sixteen years    good character he was unable to obtain work of any kind  mr    dickinson had defendant put back for the court missionary to see him     timothy warner thirtytwo was remanded for a similar offence  he    jumped off limehouse pier and when rescued said i intended to do    it     a decentlooking young woman named ellen gray was remanded on a    charge of attempting to commit suicide  about halfpast eight on    sunday morning constable 834 k found defendant lying in a doorway in    benworth street and she was in a very drowsy condition  she was    holding an empty bottle in one hand and stated that some two or three    hours previously she had swallowed a quantity of laudanum  as she was    evidently very ill the divisional surgeon was sent for and having    administered some coffee ordered that she was to be kept awake  when    defendant was charged she stated that the reason why she attempted to    take her life was she had neither home nor friends  i do not say that all people who commit suicide are sane no more than i say that all people who do not commit suicide are sane  insecurity of food and shelter by the way is a great cause of insanity among the living  costermongers hawkers and pedlars a class of workers who live from hand to mouth more than those of any other class form the highest percentage of those in the lunatic asylums  among the males each year 269 per 10000 go insane and among the women 369  on the other hand of soldiers who are at least sure of food and shelter 13 per 10000 go insane and of farmers and graziers only 51  so a coster is twice as likely to lose his reason as a soldier and five times as likely as a farmer  misfortune and misery are very potent in turning peoples heads and drive one person to the lunatic asylum and another to the morgue or the gallows  when the thing happens and the father and husband for all of his love for wife and children and his willingness to work can get no work to do it is a simple matter for his reason to totter and the light within his brain go out  and it is especially simple when it is taken into consideration that his body is ravaged by innutrition and disease in addition to his soul being torn by the sight of his suffering wife and little ones  he is a goodlooking man with a mass of black hair dark expressive eyes delicately chiselled nose and chin and wavy fair moustache  this is the reporters description of frank cavilla as he stood in court this dreary month of september dressed in a much worn grey suit and wearing no collar  frank cavilla lived and worked as a house decorator in london  he is described as a good workman a steady fellow and not given to drink while all his neighbours unite in testifying that he was a gentle and affectionate husband and father  his wife hannah cavilla was a big handsome lighthearted woman  she saw to it that his children were sent neat and clean the neighbours all remarked the fact to the childeric road board school  and so with such a man so blessed working steadily and living temperately all went well and the goose hung high  then the thing happened  he worked for a mr beck builder and lived in one of his masters houses in trundley road  mr beck was thrown from his trap and killed  the thing was an unruly horse and as i say it happened  cavilla had to seek fresh employment and find another house  this occurred eighteen months ago  for eighteen months he fought the big fight  he got rooms in a little house in batavia road but could not make both ends meet  steady work could not be obtained  he struggled manfully at casual employment of all sorts his wife and four children starving before his eyes  he starved himself and grew weak and fell ill  this was three months ago and then there was absolutely no food at all  they made no complaint spoke no word but poor folk know  the housewives of batavia road sent them food but so respectable were the cavillas that the food was sent anonymously mysteriously so as not to hurt their pride  the thing had happened  he had fought and starved and suffered for eighteen months  he got up one september morning early  he opened his pocketknife  he cut the throat of his wife hannah cavilla aged thirty three  he cut the throat of his firstborn frank aged twelve  he cut the throat of his son walter aged eight  he cut the throat of his daughter nellie aged four  he cut the throat of his youngestborn ernest aged sixteen months  then he watched beside the dead all day until the evening when the police came and he told them to put a penny in the slot of the gasmeter in order that they might have light to see  frank cavilla stood in court dressed in a much worn grey suit and wearing no collar  he was a goodlooking man with a mass of black hair dark expressive eyes delicately chiselled nose and chin and wavy fair moustache     chapter xxiiithe children      where home is a hovel and dull we grovel    forgetting the world is fair  there is one beautiful sight in the east end and only one and it is the children dancing in the street when the organgrinder goes his round  it is fascinating to watch them the newborn the next generation swaying and stepping with pretty little mimicries and graceful inventions all their own with muscles that move swiftly and easily and bodies that leap airily weaving rhythms never taught in dancing school  i have talked with these children here there and everywhere and they struck me as being bright as other children and in many ways even brighter  they have most active little imaginations  their capacity for projecting themselves into the realm of romance and fantasy is remarkable  a joyous life is romping in their blood  they delight in music and motion and colour and very often they betray a startling beauty of face and form under their filth and rags  but there is a pied piper of london town who steals them all away  they disappear  one never sees them again or anything that suggests them you may look for them in vain amongst the generation of grownups  here you will find stunted forms ugly faces and blunt and stolid minds grace beauty imagination all the resiliency of mind and muscle are gone  sometimes however you may see a woman not necessarily old but twisted and deformed out of all womanhood bloated and drunken lift her draggled skirts and execute a few grotesque and lumbering steps upon the pavement  it is a hint that she was once one of those children who danced to the organgrinder  those grotesque and lumbering steps are all that is left of the promise of childhood  in the befogged recesses of her brain has arisen a fleeting memory that she was once a girl  the crowd closes in  little girls are dancing beside her about her with all the pretty graces she dimly recollects but can no more than parody with her body  then she pants for breath exhausted and stumbles out through the circle  but the little girls dance on  the children of the ghetto possess all the qualities which make for noble manhood and womanhood but the ghetto itself like an infuriated tigress turning on its young turns upon and destroys all these qualities blots out the light and laughter and moulds those it does not kill into sodden and forlorn creatures uncouth degraded and wretched below the beasts of the field  as to the manner in which this is done i have in previous chapters described it at length here let professor huxley describe it in brief  any one who is acquainted with the state of the population of all great industrial centres whether in this or other countries is aware that amidst a large and increasing body of that population there reigns supreme    that condition which the french call la misere a word for which i do not think there is any exact english equivalent  it is a condition in which the food warmth and clothing which are necessary for the mere maintenance of the functions of the body in their normal state cannot be obtained in which men women and children are forced to crowd into dens wherein decency is abolished and the most ordinary conditions of healthful existence are impossible of attainment in which the pleasures within reach are reduced to brutality and drunkenness in which the pains accumulate at compound interest in the shape of starvation disease stunted development and moral degradation in which the prospect of even steady and honest industry is a life of unsuccessful battling with hunger rounded by a paupers grave  in such conditions the outlook for children is hopeless  they die like flies and those that survive survive because they possess excessive vitality and a capacity of adaptation to the degradation with which they are surrounded  they have no home life  in the dens and lairs in which they live they are exposed to all that is obscene and indecent  and as their minds are made rotten so are their bodies made rotten by bad sanitation overcrowding and underfeeding  when a father and mother live with three or four children in a room where the children take turn about in sitting up to drive the rats away from the sleepers when those children never have enough to eat and are preyed upon and made miserable and weak by swarming vermin the sort of men and women the survivors will make can readily be imagined     dull despair and misery    lie about them from their birth    ugly curses uglier mirth    are their earliest lullaby  a man and a woman marry and set up housekeeping in one room  their income does not increase with the years though their family does and the man is exceedingly lucky if he can keep his health and his job  a baby comes and then another  this means that more room should be obtained but these little mouths and bodies mean additional expense and make it absolutely impossible to get more spacious quarters  more babies come  there is not room in which to turn around  the youngsters run the streets and by the time they are twelve or fourteen the roomissue comes to a head and out they go on the streets for good  the boy if he be lucky can manage to make the common lodginghouses and he may have any one of several ends  but the girl of fourteen or fifteen forced in this manner to leave the one room called home and able to earn at the best a paltry five or six shillings per week can have but one end  and the bitter end of that one end is such as that of the woman whose body the police found this morning in a doorway in dorset street whitechapel homeless shelterless sick with no one with her in her last hour she had died in the night of exposure  she was sixtytwo years old and a match vendor  she died as a wild animal dies  fresh in my mind is the picture of a boy in the dock of an east end police court  his head was barely visible above the railing  he was being proved guilty of stealing two shillings from a woman which he had spent not for candy and cakes and a good time but for food  why didnt you ask the woman for food the magistrate demanded in a hurt sort of tone  she would surely have given you something to eat  if i ad arsked er id got locked up for beggin was the boys reply  the magistrate knitted his brows and accepted the rebuke  nobody knew the boy nor his father or mother  he was without beginning or antecedent a waif a stray a young cub seeking his food in the jungle of empire preying upon the weak and being preyed upon by the strong  the people who try to help who gather up the ghetto children and send them away on a days outing to the country believe that not very many children reach the age of ten without having had at least one day there of this a writer says the mental change caused by one day so spent must not be undervalued  whatever the circumstances the children learn the meaning of fields and woods so that descriptions of country scenery in the books they read which before conveyed no impression become now intelligible  one day in the fields and woods if they are lucky enough to be picked up by the people who try to help  and they are being born faster every day than they can be carted off to the fields and woods for the one day in their lives  one day  in all their lives one day  and for the rest of the days as the boy told a certain bishop at ten we ops the wag at thirteen we nicks things an at sixteen we bashes the copper  which is to say at ten they play truant at thirteen steal and at sixteen are sufficiently developed hooligans to smash the policemen  the rev j cartmel robinson tells of a boy and girl of his parish who set out to walk to the forest  they walked and walked through the never ending streets expecting always to see it byandby until they sat down at last faint and despairing and were rescued by a kind woman who brought them back  evidently they had been overlooked by the people who try to help  the same gentleman is authority for the statement that in a street in hoxton a district of the vast east end over seven hundred children between five and thirteen years live in eighty small houses  and he adds it is because london has largely shut her children in a maze of streets and houses and robbed them of their rightful inheritance in sky and field and brook that they grow up to be men and women physically unfit  he tells of a member of his congregation who let a basement room to a married couple  they said they had two children when they got possession it turned out that they had four  after a while a fifth appeared and the landlord gave them notice to quit  they paid no attention to it  then the sanitary inspector who has to wink at the law so often came in and threatened my friend with legal proceedings  he pleaded that he could not get them out  they pleaded that nobody would have them with so many children at a rental within their means which is one of the commonest complaints of the poor bythebye  what was to be done  the landlord was between two millstones  finally he applied to the magistrate who sent up an officer to inquire into the case  since that time about twenty days have elapsed and nothing has yet been done is this a singular case  by no means it is quite common  last week the police raided a disorderly house  in one room were found two young children  they were arrested and charged with being inmates the same as the women had been  their father appeared at the trial  he stated that himself and wife and two older children besides the two in the dock occupied that room he stated also that he occupied it because he could get no other room for the halfcrown a week he paid for it  the magistrate discharged the two juvenile offenders and warned the father that he was bringing his children up unhealthily  but there is no need further to multiply instances  in london the slaughter of the innocents goes on on a scale more stupendous than any before in the history of the world  and equally stupendous is the callousness of the people who believe in christ acknowledge god and go to church regularly on sunday  for the rest of the week they riot about on the rents and profits which come to them from the east end stained with the blood of the children  also at times so peculiarly are they made they will take half a million of these rents and profits and send it away to educate the black boys of the soudan     chapter xxiva vision of the night      all these were years ago little redcoloured pulpy infants capable    of being kneaded baked into any social form you chosecarlyle  late last night i walked along commercial street from spitalfields to whitechapel and still continuing south down leman street to the docks and as i walked i smiled at the east end papers which filled with civic pride boastfully proclaim that there is nothing the matter with the east end as a living place for men and women  it is rather hard to tell a tithe of what i saw  much of it is untenable  but in a general way i may say that i saw a nightmare a fearful slime that quickened the pavement with life a mess of unmentionable obscenity that put into eclipse the nightly horror of piccadilly and the strand  it was a menagerie of garmented bipeds that looked something like humans and more like beasts and to complete the picture brassbuttoned keepers kept order among them when they snarled too fiercely  i was glad the keepers were there for i did not have on my seafaring clothes and i was what is called a mark for the creatures of prey that prowled up and down  at times between keepers these males looked at me sharply hungrily gutterwolves that they were and i was afraid of their hands of their naked hands as one may be afraid of the paws of a gorilla  they reminded me of gorillas  their bodies were small ill shaped and squat  there were no swelling muscles no abundant thews and widespreading shoulders  they exhibited rather an elemental economy of nature such as the cavemen must have exhibited  but there was strength in those meagre bodies the ferocious primordial strength to clutch and gripe and tear and rend  when they spring upon their human prey they are known even to bend the victim backward and double its body till the back is broken  they possess neither conscience nor sentiment and they will kill for a halfsovereign without fear or favour if they are given but half a chance  they are a new species a breed of city savages  the streets and houses alleys and courts are their hunting grounds  as valley and mountain are to the natural savage street and building are valley and mountain to them  the slum is their jungle and they live and prey in the jungle  the dear soft people of the golden theatres and wondermansions of the west end do not see these creatures do not dream that they exist  but they are here alive very much alive in their jungle  and woe the day when england is fighting in her last trench and her ablebodied men are on the firing line  for on that day they will crawl out of their dens and lairs and the people of the west end will see them as the dear soft aristocrats of feudal france saw them and asked one another whence came they  are they men  but they were not the only beasts that ranged the menagerie  they were only here and there lurking in dark courts and passing like grey shadows along the walls but the women from whose rotten loins they spring were everywhere  they whined insolently and in maudlin tones begged me for pennies and worse  they held carouse in every boozing ken slatternly unkempt blearyeyed and towsled leering and gibbering overspilling with foulness and corruption and gone in debauch sprawling across benches and bars unspeakably repulsive fearful to look upon  and there were others strange weird faces and forms and twisted monstrosities that shouldered me on every side inconceivable types of sodden ugliness the wrecks of society the perambulating carcasses the living deathswomen blasted by disease and drink till their shame brought not tuppence in the open mart and men in fantastic rags wrenched by hardship and exposure out of all semblance of men their faces in a perpetual writhe of pain grinning idiotically shambling like apes dying with every step they took and each breath they drew  and there were young girls of eighteen and twenty with trim bodies and faces yet untouched with twist and bloat who had fetched the bottom of the abyss plump in one swift fall  and i remember a lad of fourteen and one of six or seven whitefaced and sickly homeless the pair of them who sat upon the pavement with their backs against a railing and watched it all  the unfit and the unneeded  industry does not clamour for them  there are no jobs going begging through lack of men and women  the dockers crowd at the entrance gate and curse and turn away when the foreman does not give them a call  the engineers who have work pay six shillings a week to their brother engineers who can find nothing to do 514000 textile workers oppose a resolution condemning the employment of children under fifteen  women and plenty to spare are found to toil under the sweatshop masters for tenpence a day of fourteen hours  alfred freeman crawls to muddy death because he loses his job  ellen hughes hunt prefers regents canal to islington workhouse  frank cavilla cuts the throats of his wife and children because he cannot find work enough to give them food and shelter  the unfit and the unneeded  the miserable and despised and forgotten dying in the social shambles  the progeny of prostitutionof the prostitution of men and women and children of flesh and blood and sparkle and spirit in brief the prostitution of labour  if this is the best that civilisation can do for the human then give us howling and naked savagery  far better to be a people of the wilderness and desert of the cave and the squattingplace than to be a people of the machine and the abyss     chapter xxvthe hunger wail   my father has more stamina than i for he is countryborn  the speaker a bright young east ender was lamenting his poor physical development  look at my scrawny arm will you  he pulled up his sleeve  not enough to eat thats whats the matter with it  oh not now  i have what i want to eat these days  but its too late  it cant make up for what i didnt have to eat when i was a kiddy  dad came up to london from the fen country  mother died and there were six of us kiddies and dad living in two small rooms  he had hard times dad did  he might have chucked us but he didnt  he slaved all day and at night he came home and cooked and cared for us  he was father and mother both  he did his best but we didnt have enough to eat  we rarely saw meat and then of the worst  and it is not good for growing kiddies to sit down to a dinner of bread and a bit of cheese and not enough of it  and whats the result  i am undersized and i havent the stamina of my dad  it was starved out of me  in a couple of generations therell be no more of me here in london  yet theres my younger brother hes bigger and better developed  you see dad and we children held together and that accounts for it  but i dont see i objected  i should think under such conditions that the vitality should decrease and the younger children be born weaker and weaker  not when they hold together he replied  whenever you come along in the east end and see a child of from eight to twelve goodsized well developed and healthylooking just you ask and you will find that it is the youngest in the family or at least is one of the younger  the way of it is this the older children starve more than the younger ones  by the time the younger ones come along the older ones are starting to work and there is more money coming in and more food to go around  he pulled down his sleeve a concrete instance of where chronic semistarvation kills not but stunts  his voice was but one among the myriads that raise the cry of the hunger wail in the greatest empire in the world  on any one day over 1000000 people are in receipt of poor law relief in the united kingdom  one in eleven of the whole working class receive poorlaw relief in the course of the year 37500000 people receive less than 12 pounds per month per family and a constant army of 8000000 lives on the border of starvation  a committee of the london county school board makes this declaration at times when there is no special distress 55000 children in a state of hunger which makes it useless to attempt to teach them are in the schools of london alone  the italics are mine  when there is no special distress means good times in england for the people of england have come to look upon starvation and suffering which they call distress as part of the social order  chronic starvation is looked upon as a matter of course  it is only when acute starvation makes its appearance on a large scale that they think something is unusual  i shall never forget the bitter wail of a blind man in a little east end shop at the close of a murky day  he had been the eldest of five children with a mother and no father  being the eldest he had starved and worked as a child to put bread into the mouths of his little brothers and sisters  not once in three months did he ever taste meat  he never knew what it was to have his hunger thoroughly appeased  and he claimed that this chronic starvation of his childhood had robbed him of his sight  to support the claim he quoted from the report of the royal commission on the blind blindness is more prevalent in poor districts and poverty accelerates this dreadful affliction  but he went further this blind man and in his voice was the bitterness of an afflicted man to whom society did not give enough to eat  he was one of an enormous army of blind in london and he said that in the blind homes they did not receive half enough to eat  he gave the diet for a day  breakfast075 pint of skilly and dry bread dinner   3 oz meat             1 slice of bread             05 lb potatoes supper   075 pint of skilly and dry bread  oscar wilde god rest his soul voices the cry of the prison child which in varying degree is the cry of the prison man and woman  the second thing from which a child suffers in prison is hunger  the food that is given to it consists of a piece of usually badbaked prison bread and a tin of water for breakfast at halfpast seven  at twelve oclock it gets dinner composed of a tin of coarse indian meal stirabout skilly and at halfpast five it gets a piece of dry bread and a tin of water for its supper  this diet in the case of a strong grown man is always productive of illness of some kind chiefly of course diarrhoea with its attendant weakness  in fact in a big prison astringent medicines are served out regularly by the warders as a matter of course in the case of a child the child is as a rule incapable of eating the food at all  any one who knows anything about children knows how easily a childs digestion is upset by a fit of crying or trouble and mental distress of any kind  a child who has been crying all day long and perhaps half the night in a lonely dimlit cell and is preyed upon by terror simply cannot eat food of this coarse horrible kind  in the case of the little child to whom warder martin gave the biscuits the child was crying with hunger on tuesday morning and utterly unable to eat the bread and water served to it for its breakfast  martin went out after the breakfasts had been served and bought the few sweet biscuits for the child rather than see it starving  it was a beautiful action on his part and was so recognised by the child who utterly unconscious of the regulations of the prison board told one of the senior wardens how kind this junior warden had been to him  the result was of course a report and a dismissal  robert blatchford compares the workhouse paupers daily diet with the soldiers which when he was a soldier was not considered liberal enough and yet is twice as liberal as the paupers  pauper    diet          soldier 325 oz  meat          12 oz 155 oz  bread         24 oz 6 oz     vegetables     8 oz  the adult male pauper gets meat outside of soup but once a week and the paupers have nearly all that pallid pasty complexion which is the sure mark of starvation  here is a table comparing the workhouse officers weekly allowance  officer    diet          pauper 7 lb      bread         675 lb 5 lb      meat          1 lb 2 oz 12 oz     bacon         25 oz 8 oz      cheese        2 oz 7 lb

officers diet is still more liberal than the paupers but evidently it is not considered liberal enough for a footnote is added to the officers table saying that a cash payment of two shillings and sixpence a week is also made to each resident officer and servant  if the pauper has ample food why does the officer have more  and if the officer has not too much can the pauper be properly fed on less than half the amount  but it is not alone the ghettodweller the prisoner and the pauper that starve  hodge of the country does not know what it is always to have a full belly  in truth it is his empty belly which has driven him to the city in such great numbers  let us investigate the way of living of a labourer from a parish in the bradfield poor law union berks  supposing him to have two children steady work a rentfree cottage and an average weekly wage of thirteen shillings which is equivalent to 325 then here is his weekly budget                                        s  d bread 5

rigid economy  it costs per pauper per week                 s   d men            6    15 women          5    65 children       5    125  if the labourer whose budget has been described should quit his

would require more than a guinea for the workhouse to care for him and his family which he somehow manages to do on thirteen shillings  and in addition it is an understood fact that it is cheaper to cater for a large number of peoplebuying cooking and serving wholesalethan it is to cater for a small number of people say a family  nevertheless at the time this budget was compiled there was in that parish another family not of four but eleven persons who had to live on an income not of thirteen shillings but of twelve shillings per week eleven shillings in winter and which had not a rentfree cottage but a cottage for which it paid three shillings per week  this must be understood and understood clearly whatever is true of london in the way of poverty and degradation is true of all england while paris is not by any means france the city of london is england the frightful conditions which mark london an inferno likewise mark the united kingdom an inferno  the argument that the decentralisation of london would ameliorate conditions is a vain thing and false  if the 6000000 people of london were separated into one hundred cities each with a population of 60000 misery would be decentralised but not diminished  the sum of it would remain as large  in this instance mr b s rowntree by an exhaustive analysis has proved for the country town what mr charles booth has proved for the metropolis that fully onefourth of the dwellers are condemned to a poverty which destroys them physically and spiritually that fully one fourth of the dwellers do not have enough to eat are inadequately clothed sheltered and warmed in a rigorous climate and are doomed to a moral degeneracy which puts them lower than the savage in cleanliness and decency  after listening to the wail of an old irish peasant in kerry robert blatchford asked him what he wanted  the old man leaned upon his spade and looked out across the black peat fields at the lowering skies  what is it that im wantun he said then in a deep plaintive tone he continued more to himself than to me all our brave bhoys and dear gurrls is away an over the says an the agent has taken the pig off me an the wet has spiled the praties an im an owld man an i want the day av judgment  the day of judgment  more than he want it  from all the land rises the hunger wail from ghetto and countryside from prison and casual ward from asylum and workhousethe cry of the people who have not enough to eat  millions of people men women children little babes the blind the deaf the halt the sick vagabonds and toilers prisoners and paupers the people of ireland england scotland wales who have not enough to eat  and this in face of the fact that five men can produce bread for a thousand that one workman can produce cotton cloth for 250 people woollens for 300 and boots and shoes for 1000  it would seem that 40000000 people are keeping a big house and that they are keeping it badly  the income is all right but there is something criminally wrong with the management  and who dares to say that it is not criminally mismanaged this big house when five men can produce bread for a thousand and yet millions have not enough to eat     chapter xxvidrink temperance and thrift   the english working classes may be said to be soaked in beer  they are made dull and sodden by it  their efficiency is sadly impaired and they lose whatever imagination invention and quickness may be theirs by right of race  it may hardly be called an acquired habit for they are accustomed to it from their earliest infancy  children are begotten in drunkenness saturated in drink before they draw their first breath born to the smell and taste of it and brought up in the midst of it  the publichouse is ubiquitous  it flourishes on every corner and between corners and it is frequented almost as much by women as by men children are to be found in it as well waiting till their fathers and mothers are ready to go home sipping from the glasses of their elders listening to the coarse language and degrading conversation catching the contagion of it familiarising themselves with licentiousness and debauchery  mrs grundy rules as supremely over the workers as she does over the bourgeoisie but in the case of the workers the one thing she does not frown upon is the publichouse  no disgrace or shame attaches to it nor to the young woman or girl who makes a practice of entering it  i remember a girl in a coffeehouse saying i never drink spirits when in a publicouse  she was a young and pretty waitress and she was laying down to another waitress her preeminent respectability and discretion  mrs grundy drew the line at spirits but allowed that it was quite proper for a clean young girl to drink beer and to go into a publichouse to drink it  not only is this beer unfit for the people to drink but too often the men and women are unfit to drink it  on the other hand it is their very unfitness that drives them to drink it  illfed suffering from innutrition and the evil effects of overcrowding and squalor their constitutions develop a morbid craving for the drink just as the sickly stomach of the overstrung manchester factory operative hankers after excessive quantities of pickles and similar weird foods  unhealthy working and living engenders unhealthy appetites and desires  man cannot be worked worse than a horse is worked and be housed and fed as a pig is housed and fed and at the same time have clean and wholesome ideals and aspirations  as homelife vanishes the publichouse appears  not only do men and women abnormally crave drink who are overworked exhausted suffering from deranged stomachs and bad sanitation and deadened by the ugliness and monotony of existence but the gregarious men and women who have no homelife flee to the bright and clattering publichouse in a vain attempt to express their gregariousness  and when a family is housed in one small room homelife is impossible  a brief examination of such a dwelling will serve to bring to light one important cause of drunkenness  here the family arises in the morning dresses and makes its toilet father mother sons and daughters and in the same room shoulder to shoulder for the room is small the wife and mother cooks the breakfast  and in the same room heavy and sickening with the exhalations of their packed bodies throughout the night that breakfast is eaten  the father goes to work the elder children go to school or into the street and the mother remains with her crawling toddling youngsters to do her houseworkstill in the same room  here she washes the clothes filling the pent space with soapsuds and the smell of dirty clothes and overhead she hangs the wet linen to dry  here in the evening amid the manifold smells of the day the family goes to its virtuous couch  that is to say as many as possible pile into the one bed if bed they have and the surplus turns in on the floor  and this is the round of their existence month after month year after year for they never get a vacation save when they are evicted when a child dies and some are always bound to die since fiftyfive per cent of the east end children die before they are five years old the body is laid out in the same room  and if they are very poor it is kept for some time until they can bury it  during the day it lies on the bed during the night when the living take the bed the dead occupies the table from which in the morning when the dead is put back into the bed they eat their breakfast  sometimes the body is placed on the shelf which serves as a pantry for their food  only a couple of weeks ago an east end woman was in trouble because in this fashion being unable to bury it she had kept her dead child three weeks  now such a room as i have described is not home but horror and the men and women who flee away from it to the publichouse are to be pitied not blamed  there are 300000 people in london divided into families that live in single rooms while there are 900000 who are illegally housed according to the public health act of 1891a respectable recruitingground for the drink traffic  then there are the insecurity of happiness the precariousness of existence the wellfounded fear of the futurepotent factors in driving people to drink  wretchedness squirms for alleviation and in the public house its pain is eased and forgetfulness is obtained  it is unhealthy certainly it is but everything else about their lives is unhealthy while this brings the oblivion that nothing else in their lives can bring  it even exalts them and makes them feel that they are finer and better though at the same time it drags them down and makes them more beastly than ever  for the unfortunate man or woman it is a race between miseries that ends with death  it is of no avail to preach temperance and teetotalism to these people the drink habit may be the cause of many miseries but it is in turn the effect of other and prior miseries  the temperance advocates may preach their hearts out over the evils of drink but until the evils that cause people to drink are abolished drink and its evils will remain  until the people who try to help realise this their wellintentioned efforts will be futile and they will present a spectacle fit only to set olympus laughing  i have gone through an exhibition of japanese art got up for the poor of whitechapel with the idea of elevating them of begetting in them yearnings for the beautiful and true and good  granting what is not so that the poor folk are thus taught to know and yearn after the beautiful and true and good the foul facts of their existence and the social law that dooms one in three to a publiccharity death demonstrate that this knowledge and yearning will be only so much of an added curse to them  they will have so much more to forget than if they had never known and yearned  did destiny today bind me down to the life of an east end slave for the rest of my years and did destiny grant me but one wish i should ask that i might forget all about the beautiful and true and good that i might forget all i had learned from the open books and forget the people i had known the things i had heard and the lands i had seen  and if destiny didnt grant it i am pretty confident that i should get drunk and forget it as often as possible  these people who try to help  their college settlements missions charities and what not are failures  in the nature of things they cannot but be failures  they are wrongly though sincerely conceived they approach life through a misunderstanding of life these good folk they do not understand the west end yet they come down to the east end as teachers and savants  they do not understand the simple sociology of christ yet they come to the miserable and the despised with the pomp of social redeemers  they have worked faithfully but beyond relieving an infinitesimal fraction of misery and collecting a certain amount of data which might otherwise have been more scientifically and less expensively collected they have achieved nothing  as some one has said they do everything for the poor except get off their backs  the very money they dribble out in their childs schemes has been wrung from the poor  they come from a race of successful and predatory bipeds who stand between the worker and his wages and they try to tell the worker what he shall do with the pitiful balance left to him of what use in the name of god is it to establish nurseries for women workers in which for instance a child is taken while the mother makes violets in islington at three farthings a gross when more children and violetmakers than they can cope with are being born right along  this violetmaker handles each flower four times 576 handlings for three farthings and in the day she handles the flowers 6912 times for a wage of ninepence  she is being robbed  somebody is on her back and a yearning for the beautiful and true and good will not lighten her burden they do nothing for her these dabblers and what they do not do for the mother undoes at night when the child comes home all that they have done for the child in the day  and one and all they join in teaching a fundamental lie  they do not know it is a lie but their ignorance does not make it more of a truth and the lie they preach is thrift  an instant will demonstrate it  in overcrowded london the struggle for a chance to work is keen and because of this struggle wages sink to the lowest means of subsistence to be thrifty means for a worker to spend less than his incomein other words to live on less  this is equivalent to a lowering of the standard of living  in the competition for a chance to work the man with a lower standard of living will underbid the man with a higher standard  and a small group of such thrifty workers in any overcrowded industry will permanently lower the wages of that industry  and the thrifty ones will no longer be thrifty for their income will have been reduced till it balances their expenditure  in short thrift negates thrift  if every worker in england should heed the preachers of thrift and cut expenditure in half the condition of there being more men to work than there is work to do would swiftly cut wages in half  and then none of the workers of england would be thrifty for they would be living up to their diminished incomes  the shortsighted thriftpreachers would naturally be astounded at the outcome  the measure of their failure would be precisely the measure of the success of their propaganda  and anyway it is sheer bosh and nonsense to preach thrift to the 1800000 london workers who are divided into families which have a total income of less than 21s per week one quarter to one half of which must be paid for rent  concerning the futility of the people who try to help i wish to make one notable noble exception namely the dr barnardo homes  dr barnardo is a childcatcher  first he catches them when they are young before they are set hardened in the vicious social mould and then he sends them away to grow up and be formed in another and better social mould  up to date he has sent out of the country 13340 boys most of them to canada and not one in fifty has failed  a splendid record when it is considered that these lads are waifs and strays homeless and parentless jerked out from the very bottom of the abyss and fortynine out of fifty of them made into men  every twentyfour hours in the year dr barnardo snatches nine waifs from the streets so the enormous field he has to work in may be comprehended the people who try to help have something to learn from him  he does not play with palliatives  he traces social viciousness and misery to their sources  he removes the progeny of the gutterfolk from their pestilential environment and gives them a healthy wholesome environment in which to be pressed and prodded and moulded into men  when the people who try to help cease their playing and dabbling with day nurseries and japanese art exhibits and go back and learn their west end and the sociology of christ they will be in better shape to buckle down to the work they ought to be doing in the world  and if they do buckle down to the work they will follow dr barnardos lead only on a scale as large as the nation is large  they wont cram yearnings for the beautiful and true and good down the throat of the woman making violets for three farthings a gross but they will make somebody get off her back and quit cramming himself till like the romans he must go to a bath and sweat it out  and to their consternation they will find that they will have to get off that womans back themselves as well as the backs of a few other women and children they did not dream they were riding upon     chapter xxviithe management   in this final chapter it were well to look at the social abyss in its widest aspect and to put certain questions to civilisation by the answers to which civilisation must stand or fall  for instance has civilisation bettered the lot of man  man i use in its democratic sense meaning the average man  so the question reshapes itself has civilisation bettered the lot of the average man  let us see  in alaska along the banks of the yukon river near its mouth live the innuit folk  they are a very primitive people manifesting but mere glimmering adumbrations of that tremendous artifice civilisation  their capital amounts possibly to 2 pounds per head  they hunt and fish for their food with boneheaded spews and arrows  they never suffer from lack of shelter  their clothes largely made from the skins of animals are warm  they always have fuel for their fires likewise timber for their houses which they build partly underground and in which they lie snugly during the periods of intense cold  in the summer they live in tents open to every breeze and cool  they are healthy and strong and happy  their one problem is food  they have their times of plenty and times of famine  in good times they feast in bad times they die of starvation  but starvation as a chronic condition present with a large number of them all the time is a thing unknown  further they have no debts  in the united kingdom on the rim of the western ocean live the english folk  they are a consummately civilised people  their capital amounts to at least 300 pounds per head  they gain their food not by hunting and fishing but by toil at colossal artifices  for the most part they suffer from lack of shelter  the greater number of them are vilely housed do not have enough fuel to keep them warm and are insufficiently clothed  a constant number never have any houses at all and sleep shelterless under the stars  many are to be found winter and summer shivering on the streets in their rags  they have good times and bad  in good times most of them manage to get enough to eat in bad times they die of starvation  they are dying now they were dying yesterday and last year they will die tomorrow and next year of starvation for they unlike the innuit suffer from a chronic condition of starvation there are 40000000 of the english folk and 939 out of every 1000 of them die in poverty while a constant army of 8000000 struggles on the ragged edge of starvation  further each babe that is born is born in debt to the sum of 22 pounds  this is because of an artifice called the national debt  in a fair comparison of the average innuit and the average englishman it will be seen that life is less rigorous for the innuit that while the innuit suffers only during bad times from starvation the englishman suffers during good times as well that no innuit lacks fuel clothing or housing while the englishman is in perpetual lack of these three essentials  in this connection it is well to instance the judgment of a man such as huxley  from the knowledge gained as a medical officer in the east end of london and as a scientist pursuing investigations among the most elemental savages he concludes were the alternative presented to me i would deliberately prefer the life of the savage to that of those people of christian london  the creature comforts man enjoys are the products of mans labour  since civilisation has failed to give the average englishman food and shelter equal to that enjoyed by the innuit the question arises has civilisation increased the producing power of the average man  if it has not increased mans producing power then civilisation cannot stand  but it will be instantly admitted civilisation has increased mans producing power  five men can produce bread for a thousand  one man can produce cotton cloth for 250 people woollens for 300 and boots and shoes for 1000  yet it has been shown throughout the pages of this book that english folk by the millions do not receive enough food clothes and boots  then arises the third and inexorable question if civilisation has increased the producing power of the average man why has it not bettered the lot of the average man  there can be one answer onlymismanagement  civilisation has made possible all manner of creature comforts and hearts delights  in these the average englishman does not participate  if he shall be forever unable to participate then civilisation falls  there is no reason for the continued existence of an artifice so avowed a failure  but it is impossible that men should have reared this tremendous artifice in vain it stuns the intellect  to acknowledge so crushing a defeat is to give the deathblow to striving and progress  one other alternative and one other only presents itself  civilisation must be compelled to better the lot of the average men  this accepted it becomes at once a question of business management  things profitable must be continued things unprofitable must be eliminated  either the empire is a profit to england or it is a loss  if it is a loss it must be done away with  if it is a profit it must be managed so that the average man comes in for a share of the profit  if the struggle for commercial supremacy is profitable continue it  if it is not if it hurts the worker and makes his lot worse than the lot of a savage then fling foreign markets and industrial empire overboard  for it is a patent fact that if 40000000 people aided by civilisation possess a greater individual producing power than the innuit then those 40000000 people should enjoy more creature comforts and hearts delights than the innuits enjoy  if the 400000 english gentlemen of no occupation according to their own statement in the census of 1881 are unprofitable do away with them set them to work ploughing game preserves and planting potatoes  if they are profitable continue them by all means but let it be seen to that the average englishman shares somewhat in the profits they produce by working at no occupation  in short society must be reorganised and a capable management put at the head  that the present management is incapable there can be no discussion  it has drained the united kingdom of its lifeblood  it has enfeebled the stayathome folk till they are unable longer to struggle in the van of the competing nations  it has built up a west end and an east end as large as the kingdom is large in which one end is riotous and rotten the other end sickly and underfed  a vast empire is foundering on the hands of this incapable management and by empire is meant the political machinery which holds together the englishspeaking people of the world outside of the united states  nor is this charged in a pessimistic spirit  blood empire is greater than political empire and the english of the new world and the antipodes are strong and vigorous as ever  but the political empire under which they are nominally assembled is perishing  the political machine known as the british empire is running down  in the hands of its management it is losing momentum every day  it is inevitable that this management which has grossly and criminally mismanaged shall be swept away  not only has it been wasteful and inefficient but it has misappropriated the funds  every wornout pasty faced pauper every blind man every prison babe every man woman and child whose belly is gnawing with hunger pangs is hungry because the funds have been misappropriated by the management  nor can one member of this managing class plead not guilty before the judgment bar of man  the living in their houses and in their graves the dead are challenged by every babe that dies of innutrition by every girl that flees the sweaters den to the nightly promenade of piccadilly by every workedout toiler that plunges into the canal  the food this managing class eats the wine it drinks the shows it makes and the fine clothes it wears are challenged by eight million mouths which have never had enough to fill them and by twice eight million bodies which have never been sufficiently clothed and housed  there can be no mistake  civilisation has increased mans producing power an hundredfold and through mismanagement the men of civilisation live worse than the beasts and have less to eat and wear and protect them from the elements than the savage innuit in a frigid climate who lives today as he lived in the stone age ten thousand years ago     challenge   i have a vague remembrance    of a story that is told in some ancient spanish legend    or chronicle of old  it was when brave king sanche    was before zamora slain and his great besieging army    lay encamped upon the plain  don diego de ordenez    sallied forth in front of all and shouted loud his challenge    to the warders on the wall  all the people of zamora    both the born and the unborn as traitors did he challenge    with taunting words of scorn  the living in their houses    and in their graves the dead and the waters in their rivers    and their wine and oil and bread  there is a greater army    that besets us round with strife a starving numberless army    at all the gates of life  the povertystricken millions    who challenge our wine and bread and impeach us all as traitors    both the living and the dead  and whenever i sit at the banquet    where the feast and song are high amid the mirth and music    i can hear that fearful cry  and hollow and haggard faces    look into the lighted hall and wasted hands are extended    to catch the crumbs that fall  and within there is light and plenty    and odours fill the air but without there is cold and darkness    and hunger and despair  and there in the camp of famine    in wind and cold and rain christ the great lord of the army    lies dead upon the plain  longfellow     footnotes   1  this in the klondikej l  2  runt in america is the equivalent of the english crowl the dwarf of a litter  3  the san francisco bricklayer
