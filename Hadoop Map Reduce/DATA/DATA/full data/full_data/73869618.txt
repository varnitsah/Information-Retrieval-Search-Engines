about  a wild man in the woods back of oak hall answered roger morr who held a letter in his hand queerest thing you ever heard of  i should say it was if its about a wild man returned dave porter who sent that letter  shadow hamilton  maybe its another one of shadows innumerable yarns suggested dave with a faint smile if he cant tell them by word of mouth he writes them down  what has shadow got to say about the wild man asked phil lawrence looking up from the suitcase he was packing has he been trying to clean out oak hall or anything like that  no not exactly returned roger turning back to the letter which he had not yet finished he keeps in the woods so shadow says and scares everybody who comes that way  how does he scare them asked dave pausing in the act of stowing a suit of clothing in a trunk  shadow writes that he and lazy were out walking one day and the wild man came after them with a big club he wears long hair and a long beard and his clothes are in tatters  what did they do questioned phil  they ran back towards the school the wild man followed em as far as the bridge over the brook and then jumped into the bushes and disappeared  humph muttered phil is that all  oh no the day before that chip macklin and two other of the smaller boys went out along the river and the wild man came after them and shoved chip into the water he yelled to them never to come near him again the other fellows ran away and as soon as chip could get out of the water he went after em then three days later doctor clay sent out mr dale and horsehair the driver to look into the matter and the wild man met them at the bridge and threw mud balls at em one mud ball hit the teacher in the arm and one struck horsehair in the nose and made it bleed horsehair was afraid to go on because the wild man jumped around and shouted so furiously mr dale tried to catch him but he ran away  poor chap he must be crazy was daves comment he ought to be taken care of by the authorities  yes but they cant catch him continued roger they have tried half a dozen ways but he slips em every time  who is he asked dave as he continued to pack his trunk  nobody has the least idea so shadow writes  say that will give us something to dowhen we get back to oak hall cried phil well organize a posse to round up the wild man  i think well have plenty of other things to do when we get to school phil remarked dave just remember that we have lost a lot of time from our lessons and if we want to make up what we have missed and graduate from oak hall with honor weve got to buckle down and study  oh i know that answered phil and gave a little sigh just the same im going to have a try at the wild manif he comes my way  so am i cried roger and dave will try with us wont you old man and roger caught his chum affectionately by the shoulder you are the fellow to solve mysteries  dave was about to answer when there came a knock on the bedroom door he opened it to find himself confronted by a middleaged lady who was smiling but anxious  how are you getting along boys she asked  firstrate mrs wadsworth answered roger well soon be finished now  are the girls getting anxious questioned dave  say what do you think burst out phil we are going back to oak hall to capture a wild man who  phil burst out both dave and roger and the other youth stopped short in confusion  a wild man cried the lady of the house in consternation oh dave i hope  oh dont let him worry you mrs wadsworth responded dave quickly there is a wild man up there but i dont think he will bother us any and weve got too much to do to hunt for him and the lad gave his chum a look that said as plainly as words what did you want to mention it for  ohieri was only fooling stammered phil of course if there is a wild man he wont come near us tell the girls well be ready in five minutesat least i will he added and resumed his packing  can i do anything for you asked the lady  you might try to find my striped cap answered dave i cant seem to locate it  it is in the libraryi saw it a while ago dave  and my baseball batthe new one with the black handle  that is in the back hall in a corner how about your books  ive got all of them send laura with the bat and cap will you please  yes and mrs wadsworth hurried off anxious to be of all the assistance possible  say that was a bad break for me murmured phil as the door closed and before dave or roger could speak i didnt want to worry her dave im sorry i mentioned the wild man  and the man may be caught before we get back to oak hall said roger he crossed the room and peered into a closet has anybody seen my baseball shoes  you left those at the hall roger answered dave  did i all right then i came away in such a hurry i cant remember what i took and what i didnt  i guess weve got about everything now resumed dave looking around the bedroom he glanced at his watch ten minutes to twelve we are to have lunch at a quarter past and start at one sharp  provided the auto is ready interposed phil  it will betrust my uncle dunston for that answered dave my but isnt it jolly to think we are going back to school in the auto instead of by train  yes and to think that the girls and your uncle are going with us added roger  dave look out for roger hes got his eye on laura said phil slyly  oh you give us a rest phil lawrence burst out roger growing red i guess youve got an eye on her yourself  poor me poor me murmured phil as if talking to himself roger will talk to nobody but laura and dave will see and hear and think of nobody but jessie and ill be left in the cold oh what a cruel world this is if onlywow and phils pretended musings came to a sudden end as dave shied a pair of rolledup socks at him and roger followed with a pillow in another instant a mimic battle was on with pillows and various articles of clothing for ammunition then came another knock on the door and laura porter appeared with a baseball bat in one hand and her brothers cap in the other  oh dear me she cried and then stopped short for a red sweater thrown by roger at phil had missed its aim and landed on her head  i beg your pardon laura really i do gasped roger as he sprang forward and took the sweater from its restingplace ii didnt mean that for you  oh roger of course you did cried phil with a twinkle in his eye thats the way he salutes girls always laura  is this the way you are packing up demanded daves sister with a little smile while poor roger grew redder than ever  oh we were only waiting for you to bring my things laura answered her brother coolly well be ready in three minutes and a half by the factory whistles  say what is this i hear about a wild man continued laura as she sat down on a chair roger shoved towards her youve made mrs wadsworth and jessie all excited over it  oh it isnt anything burst out phil quickly i made a mistake even to mention it  she came down and told jessie and me that she was afraid youd have more trouble when you got back to school as if you havent had troubles enough already and laura looked affectionately at her brother and then at his chums  oh this wont amount to anything laura said dave so tell mrs wadsworth and jessie not to worry about it  but i want to know what it means demanded the sister and in the end dave and his chums had to relate what they knew about the wild man as they finished the girl shook her head doubtfully  i dont like that a bit she said i am sure youll get mixed up with that wild man somehow why he might attack you and try to kill you  well be on our guardwhen we go near the woods answered roger  you had better not go alone insisted the girl  we seldom travel alone said her brother generally roger phil and i are together and very often some of the other fellows are with us but dont you worry laura and tell jessie and her mother it will be all right  and there is another thing to be careful about dave went on laura as she prepared to leave  what is that  be careful of how you treat nat poole  why what do you mean cried dave and then he added quickly as he saw that his sister had something on her mind what has happened now  i dont know exactly dave but i got word through ben basswoods cousin that nat had told ben he wasnt going to let you ride over him this term i think nat is jealous because you were so successful in that trip to cave island  did you learn of anything nat intended to do questioned roger curiously  no excepting that he said he wasnt going to play second fiddle to your crowd any longer he tried to get into a quarrel with ben but ben would have nothing to do with him  did nat go back to the hall when it opened asked phil  yes the same day ben went back  i am not afraid of nat poole declared dave stoutly he is a bully always was and i suppose he always will be i tried to do him a favor the last time i saw himbut he doesnt seem to have appreciated it  laura called a musical voice from the stair landing  coming jessie answered laura now you boys hurrylunch will be served in a few minutes and she left the room  so nat poole wants to make more trouble eh mused dave as he resumed packing what a chap he is why cant he be decent and mind his own business  because he isnt that breed thats why answered phil he hates to see another fellow become popular dave you take my advice and watch him when we get back to school  ill do it answered dave thoughtfully     chapter ii  a glimpse at the past   everything ready  yes so far as i know  then we are off goodby everybody  goodby take care of yourself dave  i will  there was a tooting of an automobile horn a chorus of cries and cheers a waving of caps and then the big touring car that had been drawn up in front of the wadsworth mansion rolled from the piazza steps through the spacious grounds and dave porter and his chums were once more on their way to boarding school  to those who have read the previous volumes of this line of stories dave porter will need no special introduction for the benefit of new readers allow me to state that dave was a wideawake american lad now well along in his school years  when a small child our hero had been found one day walking along the railroad tracks near the town of crumville he could tell nothing about himself and as nobody came to claim him he was taken to the local poorhouse where he remained a number of years then he was bound out to a brokendown college professor named caspar potts who was farming for his health the professor did what he could for the lad but soon got into difficulties with a mean moneylender named aaron poole and would have lost his farm had it not been for something out of the ordinary happening  on the outskirts of the town lived a wealthy jewelry manufacturer oliver wadsworth mr wadsworth had a daughter named jessie and one day through an explosion of an automobile tank the little miss was in danger of being burned to death when dave came to her assistance this so pleased the wadsworths that they came not only to the boys aid but also helped caspar potts  the lad shall go to boarding school and get a good education said oliver wadsworth and how dave was sent off has already been related in the first book of this series entitled dave porter at oak hall at the school he made many warm friends including roger morr the son of a united states senator phil lawrence the offspring of a wealthy shipowner buster beggs who was fat as he was jolly and maurice otherwise shadow hamilton who would rather spin yarns than eat he also made some enemies not the least of whom were gus plum a great bully and nat poole son of the moneylender already mentioned plum had since reformed but nat was as overbearing and dictatorial as ever  the great cloud resting over dave in those days was the question of his identity and when some of his enemies spoke of him as that poorhouse nobody he resolved to find out who he really was getting a strange clew he set forth on his travels as described in dave porter in the south seas where he found his uncle dunston porter then he came back to oak hall as told of in dave porters return to school and next went to the land of the midnight sun as set forth in dave porter in the far north where he was gladdened by a longhopedfor meeting with his father  they cant say im a poorhouse nobody now he told himself and went back to oak hall once again as set forth in dave porter and his classmates here he made more friends than ever but he likewise made enemies the most bitter of the latter being one link merwell the son of a ranchowner of the west merwell did his best to get dave into trouble but in the end was exposed and had to leave the school  vacation time was now at hand and through laura porter our heros newlyfound sister dave and his chums were invited to visit some of lauras friends in the far west laura porter and jessie wadsworth went along and what a grand time the young folks had can be realized by reading dave porter at star ranch the boys went hunting and fishing and learned to do some bronchoriding and they likewise fell in with link merwell again and showed that bully up in his true colors  back to the grind now said dave after the vacation was over and back he did go to oak hall as told of in dave porter and his rivals that term was a lively one for some lads came there from another school and they led by nat poole tried to run matters to suit themselves but when the newcomers lost an important football contest oak hall woke up to the true condition of affairs and dave and his chums quickly regained their places on the eleven and then won a grand victory during this time link merwell in company with another bad boy named nick jasniff became a student at rockville military academy a rival institution of learning both bullies did their best to make trouble for our hero but as before he exposed them and this time they had to flee to escape arrest  when the christmas holidays came around dave went back to crumville where he and his family and old caspar potts now lived with the wadsworths at that time mr wadsworth had at his jewelry works some rare diamonds waiting to be reset directly after christmas came a startling robbery the diamonds were gone and it was learned by dave that if they were not recovered not only would mr wadsworth be ruined but that his own father and his uncle would be seriously crippled financially as they had gone on a bond for the return of the gems  at first clews to the robbers were scarce but soon dave made a queer discovery and followed this up by another as set forth in the volume preceding this entitled dave porter on cave island he and his chums became satisfied that link merwell and nick jasniff had committed the theft and they followed the evil pair first to florida and then to cave island so named because of the numerous caverns it contained the evildoers were caught and the diamonds recovered but at the last moment link merwell managed to escape  let him go said dave he acts as if he wanted to turn over a new leaf  i am glad it wasnt jasniff returned phil he is the worse of the pair  right you are agreed roger  the senators son and phil had accompanied dave to crumville and all had received a warm reception at the hands of those who were waiting for them mr wadsworth was delighted to get back the jewels and thanked dave over and over again for what he had done daves father and his uncle were also happy and as for laura she had to hug her brother over and over again jessie wanted to hug him too but her maidenly modesty prevented this but she gave dave a look and a hand squeeze that meant a good deal for our hero was her hero too and always had been  the boys knew they had to go back to oak hall but the older folks had insisted that they rest up a bit after their traveling so they rested by going skating and sleighriding for the last time that season taking the girls along  ive got an idea said daves uncle one morning after the snow had cleared away the roads are so fine just now what is to prevent my taking you to oak hall in the touring car we can make it in a day i think  grand shouted dave  just the thing added phil  couldnt be better supplemented roger  you can ship your baggage on by express went on dunston porter and then well have room enough to take laura and jessie if they want to go along  fine burst out roger so quickly that it made phil wink and then the senators son grew red isnt it all right he demanded  sure thing responded the shipowners son  the matter was talked over and that night it was arranged that the two girls should go along on the trip returning later to crumville with mr porter not to tire laura and jessie too much it was decided to leave after lunch the next day stopping over night at ryeport and finishing the trip to oak hall the morning following  if only the good weather holds out said roger wistfully and then he added suddenly who is going to sit in front with your uncle dave  why you are of course broke in phil with a grin  whyeri stammered the senators son  now phil you know you said youd like that seat broke in dave hes only fooling you roger and then roger looked quite satisfied for it might as well be confessed roger and laura were very friendly and liked greatly to be in each others company the senators son had a manly regard for daves sisterthe same kind of a feeling that our hero had for dear little jessie  the trunks and suitcases had been shipped off and the big sixcylinder cara new machine belonging to the portershad been brought around with dunston porter at the wheel for the old hunter and traveler had taken a strong liking to autoing the girls and boys had piled in after much handshaking and some kisses and now the car was rolling out of the grounds leaving mr and mrs wadsworth daves father and old caspar potts standing on the piazza waving the travelers adieu  take care of yourself my boy shouted mr porter  i will dad called back dave you take it easy till i get back he added for he knew that his parent had been working hard of late  i hate to see dave gohe is so full of life and good cheer murmured mrs wadsworth with a sigh  best lad in the world added her husband  yes yes the very best came in a quavering voice from old caspar potts and the tears stood in his glistening eyes  i trust he comes through this year at oak hall all right resumed mr porter as the automobile having disappeared those left behind reentered the house he wishes to graduate you know  dont you think hell come through asked the manufacturer quickly  im not sure about it he has lost so much timeon that trip he and the others tookyou know  that is true  oh davy will come through never fear cried caspar potts i know the lad if he makes up his mindwell its as good as done and he nodded his whitened head several times to the old college professor who knew him so well there was no youth quite so clever and manly as dave porter  in the meantime the big touring car was leaving crumville rapidly behind on the front seat beside mr porter sat phil waving an oak hall banner and cracking all kinds of jokes in the back were the two girls with dave and roger all were well bundled up for the air though clear was still cold  here is where we make fifty miles an hour cried the shipowners son gayly  oh phil burst out laura fifty miles an hour uncle dunston dont you dare  phil is fooling interrupted her uncle  thats iti made a mistakewe are to go at sixty miles an hour just as soon as we pass the next chicken coop we wont dare do it before for fear of blowing the coop over we  why not make it seventyfive miles while you are at it broke in dave nothing like going the limit and at this there was a general laugh  there is a bad turn ahead said dunston porter a minute later they have torn up part of the road around the hill well have to take it pretty slowly  the touring car crept up the hill past several heaps of dirt and then started to come down on the other side here there was a sharp curve with heavy bushes on both sides mr porter blew the horn loud and long to warn anybody ahead that he was coming  look out yelled phil suddenly but the warning was not necessary for dunston porter saw the danger and so did the others a horse and buggy were just ahead on the tornup highway going in the same direction as themselves the horse was prancing and rearing and the driver was sawing at the lines in an effort to quiet the steed it looked as if there might be a collision     chapter iii  a talk of the future   the girls screamed and the boys uttered various cries and words of advice dave leaned forward to jam on the handbrake but his uncle was ahead of him in the action the footbrake was already down and from the rear wheels came a shrill squeaking as the bands gripped the hubs but the hill was a steep one and the big touring car well laden continued to move downward although but slowly  keep over keep over to the right yelled dunston porter to the driver of the buggy but the man was fully as excited as his horse and he continued to saw on the reins until the turnout occupied the very center of the narrow and tornup highway  it was a time of peril and a man less used to critical moments than dunston porter might have lost his head completely but this old traveler and hunter who had faced grizzly bears in the west and lions in africa managed to keep cool he saw a chance to pass on the right of the turnout ahead and like a flash he let go on the two brakes and turned on a little power forward bounded the big car the right wheels on the very edge of a watergully the left mudguards scraped the buggy and the man driving it uttered a yell of fright then the touring car went on to come to a halt at the bottom of the hill a short distance away  hello exclaimed dave as he looked back at the turnout that had caused the trouble its mr poole  you mean nats father queried phil  yes  hi you what do you mean by running into me stormed the moneylender savagely as he presently managed to get his steed under control and came down beside the touring car  what do you mean by blocking the road mr poole returned dunston porter coldly  i didnt block the road  you certainly did if we had run into you it would have been your fault  nonsense you passed me on the wrong side  because you didnt give me room to pass on the other side  and your horn scared my horse  i dont see how that is my fault your horse ought to be used to autohorns by this time  youve scraped all the paint off my carriage and i had it painted only last week went on the moneylender warming up its an outrage how you auto fellows think you own the whole road  i wont discuss the matter now mr poole answered dunston porter stiffly i think it was your fault entirely but if you think otherwise come and see me when i get back from this trip which will be in four days and without waiting for more words daves uncle started up the touring car and aaron poole was soon left far behind  if he isnt a peach murmured roger slangily its easy to see where nat gets his meanness from he is simply a chip off the old block  hes a pretty big chip returned phil dryly  i dont see how he can blame us said dave we simply couldnt pass him on the left if we had tried wed have gone in the ditch sure and the scraping we did to his buggy amounts to next to nothing  i am not afraid of what hell do said dunston porter a couple of dollars will fix up those scratches and if he is so closefisted ill foot the bill but ill give him a piece of my mind for blocking the road  but his horse was frightened uncle dunston said laura  a little yes but if poole hadnt got scared himself he might have drawn closer to the side of the road i think he was more frightened than the horse  he certainly was declared phil when we scraped the buggy his face got as white as chalk and he almost dropped the lines  hell hate all of us worse than ever for this was daves comment  i am not afraid of him answered the uncle  on and on sped the big touring car and soon the stirring incident on the road was for the time being forgotten crumville had been left far behind and now they passed through one pretty village after another on the broad level stretches dunston porter allowed the boys to spell him at the wheel for each knew how to run an automobile  twenty miles more to ryeport cried dave as they came to a crossroads and read a signboard  and its just halfpast five added the senators son consulting his watch well get there in plenty of time to wash up and have a fine dinner  and say maybe we wont do a thing to that table murmured phil smacking his lips  oh you boys are always hungry was jessies comment  well you know weve got to grow answered phil with a grin  i think ill enjoy eating after such a long ride said laura the fresh air certainly does give one an appetite  i think ill order bread and milk for all hands remarked dunston porter with a sly smile  bread and milk murmured jessie in dismay  sure its famous for your complexion  a juicy steak for mine cried dave steak and vegetables and salad and pudding or pie  well i guess that will do for me too said his uncle simply you see i suppose ill have to eat to keep you company and he smiled again  uncle dunston what a tease you are murmured laura your appetite is just as good as that of any of the boys  dave was at the wheel and he sent the touring car along the smooth highway at a speed of twenty miles an hour he would have liked to drive faster but his uncle would not permit this  the law says twenty miles an hour and i believe in obeying the law said dunston porter besides you can never tell what may happen and it is best to have your car under control  the truth of the latter remark was demonstrated less than five minutes later when they came to another crossroads without warning of any kind a racing car came rushing swiftly from one direction and a coach from the other dave could not cross ahead of the racing car and the approach of the coach from the opposite direction cut him off from turning with the car so all that was left to do was to jam on both brakes which he did and then as the racing car shot past he released the wheels and went on just ahead of the coach but it was a narrow escape all around and the girls and roger leaped to their feet in alarm  phew see them streak along was phils comment gazing after the racing car which was fast disappearing in a cloud of dust  they ought to be arrested was lauras comment why we might have been smashed up  good work davy cried dunston porter you did just the right thing  even if that coach driver is shaking his fist at us eh answered dave and he bobbed his head in the direction of the coach which had hauled up but was now going on  if you had been going a little faster it would have been all up with us said phil with a grave shake of his head  let me take the wheel now said dunston porter quietly and dave slid out of the drivingseat willingly enough for the excitement had left him somewhat limp  halfpast six found them in ryeport and a few minutes later they rolled up to the national hotel and the girls and boys got out while mr porter took the car around to the garage they had sent word ahead for rooms and all soon felt at home the girls had a fine apartment on the second floor front with dunston porter next to them and the three boys in a big room across the hallway  when the young people assembled in the diningroom after brushing and washing up a surprise awaited them they had a table to themselves ordered by dunston porter and decorated with a big bouquet of roses and carnations a full course dinner was served  oh this is lovely cried jessie as she caught sight of the flowers  just grand uncle dunston added laura and then she added in a lower voice if there wasnt such a crowd id give you a big hug for this  and so would i added jessie  all right thats one you owe me girls remember that answered the old hunter and traveler  they spent over an hour at the table enjoying the bountiful spread provided and telling stories and jokes the boys were in their element and kept the girls laughing almost constantly  well be back to the grind day after tomorrow so we had better make the best of it was the way dave expressed himself  after the meal dunston porter went out to give directions concerning the touring car and phil accompanied him this left our hero and roger alone with the two girls they sought out the hotel parlor which they found deserted and dave and jessie walked to the far end where there was an alcove while roger and laura went to the piano  dave wont it be hard work to go back to the grind as you call it questioned jessie as both stood looking out of the window  in a way yes but its what a fellow has got to expect jessie he returned a chap cant get an education without working for it  i trust you pass with high honors the girl went on with a hopeful look into his face  ill try my best of course ive lost some timegoing to cave island and all that maybe ill flunk  oh dave that would bebe jessie could not go on  as soon as i get back im going to buckle down and get to be a regular greasy grind as they call em ive made up my mind to one thing im afraid the others wont like  whats that  im going to cut the baseball nine if i can it takes too much time from our studies  wont that be easy  i dont know i made quite a record you know maybe the crowd will insist on it that i play of course i dont want to see oak hall lose any games but i guess theyll have players enoughwith all the new students coming in  and if you do graduate dave what then asked jessie after a pause this question had been on her mind a long time but she had hesitated about asking it  to tell the honest truth jessie i dont know answered dave very slowly ive thought and thought but i cant seem to hit the right thing your father and professor potts seem to think i ought to go to college and i rather incline that way myself but then i think of going to some technical institution and of taking up civil engineering or mining or something like that uncle dunston knew a young fellow who became a civil engineer and went to south america and laid out a railroad across the andes mountains and he knew another young fellow who took up mining and made a big thing of a mine in montana that sort of thing appeals to me and it appeals to dad too  but it would take you so far from home dave and jessie caught hold of his arm as she spoke as if afraid he was going to leave that minute  i know it buterbutwould you care jessie he stammered  care of course id care she replied and suddenly began to blush wed all care  but would you care very much he insisted lowering his voice because if you would id tell you something  what would you tell me she asked  the young fellow who went to south america as a civil engineer took his wife with him  oh dave and for the moment jessie turned her head away  if i went so far off id want somebody with me jessie a fellow would be awfully lonely otherwise  ii suppose that would be so  if you thought enough of a fellow would you go to south america or montana or africa with him and dave looked jessie full in the face  id go to the end of the world with him she answered with sudden boldness  then mr porter and phil came back and the conversation became general     chapter iv  mr job haskerss doings   and now for oak hall  it was dave who uttered the words the next morning after a good nights rest and an early breakfast the big touring car had been brought around by dunston porter and the young folks had climbed in and stowed away the limited baggage they carried all felt in excellent spirits and dave was particularly gay what jessie had said the evening before and the way she had said it still hung in his mind she was a splendid girl and if it was in him to do it he was going to make himself worthy of her he was still young so he did not dwell long over these things but his regard for her was entirely proper and likely to make him do his best in his endeavors  phil had asked for permission to run the car for a while and took the wheel as soon as ryeport was left behind the shipowners son knew how to handle an automobile almost as well as any of them but he had one fault which was that he did not steer out of the way of sharp stones and like things calculated to bring on punctures and blowouts  my what a glorious morning exclaimed laura as they bowled along over the smooth roads  couldnt be better answered roger wish we were going on all day he added  so do i added dave they expected to reach oakdale by noon get dinner there and then run up to the school  not too fast phil warned mr porter as the shipowners son let her out a bit as he expressed it you dont know what sort of a road youve got beyond the turn  well soon be coming to some roads we know answered phil those we used to travel on our bicycles  they passed through several towns and villages then they reached a crossroads and here some men and a steam roller were at work and the road was closed one of the workmen motioned for them to take the road on the left  must be a road around said dunston porter it doesnt look very good but you can try it shall i take the wheel  oh i can run the car easily enough answered phil  for half a mile they went on without trouble through a rolling country where the scenery was very fine then they reached a point where the road was full of loose stones  be careful cried mr porter  they rolled on past a pretty farmhouse and some barns they were just on the point of making another turn when there came a sudden bang from under the car and the turnout swayed to one side of the road phil threw out the clutch and put on the brakes and they came to a standstill then the driver shut off the engine  what is the matter queried jessie  a blowout i guess answered dave well soon see  dunston porter and the boys got down to the ground and made an examination the shoe of the rear left wheel had been badly cut by the sharp stones and the inner tube had been blown out through the cut  well have to put on one of the other shoes said mr porter they carried two with them besides half a dozen inner tubes  all right here is where we get to work cried dave somebody time us please and he started in by getting off his coat and cuffs and donning a working jumper his uncle quickly followed suit while phil and roger got out the liftingjack and some tools  the girls stood watching the proceedings for a while and then strolled back towards the farmhouse the boys and mr porter became so engrossed in putting on a new inner tube and a shoe that they did not notice their absence the new shoe fitted the rim of the wheel rather tightly and they had all they could do to get it into place  phew this is work and no mistake murmured roger i wonder why they cant get tires that wont blow out or go down  maybe some day they will have them answered dunston porter  i reckon this is all my fault put in phil ruefully i must have gone over some extra sharp stone and it cut like a knife  oh such accidents are liable to happen to anybody answered dave he looked at his watch twentyfive minutes and we havent blown it up yet no record job this time  thank fortune weve got a patent pump to do the pumping for us remarked his uncle pumping tires by hand he found a very disagreeable task  at last the shoe and tube were in place and the pump was set in motion dave watched the gauge and when it was high enough he shut off the air the tools were put away and they were ready to go on again  the girls went back to that farmhouse said the senators son pointing to a small cottage  let us run back and pick them up and wash our hands at the well  once in front of the house dunston porter who was at the wheel sounded the horn at the same time the boys made for the well which stood between the house and one of the barns  maybe the girls went inside remarked dave as he looked in vain for them  must be somewhere around returned phil  all washed up using soap and towels carried in the car then dave went to the door of the farmhouse and knocked in answer to the summons laura appeared  oh dave come in she cried i want you to meet the lady here  wondering what his sister wanted our hero stepped into the sittingroom which was small and plainly but neatly furnished in a rockingchair sat an elderly woman pale and careworn  mrs breen this is my brother said laura and these are his school chums she added nodding towards phil and roger  how do you do boys said the woman in a thin trembling voice  we just told her we were bound for oak hall said jessie who was also present and she says she knows somebody there  she knows mr job haskers finished laura  mr haskers repeated dave mentioning the name of one of the teachersa dictatorial individual nobody liked and who was allowed to keep his position mainly because of his abilities as an instructor the chums had had more than one dispute with job haskers and all wished that he would leave the school  yes yes i know him answered mrs breen nodding her head gravely and thoughtfully he is a great scholara very great scholar and she nodded again she was not well and her mind did not appear to be overly bright she lived alone in the cottage a neighboring farmer taking care of her few acres of ground for her  dave come here whispered laura and led her brother to a corner of the room mrs breen tells me that mr haskers owes her moneythat he used to board with her and that he borrowed someand she says he writes that he cant pay her because he gets so little salary and that sometimes he has to wait a long while himself  how much is it asked dave with interest he remembered how closefisted job haskers had been on more than one occasion  nearly two hundred dollars so she says  he ought to be able to pay that laura i think he gets a fair salaryin fact i am sure of itand i am also pretty sure that doctor clay doesnt keep him waiting for his money  it is too bad she looks so helpless and so much in need murmured the girl  ill find out about this answered dave  he sat down as did the others and soon had the elderly lady telling her story in detail it was not very long job haskers had boarded with her one summer just before obtaining his position at oak hall and he owed her sixty dollars for this during the time he had spent with her he had spoken of a schoolbook he was going to publish that would bring him in much money and she had loaned him a hundred and twentyfive dollars for this but she had never seen the schoolbook nor had he ever paid back a cent his plea when she had written to him had been that his pay was poor and that he had to wait a long time to get money and that his publishers had not yet gotten around to selling his book  i never heard of any book he got out said roger and i think i would hear if there was such a book  thats so added phil old haskers would be so proud of it he would want everybody to know  it is certainly a shame he doesnt pay this lady if he has the money was dunston porters comment did he give you a note he asked of mrs breen  he wrote out some kind of a paper and was going to give it to me but i never got it  hes a swindler thats what he is murmured phil wrathfully  it looks that way answered dave in an equally low tone  he knows this lady is next to helpless and he intends to do her out of the money  he ought to be sued exclaimed roger  you have no note or other writing about the money questioned mr porter  i have his letters answered the elderly lady they are in the bureau yonder and she pointed to an ancient chest of drawers  shall i get them asked jessie for she saw that it was a task for the old lady to move around  if you will my dear i am so stiff it is hard to get up  both girls went to the chest of drawers and brought out a small box of letters mrs breen put on her glasses and fumbled them over and brought forth three communications which were as the boys recognized in job haskerss wellknown jerky handwriting she passed them over to be read and all present perused them with interest  the contents however were disappointing especially to the boys and dunston porter who had hoped to find something by which legally to hold the schoolteacher not once did job haskers mention that he owed mrs breen any money he simply stated that he regretted he could do nothing for her that times were hard and that his income was limited and hard to get he said as little as possible and the tone of the communications showed that he hoped he would hear no more from the old lady who had done what she could to aid him  i think this is the limit said dave to his uncle dont you think he ought to be sued  i dont know about suing him dave but i think this ought to be put in a lawyers hands  he makes money enough to pay this lady said phil say ive a good mind to give him a piece of my mind he added hotly  ill look into this when i come back this way said dunston porter after a little more talk perhaps i can get one of our lawyers to prod this haskers a little and also state the case to doctor clay  oh will you do that uncle dunston cried laura brightening for she as well as all of the others felt sorry for mrs breen who seemed so poor old and lonesome  yes ill do it and now we had better be on our wayif we want to reach oakdale by noon went on mr porter  the boys went out followed by jessie laura lingered to whisper something in her uncles ear dunston porter nodded and then laura joined the others  mrs breen i will be back in a day or two to see you about this money affair said mr porter when he and the old lady were alone in the meantime as you were so kind as to take the young ladies in while we were mending our machine allow me to make you a little present and as he finished he placed a fivedollar bill in her lap  oh she cried taking up the banknote why its five dollars ii cant really take all that money  oh yes you can said mr porter smiling use it as you see fit and remember that ill be back and well do what we can to get that money from mr haskers  you are very very kind murmured the old lady and tears stood in her eyes the past winter had been a severe one for her and she had had a hard struggle to get along  goodby shouted the girls and boys to her and she waved her hand to them then the automobile started off once more in the direction of oakdale     chapter v  at oak hall once more   hurrah here we are at oakdale at last  old town looks natural doesnt it  so it does roger see any of the fellows  not yet dave but we are sure to meet somebody even if it is a schoolday went on the senators son  uncle dunston let me take the auto around to the hotel said our hero i know the streets better than you do we have to make several turns  all right dave was the ready answer and dunston porter arose and allowed his nephew to crowd into the drivers seat  the run to the town in the vicinity of which oak hall was located had been made without further incident on the way the party had talked over mrs breens affairs and dunston porter had promised to take the matter up through his lawyer  i think it best that our names dont appear in the case said he otherwise mr haskers might not treat you so well during the term  he never treats us well anyway grumbled phil but you are right dont mention our names  on this late winter day the town looked rather dreary but the young folks were in high spirits and dave with a grand flourish ran the car up to one of the best hotels the place afforded as before word had been sent ahead that they were coming and the host of the resort came out to meet them  well have dinner ready inside of quarter of an hour he said come in and make yourselves at home  the repast was fully as good as the dinner served at ryeport and everybody enjoyed it greatly  and now for the hall cried dave  glad to leave us asked jessie halfreproachfully  you know better than to ask such a question he replied but if we have got to get back to the grind why we might as well do it  and im a bit anxious to see how the old place looks added the senators son  dave you can run the car to the hall if you wish said mr porter feeling sure the youth would like to do that very thing  all right  the touring automobile was brought around and they were just getting in when there came a sudden hail from across the way  hello there everybody  its dave porter and roger and phil said somebody else  why how are you shadow cried our hero and how are you buster he added as maurice hamilton and buster beggs came across the road to greet them  fine puffed buster who was very fat and jolly only shadow has been walking the feet off of me and then the stout youth shook hands all around  now just to hear that cried shadow as he too shook hands why all we did was to walk from the hall to here  and up one street and down another for half an hour burst in buster  say that puts me in mind of a story cried shadow who was noted for his yarnspinning weakness once two men started to walk  stow it came from three of the other lads in concert  its too early yet to tell stories shadow said dave with a smile you can tell them tonight tell us now is there anything new at the hall  there sure is  what asked phil and roger  the wild man  oh has he turned up again asked the girls with interest  twiceyesterday morning and this morning said buster  he didnt turn up at all buster interposed shadow when you start to tell a story why dont you tell it straight  oh you tell it grumbled the fat boy you have that sort of thing down to a science  there isnt very much to tell went on shadow hamilton he left his mark thats all  left his mark queried dave  thats itwide blue marks he must have about a ton of blue chalk  say shadow you are talking in riddles burst out the shipowners son give it to us in plain united states cant you  sure i can well this wild man visited the school yesterday morning and this morning before anybody was up the first time he went into the big classroom and took some books and the next time he visited the kitchen and pantry and took some grubi beg the ladies pardoni should have said fooda ham a chicken and some doughnuts  and the blue chalk queried mr porter  i was coming to that in the classroom he left his marka big circle with a cross inside in blue chalk  and how do you know that is the mark of the wild man asked laura  oh we found that out some time ago answered shadow he seems to have a mania for blue chalk and even puts it on his face sometimes and he chalks down that circle with the cross wherever he goes  then if he does that why cant they trail him down asked dave  because he is like a fleawhen you try to put your hands on him he isnt there answered shadow and say that puts me in mind of another story once three boys were  that will do shadow cried roger about the wild man is enough for the present  have they any idea who he is asked dunston porter  not the slightest answered buster and they dont know where he keeps himself although it must be in the woods near the school  oh dave i hope he doesnt harm anybody cried jessie with a shiver  are you boys ready to go back to the hall asked dunston porter  i am responded buster readily  so am i added the storyteller of the school  then well take you along provided you dont mind being crowded  we wont mind if the young ladies wont returned the fat youth  oh come in by all means cried laura  well make room somehow added jessie  a minute later the big car started on the way to oak hall with dave at the wheel and his uncle beside him  looks familiar doesnt it called out roger as they spun along the turnpike  it certainly does answered roger and then he added what do you say to the old school song  fine came back the answer and then the senators son commenced a song they all knew well which was sung to the tune of auld lang syne the girls knew the song too and readily joined in                oak hall we never shall forget                   no matter where we roam               it is the very best of schools                   to us its just like home               then give three cheers and let them ring                   throughout this world so wide               to let the people know that we                   elect to here abide  loud and clear over the cool air sounded the song and it was sung several times then just as the car rolled into the grounds of the school the boys gave one of the hall yells and dave honked the horn of the automobile loud and long  hello its the porter crowd  welcome to our city  how about cave island dave did you bring it with you  heard you caught jasniff and merwell roger good for you  say phil youre as sunburnt as if youd been to the seashore for a summer  so the talk ran on as half a dozen students flocked up to the car the afternoon session was over and despite the chilliness many lads were out on the campus many knew the girlshaving met them at some athletic games and at a commencementand those that did not were glad of a chance for an introduction  i am real glad to see you back boys said doctor hasmer clay the head of the institution as he appeared and shook hands glad to see you mr porter and also the young ladies he added so you came all the way by automobile eh it must have been a delightful trip  it was answered daves uncle  all went inside and the visitors were permitted to accompany dave and his chums to their dormitory the boys baggage had already arrived so it did not take the lads long to settle down  and now well have to start back said dunston porter a little later dave take good care of yourself and make a good record  ill do my best uncle dunston  and dont let that wild man get you added jessie as she took his hand and allowed him to hold her own perhaps longer than was necessary  and dont forget to write put in his sister  oh ill not forget that answered dave with a smile both to his sister and to the girl whom he regarded so warmly  it was a trying momentthis partingbut it was soon over and with dunston porter at the wheel and the girls and boys waving their hands the touring car left the oak hall grounds on its return journey to crumville  well here we are as the pug dog said to the lookingglass when he walked behind it to look for himself remarked phil dropping into a chair  i suppose it will take us a few days to get settled down answered dave resting on the top of a table i dont feel much like unpacking yet do you  no let us wait until tonight or tomorrow returned roger dropping on one of the beds he was still thinking of how clear and deep lauras eyes had appeared when she had said goodby to him  i really hope you will not be homesick said a girlish voice and bertram vane one of the students appeared from the next room and sat down on a chair homesickness is such an awfully cruel thing dont you know  no homesickness here polly answered dave i guess we are just tired out thats all weve done a lot of traveling since we left oak hall  so i understand wasnt it dreadful that jasniff and merwell should prove such villains went on the girlish student werent you really afraid toerto touch them  not much cried phil i am only sorry merwell got away  but you got the diamonds i heard put in sam day who was another of the chums  we did  at that moment came musical sounds from another room near bythe sounds of somebody strumming on a guitar  hello theres luke watson cried roger hi come in with that guitar and give us a tune luke he called out  thought i might cheer you up said luke appearing how would you like me to play the girl i left behind me or something like that  make it oh those eyes so tender suggested buster  or else that beautiful ditty called he loved but had to leave her suggested shadow say that puts me in mind of a story he went on this is true too though you may not believe it a young man went to call on his best girl and took a bouquet of flowers along the bouquet was done up in several thicknesses of tissue paper some of his friends who were jokers got hold of that bouquet and fixed it up for him he gave it to the girl and when she took off the tissue paper what do you suppose she found a bunch of celery and some soup greens he was so fussed up he didnt know what to say and he got out in a hurry  hurrah for the chaps who fixed up the bouquet cried phil but start up luke something in which we can all join  but not too loud cautioned roger old haskers might not like  oh hang old haskers interrupted phil he cant  shsh came from dave suddenly and silence fell on the group of boys all turned towards the doorway leading to the hall there on the threshold stood the instructor just mentioned mr job haskers     chapter vi  phil shows his stubbornness   not one of the boys knew how to act or what to say all wondered if job haskers had heard his name mentioned  if the illnatured instructor had heard he made no mention of it he looked sharply about the apartment and waved his hand to luke  watson how many times have i told you that you make too much noise with your musical instruments he said harshly you disturb the students who wish to study  i thought this was the recreation hour mr haskers answered the lad who loved to play the guitar and banjo  true but i think we get altogether too much of your music growled the instructor he turned to dave roger and phil so you are back at last it is high time if you wish to go on with your regular classes  we told doctor clay that we would make up what we have missed mr haskers answered dave in a gentle tone for he knew how easy it was to start a quarrel with the man before him as phil had once said job haskers was always walking around with a chip on his shoulder  and how soon will you make up the lessons in my class demanded the instructor  i think i can do it inside of ten days or two weeks  that wont suit me porter youll have to do better ill give each of you just a weekone week understand if you cant make the lessons up in that time ill have to drop you to the next lower class  oh mr haskers burst out roger he knew what that meant only too well they would not have a chance to graduate that coming june  ill not argue the point morr ill give you a week starting tomorrow when you come to the classroom i will show you just what you have to make up job haskers looked around the room now then remember i want less noise here and so speaking he turned on his heel and walked away  for a moment there was silence as the boys looked at each other and listened to the sounds of mr haskerss retreating footsteps then phil made a face and punched one of the bed pillows savagely  now wouldnt that make a saint turn in his grave he remarked isnt he the real kind generous soul  he ought to be ducked in the river was busters comment why how can anybody make up the lessons youve missed in a week its absurd say do you know what id do if i were you id complain to the doctor  so would i added sam day two weeks would be short enough  ill not complain to the doctor returned phil but i know what i will do he added quickly as though struck by a sudden idea  what came from several  never mind what but ill wager hell give us more time  i guess i know what you think of doing said dave but take my advice and dont phil  humph ill see about it dave he isnt going to run such a thing as this up my back without a kick grumbled the shipowners son  well wait first and see if he doesnt change his mind or if we cant get through in the week cautioned dave  what was phil going to do questioned luke strumming lowly over the strings of his guitar  oh dont lets talk about it cried dave before roger could speak he did not wish the mrs breen affair to become public property tell us about the wild man and all the other things that have happened here since we went away  and you tell us all about cave island and those stolen jewels said buster  thereafter the conversation became general dave and his chums telling of their quest of the carwith diamonds and the other students relating the particulars of a feast they had had in one of the dormitories and of various efforts made to catch the socalled wild man  i dont believe he is what one would call a wild man said ben basswood daves old chum from home who had just come in from some experiments in the school laboratory he is simpleminded and very shy he gets excited once in a while like when he threw those mudballs  well you ought to know remarked buster ben is the only fellow here who has talked to the man he explained  when was that ben questioned dave  that was when the man first appeared answered the crumville lad i didnt find out until yesterday that he was the wild man and then it was because of that blue chalk he uses i met him in the woods when i was out during that last snow looking for rabbits with my shotgun i came across him sitting on a rock looking at an old newspaper he had some of the blue chalk in his hand and had marked a circle with a cross on the rock he asked me where i was going and told me to look out and not shoot a star and then he asked me if i used chalk for powder and said he could supply a superior brand of chalk cheap i thought at first that he was merely joking but i didnt like the look in his eyes and then i made up my mind he was not right in his head and i left him when i came back that way an hour later he was gone and i have never seen him since  where was this ben  up in the woods where the brook branches off by the two big rocks  i know the spot cried roger say maybe he hangs out around there  no we hunted around there yesterday but he wasnt to be seen i dont believe he has any settled place of abode but just roams through the woods  poor fellow somebody ought to catch him and place him in a sanitarium was daves comment  various matters were talked over until the supper hour and then the boys filed down to the dininghall here our hero met more of his school chums including gus plum who had once been his enemy but who was now quite friendly and little chip macklin who in days gone by had been plums toady  very glad to see you back dave cried gus and say youve certainly made a hero of yourself he added warmly  it was great what you and roger and phil did added chip in deep admiration  everybody was glad to see dave back and after supper it was all he could do to get away from many of his friends but he managed it at last and he roger and phil went upstairs to put away their things and get out their schoolbooks  we have got to study and that is all there is to it said dave firmly fun is one thing and getting ready to graduate is another we have got to get down to the grind boys  thats right answered the senators son  but dont forget what old haskers said grumbled phil hell make us sweat just you wait and see  sufficient for the day is the evil thereof quoted dave i think we can get through if we buckle down hard  supposing mr dale and the other teachers pin us down as old haskers did demanded phil  they wont do it declared our hero take my word for it mr dale will give us a month if we want it i know him and the others will do the same  well maybe we can get through if thats the case said the shipowners son slowly just the same i think old haskers the meanest man alive  the following morning after a good nights rest the boys went to their various classes as dave had predicted mr dale the head teacher treated them with all possible consideration for he loved boys and understood them thoroughly the other teachers were likewise very lenient  old haskers is the one stumblingblock said roger dave maybe we had better see doctor clay about him  not much cried phil weve got a club we can use on haskers why not use it  you mean go to him and tell him we know about that mrs breen affair and that we will expose him if he doesnt let up on us phil said dave  yes  do you think that is awell a gentlemanly thing to do  its what old haskers would do if he was in our place  perhaps but id rather not do it let my uncles lawyer try to collect that money without our appearing in the case we have had trouble enough in the past with haskers let us buckle in and study up i am sure we can get through added dave earnestly  all right growled phil but his manner showed that he was not satisfied  two days went by and the boys settled down to the regular routine of the school the lessons to be made up were exceedingly hard and dave found he had to study almost constantly to do what was required of him  but i am going to make it he murmured setting his teeth hard i am not going to disappoint the folks at home  one afternoon the three chums had a very hard lesson in latin to do it was a clear sunshiny day and they had one of the windows wide open to let in the fresh air dave and roger were bending over their books when they heard a sudden exclamation from phil  ill be hanged if im going to do it  and then of a sudden a latin book was hurled across the room to land on a bureau just missing the glass  hello cried dave raising his head whats wrong now  im not going to do it cried phil stretching himself its an outrage and i wont submit to it  you mean this boning away for haskers queried roger  just that answered the shipowners son why cant he treat us as fairly as the other teachers did it wouldnt hurt him a bit to give us more time  phil whats the use of talking it over again asked dave i thought we had settled it once for all  no i wont stand it i tell you cried phil stubbornly he cant make a packmule of me  well then speak to the doctor about it advised roger  i dont have to speak to the doctor stormed phil and walking over to a rack he caught up his cap and marched from the room  he is certainly in a bad humor was daves comment i am afraid hell put his foot into it roger  so am i hes been aching to get back at old haskers ever since he put all this studying up to us  do you know ben is just as angry at haskers as phil is went on our hero after a pause during which both had hoped that their close chum would return but phil had stalked down the stairs and out of the building  ben  yes so he told me this noon  what about  oh ben talked in class and old haskers penalized him heavilygave him a lot of extra latin to do it nearly broke ben up  you told ben about that breen affair didnt you  yes  maybe he and phil will both go to haskers about it  i hope not roger i dont think it is just the right thing to doto use that as a club over haskers to get him to let us off i dont like that kind of dealing  neither do i but its just what such a meanspirited fellow as haskers deserves he has never treated us squarely since we came here i think this school would be a good deal better off without him even if he is well educated  dave heaved a deep sigh he was on the point of replying but changed his mind he took up his book again and soon was trying his best to study roger followed his example  but both boys made slow progress each was thinking about phil what would be the outcome of their headstrong chums actions     chapter vii  phil and ben make a move so far dave and nat poole had not met face to face our hero had seen the moneylenders son a number of times but nat had always been with some of his cronies and had apparently not taken any notice  but on the morning following the conversation just recorded the pair came face to face in one of the narrow hallways  goodmorning nat said dave pleasantly  morning grumbled the other student he was about to pass dave but suddenly changed his mind so you got back eh  yes ive been back several days  i heard that link merwell got away from you  that is true  humph if i had the chance to nab him that you had id not let him get away  we held jasniff  maybe you let merwell go on purpose continued the moneylenders son shrewdly  not at all nat he gave us the slip clean and clear  humph nat paused for a moment i got word from my dad that you almost smashed him up on the road with your auto  hardly as bad as that  he is going to make your uncle pay for the damage done  it wasnt much  it was enough you want to be more careful with your car after this you auto fellows seem to think you own the whole road  what about your motorboat nat asked dave he remembered how the moneylenders son had played more than one mean trick while running the craft  oh my boat is all right dave porter sniffed nat and then he moved on with a scowl on his face  the same old nat soliloquized our hero too bad that he cant make himself a bit more agreeable  that day was a particularly trying one in the classroom the lessons were unusually hard and dave had all he could do to pass especially in those studies presided over by professor haskers roger made one miss in his latin and poor phil made several while ben basswoods recitation was a complete failure  as was usual with him job haskers was exceedingly dictatorial and said some cutting things that brought the blood to daves face  you must do much better than this porter and morr said the professor otherwise i shall have to place you in the next lower class you lawrence and basswood have failed so utterly that i will have to take your cases under immediate consideration the class is dismissed  the old bear growled ben under his breath  he looked inquiringly at phil and the latter nodded knowingly  dave did not know what to do he did not wish phil and ben to get into further trouble yet he did not know how to interfere besides he was suffering himself and hardly knew what to do on his own account  this is the worst yet cried roger as he and our hero came out of the classroom side by side  there go phil and ben returned dave roger they have got some plan up their sleeve  i believe you dave i wish i knew what to do shall we go to doctor clay  ive been thinking of that roger but i hate to do it id rather fight my own battles  so would i  let us wait until tomorrow and see if things dont take a turn for the better  all right just as you say but its a shame the way old haskers treats us grumbled the senators son  in the meantime phil and ben had gone on ahead both were exceeding angry and consequently not in a frame of mind to use their best judgment  its an outrage burst out the shipowners son an outrage ben i am not going to stand for it  well i am with you phil returned ben but what can we do  you know what i spoke about last evening  yes  how about doing that  i am with you if you are game  of course we may make old haskers tearing mad  well only face him with the truth wont we  yes  then let us do it and the sooner the better  yes but we must see him alone  of course i think we can manage it just before supperwhen he goes up to his room to fix up for the evening  the two chums talked the affair over for a long time  i dont suppose dave will like this ventured ben presently what do you think  he isnt hit as hard as we are answered phil lamely if he waswell he might look at things in a different light  thats so answered ben but deep down in his heart he was afraid that our hero would not altogether approve of what he and phil proposed to do  the boys took a walk and purposely kept out of the way of dave and roger they did not return to the hall until fifteen minutes before the first bell for supper then they came in by a side entrance and passed swiftly up the stairs and along the hallway to the room occupied by job haskers  who is it asked the teacher sharply when phil had knocked  mr haskers it is phil lawrence was the reply ben basswood is with me we wish to see you  ah indeed said the teacher coldly you come to me at an unusual hour you may see me tomorrow before class  mr haskers we wish very much to see you now put in ben  we have got to see you added phil warmly  there was no immediate reply to this the boys heard job haskers moving around the room and heard him shut a bureau then the door was flung open  you insist upon seeing me eh demanded the professor harshly  we do mr haskers returned phil boldly  very well young gentlemen step in and job haskers glared at the boys as he stood aside for them to enter  we came to see you sir about those latin lessons went on phil finding it just then difficult to speak he realized that job haskers was in no humor for being lenient  well shot out the professor  we feel that we are not being treated fairly put in ben believing he should not make phil do all the talking  not treated fairly i believe i am the best judge of that basswood  mr haskers i hate to say it but you are a hardhearted man cried out phil the door being closed so that no outsider might hear you are not giving us a fair chance the other teachers have given me and dave porter and roger morr several weeks in which to make up those lessons we missed while we were away you wish to give us only a week  and you didnt give me a fair chance to make up added ben  see here who is master here you or i demanded job haskers drawing himself up boys you are impudent i will not stand it  yes you will stand it cried phil throwing caution to the winds all we ask is a fair deal and you have got to give it to us well make up those lessons if youll give us a fair amount of time i dont intend to be put in a lower class for nothing  and im not going to stand it either came from ben  ha this to me snarled job haskers take care or ill have you dismissed from the hall  if you try it it will be the worst days work you ever did mr haskers warned the shipowners son  what you threaten me  we are going to make you give us a fair chance that is all and if youll do that well give you a fair chance  why whyyouyou the irate instructor knew not for the moment how to proceed  mr haskers i think you had better listen to me pursued phil  i have listened to all i care to hear  oh no you havent there is much moreand you had better listen closelyif you care at all for your reputation here at oak hall  the professor stared at the boy and grew a trifle pale  whawhat do youermean by that lawrence  i hate very much to bring this subject up mr haskers but you practically compel me to do it if you will only promise to give us a fair chance to make up our lessons i wont say a word about it  just what do you mean faltered the teacher  i know something about your doings in the pastdoings which are of no credit to you if you disgrace ben and me by degrading us in classes well disgrace you by telling all we know  and what do you know demanded job haskers hastily  we know a good deal put in ben  all about your dealing with the poor widow mrs breen added the shipowners son how you still owe her for board and how you borrowed money to publish a book that was never issued  who told you that cried job haskers stepping back in consternation who told you that i had borrowed money from her and that i owed her for board  never mind who told us said ben we know it is true  and you went to that lawyer eh stormed professor haskers you got him to threaten a suit didnt you i got his letter only this afternoon  we went to no lawyer answered phil  i know better i see it all now you want to get me into troubleto disgrace me here job haskers began to pace the floor it isera mistake i meant to pay that lady but iterslipped my mind and the book has been issued but the publishers have noterseen fit to push it that is why you and the world at large have not heard of it  mr haskers we havent told anybody about this went on phil pointedly you can settle with that lawyer whoever he may beand well not say a word to anybodythat is providing youll give us a fair chance in our lessons  ha maybe you wish me to pass you without an examination cried the teacher cunningly  no sir answered phil stoutly  we simply ask for more time that is all added ben we dont ask any favor we can make up the lessons if you will give us as much time as the other teachers would give us  you have not told anybody of thisthiseraffair of mrs breen  no  it is all a mistake but i should not like it to get abroad it would hurt my reputation a great deal i shall settle the matter in the near future i do not owe that lady as much as the lawyer says i dobut that is not your affair job haskers continued to pace the floor now about your lessons he continued after a pause if ierthought that i had really been too hard on you he paused  you certainly have been hard said phil  and if you really need more time  give us two weeks more and well be all right put in ben  and iferif i should decide to do that you willer  well make goodand keep our mouths shut finished phil  very well i will think it over young gentlemen and let you know tomorrow morning before class and in the meantime  we wont say a word to anybody said ben with a little grin  so be it and job haskers bowed there is the supperbell you may go now come to me just before class tomorrow he added and then the two students passed out of the room and the teacher shut the door after them     chapter viii  an unusual compact   hell do ithe is bound to do it cried ben as he and phil hurried down to the diningroom  i think so myself ben answered the shipowners son but for some reason he did not seem as joyful over the outcome of the interview as might have been expected  he wont dare let this news become public property went on the other student he is too afraid of public opinion  ben he thinks we got that lawyer to take the case up  you told him we hadnt  but he didnt believe iti could tell that by his manner and ben do you know after all this looks to me as if we had somehow bribed him to be easy on us continued phil with added concern  oh dont bother your head about that phil we only asked for what is fair didnt we  yes but and then the shipowners son did not finish because he did not know what to say in some manner phils conscience troubled him and he wondered what dave and roger would say when they heard of what had occurred  during the meal that followed but little was said by any of the boys once or twice our hero looked at phil but the latter avoided his gaze as soon as the repast was over phil rushed outside followed by ben and that was the last seen of the pair until it was time to go to bed  they have been up to something that is certain was the comment of the senators son  well we can only wait and see what turns up answered dave thoughtfully i dont think i care to ask them  in the morning when dave got up he looked over to where phil was in the habit of sleeping the bed was empty and the shipowners son was gone  dressed half an hour ago said another of the dormitory inmates  went off again with ben ill wager murmured roger ben was in another room across the hallway that term  dave and roger had been hard at work the evening before doing their best to make up the lessons they had missed while away from the school they doubted if phil and ben had studied at all with considerable curiosity they awaited the opening of the morning classes to see what might happen they felt that something was in the air  just before the last bell rang phil and ben appeared their faces wreathed in smiles  its all right fellows cried the shipowners son merrily its all right  now we can take our time making up those missed lessons added ben  you went to old haskers queried roger  we sure did answered the shipowners son  and told him about began our hero  never mind what we told him dave interrupted phil we did tell him that we wanted to make up the lessons but couldnt do it in the time he had allotted he argued it at first but now he has agreed to give us the same time mr dale did three weeks  good exclaimed roger  you or all of us asked our hero  all of us i think hell speak to you at recesshe said he would  what did he say when youwhen you mentioned mrs breen asked roger  hush somebody might hear you returned phil in a whisper we have promised to keep that quiet  but the poor woman began dave  will get her money never fear a lawyer has already written about it and old haskers says he will pay up he claims it is all a mistake but he doesnt want anybody at oak hall to get wind of it  there was no time to say more and evidently neither phil nor ben felt in the humor to discuss the affair the early morning lesson proceeded as usual but it was noticed that professor haskers was much subdued in his manner towards the students  porter and morr i wish to speak to you at recess said he coming down to where the two lads sat kindly remain here  when the other students had left the classroom the instructor came to our hero and his chum and motioned for them to follow him to a private room close by  i wish to speak to you about the lessons you are to make up said job haskers after clearing his throat several times i understand that you want more time  we would like to have more time yes answered dave briefly and looking the teacher full in the face  can you do the lessons in three weeks  yes mr haskers said dave and roger nodded his head  then you can take that much time but remember i shall expect you totoerto make up the lessons  yes sir came from both students  if you need more timeor any assistancepossibly i can arrange it went on job haskers eagerly  thank you if you give me three weeks i am sure i can make up the lessons to your satisfaction mr haskers came from our hero  and so can i added the senators son anyway ill try my level best  very well then we will let it stand that way there was a pause and the instructor bit his lip several times by the way ierunderstand that there is a very unpleasant rumor going around concerning me he proceeded it is all a mistake which i shall try to clear up without delay i trust that you will not attempt toerto circulate that rumor any further  mr haskers do you mean about that affair with mrs breen demanded dave bluntly  yes i have already explained to lawrence and basswood that it is a mistake and that the widow will be paid all that is due her but if this shoulderbe mentioned here the teacher stopped short and looked sharply at dave and roger  mr haskers let us understand each other answered dave quickly i have no desire whatever to get you or anybody else into trouble nor do i want to ask you for any favors i think we are justly entitled to more time in which to make up those lessons and now that you have granted that time i shall do my best to make good as for that mrs breen affair i think that poor old lady ought to have her money i understand some lawyer is going to try to collect it for her well if you settle the matter i shall feel very glad and you can rest assured that i will not say a word about the matter to anybody in this school or anywhere else  youeryou give me your word on that porter demanded the instructor eagerly  i do  and you morr  yes sir answered the senators son  who else is there who knows about thiserunpleasant affair  phil lawrence and ben basswood answered roger  no other students  not that i know of  very well then job haskers drew a breath of relief see that you keep your word and about the lessonsif three weeks are not long enough i mayerbe able to give you a little more time  that time will be enough replied dave  well make it with ease added roger  then that is settled and you may go and so speaking job haskers left the room the two boys followed him and went out on the campus  how did you make out questioned phil as he ran up to them  we got our time answered roger  but let me tell you one thing said dave after this haskers is going to hate us worse than ever  i dont see why declared the shipowners son i think we are letting him off mighty easy  he feels as if he had been forced into doing what we want went on dave i think he looks at it as if you had used that mrs breen incident as a club over him  well it was a club in one sense dave  i know it phil and although i am glad we have won out and gotten that extra time still i am sorry that you and ben went to him as you did  humph did you think i was going to sit still and be put back into a lower class  maybe it might have been better if you had gone to doctor clay  i dont think so replied phil shortly and then the schoolbell rang again and all the boys had to go to their next classes  in spite of the cloud that thus hung over the affair every one of the chums was glad of the extra time in which to make up the lost lessons not one of them had to grind away as hard as before and dave took a little time off in which to send a letter to his father and another to jessie  the next day was warm and pleasant and after schoolhours roger proposed to dave that they take a walk up the woods road back of the school  all right a walk in the woods will do us good was the answer shall we ask some of the others  if you wish and in the end phil went along and also buster beggs and gus plum  my but i had a runin with old haskers this afternoon said the stout youth i came close to carrying the matter to the doctor  what was it about questioned dave  oh nothing at all to my way of thinking i went to the library to get a book and he accused me of wasting my class time he was very ugly i wont stand for much more of it grumbled buster  dave said no more but he and roger exchanged glances evidently the irate instructor was going to take it out of somebody as the saying goes  the boys walked on and on along the road until oak hall was left far behind soon buster forgot his troubles and the crowd were chatting gayly of many things  call for candidates for the baseball team next saturday announced gus plum i hope we get up a team this year that knocks the spots out of rockville military academy and all the other institutions we cross bats with  are you going to try for the nine this term gus questioned dave  sure why not youll try wont you went on the big youth in surprise  no ive decided not to go into athletics this term gus i want to give all my time to my studies  yes but the nine needs you dave put in buster i heard some of the fellows talking about it only yesterday they had you slated for your old position  well if gus wants to play he can fill the box answered dave  but we need more than one pitcher insisted buster  there are plenty of new students coming along i hear thomas is a good one and so is ennis  im not going to play either said roger i want to graduate with all the honors possible  how about you phil  ii think ill play answered the shipowners son rather lamely ill see about it later  well i dont want to neglect my studies said gus plum but i have done some hard work this winter and so i am pretty well ahead i didnt lose time going to cave island you know he added with a smile  well it was worth itlosing that time answered dave it saved mr wadsworth from ruin and thats a good deal  if the baseball nine commenced buster and then broke off short what was that he demanded as a cry from a distance broke on the ears of all  its a womans voice cried dave quickly she is calling for help come on and see what is the matter and he started off on a run with his school chums at his heels     chapter ix  the king of sumatra   the boys had been traveling along a broad highway that ran to a town on the other side of the woods the trees were thick and so were the bushes with here and there a big rock covered with the dead vines of the summer previous  at one point some distance ahead was an old stone house standing where another road ran in the direction of the river this house had not been inhabited for years and the doors and windows were gone and the falling of the chimney had smashed in a large portion of the sloping roof  it was from in front of the old house that the cries for assistance came and now the boys heard two voices both somewhat girlish in tones  oh let me go please let me go came wildly  you have no right to touch us was added in another voice  whats the matter called out dave as loudly as he could but in his mind there had already flashed an inkling of what was going on for some time past the wild man of that locality had not shown himself now perhaps he was again at his old tricks  oh make him go away screamed a girlish voice and then as our hero made a turn of the road he caught sight of two girls standing near the old stone house back of them was another figure that of a tall powerful man but this figure disappeared as if by magic behind the ancient building  why miss rockwell exclaimed dave as he recognized a young lady from town whom he knew well and you too miss feversham what is the matter  that manthe wild man panted vera rockwell hehestopped us  he wanted our purses added mary feversham the other young lady  where is he asked roger and phil in a breath  he just ran behind the housei saw him answered dave did he hurt you any he went on anxiously for he and vera and mary were good friends  no but hehe scared us so  let us go after him put in phil quickly he had taken mary feversham out a number of times and the two were well acquainted come on and he started around the house  all of the others were not slow to follow behind the building they came upon a mass of weeds and bushes and in their midst the remains of an old well long since caved in what had once been a path led to the side road before mentioned  thats the way he must have gonedown the side road cried the shipowners son  supposing we see if we can catch him suggested dave but somebody ought to go back and stay with the girls he added thoughtfully  ill go back answered phil he was only too glad of a chance to talk to mary not having seen her for a long time  if that fellow comes back whistle for us advised roger  dave was already on the side road with buster and gus beside him and the senators son quickly followed  dont go too fast or ii cant kekeep up with you panted buster  do you see anything of him dave queried roger  not yet but there is a turn just ahead when we make that well be able to see almost to the river  all of the students sped on the stout lad doing his best to keep up with the others they reached the turn with dave a step or two in advance  there he is  i see him say hes wildlooking enough  he is making for the river  we ought to be able to catch him we are four to one  dave and roger pressed forward with increased speed and poor buster fell somewhat behind  im coming as fafast as i cacan blurted out the fat youth go onill get there sooner or later  pick up a stick if you see one cried dave to roger and gus we may have a hot fight on our hands that man ought to be in jail or in an asylum  as they sped along the three kept their eyes open and each presently armed himself with a fairsized club the wild man was running like a deer pausing occasionally to turn and brandish his long arms at them savagely they could see that his clothing was in tatters and that his hair and beard were long and unkempt  hi stop called out dave although he had but little hope of causing the man to halt we want to talk to you  go back beware go back or it will be the worse for you called the wild man leave the king of sumatra alone  the king of sumatra repeated roger say hes crazy sure enough to imagine himself that  the boys continued after the wild man and urged him to stop but instead of heeding them he ran on the faster  hes an athlete when it comes to running remarked dave as he tried in vain to get closer to the man  they say crazy people are always strong answered the senators son  ive gogot to gigive up panted gus and came to a halt gogot a papain in my side and he put his hand over his hip  all right well manage alone cried roger i dont think we can catch that fellow anyway he added half under his breath  another turn of the woodland road brought the leming river into plain view at a point where the stream was both wide and deep the wild man kept sprinting along and it was impossible for the boys to draw any closer to him  shall we threaten to shoot him if he wont stop asked roger neither of the lads carried firearms  illustration stop cried davepage 87  no he might do some shooting on his own accountif he is armed come on he may fall or something like that  inside of three minutes more the wild man gained the shore of the river and disappeared around a point of rocks and brushwood  be careful dave warned roger he may spring out at you with a club  ive got my eyes open was the ready reply  both advanced with caution and soon came up to the nearest of the rocks with clubs ready for use the two youths continued to move forward then they came to a sudden halt the wild man was no longer in sight what had become of him  maybe he ran into the woods suggested roger  perhaps buthark and our hero held up his hand from a distance came a scraping sound like something sliding over a rock  look called out the senators son hes got a boat there he goes  dave turned in the direction pointed out by his chum both saw a small rowboat sweep out from under some brushwood in it stood the wild man using an oar as a pole on the rocks  stop cried dave stop or you may be sorry for it  you cant catch the king of sumatra yelled the wild man and flourished his arms and made a hideous face at them then he sat down on the middle seat of the craft placed the oars in the rowlocks and commenced to row rapidly down the stream  well thats the end of the chase remarked dave in some disgust  thats right since we havent any boat returned roger wonder where he got that craft i dont think he bought it  it isnt likely probably he saw it somewhere along the river and simply appropriated it and this proved to be true  the boys watched the wild man until a bend of the stream hid rower and craft from view then they turned back in the direction of the old stone house  did you get him demanded buster who was waiting with gus at the point where he had dropped out of the race  no answered roger and told why  he sure is a cute one went on the stout youth say if they dont catch him soon hell have this whole neighborhood scared to death  the students soon reached the old house here they found the two girls and phil the latter with a heavy stick in his hand ready for any emergency the girls had calmed down a little but were still much agitated  we were to come home in my uncles carriage said mary feversham but the horse got a lame foot and so we decided to walk we had heard of the wild man but did not think we would meet him oh it was dreadful  he didnt hurt you did he asked dave  oh no but he frightened us so he danced around us and caught us by the arms and he wanted us to give him money oh it was dreadful  he ought to be in an asylum said dave and then he and roger related how the wild man had escaped  i shant go out alone again said vera rockwell that is not until that man is captured  well take you both home said phil promptly looking at mary  but we dont want to keep you from what you were going to do said vera  oh we were only out for a walk replied dave well walk to town with you maybe well hear something more of this strange fellow  all turned back on the road that led close to oak hall and after discussing the wild man from various points of view the conversation turned to other matters the girls told of what they had been doing during the past holidays and asked the boys about themselves  i heard that that horrid jasniff is under arrest said vera to dave i am glad of it it is a pity that merwell got away  perhaps answered our hero but somehow i sometimes think that link merwell will turn over a new leaf  vera looked back to make sure that none of the others were near  just like mr plum i suppose you mean she whispered oh it was splendid what you did for him dave  oh i didnt do much for gus  my brother thinks you did he heard the whole story it was brave and noble of you it was indeed and veras face showed her earnestness  well gus has turned out a nice fellow i wish merwell would turn out as good  but he helped to take those jewels  that is trueand that will always be a black mark against him said dave soberly  soon all reached the outskirts of oakdale and there at one of the corners the boys left the girls  pretty late cried gus plum consulting the watch he carried well have to hike back lively if we dont want to be marked up for tardiness  we can get an excuse if we tell about the wild man said buster ive hurried all im going to  well certainly have a yarn to spin when we get back to the school was phils comment  at the entrance to the campus the boys who were a little late met the first assistant to doctor clay as my old readers know mr dale was as pleasant as job haskers was disagreeable  had a fine walk boys he asked with a smile  we had an adventure answered dave and then he and his chums told what it was  well well that wild man again mused the instructor this is getting truly serious i was hoping he would leave this neighborhood and so he calls himself the king of sumatra that is strange  it certainly is strange answered dave  but how strange our hero was still to find out     chapter x  nat poole wants to know   that evening dave was on his way to the school library to consult a certain work of reference when he ran into another student who suddenly grasped him by the shoulder it was rather dark where the pair confronted each other and for the instant our hero did not recognize the fellow  what do you want  i want to speak to you for a minute dave porter said the other in a voice that trembled a trifle  oh its you nat answered dave as he recognized the son of the crumville moneylender what do you want he rather imagined that the youth wished to pick another quarrel with him  ii want to talk in private with you returned nat and looked around to see if anybody else was near  what about  you were out walking this afternoon and met that wild man so i heard  that is true  you tried to catch him didnt you  yes roger morr buster beggs gus plum and i did our best to collar him but he was too fast for us he ran down to the river got into a rowboat and rowed away  so i heard and i heard something else continued the boy from crumville when you called to the man to stop he answered back didnt he  yes  will you please tell me what he said and nats voice had an eager ring in it  he told us to beware and go back or wed get into trouble  didnt he say something more than that  oh yes a great deal more  he called himself something didnt he  yes look here nat what is this to you why are you so interested queried dave for he could easily perceive that the other youth was more than ordinarily anxious to know the particulars of what had occurred  iiwant toerknow thats all did he call himself anything  yes he thinks he is the king of sumatra  he called himself that asked nat with increased excitement  yes two or three times but see here nat  will you please tell me how he looked was he tall and rather thin  yes  and what kind of hair did he have  brownishred as near as i could make out and very long and he had rather a long beard and a large nose went on our hero  at this brief but accurate description of the wild man nat poole paled a trifle and uttered something of a gasp  whewhere did he go he faltered  he rowed down the river just as fast as he could i dont know how far he went for the bend hid him from view answered our hero say nat do you think you know that man  whyerknow him of course i dont know him was the stammeredout reply but ii thinkmaybeive met him and then to avoid further questioning nat poole hurried away our hero could do nothing but stare after him  that is mighty queer mused dave as he turned into the library to consult the reference book if nat doesnt know the man why was he so anxious he acted scared to death when i said the fellow called himself the king of sumatra  dave remained in the school library for a half an hour and then joined phil roger and the others in dormitory number twelve he found the students discussing a talk roger had had with nat poole only a few minutes before  nat called me out in the hallway said the senators son he wanted to know all about that wild man and he wanted to make dead certain that he had called himself the king of sumatra  that is certainly queeron top of what happened to me said dave and told of the interview he had had  well this is a puzzle declared phil slowly what do you make of it dave  i think nat imagines he knows the wild man  thats the way it looks to me added the senators son  say you dont suppose that wild man has anything to do with the fellows nat used to train withjasniff merwell and that crowd questioned buster  its possible but i dont think so returned our hero he is surely a crazy individual and as nobody around here seems to know him he must be a stranger to these parts  but what would make nat so interested asked little chip macklin  give it up answered roger  maybe he has something to tell but wont tell it to us ventured phil he may go right to the doctor  but if nat poole went to the master of oak hall or to anybody else at that institution the boys did not hear of it he asked no more questions about the wild man and when any of our friends came near him he immediately walked away thus avoiding an interview  the proposed meeting of the athletic committee of oak hall was held on saturday afternoon in the gymnasium and was well attended an even twenty names had been put up for the regular baseball nine of the institution of these names fifteen belonged to old students and five were those of newcomers to oak hall as he had said he would do gus plum had handed in his name and so had sam day and some of our other friends but dave phil and roger were conspicuous by their absence  see here porter youre going to play arent you asked the former manager  no answered dave quietly but firmly  why not  well in the first place i have too many back lessons to make up and in the second place i hope to graduate this coming june and i want to make a record for myself if possible  but you can do that and play on the nine too urged the manager  i dont think so id like to play continued our hero wistfully but i dont see how i can  this isnt fair porter we really need you  oh it isnt as bad as that returned dave with a faint smile youve got gus plum to pitch and some of the others there are plenty of good ballplayers here this term  i dont know about that answered the manager with a grave shake of his head i wish youd come in  not this year said dave and then the two separated  phil and roger were likewise urged to try for the nine but they followed daves example then a tentative nine was formed with gus plum as pitcher and also a scrub nine with one of the newcomers to oak hall in the box practice was to start on wednesday afternoon of the following week  too bad we couldnt take part sighed the shipowners son id like to wallop the rockville military academy fellows just once more  well we cant have everything answered dave i want to graduate with the highest possible honors and that means plenty of hard boning  and a fellow cant bone and play ball too added roger  we mightif old haskers would be easy on us murmured the shipowners son  now see here phil said dave almost sternly dont ask haskers for any more favors he has done all that can reasonably be expected of him  all right just as you say grumbled phil but his manner showed that he was not altogether satisfied  a week went by and dave and his chums applied themselves diligently to their studies during that time nothing more was heard of the wild man and the excitement concerning that strange individual again died down but the folks living in the vicinity of the woods back of oak hall were on their guard and it was seldom that women and children went out alone  the boys were doing very well in their studies and dave received warm words of encouragement from andrew dale he had made up nearly all the back lessons imposed upon him by job haskers and that dictatorial teacher could not help but be satisfied over the showing made roger was also doing well and poor phil was the only one who was backward although not enough to cause alarm  ill get there but it comes hard said the shipowners son i should have asked old haskers for more time  dont you do it answered dave come ill help you all i can which he did  one day there came a letter to our hero which gave him great satisfaction he read it carefully and then hastened off to communicate the news to phil roger and ben  its a letter from my uncle dunston he explained to his chums if you will remember he said he would hire a lawyer to take up that mrs breen case against professor haskers  what does he say asked roger quickly  i will read it to you answered dave and read the following    you will be glad to learn that mr loveland one of our lawyers   has gotten a settlement for mrs breen out of your teacher mr   haskers he had quite a time of it haskers declaring that he did   not owe as much as the widow said he did the lawyer said he would   sue for the full amount and then haskers came to see him mr   loveland says the teacher wanted to learn who had hired him to   stir the matter up and mentioned some students names but the   lawyer gave him no satisfaction at all and at last haskers paid   up in full took his receipt and got out i instructed mr   loveland to put his charges for services on our bill so mrs   breen will get the entire amount collected i am going to take it   to her in person and see to it that it is wisely invested for her   benefit  good cried the senators son that will help the old lady a great deal  say ill bet old haskers was sore when he forked over that money was bens comment no wonder hes been looking like a thundercloud lately  yes and hed let out on usif he dared said phil but he doesnt dare  dont be too sure of that phil said dave seriously there is no telling what he will dolater on when he thinks this affair has blown over  humph i am not afraid of him declared phil recklessly  if he tries any of his games well expose him added ben  better go slow advised roger he too felt that job haskers might become very vindictive  spring was now at hand and a week later came the first baseball game of the season it was a contest with esmore academy from daytonville and held on the oak hall grounds quite a crowd was present including some of the town folks gus plum was in the pitchers box for the hall and sam day was on first base and chip macklin on third  i hope we win cried dave  i hope you do answered vera rockwell who was present with some other girls but why are you not playing she went on  not this term said our hero with a smile and then he spoke of his studies  i suppose it is noble of you to give up this way she said butid like to see you play  the contest proved a wellfought one and was won by oak hall by a score of eight runs to five at the conclusion there was a great cheering for the victors  this means bonfires tonight cried roger as the gathering broke up  yes and a grand good time added buster beggs     chapter xi  bonfire night at the hall   it was certainly a night long to be remembered in the annals of oak halland for more reasons than one  at the start several bonfires were lit along the bank of the river and around these the students congregated to dance and sing songs and cut up generally none of the teachers were present and it was given out that the lads might enjoy themselves within reasonable bounds until ten oclock  lets form a grand march cried gus plum every man with a torch  yes but dont set anything on fire cautioned roger  say that puts me in mind of a story came from shadow a fellow went into a powder shop to buy some ammunition he was smoking a pipe and the proprietor  whoop hurrah for shadow yelled somebody from the rear and the next instant the storyteller of the hall found himself up on a pile of barrels which had not yet been set on fire  now then tell your yarns to everybody came the cry  speak loud shadow  give us all the details  tell us the story about the old man and the elephant  no give us that about the old maid and the mouse  let us hear about the fellow who was shipwrecked on the rocky mountains  or about how the fellow who couldnt swim fell into a flour barrel  say what do you take me for roared shadow i dont know any story about the rocky mountains or a flour barrel either if you want to hear  sure we do  thats the very yarn weve been waiting for  say shadow wont you please tell it into a phonograph so i can grind it out to my grandfather when i get home  is that the story that starts on a foggy night at noon  no this one starts on a dusty day in the middle of the atlantic  say if you fellows want me to tell a story say so grumbled shadow otherwise im going to get down  no no tell your best yarn shadow  all right then once two men went into a shoe store  wow thats fifty years old  i heard that when a child at my grandsons knee  tell us something about smoke shadow  and fire i love to hear about a fire its so warm and  hi let me get down do you want to burn me up yelled the storyteller of the school suddenly as chancing to glance down he saw that the barrels were on fire let me down i say and he made a leap from the barrels into the midst of the crowd  shadow landed on the shoulders of nat poole and both went down and rolled over in a spirit of play some of the students near by covered the rolling pair with shavings and straw shadow took this in good part and merely laughed as he arose but the moneylenders son was angry  hi who threw those dirty shavings all over me he bawled i dont like it  dont mind a little bath like that nat called one of the students  but i do mind it the shavings are full of dirt and so is the straw the dirt is all over me  never mind you can have a free bath nat said another  ill lend you a cake of soap added a third  i dont want any of your soap growled the moneylenders son say the whole crowd of you make me sick he added and walked off in great disgust  phew but hes touchy was the comment of one of the students i guess he thinks hes better than the rest of us  lets give him another dose came the suggestion from the rear of the crowd  shavings  yes and straw too put some down his neck  right you are  fully a dozen students quickly provided themselves with shavings and straw both far from clean and made after nat who was walking up the riverfront in the direction of the boathouse  before the moneylenders son could do anything to defend himself he found himself seized from behind and hurled to the ground  now then give it to him good cried a voice and in a twinkling a shower of shavings straw and dirt descended upon poor nat covering him from head to foot  hi let up spluttered the victim trying to dodge the avalanche but instead of heeding his pleadings the other students proceeded to ram a quantity of the stuff into his ears and down his collar nat squirmed and yelled but it did little good  now then you are initiated into the order of straw and shavings cried one merry student  just you wait ill get square see if i dont howled nat as he arose then he commenced to twist his neck to free himself from the ticklish straw and shavings  come on and have a good time old sport howled one of his tormentors and then off the crowd ran in the direction of the bonfires leaving nat more disgusted than ever  ill fix them just wait and see if i dont stormed the moneylenders son to himself and then hurried to the hall to clean up and make himself comfortable  in the meantime the march around the campus had begun each student carrying a torch of some kind there was a great singing  be careful of the fire warned mr dale as he came out doctor clay says you must be careful  well take care was the cry  the marching at an end some of the boys ran for the stables and presently returned with jackson lemond the driver of the school carryall commonly called horsehair because of the hairs which clung to his clothing  come on horsehair join us in having a good time  give us a speech horsehair  tell us all you know about the wars of the roses  or how hannibal crossed the delaware and defeated the turks at the alamo  i cant make no speech pleaded the carryall driver just you let me go please  if you cant make a speech sing suggested another give us yankee doodle in the key of j minor  or that beautiful lullaby entitled you never miss your purse until you have to walk home give us that in nine flats will you  i tell you i cant make a speech and i cant sing shouted out the driver for the school desperately  how sad cant speechify and cant sing all right then let it go and give us a dance  thats the talk a real japanese jig in fivequarter time  there was a rush and in a twinkling poor horsehair was boosted to the top of a big packingcase that had been hauled to the spot as fuel for one of the bonfires  the stage announced one of the students with a wave of his hand the worldrenowned horsehairsky will perform his celebrated dance of the hop scotch get your opera glasses ready  whats the admission fee  two pins and a big green apple  i cant dancei aint never danced in my life pleaded the victim you let me go ive got to take care o my hosses  while he was speaking buster beggs had come up behind horsehair and placed something attached to a dark string on the box between the drivers feet it was an imitation snake made of rubber and colored up to look very natural  oh my look at the snake yelled several in pretended alarm  where where yelled horsehair  there right between your feet hes going to bite you on the leg  take care thats a rattler sure  if he bites you horsehair youll be a dead man  take him off take him off bawled the carryall driver and in terror he made a wild leap from the packingbox and landed directly on the shoulders of two of the students then he dropped to the ground rolled over got up and ran as fast as his legs could carry him in the direction of the stables a wild laugh followed him but to this he paid no attention  well we are certainly having a night of it remarked dave after the fun had quieted down for a moment he spoke to roger  where is phil asked the senators son  went off with ben i think  where to  i dont know  its queer how much they keep together lately isnt it continued roger  oh i dont know of course that affair with haskers may have something to do with it answered our hero slowly  i wish haskers would leave this school dave  oh it wont make much difference to us if we graduate whether he stays or not  i know that but somehow i dont think he is a good man to have here even if he is a learned instructor he never enters into the school spirit as mr dale does  well we cant all be alike  would you keep him if you were in doctor clays shoes  i hardly think so certainly not if i could find another teacher equally good  the boys walked on until they found themselves at the last bonfire of the line close to where the school grounds came to an end here was a hedge and beyond were the woods reaching up from the river  nobody down by this bonfire remarked dave say this is careless work he added the wind might shift and set the woods on fire  i didnt think theyd start a fire so far from the others answered his chum  let us kick it into the water suggested our hero and this they started to do when unexpectedly a voice hailed them and they saw a student sitting in a tree that grew in the hedge which separated the campus from the woods  let that fire alone the youth called angrily  why its nat poole exclaimed roger in a low voice whatever is he doing in that tree  i am sure i dont know returned dave  is he alone  he seems to be  do you hear what i say went on the moneylenders son leave that fire alone  did you build it asked dave  i did and i want you to leave it alone  all right nat if you say so answered roger we thought it had been abandoned and that it might set fire to the woods  to this nat poole did not reply plainly he was annoyed at being discovered in his present position dave and roger looked around to see if anybody else was in the vicinity and then turning walked in the direction of the other bonfires  what do you make of that dave asked the senators son presently  it looked to me as if nat was waiting or watching for somebody roger  so it did the question is who was it  i dont know but ive got something of an idea  some of the students  no that wild man     chapter xii  plans for a spread   that wild man exclaimed the senators son stopping short to stare at dave  yes  how do you make that out  because i think nat is interested in the fellow although just how i wont pretend to say but youll remember how excited he got when he found out that the wild man called himself the king of sumatra  oh i see you think he knows the fellow and thought that the bonfire might attract him to the place  yes ive heard it said that crazy folks were sometimes attracted by the sight of fire maybe nat has heard the same and wants to see if it will work in the case of this man  shall we go back and see what happens suggested roger  dave mused for a moment  would it be just right to play the spy roger  well this isnt playing the spy in the ordinary sense of the term dave that wild man ought to be locked up  but it may not be the wild man he is looking for  oh let us go back a little while anyway urged the senators son  they retraced their steps until within fifty feet of the bonfire and then walked to the shelter of the hedge they thought they had not been seen but they were mistaken  humph so you think you are going to spy on me after all cried a voice and nat poole came towards them with a deep frown on his face  its rather queer you are in the tree answered roger somewhat sharply  its my affair not yours roger morr roared the moneylenders son then without another word he walked to the bonfire kicked the blazing sticks into the river and strode off in the direction of the hall  hes good and mad was rogers comment  and we didnt learn anything after all added our hero  dave and his chum rejoined the merry throng at the other bonfires but the celebration in honor of the baseball victory was practically at an end and a little later the students retired to skylark a little in the dormitories and then settle down for the night  a week passed and dave stuck to his studies as persistently as ever during that time he sent off several letters and received a number in return including one from jessie which he treasured very highly and which he did not show to his chums  here is news of link merwell said luke watson one day as he came along with a letter its from a friend of mine who knows merwell he says he saw link in quebec canada at one of the little french hotels in the lower town  what was merwell doing questioned dave with interest  nothing much so my friend writes he says link was dressed in a blue suit and wore blue glasses and he thought his hair was dyed  evidently doing what he could to disguise himself was phils comment  my friend writes that he saw merwell only one evening the next day he was missing he made inquiries and says he was at the hotel under the name of v a smith of albany new york  he does not dare to travel around under his own name remarked shadow say that puts me in mind of a story he went on brightening up once a chap changed his name because  say cut it out interrupted phil we want to hear about merwell  there isnt any more to tell said luke my friend tried to find out where he had gone but couldnt  he must be having a lonely time of ittrying to keep out of the hands of the law murmured dave  and maybe he hasnt much money said buster his father may have shut down on him  gus plum listened to all this conversation without saying a word but down in his heart the former bully of oak hall was glad that he had cut away from merwell and jasniff and turned over a new leaf and he resolved then and there that come what might he would never again turn aside from the path of right and honor  say why dont you listen to my story pleaded shadow and then related a somewhat rambling tale of a man who had changed his name and later on lost some property because of it  another day slipped by and it was one of particular interest to dave and roger for in the morning they made up the last of the back lessons imposed upon them by job haskers they had done exceedingly well but the harsh teacher gave them little credit phil and ben had still three days work but professor haskers said nothing of this  he doesnt dare declared the shipowners son  thats right chuckled ben we could give him a good black eye before this whole school if we wanted to  dave had already finished up the back lessons for the other teachers so he was now free to spend his time on what was ahead of him he was as enthusiastic as ever to make a record for himself and pitched in with a will and his enthusiasm was caught by roger who also resolved to do his best  whoop hurrah what do you think of this came from phil late one afternoon after the mail had been distributed somebody hold me down i guess im going to fly or maybe im only dreaming and he began to caper around gayly  what is it all about phil asked dave hit your funnybone  money boys money thats what it is about replied the shipowners son ive got five thousand dollars all my own  five thousand dollars gasped buster  all your own queried gus plum  where did you get it asked another  why its this way answered phil when he could calm down a little about two years ago a greatuncle of mine died leaving considerable money he was interested in various enterprises and his death brought on legal complications and some litigation he left his money to a lot of heirs including myself my father and i never thought wed get anythingthought the lawyers and courts would swallow it all but now it seems that it has been settled and yours truly gets five thousand dollars in cash  when do you get it phil right away asked buster  welleri of course dont get it until i am of age its to go in the bank  oh  wont you get any of it until then asked shadow your dad might let you have a little just to celebrate  thats just itjust what he has done cried phil ive got but wait cried the shipowners son interrupting himself ill plan this thing out you shall all be my guests later on he added mysteriously  will you give a spread asked chip macklin  dont ask questions only wait returned phil and that was all he would say on the point although he talked freely about his inheritance  the next morning phil and ben were seen in earnest conversation and that afternoon the two boys left the school as soon as they could get away bound on an errand to oakdale  we ought to get a dandy spread for a dollar or a dollar and a half a head said phil as they hurried along and twelve at a dollar and a half will be only eighteen dollars  the music will cost something said ben  yes im counting on two pieces a harp and a violin for ten dollars thats the price professor smuller charges  the boys were bound for the oakdale union house a new hotel which had just been opened by a man named jason sparr it was a nice resort without a bar and catered to the better class of people including the students at oak hall and at the military academy  the boys found the hotel proprietor glad to see them and willing to set any kind of a spread that they were able to pay for trade was not yet brisk and jason sparr said he would do his best to serve them he was a smooth oily man and a fellow who wanted all that was coming to him  i can set you an elegant table for eighteen dollars for twelve said he ill give you oysters fish two kinds of meat several vegetables salad icecream coffee and also nuts cake olives celery and other fixings  thats the talk cried phil enthusiastically just make a nice spread of it and you can have all our trade in the future  youll be well pleased answered jason sparr  can we have a private diningroom  to be surethe blue room over yonder and the hotel man showed the boys the apartment  i want some flowers too said phil you can put two dollars worth of roses on the table  very wellthat will make an even twenty dollars  when do you want me to pay  such spreads are usually paid for in advance answered jason sparr shrewdly he did not intend to take any chances with schoolboys  all right here is your money answered the shipowners son and brought forth one of the two crisp twentydollar bills his father had mailed to him with the good news of his fortune  tell him about the music suggested ben  oh yes i thought id have professor smuller furnish some musicharp and violin  fine they can sit in the alcove and well put some of our palms around them returned jason sparr  remember this is for next saturday night seven oclock sharp said phil  ive got it down returned the hotel proprietor as he wrote in his book  and dont say anything to anybody about it i want to surprise my friends  very well mums the word and the hotel man looked very wise and knowing  leaving the place phil and ben sought out the home of professor smuller a violinist who with a friend who played the harp often furnished music for dances and other occasions  yes yes i can furnish music said the violinist just tell me what you want business was slow and he was glad to get any sort of an engagement  the matter was explained and the professor promised to be on hand and bring the harpist with him he said he could play anything the students desired including the wellknown school songs he would fill the engagement for the boys for eight dollars although his regular price was ten but he would have to have cash in advance  again phil paid out his money and then the business concluded he and ben left the professors home and hurried along the road leading to oak hall  have you made up your list yet asked ben when nearing the school  not quite ill have dave and roger and shadow and buster of course ill have to leave out some fellows but that cant be helped i cant afford a spread for the whole school  of course you cant  i think ill have luke and sam and maybe gus and chip  as the boys drew closer to the school ben had to stop to fix his shoe both sat down on some rocks at a turn in the road they were about to go on again when somebody made the turn of the road coming from the town it was nat poole  hello you been to town cried ben goodnaturedly  yes answered the moneylenders son havent i a right to go if i want to he added and then hurried on ahead of them  rather peppery mused ben say phil there is one fellow you wont invite and i know it  right you are ben was the ready answer all i ask of nat poole is that he leave me alone  but nat was not to leave phil alone as events were quickly to prove     chapter xiii  the cabin on the island   dave come on out for a row you havent been on the river this year  it was gus plum who spoke he was out in one of the craft belonging to oak hall and hailed our hero as the latter was strolling along the riverbank  all right gus dave cried cheerily i dont know but that a try at the oars will do me good after the hard studying ive been doing  you are bound to get a highwater mark this term arent you went on gus plum as he brought the rowboat up to the dock so that dave might get in  id like to graduate with honor yes  what are you going to do after you leave here dave went on the big youth as the two rowed up the river  i dont know yet have you made up your mind  oh i think ill go into business but i am not sure  you wont try for college  no you see i dont make much of a fist at learning so whats the use but i love businessbuying and selling things  the two boys continued at the oars until the vicinity of oak hall was left far behind  if we only had a powerboat we might run up to squirrel island remarked gus  perhaps nat poole will lend you his motorboat suggested our hero with a little grin  humph id not ask him returned the big youth promptly i am done with nat poole i want to stick to my new friends and the former bully of the school fairly beamed on dave who had done so much to make him reform  have you seen the motorboat this season gus  yes nat got it out two days ago i think he is on the river now  the boys rowed on until they came to a bend where there was something of a cove as they rounded the point they heard the steady putput of a gasoline engine not far off  there is nats craft now cried our hero and pointed ahead  hes all alone was plums comment he cant have many friends these days or hed have some of them along  id hate to be without friends gus shouldnt you  yes indeed but its nats own fault if hed only drop his important airs and be more sociable hed get along all right  on and on rowed the two students it was a clear balmy day and they hated to return to the school until it was absolutely necessary  let us row around smith island suggested our hero mentioning a small place in the middle of the stream so named after a farmer who owned it it was a rocky and somewhat barren spot and seldom visited by anybody but fishermen  all right but we want to beware of the rocks cautioned the big youth  the rowboat was headed up the stream and soon they came in sight of the island on one side were a number of bushes overhanging the river  hello look there cried dave a few minutes later and pointed to the bushes  what do you see  a motorboat i think it is nat pooles  is that so what brought him here questioned gus with interest  i am sure i dont know but its his boat i am sure of that went on dave after another look at the craft  see anything of nat  no the boat is empty  let us row in a little closer and see what he is doing suggested gus  hell say we were spying on him  humph havent we as much right as he has to visit the island  of course  then what is the use of keeping away he may be waiting to play some trick or something like that  oh i think not gus probably he just visited the island out of curiosity but ill go in if you say so  slowly so as to avoid the many rocks in that vicinity the two students brought the rowboat close up to the motorcraft they looked into the bushes and along the rocks beyond but saw nothing of nat  shall we call to him asked gus  what for i dont want to see him  neither do i his boat is tied good and fast he must expect to stay on the island quite a while  the two boys rowed on past the motorboat then as they turned a point of rocks dave gave a start  well of all things  what is it dave  look yonderin between those bushes  why its a rowboat  exactly gus and do you see how it is painted drab with blue stripes  of coursea pretty ugly boat i think  gus that is the very rowboat used by that wild manthe one he was in when he got away from us that day  do you really mean it gasped the big boy staring hard at the craft  i certainly doid know that boat in a hundred i never saw another just like it  if thats the case maybe the wild man is on the island  just what i was thinking answered dave and i was thinking too that he stopped short  what  dont you remember how nat was so anxious to know all about the wild man and how upset he seemed to be when he heard that the fellow called himself the king of sumatra  yes i remember that do you think he came here to find the man demanded gus quickly  it looks so to me  my gracious dave i think you are right say there is something mysterious about all this cried gus  exactly  let us go ashore by all means and see what nat is up to urged the big youth  dave was more than willing now that he had discovered the rowboat used by the wild man perhaps this island was the home of that mysterious individual if so what was the moneylenders son doing there had he business with the strange creature  maybe wed better not make any noise suggested gus as the boat was turned in to a convenient landingplace to this dave did not reply but they landed as silently as possible then the rowboat was hauled up out of sight between the bushes  from the craft used by the wild man a rude path ran up from the shore to the rocks beyond a short distance from the shore the boys saw the marks of a wet foot coming from the direction where lay the motorboat  that was made by nathe got his left foot wet said gus  i think so myself answered our hero  they followed the marks left by the wet foot over the rocks they headed for the upper end of the island where there was a small grove of straggly cedar trees here the marks faded away completely  well we know he came this way anyhow remarked gus he cant be very far off for the island isnt very big  i see a rude log cabin exclaimed dave and pointed through the cedars maybe that is where the wild man lives  if it is we want to go slow dave he may attack us  but what of nat if he is there  he may know the man and have some influence over him  i hardly think anybody could have any influence over that man he is as crazy as can be and not to be trusted  the two youths approached the old log cabin slowly keeping as much as possible in the shelter of the trees nobody was in sight nor did any sound reach their ears  presently the students found themselves within fifty feet of the cabin the door of which stood half open each looked at the other  im going ahead said dave resolutely he and his companion had provided themselves with sticks and gus had also picked up two stones  oh oh oh came of a sudden to their startled ears oh dear me  its nat ejaculated dave something has happened to him  maybe the wild man attacked him added gus  well soon see cried dave and started forward on a run  soon our hero was at the door of the cabin which he pushed wide open inside all was dark for it was growing late and the rude structure boasted of but one small window stuffed with cedar boughs to keep out the wind  nat where are you cried dave as his eyes sought to pierce the semidarkness  whowho is that calling me came in surprise from the center of the cabin  it is idave porter where are you and what happened where is the wild man  oh im caught fastin a trap groaned the moneylenders son oh help me out my ankle is almost broken  but the wild man queried gus who was close behind our hero  ii dont know where he is gasped nat oh say wont you please help me my ankle is fast in a trap oh how it hurts  wasnt the wild man here asked dave as he got out his matchbox to strike a light  noat least i havent seen him  dave soon had a match lit and with it set fire to a cedar bough placed in the rude fireplace of the cabin by the glare of this light he and gus looked around them and at their fellowstudent  the cabin was unfurnished excepting for a rude bench and a board placed on some piles of stones for a table in the fireplace were a kettle and a fryingpan and on the table the remains of a scanty meal of crackers eggs and apples a tin pail half filled with water was also handy  when dave and gus turned their attention to nat poole they had to stare in wonder nat sat on the floor nursing a bruised ankle that was caught fast between the jaws of an oldfashioned steel animaltrap the trap was chained to the floor and the release chain ran to a corner of the fireplace several feet beyond the sufferers reach  however did this happen asked gus although he and our hero could easily guess the answer to the question  help me get loose first groaned poor nat this thing is sawing down to the bone  dave saw the release chain which was held firm by a hook stepping over he unhooked it and then it was an easy matter to pry the jaws of the steeltrap apart as soon as this was done nat rose slowly to his feet making a wry face as he did so  ill be lame for lifei know i will he groaned oh dear how it hurts  you take care that you dont get bloodpoisoning from it warned gus when you get home wash it well and put some peroxide of hydrogen or something like that on it  bloodpoisoning oh dear and nat gave another groan  shall we help you back to your boat asked dave  if you will  where is the wild man questioned gus looking around  i dont know and i dont carejust now answered nat poole     chapter xiv  the bandanna handkerchief   nat poole could hardly walk on the injured leg so dave and gus supported him as the three left the rude cabin and headed for the shore of the island  do you know where the wild man is repeated gus who had not been satisfied by the reply given to the question before  i do not snapped the moneylenders son with a touch of his former tartness i havent seen him  but you know that cabin is where he lives put in our hero  i thought sobut i wasnt sure of it  did you see him come ashore nat  nothat is not today i saw him land here yesterday  and that is what brought you here today remarked gus  yes if you must know was the somewhat cold answer  see here nat do you know this wild man asked dave abruptly  me know him how should i know him demanded the moneylenders son but his apparent astonishment did not somehow ring nor look true  that is what i wanted to find out  i dont know himat least i dont think i do ive never seen him close enough to make sure maybe hes some fellow who belongs around here i wanted to find out about himjust as everybody else wants to find out thats all  want to have him caught and placed in an asylum asked gus  its not my business to place him anywhere cried nat hastily for all we know he may be harmless  not when he stops young ladies on the road and catches folks in steeltraps answered our hero with a faint smile  well thats right too grumbled the moneylenders son maybe he ought to be in an asylum  i think he is on this island now went on dave his rowboat is here anyway  say ill tell you what we can do cried gus take his boat with us then he cant get away and we can send the authorities over here to get him  thats an idea gus cried dave well do it  would that be fair to the man asked nat heerhe might starve to deathor try to swim to shore and get drowned  he cant starve to death in one night and i dont think hell drown himself the authorities can come over here early in the morning and round him up if he is here  ieri dont think much of your plan murmured nat and seemed much disturbed  in about a quarter of an hour the boys reached the island shore at the spot where nats motorboat was tied up they helped him get in and start up the engine he had been told how they had come to the island  if you want to you can tie your boat fast to the stern and ride back with me he said  all right nat well do it answered dave it is getting rather late and its a pretty stiff row to the school  the motorcraft was started up and sent along in the direction where the boys had left the oak hall rowboat their course took them past the spot where the wild mans boat had been tied up  why look its gone cried gus standing up and pointing to the place  true enough answered our hero he must have gone off in it while we were up to the cabin  he cant be very far away dave  the boys looked up and down the river but could catch no trace of the missing rowboat or the wild man in the meantime the motorcraft was moving forward where the other boat had been beached among the bushes  that is gone too ejaculated dave he has taken our boat  oh do you really think so asked gus he felt that he was responsible for the craft as he had taken it from the school boathouse  i certainly do think so said dave it was a neat trick to play  its a wonder he didnt take the motorboat too  maybe he didnt know how to run the boat and it was too heavy to start without the engine  i guess you are right came suddenly from nat look here  he had stooped down to pick something up from the grating on the motorboats bottom if was a torn and dirty bandanna handkerchief  the wild mans cried dave i remember it  i am glad he didnt get away with my boat returned the moneylenders son drawing a deep breath ill keep this handkerchief to remember him by  is it marked in any way questioned our hero perhaps it has his name or initials on it  oh i dont think so returned nat let us hurry up and get back to the school if we are late old haskers will be after us  go on and run the boat as fast as you please nat answered dave but i want to look at that handkerchief  rather unwillingly the moneylenders son passed the bandanna over it was now growing so dark that dave could see but little  wait ill light a match suggested gus and did so and by the protected but flickering flare our hero looked the handkerchief over in one corner there was a faint stamping  looks like rossmore sanitarium to me said dave slowly or it may be bossmore or crossmore the beginning is too faded to be sure  bossmore sanitarium queried nat and then he became silent and thoughtful a little later he asked for the bandanna and placed it in his pocket  the run in the motorboat to the school dock did not take long as soon as nats craft was properly housed dave and gus assisted the moneylenders son up the walk and across the campus  i suppose ive got to report the loss of the rowboat said gus ruefully  it wasnt your fault gus answered dave ill go with you to doctor clay  i cant go with my lame foot put in nat and he hobbled up to his dormitory eyed by several curious students who wanted to know how he had gotten hurt  the boys found the master of oak hall getting ready for supper he looked at them inquiringly as they entered his study in answer to his invitation  well well he exclaimed after listening to their story this is certainly odd i trust poole was not seriously hurt  i think he was more scared than hurt answered dave the trap scratched his ankle thats all i am sure it is not sprained or broken  but the rowboat put in gus i didnt mean  do not worry about that plum it was not your fault i am glad the wild man did not harm you i think you got off well after this you must be careful about how you go out after this remarkable creature  the master of the school then asked for more particulars of the occurrence and said he would notify the town authorities about the loss of the rowboat and ask that a general hunt take place for the wild man  they ought to be able to round him up sooner or later he added  there was considerable excitement in the school when it was learned that the wild man had been heard of again the boys looked for the strange individual and so did the town authorities and many farmers but nothing came of the search nat was called on to exhibit the bandanna handkerchief and did so nobody could make out the first part of the name on it for the handkerchief showed a small hole where the letters should be  that is queer said dave to roger and phil when he heard of this that handkerchief did not have a hole there when i looked at it  maybe nat put the hole there returned the senators son  why would he do that questioned phil  so that nobody would know what the name of the sanitarium really was i believe with dave that nat knows the man or knows about him and is trying to keep something a secret  hum maybe you are right mused the shipowners son  phil had perfected all his arrangements for his spread at the hotel and his guests for that occasion had been duly invited and all had accepted the invitation it had been arranged with mr dale that the boys should drive to the hotel in the school carryall and horsehair was to have his supper in town and later on bring them home no secret was made of the affair for this was not necessary  i am only sorry for one thing said phil to dave that is that i cant have the whole school there but that would go beyond my purse  well youll have enough phil to insure a good time answered our hero  the night was clear with numberless stars glittering in the heavens when the carryall drove around to the hall door and the boys piled in all were in the best of humor and they left the campus in a burst of song  ive been saving up for this cried ben havent eaten a mouthful for two days  say that puts me in mind of a story cried shadow once a poor streetboy was invited to a sundayschool picnic the ladies fed him all he could hold and then some at last when he couldnt eat another mouthful and saw some cake and pie and icecream going to waste what do you suppose he said  give it up shadow  he said say missus please save it fer me wont yer i wont eat fer a week honest an then ill come an finish it all up fer yer  good for the streetboy  say phil you wont have to save anything for me ill eat my share right now  ive been in training for this feed  shove the horses along horsehair we dont want the soup to get cold  im ashovin em along answered the carryall driver well git there in plenty o time  say phil as far as i am concerned you can have this affair pulled off once a month remarked buster  make it once a week piped in chip macklin and then luke watson commenced to sing a popular negro ditty and all joined lustily in the chorus  on and on rattled the carryall until the lights of oakdale shone in the distance the boys continued to sing while one or two blew freely on the tin horns they carried here and there somebody would come rushing to a window or door to learn what was doing  its them oak hall boys cried one old farmer my but they do have high times  so they do returned his wife but they are good boys she added for some of them had once aided her in capturing a runaway bull  with a grand flourish the carryall swept around the last corner and came to a halt in front of the hotel phil had hoped to see some extra lights lit and was somewhat disappointed to see only the regular lantern burning  i told him to light up freely and he said he would he whispered to dave  maybe he thought you meant the diningroom phil  the students piled out of the carryall and waited for phil as host to lead the way into the hotel all marched up the steps and into the broad hallway there they were confronted by the hotel proprietor who came to meet them in his shirtsleeves he looked completely bewildered  well we are here for that supper mr sparr cried phil i hope you are all ready for us  the hotel man looked at the boys in amazement his jaw dropped then he gasped out the words  well ill be jiggered     chapter xv  at the hotel   at once dave and all the other students who had come to the hotel with phil expecting a fine spread saw that something was wrong they looked questioningly at the shipowners son and at the hotel proprietor  whats the matter demanded phil quickly  matter repeated jason sparr thats just exactly what id like to know  youyou are ready for us arent you went on phil with a sudden catch in his voice  why should i be ready when you called the whole thing off growled the hotel man fine way to do i must say he continued with strong anger in his voice  called the whole thing off repeated phil me  yes you shouted jason sparr and after we had everything in fine shape too say dont you think my stuff is too good to send to the old ladies home he demanded  there must be some mistake here mr sparr put in our hero phil didnt call this spread off we are here for it as you can see  but he did call it offthis noon returned the hotel proprietor and he wasnt a bit nice about it either when i asked him what i should do with the extras i had ordered he told me to do as i pleasedsend em to the old ladies home or throw em away he didnt act a bit nice  say you chump you shouted phil growing suddenly angry i didnt send you any word at all about calling it off i  dont you call me a chump you young rascal shouted the hotel man in equal heat i got your message over the telephone  i never sent any interrupted phil  it must be a trick cried roger  who played it queried another student  maybe this is the work of some of the military academy fellows  like as not  but how did they learn that phil was going to give the spread  give it up  maybe some of our own fellows did itsome who didnt get an invitation to attend suggested chip  would any one be so mean asked buster  some of them might be murmured gus  i didnt send you any word went on phil in greater anger than ever  well i got word and so did professor smuller he was mad too because he lost another job taking yours  why didnt you make sure the word was sent by mr lawrence demanded ben you could have done that easily enough  i didnt think that was necessary this fellow said  i tell you i didnt send word shouted phil growing more angry every instant you might have known it was a trick  of course he might have known added ben he lowered his voice say phil if he doesnt give us the supper make him give your money back  sure hes got to give me the money back cried the shipowners son  see here you cant bulldoze me cried the hotel proprietor ive had trouble enough as it is i got ready for this spread and then you called it off and you were mighty sassy about it too ive lost a lot of money  a wordy war followed lasting the best part of a half an hour through this it was learned that the hotel man had prepared for the spread and so had the professor of music just after noon telephone messages had come in calling the whole affair off some hot words had passed over the wire and the hotel man was considerably ruffled the party talking to jason sparr had said that when the spread did come off it would be held elsewhereintimating that a better place than his hotel could be found  its all some trick to get my business away from me stormed the hotel man i wont stand for it  i didnt send the messages and i either want the spread or i want my money back declared phil stubbornly and then more words followed until it looked as if there might be a fight finally in a rage jason sparr ordered the students from his place  all right well go but you havent heard the end of this cried phil  youll catch it for treating us so meanly added ben  dont you threaten me or ill have the law on you roared jason sparr  perhaps ill call on the law myself answered phil and then unable to control himself he shook his fist at the hotel man then all the boys filed out of the place some bystanders looking on in wonder  well what do you think of this cried gus when outside  phil i wouldnt say anything more just nowyou are too excited said dave catching his chum by the arm  yes but that fellow is as mean asas dirt answered the shipowners son  he hasnt any right to keep phils money said one student  then the feast is called off is it said buster with something like a groan in his voice  and somebody is going to have the laugh on us added shadow say this puts me in mind of a story he added brightening once some boys were going  oh stow it shadow  this is no time for stories  id rather go down to the cemetery and weep  nobody is going to have the laugh on me cried phil well get something somewhere  right you are cried dave ive got it he added let us drive over to rockville and get something at the hotel there i know the proprietor and hes a nice man  better telephone to him first and make sure suggested roger  ill do it said phil  the carryall was brought around again and all piled in and drove down to a drug store where there was a telephone booth into the booth went phil to communicate with the hotel in rockville he came out smiling  its all fixed up and i guess well have something this time he said but just wait ill fix that mean jason sparr see if i dont  its quite a drive to rockville protested horsehair when they told the driver what was wanted  never mind it will do the horses good cried roger they are getting too fat standing still  say phil whispered dave if you havent got money enough along i can let you have some  good was the whispered return i was going to speak of that as soon as i got a chance  the affair at the oakdale hotel had put something of a damper on the crowd and all the talk was of how jason sparr had acted and who had been mean enough to play such a trick  maybe it was nat poole said chip  what makes you think that asked phil  oh he is mean enough for anything  if nat did this illill mash him cried phil with energy  cant you find out asked roger  ill trybut most likely the fellow who did it took care to cover up his tracks sparr didnt know where the messages came from  on and on rolled the carryall until the lights of rockville appeared in the distance by this time all of the students were decidedly hungry they rolled up to the little hotel and those with horns gave a couple of shrill blasts  this time there was a warm welcome by the host he came out bowing and smiling  did the best i could for you on such short notice he said as they entered next time if youll only give me a little more time  thats all right lets have what youve got cried buster he was hungry enough to eat anything  they were ushered into what was usually the private diningroom of the little hostelry the table had been spread out and was tastefully decorated with paper chrysanthemums made by the hotel mans daughter a parlorlamp and several others shed light on the scene  this looks good murmured roger  wait till you see what we get to eat answered sam it may be slimon such short notice  but he was agreeably mistaken the spread was all that could be desired there were oysters on the halfshell tomato soup fried chicken mashed potatoes lettuce salad olives and also coffee pie and various cookies it was served in home style by the hotel mans daughter and a hired girl  say this is fine cried buster smacking his lips  better maybe than if we had stayed at the other place added dave  only we havent got the music said phil he was glad that matters had taken such a nice turn but still angry over what had gone before  as they had already lost so much time the boys did not dare linger too long over the spread horsehair was given something to eat in another room and then they set out on the return songs were sung and jokes cracked and shadow was permitted to tell half a dozen of his best stories yet with it all the edge had been taken off the celebration and phil knew this as well as anybody and was correspondingly chagrined  ill make that man square up with me see if i dont he said to dave as they arrived at the school im not going to lose all that money  well be careful of what you do phil warned our hero dont get into a fight  the next day the shipowners son sent out two sharp letters one to jason sparr and the other to professor smuller he stated that he was not responsible for the tripup that had taken place and demanded his money be returned to him otherwise he would put the matter in the hands of the law  to these letters came speedy replies the musical professor said he was sorry a mistake had been made and he returned the amount paid to him and he further stated that if he could discover who had played the trick he would make that party settle up  thats decent of him said phil i am going to send him back five dollars for his trouble and this he did much to professor smullers satisfaction  the letter from jason sparr was entirely different he berated phil for the stand taken and stated that he would pay back nothing he added that he had learned how the crowd had gone to rockville to dine and said he was satisfied that it was all a trick to get patronage away from his hotel he added that he had had trouble enough with people from oak hall school and he wanted no more of it  i guess ill have to sue him growled phil on showing the letter to dave and roger  i dont think id bother answered dave put it down to experience and let it go at that  if you sued him it would cost as much as youd get and more added the senators son  humph i dont feel like swallowing it growled phil ill get it out of him somehow  he must have lost somethingif he got ready for the spread said dave  oh i dont think he lost much hes a close oneto my way of thinking responded the shipowners son     chapter xvi  the blowing up of the bridge   say this is something fierce dave  i agree with you roger i dont see how we are going to do such a long lesson  old haskers is getting worse and worse growled phil i think we ought to report it to doctor clay  just what i think came from ben he keeps piling it on harder and harder i think he is trying to break us  break us queried our hero looking up from his book  yes make us miss entirely you know  why should he want us to do that asked roger  then we wouldnt be able to graduate this coming june  would he be mean enough to do that asked dave  i think he would be mean enough for anything responded phil oh i am not going to stand it he cried  the boys had just come upstairs after an extra hard session in their latin class all were aroused over the treatment received at the hands of job haskers he had been harsh and dictatorial to the last degree and several times it had looked as if there might be an outbreak  the next day the outbreak came phil sprang up in class and denounced the unreasonable teacher and ben followed then dave and roger took a hand and so did buster and several others  sit down sit down cried job haskers growing white in the face sit down and keep quiet  i wont keep quiet answered the shipowners son you are treating us unfairly mr haskers and i wont stand for it  neither will i added ben  sit down i tell you stormed the instructor  but none of the students obeyed him and in a minute more the room was in an uproar one of the underteachers heard it and quickly sent for doctor clay  as the master of oak hall strode into the classroom there was a pause he mounted the platform and put up his hand and soon all became quiet  young gentlemen be seated he said in his strict but kindly fashion and instantly every student sat down then he turned to the teacher mr haskers what is the trouble he asked  the trouble is that certain students will not learn their lessons answered job haskers sourly i had to take them to task for it  who are those students  lawrence basswood porter morr beggs  that will do for the present lawrence stand up ordered doctor clay  phil did as requested and the eyes of the entire class were fastened on the shipowners son  now lawrence what have you to say for yourself went on the doctor  in a plain straightforward manner phil told his side of the story several times job haskers wanted to interrupt him but doctor clay would not permit this then ben was questioned and after that the master of the school turned to dave  is your complaint the same porter  yes sir  and yours morr  yes sir  what have you to say beggs  the same the lessons lately have been altogether too hardwe simply cant get through them we never had such long lessons before  i have given them only the regular lessons put in job haskers  ahem let us go over them and see what can be done responded the doctor if the students are willing to work we do not want to overburden them mr haskers  a discussion lasting over a quarter of an hour followed and in the end the lessons were cut down much to the satisfaction of the whole class who felt like cheering the head of the school the only person who was not satisfied was job haskers he was invited to go out with the doctor to his private office and came back some time later looking anything but happy  ill wager he got a calling down whispered phil to dave i hope he did  he was right about the calling down as he expressed it the master of oak hall had spoken very plainly to the instructor and given job haskers to understand that he must get along better with the boys in the future and treat them with more consideration or he would be asked to resign from the staff of the school  several days slipped by and during that time dave paid close attention to his lessons he had also a theme to write on the future of our country and he devoted considerable time to this hoping it would receive at least honorable mention even if it did not win the prize offered for the best production  come on down to town cried roger one afternoon as he rushed in big excitement on going to blow the railroad up  blow the railroad up queried our hero what sort of a joke is this roger  no joke at all you know the old stone bridge over the creek  sure  well the railroad wants to get rid of it and do it quickly so they can build another so the contractors are going to blow the old bridge up with dynamite at halfpast four oclock  lets go burst out phil it will be a great sightto see that old bridge go up  right you are cried ben  all the boys were enthusiastic and in the end fully fifty students got permission to go down to oakdale to see the old stone bridge destroyed  none of you must go very close warned doctor clay for dynamite is powerful stuffeight times more powerful than gunpowder  well keep away dont fear about that answered several  dynamite isnt to be fooled with added dave  say that puts me in mind of a story cried shadow a dutch laborer working on the railroad was much annoyed by the other laborers coming along and knocking his stiff old derby hat over his eyes at last he got good and mad and when he saw a chance he stole a stick of dynamite from the shanty where it was kept he stuck the dynamite in his hat and then went around to the other laborers now chust hit dot hat vonce again of you dare he said  and nobody dared added roger as a general laugh went up  i once saw a fellow take a stick of dynamite and burn it like a torch remarked ben it gave me a cold chill to see him do it  and it didnt explode queried roger  no but i heard afterwards that if he had struck it ever so lightly it might have blown us all as high as a kite  it sure is great stuff remarked phil say he went on suddenly i wish they were going to blow up old sparrs hotel instead of the bridge  so do i added ben hes about as mean as they make em  that man ought certainly to have something done to him was rogers comment  well he wont make a success of his hotel if he treats everybody as he treated phil said dave  he doesnt deserve any success growled the shipowners son  when the students arrived in the vicinity of the old bridge they found a large crowd assembled including many acquaintances from rockville military academy and people from the town red flags had been placed around and nobody was allowed to get very close to the old structure  there is where they have the dynamite stored said phil pointing to a shanty not far away see the sign  thats a good spot to steer clear of returned dave with a grin  oh im not afraid of the stuff answered the shipowners son  in the crowd of men and boys the students became more or less separated there was a great thrill when the word was passed that everything was in readiness for the blowing up of the old bridge  shes going cried roger to dave  boom came the dull heavy roar and the boys saw the stones of the old bridge flying upward in all directions the ground shook all around them and the water from the creek was splashed on high a great cloud of smoke and dust filled the air then came silence followed by a wild cheering from the younger element  certainly a great sight was daves comment  too bad it didnt last longer sighed buster  it wasnt quite as big as i thought it would be said luke i thought some of the stones would fly about a mile high  good enough for a free exhibition put in gus beats fireworks all hollow  the boys walked down to the ruins of the old bridge and hung around for the best part of a half an hour then in groups of five or six they walked to town to look around there before returning to oak hall dave and his chums passed jason sparrs hotel he was on the veranda and scowled at them and phil and some of the others scowled in return  have you done anything about that sparr matter yet phil asked one of the lads  no but i will soon you wait and see was the growledout reply  on the main street of the town some of the boys separated to do a little shopping and then some walked to the school while others got in the carryall that happened to be at hand as a consequence some of the students did not get back to oak hall until some time after the supper hour  dave was alone when he entered the dininghall and he was surprised to see that neither phil nor roger was present ben was also absent and likewise shadow  didnt some of them come in with you he asked of buster  gus and luke did was the reply i dont know where the others are  the meal was almost at an end when phil ben and roger made their appearance they had but little to say but dave could see that something was wrong  had another wrangle with jason sparr explained phil after the meal he followed me to one of the stores and i told him just what i thought of him  and he threatened to have phil arrested for defamation of character added ben  but he didnt dare to do it declared the shipowners son  better let him alone advised dave youll gain nothing by keeping in hot water over it phil  that night all of the boys had to study hard and consequently they retired to their dormitories early the only exception was polly vane who had to go to oakdale to meet a relative who would stop off but who was going away again on the midnight train  the boys studied until ten oclock and then retired dave was completely tired out and his head had hardly touched the pillow when he was sound asleep  he was awakened about two hours later by the sounds of excited talking he opened his eyes to behold polly vane standing in the dormitory fully dressed while phil was sitting on the edge of the bed and ben and roger and some others were just rousing up  whats going on dave asked sleepily  a whole lot if what polly says is true answered the shipowners son  but it is true upon my word cried the girlish student i heard the explosion myself  what explosion asked several  an explosion in oakdale tonight answered polly somebody tried to dynamite jason sparrs hotel     chapter xvii  a serious accusation   instantly there was great excitement in the dormitory and all of the students crowded around polly to learn what he might have to say  it was this way dont you know said the scholarly youth i went to oakdale to see my uncle who stopped off on his trip from portland to st louis he wanted to ask me about some family matters and he didnt have time to come to the hall i went down in the buggy  oh never mind that polly tell about the explosion interrupted roger  well i had just seen my uncle to the midnight train and was getting into the buggy to come back when i heard a low boom coming from the direction of sparrs hotel the stationmaster and i were the only people around and i asked him what the noise meant but he said he didnt know then he jumped into the buggy with me to find out we drove to the hotel and there was excitement enough i can tell you the girls and women folks were screaming wildly and mr sparr and some men were running around not knowing what to do soon a crowd began to collect and then we found out that a wing of the buildingwhere the diningroom ishad been blown up some men from the railroad said it had been done by dynamitethe kind used for blowing up that old bridge  was anybody hurt asked dave  nobody but an old man who was sleeping in the house next to the addition he got so scared he jumped from an upper window and sprained his ankle oh that diningroom is a sight i can tell you one end is completely gonethe wall away from the main houseand all the tables and chairs and ornaments smashed and the roof is full of holes  how was it done questioned gus  the dynamite was placed at the side of the diningroom foundation according to the railroad men and it was set off by some sort of clockwork answered polly  and who did it asked shadow  they dont know yet but sparr suspects phil that is why i woke him up as soon as i came in continued the girlish student  suspects me exclaimed the shipowners son  yes he says you are the only one who would do such a thingyou and the crowd who have been backing you up  well i never  maybe he means me too murmured ben  he does and all the others in the crowd too he thinks its a plot to get square because he wouldnt give phil his dinner money back  i had nothing to do with it declared phil stoutly  nor i added ben  well i am sure i wasnt in it said dave i didnt dream of such a thing  nor did i added roger and some others  the news soon spread through several dormitories and the boys discussed the startling happening in whispers phil was greatly disturbed  i didnt do it but i know hell try to fasten it on me he told dave he did not add that he had written to his father about the affair of the feast and his parent had sent a warning letter back ordering his son to have nothing more to do with jason sparr  the next morning the news was all over the school nat poole heard of it and he and some of his cronies declared it as their opinion that phil and some others were to blame this brought on a fistic encounter between ben and the moneylenders son and the latter got a black eye in consequence  you shant say i did itor had anything to do with it said ben when nat backed away having had enough of the battle  humph just wait till the law has its say retorted nat then maybe youll get what is coming to you  some of the boys wanted to go to townto see the damaged hotelbut doctor clay would not permit this in the meantime the wreckage was being cleared away and the authorities and jason sparr were doing their best to locate the author or authors of the crime  then came a great surprise in the shape of a letter delivered in a mysterious way to the hotelkeeper he was seated in the hotel office in the evening talking to one of the town constables when a missive was hurled at him through an open window he dodged at first fearing more dynamite but when he saw it was only a letter he picked it up and turned it over it was addressed to him and marked private and personal  wonder what this is he mused and walked over to the light to read the letter it was written on a single sheet of paper in lead pencil and evidently in a disguised hand it contained but a few lines as follows    if you want to catch the fellows who blew up your hotel have   these boys of oak hall school arrested at once philip lawrence   benj basswood david porter roger morr and joseph beggs they   were together when it was done and one or more of them surely did   it                                                      one who knows the hotelkeeper read this letter several times and then stuffed it into his pocket then he went into the next room and drew from a drawer several things wrapped up in a newspaper  i am going down to see the squire he said to the constable you can come along if you want to  what was in the letter  the names of the rascals who blew up my hotel  what you dont mean it jason  yes i do  who sent the letter  thats a secret but come on well talk it over with squire thompson aint no time to waste and then the hotel man went off to interview the leading legal light of the town  the conference at the squires office lasted the best part of two hours at this jason sparr produced the contents of the package several things picked up near the hotel at the time of the explosiona tan glove somewhat worn two iron rings an empty paper box marked l in one corner a whip handle and a clocklike contrivance which had been used to set off the dynamite he told of his trouble with phil and his chums of the threats made and produced the letter received so mysteriously  looks kind of plain to me squire he said dont you think so  it isnt for me to say replied the squire cautiously but if you want to swear out warrants for those boys arrest  aint i justified  sure you are put in the constable who happened to be the squires brotherinlaw i wouldnt waste no time on it he thought he saw in this a job for himself with some fat fees  if you have them arrested youve got to prove your case said squire thompson slowly its a serious business sparr  but this letter says they are guilty  lock em up and make em confess broke in the constable give em the third degree he added he had read something of how city criminals were occasionally treated and he wished to air his knowledge  ill do it cried jason spar ill show em they cant insult me and take away my trade and then try to blow up my hotel ill have em all locked up then we can examine em one by one and get em tangled up and make em confess  after much trouble the warrants for the arrest of phil ben dave roger and buster were made out the constable wanted to serve them at once but it was decided at the last moment to wait until the next morning to see if any new evidence regarding the crime might be forthcoming  the constable went home sworn to secrecy but he had to tell his wife and her sister of the affair and the news got to the ears of a man who boarded with them this fellow who was named andy prime chanced to know dave quite well our hero having once done him a favor early in the morning prime drove past the school and seeing dave on the campus hailed him  come over here i want to tell you something porter said prime mysteriously  what do you want asked dave goodnaturedly  ride a bit with me will you i dont want nobody to hear us went on the man lowering his voice  wondering what was coming dave got up on the seat of the mans wagon and they drove to the far end of the oak hall grounds there andy prime told of all he had learned  please dont say i told ye he pleaded it might git me in trouble but you did me a good turn onct an i aint forgot it  thank you prime i wont tell who told me answered dave  thet old skinflint o a sparr deserved to have his buildin blown up  perhaps but we didnt do it i can assure you of that if mr sparr has us arrested hell get in hot water answered our hero and then he got out of the wagon and andy prime drove on  dave at once carried the news to those immediately concerned all were very indignant and some were scared  say i wont stand for being arrested cried phil in horror its too much of a disgrace  my folks would never get over it added ben  it would just about kill my mother if i was locked up came from buster  well ill stand it if i have to said roger but ill make that fellow suffer for it later he added bitterly  all thoughts of going to school that morning were abandoned by the five boys they talked the situation over and determined to go down the road and await the arrival of the constable andy prime having said that hickson would come by ten oclock  this is awful gasped phil shaking his head dolefully say dave i cant stand it  wait until we hear what the constable has to say  he wont say anythinghell just drag us to the oakdale lockup put in ben  i wonder what my dad will say to that when he hears of it murmured roger the newspapers are bound to make a spread of it son of a u s senator jailed for blowing up a hotel or something like that oh it makes me sick  plainly the majority of the students were very nervous the only one who kept calm was dave and even he was much disturbed all walked along the road keeping a sharp eye out for the appearance of paul hickson  here he comes cried phil as a covered wagon came along the road driven by the keeper of the oakdale jail on the front seat beside the driver were the constable and jason sparr  hi you boys shouted the constable as the wagon came closer i want to see you  what do you want demanded dave stepping to the front  we want you for one cried the hotelkeeper be careful hickson that none of em get away he added  i dont know one from tudder said the constable doubtfully  this is just the bunch we are after unless i am mistaken went on the hotel man that is lawrence there and basswood and this is porter and i think that is morr and he pointed to the various students  good enough boys in the name of the law i call on you to halt declared the constable pompously  mr sparr what does this mean demanded dave  it means that i am going to have the whole bunch of you arrested shouted the hotel man harshly you blew up my hotel and i can prove it ive got the evidence against every one of you i am going to have you arrested right now and sent to prison and he shook his fist at the boys  the evidence against us faltered phil  yes sir the plain clear evidence went on the hotelkeeper dramatically ive got you just where i want you i am going to send every one of you to prison for five or ten years     chapter xviii  the meeting on the road   there was an intense silence following the announcement of jason sparr that he intended to send dave and his chums to prison for attempting to blow up the hotel in the meantime the hotel man and the constable got down from the seat of the covered wagon  ive got the warrants fer the arrest boys said constable hickson somewhat importantly  mr sparr id like a word with you said dave as calmly as he could speak under the circumstances  i aint got no more to say than ive said returned jason sparr stubbornly you done it and i can prove it the constable is going to do his duty and arrest you  dave ii wont stand for it whispered phil hoarsely its terrible ii cant stand it and he began to back away  hi there stop yelled the hotel man stop him hickson dont let him get away  you shant arrest me for nothing cried the shipowners son and like a flash he turned around and started off on a run  come back here phil called out dave come back you are making a mistake by running away  but phil did not hear nor did ben and buster who had also taken to their heels roger ran a few steps then halted and came back to our heros side  you are right dave he said its best to face the music  phil ben and buster had turned towards oak hall phil was in the lead but the others soon caught up to him  whawhat are you gogoing to ddo panted ben  im not going to let them arrest me answered phil i didnt do it and im not going to jail  let us hide until we can get our folks to help us suggested buster the thought of going to a lockup filled him with dread  im going to notify my folks too said ben  the trouble is i dont know where my folks are just now came from the shipowners son my father went on a trip on one of his vessels and mother is visiting relatives  the boys had kept on running on the road but now as they saw the constable after them they turned and dashed into a sidepath leading to the river  a motorboat cried ben a few seconds later  its the kingsley boat added buster i know tom will let us use ithe said i could do it once let us go across in it  all leaped on board and ben started up the engine while buster took the wheel there came a put put as the flywheel was turned over and the little craft which belonged to a boy living on the riverbank headed out into the leming river  in the meantime while constable hickson was running after the fugitives jason sparr and the driver of the covered wagon confronted dave and roger  dont you try to run bawled the hotelkeeper  im armed added the keeper of the town lockup suggestively  i dont intend to run mr sparr answered dave  why should we run since we have done nothing wrong added the senators son he tried to follow daves example and remain calm but he was tremendously disturbed  did those three fellows do it alone queried the hotel man eagerly if they did you had better confess to it and clear yourselves  none of us are guilty answered dave  i know better  you do not since we didnt do it mr sparr i dont see how you can prove that we didunless you have manufactured some evidence against us went on our hero pointedly a new idea coming into his head  i aint manufactured no evidence bawled jason sparr didnt that young rascal of a lawrence say hed get square with me and didnt all of you say the same wasnt you down to the blowing up of the bridge right where they had all that dynamite stored wasnt some of the dynamite sticks stolen didnt you fellows come right by the hotel afterwards wasnt the blowing up done by clockwork made to go off hours after it was set you cant tell me you are guilty besides i got other evidencei got a letter added the hotelkeeper shrewdly  a letter about us  jason sparr nodded  saying we were guilty  yes  who wrote it  never mind that youre guilty and you know it just wait till hickson comes back with them others and ill show you a thing or two continued the hotel man harshly  mr sparr i said i wanted to talk to you and i do want to said dave after a pause you will find it to your advantage to listen to me you have got this whole thing settled in your own mind but you are dead wrong you intend to have us locked up for something we didnt do to have us locked up will blacken our characters and blacken the reputation of oak hall my folks are respectable people and so are the folks of the other boys do you think they will stand for this sort of thing and do you think doctor clay will stand for it if you do you are greatly mistaken if you have us arrested on this charge which is absolutely false ill get my folks to sue you for false imprisonment and defamation of character and i know the other fellows will do the same and you can rest assured that the charges against you will be pushed to the limits of the law  at this plain talk jason sparrs jaw dropped several times he was on the point of interrupting but thought better of it  well nower he stammered when dave had finished  my father is a united states senator said roger you dont suppose he will let a matter like this pass unnoticed if you do anything to besmirch our family name youll take the consequences  your father is a united states senator faltered jason sparr  he is and daves father is a rich man and so is phil lawrences father of course our money has nothing to do with it excepting that it will enable us to stand up for our rights in the courts and get able lawyers to defend us we are innocent of all wrongdoing if anybody is in the wrong it is you for you cheated phil lawrence out of the money he advanced to you for that spread we were to have at your hotel  cheated him cried the hotelkeeper  that is what it amounted to for you took his money and gave him nothing in return  he called the spread off  he did not and we can prove it said dave following up what he thought looked like an advantage why if he wanted to do it phil could have you locked up for swindling  what me locked up cried the hotel man  certainly why not its as reasonable as your charge against usmore reasonable in fact for you kept his money and gave him nothing in return went on our hero warmly  well now what do you know about that grumbled jason sparr turning to the driver of the covered wagon but the lockup man merely shrugged his shoulders privately he was of the opinion that the boys were not such rascals as had been pictured  if those fellows wasnt guilty why did they run away continued jason sparr after an awkward pause  because you scared them responded roger i would have run away myself if it hadnt been for dave  humph  all looked along the road constable hickson had disappeared having followed the runaways down to the river presently he came back out of breath from his exertions  did you get em queried the hotelkeeper eagerly  no they got away in a motorboat  a motorboat repeated dave and roger and looked at each other in astonishment  yes went up the river out of sight said paul hickson too bad but weve got two of em anyway he added looking at our hero and the senators son  i wanted lawrence more than i did the others grumbled jason sparr he was doing some deep thinking and his face showed that he was much disturbed  mr sparr just remember what i said remarked dave pointedly if you go ahead take my word for it it will cost you dear  say hickson well drop this matter for the present said the hotelkeeper in a low tone  drop it ejaculated the constable aint you goin to have these two took up  not just now ieri want to get more evidence first if i can we can get them any time we want them  but who is going to pay me for my trouble ive got them warrants to serve right in my pocket and  ill fix that up with you answered the hotel man in a whisper come on we can come back later and then the hotel man said something to the driver of the wagon the latter merely nodded and got back to his seat jason sparr climbed up beside him and the constable slowly followed  i dont understand went on the constable but jason sparr merely pinched his arm and he stopped short  just remember this aint settled yet cried the hotelkeeper to dave and roger im going to look into it a bit deeper before i make a move thats all i know some of you done it and ill have you in prison for it yet see if i dont and he shook his head grimly and then the covered wagon was turned around and the three men drove off in the direction of oakdale  oh dave do you think theyll come back cried roger when the men were out of hearing  there is no telling what they will do roger but you can make up your mind to one thingsparr wont come back until he has more evidence than he has at present  but how can he get evidence surely you dont think phil and the others guilty even if they did run away  no i think phil and the others are as innocent as we are but i cant understand some things somebody used that dynamite and somebody wrote a letter to sparr about us the question is who was it  could it be nat poole  i dont think nat would be bad enough to try to blow up a hotel  it certainly was an awful thing to do roger drew a long breath what shall we do now go back to school  we might as well if we dont old haskers will be after us again  do you think phil and the others will come back  why not as soon as they have time to think it over theyll realize it is best to face the music answered dave  he and roger returned to oak hall they had missed one class but fortunately that was one presided over by mr dale and he readily excused them when they said they had had some personal matters of importance to attend to and would explain later  it is bound to come out sooner or later said dave to his chum so we might as well take doctor clay and mr dale into our confidence  i suppose you are right answered the senators son nevertheless he heaved a deep sigh as he thought of what might be the outcome of the trouble what if after all jason sparr should concoct some sort of evidence against them and send them all to prison     chapter xix  looking for the runaways   when dave and roger went to the midday meal in the diningroom they looked all over for phil ben and buster but the three were not in sight  dave they havent come back yet  so i see returned our hero and he was much disturbed he ate sparingly and the senators son also had but little appetite for the meal  say whats become of those chaps questioned shadow  ill tell you later answered dave dont say anything nowand tell the others to keep quiet too  but such a happening could not be kept quiet and soon it was whispered around that phil ben and buster were missing this presently got to the ears of andrew dale and the head assistant teacher sought out dave for an explanation  i understand you went out with lawrence basswood and beggs this morning porter said the teacher they are not yet back do you know where they went  they went off in a motorboat that is all i know about that part of it mr dale roger morr and i would like to speak to you and doctor clay in private it is very important went on our hero  very well come at once to the office and i will call the doctor  a little later found the two youths in the office with doctor clay and his head assistant there as briefly as he could dave told his story and roger corroborated what was said the head of the school was deeply interested and not a little alarmed  this is certainly serious he declared with a grave shake of his head it reflects not only on you but on this school i must look into this at once and then he asked many questions and andrew dale did the same  running away makes it look bad for lawrence beggs and basswood remarked mr dale they should have stood their ground as morr and porter did  that hotel man and the constable probably scared them so they did not know what they were doing returned doctor clay he turned to the boys you have no idea where they went  no sir excepting that they went up the river in the kingsley motorboat they know tom kingsley quite well and he lets them use the boat once in a while  do you think you could find them if i let you off to do so  we could try sir  then you may go at once tell them it was very foolish to run away and urge them to come back at once added doctor clay  a little more conversation followed and then dave and roger left the office and started on the search for the runaways  we ought to have a motorboat ourselves to follow them up the riverthat is if they went any distance said the senators son  we might try to borrow one roger  not nat pooleshe wouldnt lend it to us  i know that  the two students walked to the river and looked up and down the stream a rowboat and a sailboat were in sight but that was all  there is jack laplow in his sloop cried dave mentioning a riverman they knew the wind is blowing up the stream maybe hell take us along  they hailed the riverman who made a living by doing all sorts of jobs on the stream he did not have much to do just then and readily agreed for a small amount to take them up the river and bring them back  we want to find some fellows who are in the kingsley motorboat explained dave have you seen anything of them  the riverman had not but said he would help to watch out for the lads dave and roger hopped aboard the sloop and soon the little craft was standing up the leming river with jack laplow at the tiller  it was a warm clear day and had the boys not been distressed in mind they would have enjoyed the sail immensely but as it was they were very sober so much so in fact that the old riverman at length remarked  whats wrongsomebody hurt or are ye going to a funeral  no funeral answered dave with a forced laugh but we are in a hurry to find those three fellows  well i dont see no motorboat yet answered jack laplow  one thing is certain if it went up the river its got to come down said roger  they may get out and send it back answered our hero  but dave surely you dont think but dave put up his hand for silence and nodded in the direction of the boatman and the senators son said no more  a mile and a half were covered and they were just passing one of the many islands in the river when jack laplow gave a shout  there is the motorboat now  boat ahoy shouted dave and then as they drew closer he saw that it was really the kingsley craft he was chagrined to see that only a man was on board a fellow who was running the boat very slowly  where are those boys who were aboard demanded our hero as the motorboat came closer  is this your boat asked the man on board in return  no but my friends were on that boat where are they  left the boat at snogs point and hired me to bring her back i dont know much about motorboats so im running kind o slow explained the man  snogs point repeated roger where were they going  dont ask me for i dont know they was in a tremenjous hurry i know that its all right aint it went on the man quickly  oh yes it was all right answered dave and then they allowed the man to go on his way  illustration there is the motorboat nowpage 186  want to go up to snogs point asked the man of the sloop  yesand as quickly as you can get there replied dave  as the wind was in the right direction it did not take long the point was a rocky cliff with a stretch of sand at its base here the boys jumped ashore  want me to wait for you asked the riverman  wait for half an hour said dave then if we are not back you can go back and so it was arranged  in the sand our hero and roger could plainly see the marks of the motorboat and many footprints they followed the footprints to a road leading through a stretch of woods and then came out on a highway leading to barrelton  the town is about half a mile from here wonder if they went there mused roger  maybe we can learn something at the nearest farmhouse suggested dave  they hurried on and presently reached a farmhouse set close to the road with a barn on the other side at a grindstone a tall thin boy was sharpening a sickle  yes i saw them fellers he drawled when asked about the runaways they was walking to town to beat the cars i thought they must be in one o them crosscountry races or something like that  come on cried dave to his chum then he turned back suddenly do you know anything about the trains from barrelton  aint many trains from there answered the youth at the grindstone  but do you know what there are  theres a train north jest about due now  and what is next  a train south a leetle after four oclock an the freight goes through at seven  hurry roger cried dave  do you think theyd take a train dave  i dont knowi hope not  the two boys set off on a run taking it easy at first so as not to get winded they passed a number of farms and presently came in sight of barrelton so called because of the barrel factory located there from a distance they had heard the whistle of a locomotive and knew that the northbound train had stopped at the station and gone on  there is the station cried dave pointing up the railroad tracks they continued to run and did not stop until they gained the platform here they met the ticket agent  the train just went didnt it asked dave and as the agent nodded he went on did three young fellows like ourselves get on  if they did i didnt see em answered the man  oh cried roger maybe they didnt take the train after all  let us hope so  somewhat out of breath the two boys tramped around barrelton looking for phil and the others and asking about them but nobody appeared to have seen the runaways and not a trace of them was to be found anywhere  all we can do is to get something to eat and take the other train for oakdale said roger after they had satisfied themselves that the runaways were nowhere in that vicinity the walking around had made him hungry  they procured some pie and milk at a little stand near the station and shortly after four oclock took the way train for oakdale and walked to the school they went directly to the doctors office the master of oak hall listened patiently to what they had to tell  i am sorry you did not find them he said gravely it was very foolish of them to run away very i trust they will come back of their own accord soon  will you see mr sparr about the matter asked dave  yes porter and i wish you and morr to go with me  the interview took place that evening the boys and the doctor driving down to the hotel after supper jason sparr treated the master of the hall politely but said very little  when i make my next move ill have a lawyer he said i know somebody tried to blow up my hotel and i think it was some of your boysthat lawrence boy especially but i aint going to have em arrested until i can prove it  very well answered doctor clay and in the meantime you had better keep quiet or you may have a suit for damages on hand  on the day following there was something of a sensation the weekly newspaper issued in a nearby town came out with a thrilling account of the dynamiting of the diningroom of the hotel in the account appeared the following    there is strong evidence pointing to the fact that the outrageous   deed was perpetrated by some schoolboys who held a grudge against   mr sparr they are known to have been present at the blowing up   of the old stone bridge and were seen near the shanty where the   sticks of dynamite were kept and one boy of the town says he saw   a young man coming from the shanty with something in his hand mr   sparr has the authorities at work and is piling up his evidence   and the arrest of the rascally schoolboys may be hourly expected   it is said that some of the boys have run away but the   authorities have an idea where they can be located the town   committee is thinking of offering a reward for the capture and   conviction of the rascals for the safety of our citizens the   weekly globeleader hopes the evildoers will soon be   apprehended  no names were mentioned in this account but everybody in oakdale and vicinity knew that the boys of oak hall were alluded to and there was much talk over what might be done doctor clay felt the disgrace keenly and dave and roger were equally affected  what are we going to do dave asked the senators son  i dont know returned our hero but weve got to do something thats certain     chapter xx  the wild man again   roger i have an idea  what is it dave  i may be mistaken but ive been thinking that perhaps that wild man did the blowing up at the hotel  what makes you think that questioned the senators son putting down the book he had been trying to study  a day had passed after the events recorded in the last chapter and so far no word had come in concerning phil and the other runaways doctor clay had sent for a private detective to assist in locating them and also to try if possible to clear up the mystery concerning the hotel affair  well in the first place it would be just like a crazy man to do such a thing wouldnt it  perhaps  in the second place i have heard that the wild man was seen around when the bridge was blown up  is that so who saw him  mr tyson the farmer who lives near the bridge  why didnt he try to capture the fellow  he did but in the excitement of the blowing up the wild man slipped him and that isnt all mr tyson saw him coming from the vicinity of that shanty where the dynamite was kept  say that is certainly interesting cried the senators son when did you learn all this  less than an hour ago mr tyson brought some vegetables to the school and i had a talk with him  did he think the wild man blew up the hotel  no he didnt connect the two  hum what do you think of doing about it  i hardly know i wish we could round up the wild man  plenty of folks wish that  i think he hangs out somewhere along the river or on one of the islands  maybe nat poole knows  i hardly think soalthough i am sure nat wants to find the fellowwhy i cant imagine  during those trying days job haskers was as harsh and dictatorial to dave and roger as ever and several times he passed sneering remarks about those who were missing  you may think as you please doctor clay said he to the master of the hall i feel sure in my mind that lawrence and those other boys are guilty i do not think mr sparr would accuse them if he was not pretty sure of his ground  well he has not dared to have those warrants served replied the doctor dryly  because he is afraid there will be a great deal of money used in the case to fight him  mr haskers do you stand up for mr sparr i thought you had had some difficulty yourself with him once  that was but a small affair i think he is perfectly honest and that he wants to do what is right  possibly but he did not treat lawrence very fairly in the matter of that dinner that was ordered  that was a mistake and mr sparr lost as much as he got yes i think those boys guilty and in the end you will find out that i am right added job haskers as he went off smiling grimly to himself as if it was a pleasure to him to have the boys thus accused  the next morning came another surprise on getting up dave noticed that something was missing from the dormitory phils suitcase was gone likewise a portion of his clothing and also the valises of ben and buster and part of their outfits  well this beats the dutch exclaimed roger on learning the news who took them do you suppose  dont ask me roger  maybe they came themselves and got them suggested sam  if they did wouldnt we hear them asked gus  talk about a mysterious disappearance cried shadow say this puts me in mind of a story once some fellows  oh stow it shadow cried the senators son lets get busy and try to find out what this means maybe they are back at the school  all of the boys dressed hastily and took a look around but they could find no trace of the runaways yet the travelingbags and the clothing were certainly gone  if i didnt know better id say the place was haunted cried luke  oh dont say that exclaimed polly vane looking scared i dont wish to see any ghosts  doctor clay was informed of what had occurred and he had another search conducted but it was all to no purposethe things were missing and that was all there was to it  it may well be imagined that with so much going on it was next to impossible for dave and roger to study yet they did their best not wishing to drop behind again as they had during the trip to cave island job haskers did not let up on them and many a time they wished he would leave oak hall and that they might never see him again  one afternoon roger came to dave in great haste and beckoned for him to come outside  i think we had better follow nat poole said the senators son i think there is something in the wind  what makes you think that  nat has been packing a valise and he has put in the strangest thingssome clothing some bottles of medicine some rope and a thing that looks like a crown made of brass  a crown made of brass oh roger maybe that wild manwho calls himself the king of sumatra  thats the idea dave i see youve caught on come on before nat gets away from us  our hero needed no further urging and soon he and roger were on their way to the gymnasium where the senators son had by pure accident seen nat poole packing the things mentioned in his handbag  as they approached they saw the moneylenders son trundle out a bicycle he owned and mount it swinging his valise over his shoulder by a strap he looked back to see if he was being observed but dave and roger were on guard and quickly dove out of sight behind some bushes  well have to follow on our own wheels said dave  their old bicycles were still in the gymnasium they were not in very good condition but the tires were airtight and that was enough without delay they trundled the machines out and leaping into the saddles pedaled after nat  the course of the moneylenders son was along the river road and he followed this for the best part of a mile then he branched off on a sideroad leading to what were known as the chester hills it was hard work pushing the machine up the hills but nat kept at it steadily and dave and roger followed strange to say the moneylenders son did not once look back after leaving the school evidently he was of the opinion that nobody had observed his departure or if so had taken no particular notice of it  from the top of one of the hills nat struck off on another sideroad leading to a little valley here was a brook and at a point where it widened out a small and really beautiful island in the center of the island a cabin had been built by some sportsman and a rustic bridge connected the resort with the shore  reaching the rustic bridge nat dismounted and with his valise still over his shoulder walked towards the cabin as he did this dave and roger came quite close and they too dismounted keeping in the shelter of some trees near by  stop i command you in the name of the king of sumatra to stop  the call came from the cabin and a second later the wild man appeared he was clad in a blue pair of trousers and over his shoulder was thrown a big red blanket on his head rested a crown made of a tin pail cut into sharp points  i salute you king of sumatra called out nat making a low bow  ha it is my servant that speaks said the wild man bow low bow i tell you and he flourished a wooden sword that he held in one hand  it is the wild man sure enough whispered roger in great excitement  and evidently he has been expecting nat returned dave let us get closer and see what is up  they advanced with care until they were behind a tree at the very foot of the rustic bridge in the meantime nat had gone forward bowing low at every step  i have brought you something my king cried the moneylenders son something of great importance to you  what is it demanded the wild man his curiosity excited  a new crown it is of gold a beautiful crown  ha ha that is well the king of sumatra needs a new crown cried the wild man strutting up and down in front of the cabin give it to me that i may see if it fits and he held out his empty hand  let us go into the cabin and you can sit in your chair of state while i place it on your head said nat in a soothing persuasive voice you will like it i know  did you bring your army with you demanded the wild man suspiciously  no i am all alonethe army is at oakdale answered nat  again tis well come in and i will sit on the throne and with a sweeping gesture of welcome the wild man stepped back into the cabin and nat poole followed  now what do you make of this whispered roger looking at dave in wonder  i have an idea roger answered our hero nat knows that man in fact he is well acquainted with him i think he is going to try to make him a prisoner  a prisoner oh i see for the glory of it eh  no to get him back to some sanitarium as quietly as possible i think nat would like to do it without anybody around here being the wiser  oh then maybe the fellow is some relative of the pooles  possibly or a close friend but come on let us see what happens we ought to try to capture the man ourselves  to be sure but i dont see how we are going to do it we are unarmed and they say crazy folks are fearfully strong  well have to watch our chances  the cabin had a window as well as a door and to the former the two boys crawled peering through a vine that grew over the opening they saw that the wild man had seated himself on a rude bench which he called his throne it was covered with a tattered carpet and some cabalistic signs in blue chalk nat had placed his valise on the ground and was opening it he brought out the crown and also the rope but took care to conceal the latter under his coat  now you must close your eyes and sit perfectly still while i place the crown on your head said the moneylenders son i will have to do it from behind for that is the way they do it in england and germany  do they do it in russia that way too demanded the wild man and his eyes took on a glowing look as he gazed at the brass crown  of course  then let it be so and the wild man sat back on the bench and closed his eyes and stroked his straggly beard  quickly nat stepped behind the man and while he fumbled with the crown with one hand he brought out the rope with the other he was greatly excited and his hands trembled  now sit perfectly still while i count fifty said the moneylenders son then when i  he did not finish for at that instant the wild man let out a sudden yell and leaped to his feet he ran to the doorway and the next moment came face to face with dave and roger     chapter xxi  something of a clew   ha ha you are the army sent to capture me are you but i am not to be captured take the cannons away bring up the artillery forward the light brigade victory for the king of sumatra oh if only i had a company of trained monkeys i would show you how to fight  thus speaking the wild man danced around before dave and roger swinging his wooden sword close to their heads indeed our hero had to dodge back to keep from being hit  hello you here cried nat coming from the cabin you followed me did you he scowled deeply its just like you dave porter  nobody shall follow the king of sumatra went on the wild man with a cunning look at the three students away out of my sight he yelled  he dashed past dave and roger moving towards the rustic bridge our hero caught him by the arm but received a blow in the face that staggered him roger also tried to catch the man but he was too quick and a second later was on the bridge  come back bawled nat come back uncle wilbur dont you know me come back please we wont hurt you and then he set off after the wild man who was running along the road beyond the bridge  dave did you hear that gasped the senators son he called the wild man uncle wilbur  yes i heard him returned our hero no wonder he has been after him roger come on let us see if we cant catch him  the chums started after the wild man and the moneylenders son the way was along the road but presently the wild man turned into a stretch of woods he could run like a trained athlete and easily outdistanced nat who kept calling after him  when dave and roger came up they found the moneylenders son leaning against a tree out of breath and much disgusted  couldnt get him eh queried roger  no you fellows scared him off growled the moneylenders son  i am sorry if we did that said dave  you had no right to butt in grumbled nat what did you follow me for anyway  because we thought you were after the wild man thats why answered roger  humph  so he is your uncle wilbur went on our hero after a pause and he turned a look of sympathy at nat as he spoke  who told you that  you called him uncle wilbur  ii guess you are mistaken stammered nat growing red in the face  no we heard you as plain as day put in the senators son  you havent any right to pry into my affairs roger morr you nor dave porter either  perhaps not answered roger  look here nat if we can help you well do it came from dave i suppose if that man is your uncle you wish to get him back to theerthe sanitarium as quickly and as quietly as possible is that so  wouldnt you want to do that if he was your uncle asked the moneylenders son flushing deeply  certainly but it looks now as if you couldnt do it alone  i might have done it if you hadnt come up and queered my game  he didnt see us until he ran out of the cabin said roger he just got a wild streak on thats all i dont think you could have managed him alone he wouldnt let you tie him up with that rope  well hes gone thats sure grumbled nat im going back to the cabin for my valise  he may come back suggested dave  i dont think so but ill wait and see i hung around once for himon that islandbut he never came back it isnt often he visits the same spot twice thats the reason the authorities around here havent caught him  what is his name nat  wilbur poole if you must know he is my fathers halfbrother  where did he come from  from the blossmore sanitarium in new york state its a private place near lake erie he lost a lot of money several years ago in a speculation in sumatra tobacco and that made him crazy and that is why i suppose he calls himself the king of sumatra  did you know he was missing when you heard of the wild man questioned dave with interest  no i did not for the sanitarium people did not notify us that he had gotten away i suppose they thought he would stay near the institution and that they would be able to get him again i cant imagine what brought him away out here excepting that i went to see him once when he was somewhat better and i told him about oakdale and our school i knew he called himself the king of sumatra and that is why i got interested in the wild man as soon as i heard you mention that name then when the handkerchief was found i was sure the man was my uncle  and you put the hole in the handkerchief said our hero  yes becausewell i didnt want folks to find out from the blossmore authorities that the man was my uncle answered nat casting down his eyes i thought i might be able to catch him and send him back on the quiet i didnt want the whole school talking about it  i can understand your feelings nat said our hero kindly and if i can help you in the matter ill do it  i suppose youll tell everybody hes my uncle came bitterly from the moneylenders son  no i wont but i think doctor clay ought to know it  and what of your folks asked roger do they know  i sent my dad a letter about it last week but he is away on business so i dont know when hell get it or what hell do i didnt let the blossmore folks know because i dont think my uncle ought to go back to that place he ought to be put in an institution where they are more strict so he cant get away again  you are right there said dave  nat dont you know it is highly dangerous to allow that man at large asked the senators son after a pause during which the three boys turned their footsteps towards the island cabin  oh i dont think he is as dangerous as some folks imagine was the reply he has never actually harmed anybody yet but he scares em  he may have committed some deeds of which you know nothing  at these suggestive words from the senators son nat turned pale  what do you mean have you heard anything roger  i hate to hurt your feelings any further nat but i must be honest with you dave and i have an idea that he was the one who blew up the diningroom of sparrs hotel  oh impossible  what roger says is true said dave gravely i am sorry for you nat but that is the way it looks to us he was seen around the old stone bridge when it was blown up and around the shanty where the dynamite was kept and he has been in oakdale several times so we have heard  oh he wouldnt do such a thing he couldnt cried the moneylenders son in genuine distress  an insane man is liable to do anything nat said roger why he might have set off that dynamite without realizing the consequences the best thing we can do is to organize a regular search for him and round him up as quickly as possible  i suppose that is so groaned nat but oh how i do hate the exposure  you mustnt take it too hard nat said dave remember neither you nor your family are responsible for his condition of mind  it did not take the three students long to reach the little cabin while nat was packing up the things he had brought along dave and roger looked over the place the wild man had had but few things none of them worth mentioning there was a newspaper and an old magazine showing that wilbur poole occasionally indulged in reading  hello look here cried roger as he turned the magazine over well i declare  what is it asked dave and nat in a breath  heres a picture drawn in blue pencil it is marked fort but it looks like sparrs hotel  and look what it says cried dave eying the crude drawing powder house to be blown up thats the diningroom as plain as day  and down here it says dynamite will do it easily and signed king of sumatra dave he did it and this proves it  it certainly looks that way roger  let me see that drawing burst out nat and would have snatched it from rogers hand had not dave stopped him  you can look at it nat but you must give it back said our hero  what for my uncle drew that and i have a right to it  no i am going to hand this over to doctor clay and then to the oakdale authorities it may be needed to clear phil ben and buster  hurrah dave thats the talk cried roger with sudden enthusiasm i didnt think of it but that is just what is needed to clear em well knock jason sparrs accusations into a cocked hat  you let me see that drawing shouted nat making another grab for it ive got a right to itif my uncle made it  you can look at it but you cant handle it said dave and he gave roger a look that the senators son well understood both knew that the moneylenders son could not be trusted with such an important bit of evidence  the drawing was held up but nat was not permitted to get too close to it he looked it over carelessly and then his lip curled  huh i dont think my uncle drew it he said  and we think he did returned dave  there was a sudden silence after this each boy was busy with his thoughts dave felt particularly lighthearted  this ought to clear phil and the others he reasoned and they can come back to school without delay and finish the term and graduate  having packed up his things nat got out his bicycle and prepared to ride back to oak hall and the others did the same  going to give me that drawing asked the moneylenders son just as he was ready to start off  no we are going to turn it over to doctor clay said roger  all right have your own way growled nat  as in coming to the cabin the moneylenders son took the lead in the return to oak hall dave and roger kept close behind and occasionally spoke of the happenings in guarded tones when the school was reached all left their bicycles in the gymnasium  going to doctor clay now demanded nat  we might as well said dave the sooner he knows of this the better for everybody  all right  doctor clay was somewhat surprised to see the three boys dusty and tiredlooking enter his private office he listened with close attention to their tale of visiting the cabin and encountering the wild man and looked completely astonished on learning that the man was nats uncle  i am sorry for you poole said he kindly but such things will happen and you must make the best of it it is not your fault  then dave and roger told of the finding of the old magazine with the drawing and writing and doctor clay shook his head sorrowfully  too bad too bad he murmured  but this clears lawrence basswood and beggs cried dave and it clears roger and myself  yes yes so it does porter  dont you believe it doctor clay cried nat leaping to his feet it does nothing of the sort that paper is no kind of evidence at all and thus speaking the moneylenders son glared defiantly at dave and roger     chapter xxii  after the runaways   why nat what do you mean demanded dave  i mean just what i say declared the moneylenders son this is a frameup nothing more i understand it all now although i didnt at first  what do you mean by a frameup poole demanded doctor clay  i mean that they took this magazine and the drawing to the cabin that is what i mean doctor clay they found out somehow that myerthat the wild man was there and they got up this scheme to make it look as if he had blown up the hoteland they did it just to clear their cronies and themselves  nat you know that is not true exclaimed roger i found the magazine with the drawing on a shelf in the cabin  yes that is what you said but i dont believe it roger morr i think you put the magazine there yourselfyou or dave porter  we did nothing of the kind cried our hero  i think you didand i think jason sparr will think so too when he hears the story its a frameup just to clear yourselves and your cronies added nat with a sneer  nat you ought to be began roger in high anger when dave stopped him our hero looked at doctor clay  what roger says is the absolute truth doctor clay said our hero he found that magazine on a shelf in the cabin where the wild man was staying and that drawing and the wording were on it just as you see more than that we can prove that the wild man was around the old shanty where the dynamite was kept and that he was seen in oakdale several times  dave was interrupted here by nat and a wordy war lasting several minutes followed finally doctor clay said he would take the magazine and keep it and that he would notify the authorities in what locality the wild man might be found provided he had not gone away further than expected  i am inclined to believe the story told by morr and porter said he somewhat sternly to nat poole but this matter cannot be cleared up until we find your uncle when captured the unfortunate man will most likely speak of the blowing up in some way or another if he is guilty  i dont think so answered nat but his manner showed that he was much disturbed then dave and roger were dismissed and the master of the school took nat with him to oakdale to see what could be done towards rounding up wilbur poole in the near future  well dave what is the next move asked the senators son as the two were alone in the lavatory washing up after the long bicycle ride  i wish i could find phil and the others and get them to come back here responded our hero it is a great mistake for them to stay away  i believe youit looks just as if they were guilty i wonder that they dont come back on their own account now they have had a chance to think it over  i think they saw that article in the newspaper roger and it scared them worse than ever maybe they imagine the officers of the law are waiting to gobble them up  if we only had some trace of them  ive got an idea i am going to follow up  what sort of an idea  i was thinking of that baggage that left here maybe it was shipped to some point  youll have a job tracing it up  i can try it anyway answered our hero  a day slipped by and nothing more was said about the affair by doctor clay or nat poole then nat left the school telling some friends he was going home for a weeks rest  most likely he is after his uncle was rogers comment and dave agreed with him  as soon as he could get the time dave went to oakdale to see if he could find any trace of the baggage belonging to phil and the others who had run away he made many inquiries but without success and was on the point of returning to the school when he happened to think of an old man named dowling who did some trucking and who knew buster beggs very well  well go around to dowlings place said he to his chum  they found the old man in a little shanty behind his house which he called his office it had an old easychair and a desk and on the wall was a telephone  how do you do boys he said politely what can i do for you want some baggage shipped  no i came for some information mr dowling said dave have you shipped any baggage for buster beggs lately  at the mention of the fat students name the old expressman started  what do you want to know that for he demanded  ive a very good reason mr dowling i want to do beggs a favor  reckon you want to find him eh  yes  so do some other folks and the old man chuckled  well we are his friends and we want to find him for his own good  who be you if i may ask  i am dave porter and this is roger morr buster beggs is our friend and so are phil lawrence and ben basswood they ran away and it was foolish for them to do it now we want to find them and get them to come back here  it was foolish for em to run awayi said thet all along murmured the old expressman  then you know where they are put in roger quickly  no i dont  but you took their baggage away didnt you questioned dave for he could see that the old man was holding something back  i allow as how i moved some things for em yes was the cautious reply  when they ran away pursued dave  the old expressman nodded  who got those bags from oak hall asked roger  thets a secret and now the old man really chuckled as if he thought it was a good joke  you did declared dave bound to get at the truth  no i didnt buster didcarried em down on his back one at a time in the middle o the night an nobuddy knew it say they could walk off with yer hull school if they wanted to and the old expressman chuckled again  you were waiting for him continued dave  might be as i was  and you took the baggage to the depot  maybe i did  and had them checked on railroad tickets  no buster went one way and the bags went tudderleaswise so i was given to understand maybe he done it to put me off the track continued isaac dowling  but where did the bags go to demanded dave come out with it mr dowling i give you my word that i am acting for busters good i wouldnt get him into trouble for the world he is my chum and so are those other boys my friends  well you look honest boy so ill tell ye the baggage was sent by express to a place called camptown falls in maine  camptown falls cried roger then he looked at dave who nodded to show that he understood  did buster say he was going elsewhere queried dave  he didnt say so exactly but he mentioned boston an i thought he was goin there  he left on the train  no he didnt he went off in the darkness an thats the last i see o him concluded isaac dowling as a hail came for him to come into the house  camptown falls said dave when he and roger were alone can they have gone to that outoftheway spot  it would be the place buster would pick out dave he has often spoken of going camping up there  he must have mentioned boston just to throw old dowling off the track  more than likely and to think he took those bags away while we slept  i wonder where phil and ben were at the time  i dont know maybe they were at that camp  much excited over what they had learned dave and the senators son returned to oak hall they had expected to interview doctor clay and were chagrined to learn that he had gone to new york on important business and would not return for two days mr dale had been left in charge of the school  roger do you know what i think of doing said our hero ive a good notion to get permission to leave the hall and go after phil and the others i think i can get them to come back  want me to go along  that will hardly be necessary besides id like somebody to stay here and watch nat poole if he comes back do you know ive a notion that nat knows more about this affair than he would like to tell  he certainly acts that way  i am going to see mr dale  our hero had a long talk with the head assistant and the upshot of this was that he got permission to go to maine to look for the runaways he was to be gone no longer than was absolutely necessary  it did not take our hero long to prepare for the trip he packed a few things in a suitcase and then he was ready he consulted a map and some timetables and found he could leave oakdale on the first train in the morning and by making two changes reach camptown falls about two oclock in the afternoon nobody but roger and mr dale knew that he was going away  got money enough have you dave questioned the senators son  yes roger  its a wild kind of a spot so buster told me  i am not afraid of thatif only i can locate the boys answered our hero  how are you going to look for them  i dont know yetill find out after i get there  it must be confessed that dave slept but little that night his mind was filled with what was before him he felt that he had quite a mission to perform first in locating the runaways and then in persuading them to return to oak hall to face the music  he had an early breakfast roger eating with him and then the buggy driven by horsehair was brought around and he got in and a minute later he was off the senators son waving him an adieu from the porch of the school  dave found the first train he rode on but half filled with passengers and he had a double seat to himself he changed at the junction and about noon reached lumberport where he was to take the train on the little sideline for camptown falls at lumberport he got dinner at a hotel frequented by lumbermen he sat at a long table with half a dozen men and listened to their talk with interest when he heard camptown falls mentioned  yes they tell me there is great danger of the dam giving way just above camptown falls one of the men said doxey reported it hasnt been safe for a week  say if that dam gave way it would do a lot of damage below the falls said another  it certainly would replied a tall lumberman it would wipe out some of those camps on moosetail island i rather guess the water would cover the whole island  somebody ought to warn the campers said another  oh i guess they know it already was the answer  dave arose from the table feeling very uneasy he remembered the name moosetail island now buster had once mentioned it stating he had camped there and would like to go again were the runaways there now and in danger of the dam should it break     chapter xxiii  at the camp   at last the train came that was to take our hero to the railroad station of camptown falls it was merely a flag station but the conductor said he would stop there for any passenger who might wish to get off the railroad was a singletrack affair running through the woods and across the country stretches and the train consisted of one passenger car and several freights  dave looked at the passengers and counted them there were just an even dozen and of these ten were men farmers and those in the lumber business one a bright young fellow sat near our hero and dave resolved to ask him if he knew anything about camptown falls and the summer camps in that vicinity  yes i know all about the falls said the young lumberman i work not over three miles from thereat cropleysthe station this side of camptown there aint any town not since the jewell lumber company busted up some folks camp out there down along the river and on moosetail island but there arent near as many as there used to be  somebody said the dam above camptown falls was dangerous said dave  i think it is myself and i cant understand how they allow folks to camp along the river and on that island if that dam ever broke it would be goodby to anybody on the island im thinking  have you been up to the island lately  i was there about a week ago  who were there then do you know  a couple of men from portland and half a dozen young fellers from springfield there was another camp with some women in it but i didnt get around to that i only heard of it there are half a dozen camps along the right bank of the river but they are on high ground and if the dam broke it isnt likely the water would reach em continued the young lumberman  the train rolled along at a rate of twenty miles an hour making stops at stations and crossroads here and there a person got on or off and by the time camptown falls was reached dave had the passenger car almost to himself  the train halted for but a minute and our hero alighted suitcase in hand much to his surprise not a soul was about the little depot which looked old and dilapidated there was a stretch of fields beyond the track and farther on he made out the glistening waters of the river and in the center the woodland stretch known as moosetail island  well this surely is lonesome land dave murmured to himself as the train rumbled out of sight and he was left utterly alone and not another train until eight oclock tomorrow morning ill have a fine time of it tonight if i dont meet those fellows or run across some camp where they will take me in  dave looked at the sky and this did not tend to increase his good spirits when he had left oakdale it had been warm and clear now dark clouds were forming overhead and it looked as if it might rain before long  well ive got my raincoat and a waterproof cap and that is one comfort he told himself but i had better hurry up and see if i cant find phil and the others before it gets too dark i wish there was somebody here who could tell me where to go  he looked around for a sign of some habitation far across the river he saw a column of smoke coming up from among the trees but that was all the only building in sight was the deserted depot  there was something of a path leading from the depot to the river and dave followed this but soon the path seemed to divide and the various branches became more indistinct at every step especially as it was rapidly growing darker and darker  ill strike a straight course for moosetail island dave said to himself ill surely find some people camping out there and they may be able to tell me about the boys if they are here  as he approached the river going down a small hill the way became stony and he had to walk with care for fear of going into some hole or twisting an ankle it was hard work especially with the suitcase and he half wished he had hidden the baggage somewhere near the depot  i was a big chump that i didnt bring some lunch along he reasoned and then he had to smile at himself as he remembered how he had imagined that he might put up at some hotel in camptown falls he had not dreamed that the place would prove such a lonely one it was certainly an ideal spot for runaways who wished to remain undiscovered  presently dave found himself at the bank of the river a wide but shallow stream filled with sandbars rocks and piles of driftwood not a great distance off was the end of moosetail island  it was now so dark that our hero could see but little as he stood at the edge of the river he heard a patter on the leaves of the trees and knew it had begun to rain  wonder how they get to the island he mused they must either use canoes or else wade across or ford along the stones  he moved along the riverbank and soon came to a point where the stones in the river seemed to stretch in a line from the bank to the island  i guess ill try it here he told himself but i think i had better leave the suitcase behind  he placed the case in a tree sheltering it as much as possible from the rain which was now coming down at a lively rate then donning his raincoat and waterproof cap he set out over the rocks in the river leaping from one to the next and heading for the island  it was no easy journey and when but halfway to moosetail island dave slipped and went into the stream up to his knees he floundered around for a moment splashing the water into his face and over his coat and cap  phew this is lots of fun was his grim comment as he at length found himself on a flat rock catching his breath well i am halfway over anyway  the remainder of the distance proved easier traveling and ten minutes later our hero stood on the island it was now raining steadily and the darkness of the storm had settled everywhere  i guess the best thing i can do is to move right around the shore of this island he reasoned by doing that i am bound to strike one of the camps sooner or later  he moved along as rapidly as the rocky shore of moosetail island permitted he had to proceed with care for there were many dangerous pitfalls  at length his heart was gladdened by the sight of a rude log cabin set in the trees a little back from the water he hurried to it and found the door and window closed evidently the spot was deserted  nobody here he murmured and his heart sank for the moment for he could see that the camp had not been used for a long time then he went on the rain in the meanwhile coming down harder than ever the downfall made him think of the dam that was said to be weak what if the present storm should make that structure give way  i wish we were all out of this he murmured i wonder if it would do any good to call  he set up a yell and listened and then he yelled again from a long distance came an answering cry  hurrah thats somebody anyway he exclaimed i hope it was one of the boys  he stumbled in the direction of the cry then he yelled once more and again came the answering call but now dave was sure it was a mans voice and he was somewhat disappointed  where are you he called out a moment later where are you  this way come this way was the reply and soon dave passed through a patch of timber and around some rocks and reached a spot where there was a tiny cove with a stretch of fine sand facing the cove was a neat log cabin with a small leanto the latter containing a tiny stove  a tall goodnatured man stood in the leanto peering out into the rain he watched daves approach with interest he looked to be what he was a campcook and general worker  hello he exclaimed as dave hurried in out of the rain and shook the water from his cap i thought you were one of our crowd  what camp is this questioned our hero eagerly  well it aint no camp in particular answered the man with a grin its jest a camp  but who is stopping here  three young fellers and myself  are their names beggs lawrence and basswood  youve struck it maybe you are a friend to em went on the man inquiringly  i am and i have come a long distance to find them returned dave and his tone of voice showed his relief where are they  they left the camp right after dinner an they aint back yet when you called i thought it was one of em although they didnt expect to be back much before suppertime but now its rainin i guess theyll come back sooner  how long have they been here  most a week now i guess i didnt come till day before yesterday i didnt have nothin to do an they give me a job cookin an like that returned the man  he invited dave to make himself at home and our hero was glad enough to go inside and take off the wet raincoat and also his shoes and socks the baggage belonging to phil and the others was in the cabin and he helped himself to dry garments and a dry pair of slippers  we are all school chums he told the man my name is dave porter  oh i heard em talkin about you cried the campworker and then said his own name was jerry blutt and that he was from tegley just across the canadian border  we are not far from the border here are we asked our hero  about six miles thets all answered jerry blutt and this reply gave dave another idea more than likely buster and the others had chosen this spot so that if pursued by the officers of the law they could flee into canada  jerry blutt said the three lads had spent their time in various ways occasionally going fishing and swimming they had also written some letters and gone to the railroad station to mail them in the box placed there for that purpose  have they been having a good time asked dave curiously  i cant say as to that mr porter they did seem mighty worried over something answered the camp worker and from this our hero felt certain that the man had not been let into the secret of why the runaways were there at all  half an hour went by and it continued to rain as hard as ever while the sky remained dark and the wind blew with more or less violence time and again dave went to the cabin door to peer out into the storm but each time he turned back disappointed his chums were not yet in sight  theyll be surprised to see me he thought i wonder if they will listen to reason and go back with me supposing they refuse to return id hate to go back alone  then he questioned jerry blutt about the dam above the falls the man shrugged his shoulders  it aint safe so they tell me he said but its been that way a long time so maybe it wont break away yet awhile but id hate to be on the river when she does go  are there any other camps on this island went on our hero  not now there was some other folks two or three parties i was told but they all moved out yesterday an the day before maybe they got afraid o the dam concluded the campworker     chapter xxiv  out in the storm   this is getting to be something fierce  it was dave who uttered the words about five oclock in the afternoon he was looking out of the door of the cabin and beside him stood jerry blutt  the storm had kept up without intermission the rain coming down in a perfect torrent and the wind blowing in fitful gusts from the east it was raw and depressing and our hero could not help but shiver as he looked out on the turbulent waters of the river  its a pity them fellers aint got back said the campworker with a slow shake of his head it aint nice to be out in sech a downpour as this an with sech a wind might a tree blow down on em and he shook his head again  dave was even more distressed than the man he could not get that dam out of his mind such a heavy fall of rain would certainly cause a great flow of water and if the structure was weak most anything bad was liable to happen  as soon as the boys get back ill urge them to leave here he told himself if that dam breaks we want to be on high ground where the flood cant reach us  pears to me like the river was gittin putty high remarked jerry blutt a little later as he watched the water in the cove closely  well it would rise some with all this rain coming down returned dave  so it mightbut i dont know i wish this camp was on the shore instid o this island  so do i answered dave bluntly  a fire had been started in the stove and a lantern lit and jerry blutt rather reluctantly began preparations for the evening meal but he kept peering out of the doorway of the cabin and from the leanto and his eyes always rested on the river with its rainswept swollen surface  i dont like it at all he said finally i wish we had moved over to the shore  dont you think it is safe to stay here  it aint as safe as it might be if i was alone the man stopped short  what would you do  i hate to say it but i think id go over to the shore till the storm was over and i knew jest how thet dam was agoin to act  well i dont blame you answered dave and if you want to go go ahead  want me to go alone  if you wish to go yes  but it aint no safer fer you than it is fer me  thats so too but i want to see those other fellowsin fact i must see them if i went to the shore i might miss them  you could come back later on  but i want to warn them of the danger from the dam  you could write a letter and stick it up where they couldnt help but see it then whats that  the campworker stopped short as a distant cry reached their ears sounding out above the wind an instant later the cry was repeated  that is ben basswoods voice cried dave they must be coming back  soon another voice sounded out and our hero recognized buster beggss tones he ran to the cabin door all was dark outside and the rain was being driven in sheets by the wind  hello hello he yelled and catching up the lantern he swung it out in one direction and another then he saw two forms approaching on the run each dripping with water  ben and buster  why if it isnt dave  where in the world did you come from  where is phil demanded our hero  he is somewhere behind us answered buster oh what a time weve had and entering the cabin the fat youth sank down on a bench all but exhausted  weve had to tramp for over two miles in this rain explained ben and of course we had to ford to the island say the current is something fierce now and the water is getting higher every minute he added  did you say phil was behind you demanded dave he still held the lantern on high  i thought he wassure he must be answered ben give him a hail will you im too tired and he sank on the bench beside buster  phil phil yelled our hero at the top of his lungs this way this way and he swung the lantern to the right and left  did you say the river is rising demanded jerry blutt how high is it over the white bar yet  yes the bar is a foot under water answered ben oh this is a great storm  a foot under water murmured the campworker say we better git out first thing you know this hull island will be under an if thet dam breaks  oh the dam gasped buster i forgot about that they say it isnt safe at all that is why all the other campers got out yes we must leave the island and go to the shore he turned to dave did you come alone  yes buster ill tell you all about it later but now we must find phil  i thought he was right behind me came from ben he looked greatly distressed i wonder if anything happened to him maybe he slipped off the rocks into the river  we must look for him cried dave and reached for his coat and cap show me the way you came ben  ben was nothing loath and side by side the two chums ran outside into the storm and in the direction of the upper end of the island they had gone but a short distance when they reached a low spot and here suddenly found themselves in water several inches deep  hello you are taking me into the river cried dave  this isnt the river answered ben with a gasp gosh how the water is rising this was dry when i came over it before  dry ejaculated our hero ben are you sure  positive say the water is rising to beat the band i guess we had better get out if we dont well have to swim for it  phil phil where are you  standing in water up to his ankles our hero called again and again and ben joined in the cry the lantern was flashed in all directions but nothing was seen or heard of the missing student  i am sure he started to follow us across the river said ben buster was in front i came next and phil was in the rear i asked him twice if he was all right and he said he was then it blew so hard and the rain got so heavy none of us said any more oh dave what shall we do  i dont know benwish i did  do you think he slipped off the rocks and waswasdrowned  i hope not  if he was wouldnt it be terrible  yes  a cry came from behind them and buster appeared followed by jerry blutt  where is phil demanded the stout youth  we dont know  the water is terribly high and jerry thinks we had better move to the shore he says we might be drowned if that dam should break  dont you think we ought to find phil first  sureif we can maybe he went back when he found out how the water was rising went on the stout youth hopefully  i dont think hed desert us answered ben that isnt phils style  youre right ben said dave  all splashed around in the water for several minutes but without making any discovery of importance the river was now rising more rapidly than ever and the campworker showed increased nervousness  aint no two ways about itthe dams bust he cried at last im goin to git out an i advise all o you to do the same if you want me to carry anything to shore ill do it  we cant carry any trunks in such a hurry said buster  let us carry our suitcases and bundles said ben  with heavy hearts dave and the others returned to the cabin the water in the cove had now risen so high that it swept the edge of the leanto  can we get to shore asked buster we havent any boat he added turning to dave  we can if youll hurry replied jerry blutt every minit lost makes it jest so much more dangerous  in great haste ben and buster and the campworker gathered together such belongings as they could conveniently carry the other things were placed in a trunk and hoisted by ropes into a big tree then a lantern was tied on a post in front of the cabin and to it was fastened a brief note for phils benefit stating they had gone to the shore  oh i hope he is safe murmured dave anxiously  so do i added his chums  jerry blutt led the way along the shore of the island and then out into the stream they had the second camp lantern with them one belonging to jerry he led the way from rock to rock and they followed in single file dave bringing up the rear ever and anon our hero looked back for some sign of phil but without avail  once out in the river all were certain that the dam above camptown falls had burst the water ran with great rapidity and was filled with dirt and débris of various kinds on the rocks that were low they had all they could do to keep their footing  the most dangerous part of the river had yet to be passeda section close to the shore where the water was deep and the rocks for fording few  mind your footin here sang out the campworker an if you slip look out thet you dont hurt yourselves  he was splashing along in water up to his knees sometimes on the rocks and then again on a sandbar running in that direction then he had to make a turn to avoid a deep portion of the stream where the current was rapid  ben was behind the man and buster was just ahead of dave as all struggled along there came an extra heavy blast of wind followed by a perfect deluge of rain  oh screamed buster an instant later and peering through the rain dave saw him suddenly throw up his arms and slip from a rock there was a splash and poor buster disappeared from view  buster is in the river yelled our hero and then he leaped for the rock from which the stout youth had fallen he looked down and saw an arm and a head come up  help hel came from the unfortunate one and then the swift current caught him and turned him over out of sight  help yelled dave to attract the attention of those ahead and then as he saw ben turn back he slipped down on the rock and into the swirling river and struck out after buster     chapter xxv  perils of the flood   dave dave yelled ben as he saw our hero disappear into the swiftlyflowing river look out or youll both be drowned  whats the trouble yelled jerry blutt as he turned back for the first time since leaving the island  buster slipped in and dave went after him answered ben oh what shall we do he went on despairingly  herewell throw out the rope answered the campworker and took from his shoulder a rope he carried  in the meantime dave had come up and was striking out with might and main for his chum our hero realized that buster must be hurt otherwise he would swim to save himself  must have struck on his head when he went over he thought and he was right poor buster had done just that and now lay halfunconscious as the current swept him further and further from his friends  it was too dark to see much and dave had all he could do to keep in sight of the unfortunate one but presently the stout youths body struck against a rock and was held there and our hero came up and seized the lad by the arm  buster buster he called out whats wrong cant you swim  helhelp me gasped the fat youth ii got a knock on the head im soso dizzy i dodont know what iim dodoing  the current now tore buster away from the rock and he and dave floated along on the bosom of the river for a distance of fifty yards it was impossible to do much swimming in that madlyrushing element and dave wisely steered for shore he continued to support his friend who seemed unable to do anything for himself  at length when our hero was all but exhausted his feet struck a sandbar at once he stood up finding himself in water that reached to his waist he caught up buster and placed the weakened lad over his shoulder in a dim uncertain way he saw the shore loom up in front of him and struck out in that direction  it was a short but hard struggle twice dave went down once losing his hold on his chum but he got up each time and went after buster in a hurry then he made a final dash came in contact with some bushes and hauled himself and his burden to temporary safety  all was dark around the two boys and the rain came down as pitilessly as ever but for this they did not just then care they had been close to death and now they were safe and that counted for everything  poor buster had received a severe bump on the forehead and had a swelling there of considerable size but the stunning effect was passing and he was able to sit up and peer around him  oh what a crack i got when i fell over he murmured and then he added gratefully it was a fine thing for you to jump in after me dave  well i couldnt stand there and see you drown buster answered our hero i had to do something  where are the others  up the streamunless they went overboard too  then i suppose we ought to walk that way  we willafter we get our breath and you feel strong enough  maybe you can call to them  ill try  dave yelled at the top of his voice not once but several times presently an answering hail arose from a distance and then ben came running up followed by jerry  dave buster are you safe  yes answered both  oh i am so glad we were afraid you were both drowned how did it happen  the two told their story and then the others told how they had thrown out the rope and had seen dave disappear in the darkness after buster  i would have jumped in too but i didnt see how i could do any good went on ben jerry said we had better come ashore and look for you down here so we did that my but its a fearful flood isnt it  yes i wish we knew where phil was and dave heaved a deep sigh had their chum lost his life in that rapidlyrising river  aint no ust to stay heregitting wetter an wetter said the campworker after a pause besides if that flood gits wuss it is bound to come up here we better git further backup the hill  is there any shelter around here i mean on high ground asked dave  yes i know of a cabin up on the hill answered buster i dont know if i can find it in the rain and darkness but i can try  he walked along through the trees until he reached a footpath running up from the shore they followed the path for about a hundred yards and then came in sight of a long low rambling cabin the home in years gone by of some lumbermen it was in a dilapidated state with doors and windows gone but it would provide a roof over their heads and that was something  entering the lantern was hung on a nail and they looked around them there was a fireplace with some dry sticks handy and soon they had a fire started which added much to the comfort of the surroundings they hung up the majority of their wet garments and sat close to the blaze drying themselves  if i only knew where to look for phil id go after him said dave but to look for him in the darkness is like looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack  well have to go out first thing in the morning returned ben  yes as soon as we can see added buster  the boys who had run away were anxious to learn what dave had to say about affairs at oakdale and in a low voice while the campworker was preparing hot coffee and something to eat he related what had happened since their departure  you made a big mistake to run away he said earnestly just because you did that many folks feel sure you must be guilty you ought to go right back and face the music  i guess you are right dave answered ben shamefacedly but when phil said run i didnt stop to think but just got out  and that is what i did too added the stout youth but i dont blame phil any more than i blame myself he added hastily  nor do i said ben we made a big mistake we should have stood our ground like you and roger did  well you come back with me and well face this to a finish went on our hero but of course weve got to find phil first  only the campworker slept well that night the boys were restless and several times one or another got up to go to the doorway and listen thinking he had heard a call from phil but the calls were only imaginary and morning dawned without a sign of the missing one  it was still raining but not so hard as before and by eight oclock the clouds broke away and the sun commenced to shine all had an early breakfast from the stores brought along and then the party hurried down to the river  that the dam above camptown falls had broken was plainly evident on all sides during the night the river had risen seven or eight feet bearing on its bosom many trees and bushes with here and there the remains of camps that had been located on low ground moosetail island had been swept from end to end only the higher spots escaping the flood the waters were now going down the rush from the broken dam having spent itself  the boys gave scant heed to the destruction effected by the rain and the broken dam all their thoughts were centered on phil what had become of their chum was he dead or alive  i wonder if it wouldnt be best to get over to the island and look around suggested dave most likely he went therethinking you would be at the cabin  but how are we to get to the island asked buster he had no desire to fall into the turbulent stream again  oh the water is going down rapidly buster i think we can make it by noon  all walked up and down the river bank looking in vain for some trace of the shipowners son once they met some people from another camp and asked about phil but these folks shook their heads  didnt see a soul said one of the men  jerry blutt had been looking the situation over carefully and he said he thought they could get to the island by going up the river a distance  then the current will help us along and we wont have to fight so hard said the campworker he did not like the idea of crossing the water but did not wish to desert the boys  on the trip they carried the rope with jerry at the head and dave at the rear all took tight hold so that if one slipped the others might pull him up  now take it easy cautioned the camp man this water is runnin putty swift even yet  he had mapped out a course with his eye and proceeded slowly and cautiously once away from the shore they felt the full force of the onrushing waters and were all but swept from their feet it was well that they were a good distance above moosetail island for to reach this spot by going straight out in the stream would have been impossible  it was a long hard and dangerous trip and all drew a deep breath of relief when they finally set foot on the island at times they had been in water up to their waists and it had looked as if they must surely be swept away once a tree branch coming swiftly along had caught dave and literally carried him off his feet for several yards  they landed at one end of the island at a point where the bushes were still two feet under water the evidences of the flood were on every hand and the water was muddy and filled with brokenaway brushwood and trees  i guess we had better strike out for the camp said dave phil would go there if he went anywhere  as they advanced one or another gave a loud call but no answer came back and this made them look gravely at each other was the perilous trip to the island to prove a vain one  in a quarter of an hour they came in sight of the camp the cove had been blotted out and the water was eddying around the cabin to a depth of several inches mud was everywhere inside the place and out and this showed that the flood had swept the spot at a height of several feet  we might have stayed here was busters comment it didnt hurt the big tree  but we didnt know how bad it was going to be answered ben it might have washed away the whole island  let us go up to the high ground and look for phil suggested dave maybe he went to the highest spot he could find  the others agreed and leaving the campworker at the cabin the boys led by buster tramped through the wet and mud to a little hill again they set up their calls but as before no answer came back  i dont believe he came here said ben at last if he was here he would surely hear us  unless he was hurt and couldnt answer returned dave  from the top of the little hill they could see both ends of moosetail island and also both shores of the river as they gazed about them dave suddenly gave a shout  look look he cried pointing to the shore which they had left but a short while before there is somebody waving a handkerchief at us  its phil returned ben  are you sure questioned buster i can see it is a man or a boy but that is all  it looks like phil said dave oh i hope it is     chapter xxvi  back to the school   they waved frantically to the person on the shore and he waved frantically in return and at last all were convinced that it must really be their missing chum  he must think i am jerry said dave wont he be surprised to see me  he will be unless he was at the cabin last night and read the note returned buster  the note wasnt touched said ben i noticed that it was exactly as we left it  all gave a parting wave and pointed to the shore and then left the hill they made their way down to the cabin and told the campworker what they had seen  it must be lawrence said jerry blutt maybe hell come over here instead of waiting for us to go to him  gracious i never thought of that cried buster  well be like the men in one of shadows stories said ben one was upstairs in a big office building and one downstairs the man upstairs went down and the downstairs man went up and they kept that up until both stopped tired out one upstairs and one down and the others had to smile at the brief yarn  all journeyed to the lower shore of the island where they could get a better view of the spot where the person they thought was phil had been they saw the party walking up the river bank looking for a good place to ford all shouted loudly and waved their hands to keep him where he was and he nodded his head deeply to show that he understand  it must be phil said dave oh how thankful i am that he wasnt carried away by the flood  the boys were impatient to get back to the shore and jerry blutt did not blame them to carry any of the stuff over was still out of the question and they did not attempt it  you can come and get it some day jerry said buster you can ship it to us by express and well pay you for your trouble and so it was arranged  it was as hard to gain the shore as it had been to reach the island and all were wellnigh exhausted when they finally left the water not to return again phil saw them coming and when he made out dave he was almost dumfounded  where in the world did you come from he demanded as he caught our hero by the hand  from oakdale phil  did you run away too demanded the shipowners son  hardly answered dave with a grin i came to bring you fellows back but first tell us how did you get out of the flood last night  oh i had a fierce time of it i tried to get back to the camp but stumbled over some treeroots and went down in a hole and hurt my ankle when i got up i couldnt see the others and i must have lost my way then it began to rain and get dark and i didnt know which way to turn i yelled dozens of times but i didnt hear any answer i tried to locate the cabin but i must have been completely turned around for i came out on the shore then the flood came along and before i knew it i was floating down the river i hit a tree and clung to that and we drifted a mile or more before the tree got stuck on a sandbar i stayed there in the rain and darkness until morning and then waded and swam ashore i was so tired out i had to rest for awhile and then i came up here to try to find out something about our crowd i was thinking of getting over to the island again when i saw you on the top of the hill of course i thought dave was jerry  we were scared to death thinking you had been drowned said ben  well i came pretty close to it was the serious reply no more such flood for me  all turned towards the cabin where four of the party had spent the night and there jerry was called on to prepare the best meal their limited stores afforded on the riverbank they had picked up some fish cast up by the flood and these were broiled making a welcome addition to the meal  while the meal was being prepared and after it had been eaten dave had a serious talk with phil and the others and all realized the folly they had committed in running away from oak hall phil in particular was much disturbed and said he had been thinking of coming back  but we saw that article in the newspaper and it scared us went on the shipowners son of course it didnt mention any names but we knew it was meant for us i know now just as well as the others that it was a mistake to run away  then youll go back with me questioned dave eagerly  yes  and youll go back too ben and buster  yes  i am mighty glad to hear itand i feel that this thing will come out all right in the end returned dave  by the way there is one thing i havent told you dave said buster a minute later the general excitement drove it clean out of my head we know who it was that spoiled the feast phil got up for the crowd  you do asked our hero with interest  yes it was nat poole he went to rockville and sent those telephone messages to jason sparr and that musical professor calling the whole affair off he did it because he wasnt invited to take part  how did you learn this  i heard it the night i went to the hall to get our baggage when i was in hiding waiting for a chance to go to the dormitory i saw nat poole come in along with that new student will fasey they had been out somewhere having a good time and nat was telling fasey how he had sent the telephone messages and queered the feast i would have pitched into him then and there only i didnt dare expose myself went on the stout youth  but hell get what is coming to him from me when i get back to the school put in phil it was a contemptible piece of business and i want everybody to know it besides he has got to pay for what i lost by the transaction  if it wasnt for that maybe we wouldnt have been suspected of blowing up the hotel said ben then you really think the wild man did it dave  yes  but what of that letter jason sparr got saying our crowd was guilty  i dont know what to make of that ben i dont think the wild man could write that  would nat poole be bad enough to do it  maybe but it was an awful thing to do i didnt think nat would be as mean as that  the boys had dried and pressed their clothing as best they could and put on clean collars cuffs and neckties and therefore looked quite presentable once more  as soon as we get to town we can get cleaned up a little better said dave so we wont look quite like tramps when we return to the hall  i hate to face doctor clay remarked phil dubiously  so do i added ben and buster  well it has got to be done answered dave so make the best of it the doctor understands the situation so i dont think hell be hard on you  i hope they have got the wild man and that they prove he blew up the hotel said phil wistfully that is the only thing that will really clear us  oh they are bound to get the wild man sooner or later answered dave hopefully  it was decided to take the one afternoon train from camptown falls and at the proper time the boys walked to the little depot dave with his suitcase and the others with some hand baggage instructions were left with jerry blutt regarding the other baggage and the man was paid for his services he said he was glad that nobody had been drowned in the flood and added that he was going up to the brokenaway dam later on to see how matters looked  it was a rather quiet crowd that got aboard the train when it came along the conductor wanted to know how they had fared in the flood and they told him at lumberport the boys had to wait an hour for the next train to oakdale junction and they spent the time in getting a good supper and in having their shoes shined and in brushing up generally  ill be glad to get back late at night said phil to dave id hate to have the whole crowd staring at us when we came in  at the junction they waited but a few minutes and the run to oakdale did not take long they were the only ones to get off at the depot and the spot was all but deserted but they had telegraphed ahead and horsehair was on hand with a carriage to meet them  glad to see you young gents back indeed i am said the school driver  any news horsehair asked dave as they piled into the carriage  not as i know of  have they got that wild man yet questioned phil  no sir but they seen himalong the riverday before yesterday he was sleepin in a barn but he got away before the farmer and his man could git him  where was that questioned ben  up to the morrison place  the morrison place mused buster i know that family when i get a chance i am going to ask them about this he added  when the boys arrived at oak hall they found doctor clay sitting up to receive them he smiled at dave but was somewhat cold towards the others  it is too late to listen to what you have to say tonight said he all of you may report in my office directly after our opening exercises in the morning  when the boys went upstairs there were a good many exclamations of surprise and roger and the others wanted to ask innumerable questions but a monitor cut all talk short and dave and the runaways got to bed as quickly as possible  all were up early and dave phil and the others had to tell their story before going down to breakfast roger and those who had been left behind with him listened eagerly to the tale of the flood and the other happenings  i guess dave got there just in time said the senators son how about it buster  he sure did said the stout lad and shuddered to think how close he had been to drowning  it can well be imagined that phil ben and buster did not have much appetite for breakfast phil looked around for nat poole but the moneylenders son had not yet returned to the school  now tell me everything said doctor clay when the boys at length filed into his office as they say in court we want the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  and that is what im going to give you doctor clay answered phil i made a big mistake in running away and i am glad dave came to bring us back i havent done anything wrong and i am here to face the music as the saying goes  and so am i came from ben and buster  then the boys told their story in detail omitting nothing and dave related how he had gone to camptown falls and how the flood had caught him in the midst of the narrative came a sharp knock on the door  come in said the doctor and one of the servants entered  a man to see you sir said the servant he says it is very importantsomething about that wild man sir hes terribly excited sir  the wild man again murmured the master of the school while the boys looked at him and the servant with interest show the visitor in and i will hear what he has to say     chapter xxvii  the trail through the woods   in a minute the servant ushered in a farmer whom the boys recognized as henry morrison a man who had a farm along the riverfront about a mile from oak hall  goodmorning sir said the farmer bowing to the doctor and then to the boys excuse me for being in such a hurry but i thought you would like to know  ill be glad to hear what you have to say mr morrison replied the master of the school sit down and he pointed to a handy chair  its about that wild man doctor clay exclaimed the farmer dropping into the seat and mopping his forehead with his handkerchief its something terribul the way he carries on he most scared my wife to death  he has been to your place again  yes sir last night he was in the barn and he jumped out at my wife and said he was going to blow the fort to pieces she got so scared she dropped her pailful of milk and ran to the house i got mad and got my shotgun but the fellow had skipped out before i could catch sight of him  what time was this  just about six oclock but that aint all this morning i started for town intending to tell the constable and the justice about it when all of a sudden when i was passing the end of your property i see the wild man down there behind a tree  just now asked dave eagerly  not moren a quarter of an hour ago thats why i stepped in here hes a dangerous man doctor clay and i think he ought to be rounded up went on henry morrison earnestly  you are right he certainly ought to be put under restraint answered the master of oak hall i will see to this at once will you assist in the hunt mr morrison  of courseif i dont have to go alone i dont think it is safe for anybody to tackle him alone hes that wild and dangerous  can we take part in the search asked phil eagerly oh do let us do it doctor clay he pleaded  i suppose so if you will promise to be careful mr morrison can you point out the exact spot where you saw the man  of course i can  then we will at once make up a searching party  doctor clay could act quickly when the occasion demanded and inside of ten minutes a searching party was made up composed of dave and his chums mr dale horsehair and several men who chanced to be working around the grounds  oh i hope we catch him and are able to prove that he blew up the hotel diningroom said phil to dave  so do i phil  henry morrison led the way and it was not long before the spot was gained where he had seen wilbur poole from that point a path ran from the river back into the woods  maybe he took that path suggested our hero and several thought the same  i think we had better scatter suggested mr dale who had been placed in charge by the doctor by doing that we can cover a wide range of territory in a comparatively short space of time and keep as quiet as possible for should he hear us he will most likely start and run  if he didnt run when he saw mr morrison murmured buster he may be miles away already  the crowd separated into pairs dave and phil going together and roger going with ben and buster with horsehair all had armed themselves with sticks and mr dale carried a pair of handcuffs and one of the hired men had a rope  deeper and deeper into the woods went the party spread out in a long line they had examined the riverfront and felt fairly certain that the wild man had not left by boat  looks like a wildgoose chase remarked phil with a sigh after a half an hour had passed  oh we dont want to give up yet answered dave why it isnt much after ten oclock we can stay out till noon at least  id stay out all day if i thought we could catch him returned the shipowners son promptly  presently the boys espied a small stone house standing beside a brook which flowed through the woods into the river in the house lived an old man who made his living by making baskets and fancy articles of birch bark  let us see if old herick is around suggested dave he may be able to tell us something  they found the old man hard at work on a fancy basket he looked surprised when thus suddenly confronted by the students  did i see a wild man he queried in reply to their question i guess i didat least he acted queer enough he danced up here made a deep bow and told me the army would be along in four minutes then he made another bow and walked off as stiff as a drummajor  when was this demanded dave  about half an hour ago  and which way did he go put in phil eagerly  that way and the old basketmaker pointed up the brook walked right in the water too i was going to follow him at first but then i didnt think it was any use  the boys waited to hear no more but telling old herick to watch for the other searchers and tell them about the wild man they set off up the brook as fast as they could travel  as the chums progressed they looked to the right and left wondering if wilbur poole had kept to the tiny watercourse or taken to the woods which were now exceedingly dense  i see his footprints cried phil as they passed a sandy stretch anyway those marks look fresh  i fancy you are right phil and if so he cant be very far ahead of us  they went on following the windings of the stream until it became less than a foot wide it came to an end at a number of springs among the rocks  fine cold water announced dave here is a chance for a good drink phil  both were drinking their fill when a loud voice suddenly challenged them  ha what are you doing at my fountain  both looked up hurriedly and saw the wild man standing on the highest of the rocks he had his arms folded and was glaring at them sternly  oh murmured phil say dave there he is what shall we do  let us try to make friends with him suggested dave if we dont he may run away and he can easily do that in these thick woods  if we could only notify the others  you can go back if you wish while i talk to him  arent you afraid  oh i reckon i can take care of myself answered dave  do you not know i gave a million dollars for these fountains went on the wild man  well they are worth it answered dave calmly it is very good water why dont you have it bottled mr poole  who calls me poole i am the king of sumatra my army is following me  to blow up another fort i suppose said phil as he commenced to back away  yes  then i must go for i dont want to be blown up and so speaking phil commenced to retreat  the fort is not hereit is in oakdale close to the other fort said the wild man and now he came down from the big rock and stood quite close to dave there was a strange look of cunning in his eyes and dave had to shiver although he did his best to keep calm  in oakdale said dave slowly say you blew up that hotel fort in fine shape didnt you  ha ha so i did but i was discovered worse luck i was discovered continued the wild man with a sad shake of his head the enemy saw me  somebody saw you queried our hero with interest  yes worse luck but it shant happen again next time i shall go masked i have my mask here and wilbur poole pulled from his pocket a mask made of a bit of blue cloth i will show you how i wear it and he fastened it over his face by means of a couple of strings  fine fine cried dave in pretended delight he wished to humor the man until phil returned with the others it couldnt be better you ought to patent that kind of a mask  i will patent it soon after the other fort is down  you just said somebody saw you when you blew up the other continued our hero who was it  ha that is a state secret only the cabinet must know of itthe cabinet and the man who makes shoes  i am sorry you wont let me in on your secrets said dave i want to help you wont you hire me as a clerk  how much do you want a week demanded the wild man in a businesslike tone  how much will you give  to a good clerk forty dollars  then ill take the job  very good your name is crusoe isnt itrobinson crusoe  youve got it  if i give you the job you must have your hair shaved off continued the wild man looking at daves hair critically  all right ill have that done when we reach a barber shop  it isnt necessary to wait cried wilbur poole i am a barber  you  to be surei have a certificate from the emperor of siam see here  the wild man put his hand into an inner pocket and suddenly brought forth a pair of long shears  i can cut your hair and shave you he announced just sit down on yonder throne and ill start to work and he pointed to a flat rock  the sight of the sharppointed shears was not a pleasant one and when the wild man invited him to sit down dave felt very much like running away the man evidently saw how he felt and suddenly caught him by the arm  sit down he thundered i wont hurt you i am an expert barber  let us talk about the job first said dave trying to keep his wits about him although he was terribly disturbed he wondered how long it would be before phil would return  what do you want to know  will you cut my hair in the latest fashion  i never cut hair in any other way  and will you curl the ends i like curls  if you want them although they make a man look girlish answered the wild man  and will you went on dave when wilbur poole suddenly grabbed him by both arms and forced him backwards on the flat rock  ill go to work at once cried the wild man sit still and he flourished the shears before our heros face  dave felt a chill run down his backbone but a moment later he felt a thrill of relief as from the bushes behind the wild man stepped phil mr dale and several others     chapter xxviii  the capture of the wild man   now then you may go to work said our hero as he saw mr dale come up close behind the wild man but sharpen the scissors first please  i will was wilbur pooles answer and he opened up the shears and commenced to stroke them back and forth on a rock near by  an instant later the wild man was jerked over backwards and the dangerous shears were snatched from his grasp he commenced to struggle but the whole crowd surrounded him and before he could realize the situation his hands were made fast  it is treachery base treachery he groaned my army has betrayed me and he commenced to weep  what a terrible state of mind to be in murmured roger he is certainly as crazy as they make em  i guess you are right answered phil but i am glad we have got him  he spoke about the blowing up of the hotel said dave and he said somebody saw him do it  who was it  he didnt mention any names  maybe he was simply wandering in his mind suggested ben  i dont think so returned dave i think if he was questioned long enough we could get the truth out of him he doesnt seem to be crazy all the time  its a terrible thing for the poole familyto have such a crazy man in it was busters opinion and the other lads agreed with him  the prisoner was marched along the brook past the home of old herick and then down the riverroad by this time all the searchers had come together including henry morrison and some outsiders  im mighty glad youve got him said the farmer and i hope he dont get away from you  he wont get away answered mr dale  the women of this district have been afraid to go out alone went on henry morrison theyll be glad to know hes been captured  well have to let the pooles know right away said dave  i fancy doctor clay will send a telegram answered mr dale and in the meanwhile well have to take the prisoner to the oakdale lockup  it was nearly noon when the crowd reached oak hall the wild man had but little to say his capture had evidently broken his spirit and he was inclined to cry but when doctor clay asked him if he would like to have something to eat he brightened up wonderfully  it is a sad case said the master of the hall but under proper treatment i think he can be cured  the news quickly circulated throughout the school that the wild man had been caught and that he was wilbur poole an uncle to nat and all the boys were anxious to catch a sight of the strange individual the teachers and servants were likewise curious and looked at him as he ate his dinner in a corner of the dininghall surrounded by those who had captured him and who were watching to see that he did not get away he was not allowed to use a knife and fork but his food was cut up for him and served with a spoon  the only person at oak hall who did not come in to see the wild man was job haskers when asked about this the dictatorial teacher shrugged his shoulders  some of the boys are wild enough for me he said i want nothing to do with the insane  it is a sad case said the teacher who was addressing job haskers  there are many just as bad responded the other coldly it is up to the poole family to look after that man and see that he doesnt break out again  it was decided to take the wild man down to oakdale in the school carryall to be driven by horsehair mr dale was to go along and so were phil dave ben buster and doctor clay  the carryall was brought around to the side entrance of the school and wilbur poole was told that he was about to take a ride through the country he walked through the hallway willingly enough but suddenly on turning a corner set up a shout  you you i have found you at last he cried rushing forward you are the one who exposed me base soldier that you are you have ruined the whole army and in a sudden fit of passion he ran up to job haskers and caught him by the throat  lelet gggo gasped the teacher and tried to shake the man off then the others ran up and wilbur poole was dragged back and handcuffed  do you know that man asked dave struck by a sudden idea  yes yes groaned the wild man he exposed me the army is lost  how did he expose you  he saw me do it  do what  blow up the forthotel oh what a base villain he was to look on groaned the wild man and suddenly commenced to weep  what istheerman talking about stammered job haskers and all saw him turn pale  he says you saw him blow up sparrs place said dave pointedly  it is false absurd said the teacher ieri never saw the rascal before  he isnt a rascal mr haskers he is simply out of his mind remonstrated mr dale he is not accountable for his actions  well he ought not to say such things returned the dictatorial teacher  you saw meyou know you did cried wilbur poole you spoiled everything i might have blown up many forts if it hadnt been for you and he shook his head dolefully  take him away said the teacher and turned his back on the wild man  dave i think the wild man speaks the truth whispered phil to our hero  possibly phil i think the matter will bear investigation  and if old haskers saw the thing done why didnt he tell about it do you think that letter  it struck me that such might be the truth phil but dont say anything until you are sure  he was down on usever since we mentioned that affair with the widow breen went on the shipowners son  id like to see that letter jason sparr gotsaying we were guilty returned our hero maybe doctor clay can get hold of it  all the way to oakdale the boys spoke of the case in whispers phil was quite sure job haskers had seen wilbur poole blow up the hotel and equally sure that the dictatorial teacher had written the letter to the hotelkeeper stating he dave and their chums were guilty  he thought wed be locked up or at least that wed be sent away from the school and he would be rid of us said phil he is growing afraid of us oh if we can prove that he did it ill make it hot for him  if he did such a thing as that he ought to be discharged from oak hall was bens comment  ill get my father to sue him for damages put in buster  well dont be hasty advised dave there may be some mistakealthough i think not  at oakdale wilbur poole was turned over to the authorities who placed him in a comfortable room attached to the lockup as it was known that he was insane he could not be counted a criminal and the majority of the people pitied him and hoped that some day he would be restored to his right mind  a telegram was sent to the poole family and the next day came a reply that some men would come to take wilbur poole away to a sanitarium it was established beyond a doubt that he had used the dynamite to blow up the diningroom of sparrs hotel and consequently our hero and his chums were cleared of that charge much to their satisfaction  i wonder if nat will come back said shadow i should think he would hate to do it  i dont think he will said luke  what will you do if he does come back phil asked gus  i dont know gus of course ill let him know what i think of him for spoiling my plans for a spread but i hate to be hard on him because of this disgrace about his uncle  yes thats a terrible thing was chip macklins comment id hate to have a crazy man in my family  well such things cant be helped put in polly vane the poole family will have to make the best of it  it was several days later when nat poole showed himself phil and dave did not see him until later and both were struck by the change in his appearance he looked haggard and much older and his arrogance was completely gone  got back eh said phil walking up to him  yes returned the moneylenders son and his voice sounded hollow  what have they done with your uncle nat asked dave kindly  put him in another sanitarium where he will have the best of care and doctoring  i hope he gets well  we all hope that nat swallowed a lump in his throat and then looked gloomily at phil well you got the best of me he said shortly  how the best of you demanded the shipowners son  i understand you found out about that spread  i did  well ill pay for the damage doneas soon as i get the money i havent any nowdads got too much to pay on uncle wilburs account nat swallowed another lump in his throat im sorry i did it now phil honest i am he went on brokenly  well if thats the case let us drop the matter nat was the instant reply i dont believe in hitting a fellow when he is down you havent got to pay me anything the whole thing is past and goneand that ends it  thank you nat wanted to say something more but his voice suddenly broke and he turned away to hide his emotion and then walked away  hes hit and hit hard said roger in a low voice  and you did well to drop that matter phil added dave maybe nat has learned a lesson he wont easily forget  dave was right about the lesson nat poole had learned he was deeply humiliated both by the exposure concerning the feast and by what had been learned concerning his insane uncle and for a long time was quite another boy  it may be added here that at a new sanitarium and under firstclass medical treatment a marked change came over wilbur poole and in less than a year he was completely cured of his weakmindedness with a nurse as a companion he went into the country to rest both body and mind and later on came out into the world again as well as anybody strange to say he remembered nothing of calling himself the king of sumatra nor of blowing up jason sparrs hotel but others did not forget about the blowing up and the damage done had to be settled for by mr aaron poole who was his brothers guardian and manager of his estate for the time being     chapter xxix  a bit of evidence   dave what do you make of this  well to tell the truth phil i dont think much of it  you dont think it is a clew  do you  its rather faint i must confess  oh i dont think there is anything to it declared ben  there is something but not a great deal came from roger i dont see how you are going to follow it up  this talk between the boys occurred after dave phil ben roger and buster had called upon jason sparr and the justice and insisted on seeing the letter the hotel man had received which stated that the boys were guilty of blowing up the diningroom of his hostelry  the hotel man had treated them kindly for he was in dread that the boys would get their folks to sue him for damages he had offered to pay back the money taken from phil for the spread and the shipowners son had taken the amount to which he was justly entitled  the examination of the letter had revealed next to nothing it was evidently written in a disguised hand but some of the letters looked like job haskerss handwriting in the corner of the paper some sort of an advertisement had been torn off only the letters blisher showing  i think those letters are part of the word publisher dave had said this letter was evidently penned by somebody who used some publishers blank  maybe job haskers had those blanks phil had exclaimed remember he said he published or was going to publish something once upon a time  the boys talked it over but could reach no conclusion jason sparr told how the letter had come to him but this added no new light on the subject  well it was a nasty trick no matter who played it said dave  i shant rest until i find out who did it retorted phil  all were resolved to watch job haskers and also nat poole but while doing this they had to turn once more to their studies phil ben and buster had to work harder than ever and so did dave to make up for the time lost during their absence but doctor clay was kind to them and for once job haskers did not say anything although he showed that he expected them to toe the mark as roger expressed it  several weeks slipped by and during that time oak hall played several games of ball one game of importance was won and this was celebrated in a befitting manner dave attended the games and so did phil and roger but none of the three allowed the sport to interfere with their studies all were in the grind and resolved to graduate that coming june with the highest possible honors  during those days dave received many letters from home his folks and friends were glad to know that the wild man had been captured and the mystery of the blowing up cleared away jessie sent him a very warm letter in particular congratulating him for bringing back the runaways and saying she hoped he would have no more trouble during the final term at oak hall she added that she and all the others expected to come to the school at graduation exercises  now it is up to me to make good said dave after reading this letter several times dad expects it and jessie and everybody and i am not going to disappoint them  but it was no light task to remain at the top of the senior class or even near it for there were bright seniors in plenty including the studious polly vane who seemed the brightest of all but dave plugged away day after day resolved to keep at it until the very last he was writing on his theme and had it about half finished  one month more and it will all be over but the shouting said roger one day as he came into the room where dave was studying  all over but the shouting or weeping returned phil who was present i am afraid some of the fellows will do more weeping than cheering he added grimly  let us hope that everybody passes said dave looking up with a quiet smile  such a thing has never been done said ben somebody is bound to drop by the waysidei hope it isnt yours truly and he sank his head again into his book  i think old haskers is commencing to tighten the screws again said buster he let up for a while after the wild man was caught but yesterday and todayphew we caught it didnt we  we sure did cried phil i cant understand that man why is he a teacher when he just naturally hates boys  thats a conundrum that cant be answered said the senators son  well we wont weep on leaving him remarked luke dryly  say that puts me in mind of a story said shadow once on a time a man in an auto ran into a boy carrying a cat in a basket he didnt hurt the boy much but he killed the cat says he i am sorry my boy and ill pay you for the cat how much ii dont know blubbered the boy will two dollars do asked the man yes says the boy and took the money were you taking the cat home asked the man when he was ready to drive on no said the boy i was going to take him down to the canal and drown him and there was a smile over shadows yarn  it had been a blustery day and as night came on the wind increased in violence until it fairly howled around oak hall it tore through the branches of the oaks that gave the place its name until it looked as if some of the trees might be broken off by the fury of the elements  my gracious i never saw such a wind cried roger as he came in from a trip to the gymnasium  it must be fierce at sea returned dave who was with him i am glad i am on shore the newspapers will tell about wrecks along the coast tomorrow  nobody thought of going out that evening and the boys put in the time studying and reading the windows rattled and occasionally a shutter banged and a good nights rest seemed out of the question  my what a night for a fire remarked phil while he and his chums were undressing  dont mention such a thing returned ben with a shiver it would burn down everything  at last the boys retired a few dropped off to sleep but dave was not one of them he had studied hard and was restless and the fury of the elements added to his nervousness  at last he could stand it no longer to remain in bed and got up to sit in an easychair for awhile  he was just crossing the dormitory floor when there came an extra heavy blast of wind outside followed by a crash as one of the giant oaks standing close to the school building was broken off near the top then came another crash a jingling of glass and a sudden wild cry for help  hello somethings gone through a window dave muttered maybe its in the next room  he ran to the window and looked out just below the windowsill he saw some branches of the broken tree he looked down and noted that the treetop had gone into the window of the room below  whats the row cried roger springing up and rubbing his eyes  is the roof caving in asked phil  some treebranches came down and went through the window right below us answered dave listen  all did so and heard the cry for help repeated  its job haskers calling said the senators son he uses the room below us now  let us see if he is hurt suggested another of the boys  clad in their pajamas the boys flocked out into the hallway there to be joined by others word was passed around of what had occurred and all made their way to the door of the instructors apartment they heard him yelling for help with all his might  the door was locked and dave and some others put their shoulders to the barrier and forced it open all was dark in the room and the wind was rushing around sending books pictures and other things in all directions  several matches were struck and at last a sheltered light was lit doctor clay mr dale and some of the other teachers had now arrived and instructors and students gazed curiously at the scene before them  the top of the tree had come straight through the big window of the apartment crashing down on a bureau and a writingdesk smashing both flat some branches of the tree rested on the side of the bed pinning job haskers against the wall as if in a cage  illustration help me save me spluttered the terrorstricken teacherpage 287  help me save me spluttered the terrorstricken teacher i am being crushed to death  all hands to the tree shouted mr dale and showed what he meant boys and men took hold of the treebranches and pulled them to one side  are you much hurt mr haskers asked doctor clay kindly  ii dont know i think so gasped the teacher his face was white and he was shivering from fright  cant you crawl under the branches asked mr dale here come this way  he showed how it could be done and trembling from head to feet the scared teacher got out from under the treetop his face and one shoulder were scratched but otherwise he appeared to be unhurt but all were forced to acknowledge that he had had a narrow escape  you had better take one of the spare rooms mr haskers said doctor clay as another blast of wind swept through the room you cannot remain here with this treetop in the room and i am afraid we shall have to saw it up to get it out again you can be thankful that your life has been spared  the furniture is smashed murmured the teacher  never mind the furniture so long as you are not hurt it can be mended and all the window needs is some new sash  my things have been scattered grumbled the teacher a perfect mess  leave it until morningyou can do nothing tonight said the doctor and so it was finally decided and teachers and pupils trooped off to bed the brokenin door was closed but it could not be locked  the boys had scarcely gotten back to the dormitories when dave called phil ben roger and buster to one side  now is our chance he whispered did you notice that the bureau and the writingdesk in haskerss room were smashed it may not be the most honorable thing to do but i think we are justified in looking his things over and seeing if we cant find some clew to that letter jason sparr received  right you are declared phil promptly and the others said practically the same  they waited until the other boys had retired once more and then at a signal from dave all filed silently into the hallway again and tiptoed their way to the room below soon they were inside and had the light lit and also a lantern which belonged to bens bicycle and which he had chanced to have on hand  silently and with great care the boys went over the many things that had been scattered over the floorwearing apparel books pads papers and various articles of more or less value presently phil gave a low cry  look at this and he held up several sheets of paper in one corner were the words                             latin made easy                        job haskers publisher                              albany n y its the same paper cried dave he tore the corner off so that just the letters blisher remained  thats pretty good evidence said roger  i should say it was cried ben wonder what he will have to say about it when we confront him with it  let us look for more evidence while we are at it came from buster and then the midnight search continued     chapter xxx  the exposuregoodby to oak hall   doctor clay we must see you about something that is very important  thus spoke dave the next morning as he and his chums filed into the doctors private office after the opening of the school job haskers was not at his class but in his room straightening out his things while some men had been sent up to get rid of the treetop and repair the window the storm was a thing of the past and no other damage of importance had been done  very well boys returned the master of the school kindly come in and let me know what it is  the students came in rather awkwardly it must be admitted for they had much on their minds and did not know just how the worthy doctor would take it but they had decided on a course of action and they had given their word to stick together to the end dave as the natural leader had been chosen spokesman  doctor clay we want to bring up a subject of great importance said dave important to us and to you and to the whole school the boys have asked me to speak for them and for myself  about what demanded the master somewhat shortly  about mr haskers and how he has treated us  what has he done now  it isnt what he has done now doctor clay it is what he did some time agodid his best to get us into grave trouble answered dave warmly youll remember the letter mr sparr got stating we were guilty of trying to blow up his hotel we are now satisfied that mr haskers penned that letterin fact we have the evidence to prove it  impossible  no sir it is true and i dare him to deny it it is an absolute fact doctor clay and we have come here this morning to inform you that we can no longer attend a school where he is a teacher went on dave firmly  butbut youeryou astound me porter tell me what you know or think you know  in a plain straightforward manner dave mentioned the letter and the printing that had appeared on it then he told how he and his chums had searched the bedroom after the treetop crash and found the sheets of paper with that same printing and he produced them  and we also found these in a corner of the broken writingdesk he continued some writing by mr haskers in which he practiced backhand this writing is just like that which appears in the letter mr sparr got compare the two and you will see we are right wilbur poole said mr haskers saw him blow up the hotel and he told the truth even if he is weakminded  but why should mr haskers do such an outrageous thing asked the master of oak hall  i will tell you why sir returned dave and related the affair of the widow breen that made him very sore on us and he wanted to get us out of the school at first he tried it by overworking us in our lessons and when he found that that didnt work he tried this game of making out that we were criminals  yes butbut would a teacher of mine stoop so low murmured the worthy doctor shaking his head doubtfully  no ordinary teacher would dr clay but mr haskers is not an ordinary manhe is very dictatorial and harsh and he hates boys even though he has to teach them he isnt a bit like mr dale or the others  we never had any trouble with any teacher but haskers put in phil  and if we have to leave oak hall im going to get my father to sue haskers for damages added roger  a talk lasting the best part of an hour followed and at last the worthy doctor had his eyes opened to the unworthiness of his assistant he scanned the sheets of paper and the writing the boys had brought with interest  you are rightthis is mr haskerss hand he said slowly but is it the same hand that wrote that villainous letter to mr sparr  compare the two and you will see that we are right answered dave  i will answered the doctor and a little later he set off for oakdale in his buggy going alone  the boys walked down to the gymnasium resolved to keep out of all classes until the matter had been settled they had impressed it on doctor clays mind that either job haskers must leave the school or they would do so  it was nearly noon when the master of oak hall came back driving slowly and looking very thoughtful the boys met him at the entrance to the grounds and he told them to come to the office and closed the door carefully behind them  you were right he said almost brokenly i have been deceived by thisthisi do not know what to call him it will make a great stir when the truth is knownand it will hurt the school he added with a sigh  why should we make a stir about it asked dave quickly let him go that is all we ask he can resign  no the truth must come out was the firm reply he shall not shelter himself behind you even for the benefit of the school i have already told the authorities the facts in the case if they wish to arrest him they can do so and you may appear against him if you wish  when will you tell him asked phil as there came a brief pause  at once and i wish you to be present and hear what is said returned doctor clay he rang a bell and a servant appeared tell mr haskers to come here immediately  there was silence after this the boys not knowing what to say and the master of the school being busy with his thoughts presently the door opened and job haskers came in with a look of curiosity on his face  you sent for me doctor he inquired  i did mr haskers was the cold reply i want your resignation and i want it at once  the master of oak hall had gotten to his feet and the two men stood facing each other doctor clay had his jaw set and never had the students seen him look so determined he was no longer a kindly schoolmaster he was a judge and a stern judge at that  youyou want my resignation faltered job haskers  yes and at once  why  because you are not fit to teach hereyou are not fit to teach anywhere thundered the doctor i want your resignation and then i want you to leave just as soon as you possibly can  butbuti want you to explain i want  it is not necessary for me to explain haskers you have been found out you are a despicable villain and you ought to be in jail i trusted you and you have deceived me more than that you have tried to get these young gentlemen into serious trouble dont deny it for it will do no good we have the absolute proof against you and those proofs are also in the hands of the law if you dont want to be arrested you will leave this school as soon as you can get your baggage packed  sir i want you to know commenced job haskers but stopped short for doctor clay had taken a stride forward and was shaking a finger in the teachers face  i will not argue with you haskers for a long time i have not been satisfied with your work for you did not seem to have the students interest at heart you have a good education but a teacher must have more than thathe must have a heart for his work now you are found out and i want nothing more to do with you i will give you a check for what is due you up to today and you will sign a receipt in full and also your resignation and then i never want to see or hear of you again  and suppose i wont resign snarled the teacher i have a contract  if you dont get out youll go to jail  and well sue you dave could not help putting in  thats right well push the case as far as the law allows added phil  ha you think you are smart but you dont know it all snarled the teacher but his manner showed his uneasiness he attempted to argue but doctor clay would not listen and when he said he would send for a constable job haskers quickly capitulated signed his resignation took his check and hurried away to pack his baggage he left about an hour later by the back way so that none of the students saw him go an hour after that a man came for his trunks and bags and that was the last seen or heard of him at oak hall  hurrah cried dave when the affair was at an end how glad i am that haskers is gone i feel as if a weight had been taken from my head  i guess everybody will be glad returned roger and he was right some of the students wanted to get up a celebration in honor of the unpopular teachers departure but this was not permitted but the boys had a time on the quiet and thoroughly enjoyed it  with the going away of job haskers and the clearing up of the mystery surrounding the letter oak hall settled down once more to its normal condition another teacher came to take the place of the man who had left and he proved popular all around and made doctor clay wonder why he had not made a change long before  with their minds free from worry dave and his chums buckled down to their lessons and our hero spent much time over his paper on the future of our country soon the examinations started and then the boys fell to worrying over how they would fare in this final test  well i hope i pass remarked phil when the last examination was over i dont expect to be near the top i lost too much going to cave island and when i ran away  me for the passing mark too chimed in ben  well i am hoping for something better said roger  what about you dave queried buster  i am like roger hoping for something better answered our hero with a smile but im prepared to take what comes he added  at last came the day when the announcements were to be made dave had sent in his theme and he expected to hear from this as well as from his studies in the meantime preparations were going forward for the graduation exercises and visitors were expected from far and near nearly all the folks from crumville were coming and also the parents of phil roger and the other seniors  the big assembly room was crowded when the announcements were made the passing mark was seventyfive per cent and many of the boys dreaded to think that they might be below that  i will read the names in the order of merit said doctor clay after the opening exercises only two boys have failed to pass for graduation and they will be conditioned if they so desire i am proud of the record and then the master of the school proceeded to read the list polly vane and dave had each ninetysix per cent roger had ninetyfour shadow ninety sam and luke each eightyeight phil eightyseven gus eightysix and so on down to buster who squeezed through with seventyeight the boys who had failed to pass were nat poole who had only sixtyeight and one of his cronies who was marked sixtynine  it aint fair i did as well as lots of em said nat when the reading was over but nobody listened to him for all knew that the examinations had been just in every particular  i will now announce the prizes for the best themes on the subject the future of our country went on doctor clay the reading of the nine papers handed in has afforded me great pleasure for all are good and many of them excellent but i think the best of all is that written by david porter and the committee of teachers who have examined the papers agree with me porter i congratulate you and i will now ask you to come forward and read your meritorious composition to your fellowstudents  and amid a general handclapping our hero went to the platform and commenced to read the theme everybody listened with close attention and loud was the applause when he had concluded it was certainly a fine paper and later on doctor clay had it published in one of the school journals where it attracted not a little attention  dave was certainly happy and he had good reason to be he sent word home that night of how he had fared and the next day received several messages of congratulation one message from jessie he prized very highly for she wrote you deserve a big hug for coming through so finely my very best wishes the other boys also got congratulations and that night and the night to follow were bonfire nights in more ways than one  well we are rid of haskers and also merwell and jasniff remarked roger to dave we ought to be happy eh dave  yes and especially over coming out so well for graduation answered dave  do you think well ever see haskers or merwell again questioned phil  i dont knowi trust not answered our hero but his wish was not fulfilled he did meet the pair and in a most unexpected fashion as will be related in the next volume of this series to be called dave porter in the gold fields or the search for the landslide mine in which we will learn how dave went west with some of his chums and joined an old prospector in a hunt for a lost mine that had been willed to roger morrs mother  the graduation exercises at oak hall that year formed a gala event long to be remembered the school and the campus were crowded and dave and his chums surprised even doctor clay by chipping in and hiring a brass band to play outside after the exercises were over the boys also presented their teachers and the master with some volumes of history and poetry and received numerous gifts in return from his father dave got a bankbook with an amount written therein that was a complete surprise his sister gave him a neat stickpin and his uncle a set of books and from jessie and her folks came a desk set of solid silver suitably engraved  well i think i ought to be the happiest boy alive said dave after the exercises were over and he had his diploma tied with a broad ribbon i feel just as if i was walking on air  and i am glad too said his sister laura warmly  we are all glad put in jessie and gave him her brightest smile  glad and proud dave said his father my boy you have done very well  and then the whole party went down to the gymnasium where refreshments were being served to the visitors and here let us leave dave porter wishing him well  the end     dave porter series  by edward stratemeyer  mr stratemeyer has seldom introduced a more popular hero
