3410841	the function of the poet and other essays  by james russell lowell   collected and edited by albert mordell   kennikat press incport washington ny  the function of the poet  1920 by houghton mifflin company  reissued in 1967 by kennikat press     preface   the centenary celebration of james russell lowell last year showed that he has become more esteemed as a critic and essayist than as a poet lowell himself felt that his true calling was in critical work rather than in poetry and he wrote very little verse in the latter part of his life he was somewhat chagrined that the poetic flame of his youth did not continue to glow but he resigned himself to his fate nevertheless it should be remembered that the vision of sir launfal the biglow papers and the commemoration ode are enough to make the reputation of any poet  the present volume sustains lowells right to be considered one of the great american critics the literary merit of some of the essays herein is in many respects nowise inferior to that in some of the volumes he collected himself the articles are all exquisitely and carefully written and the style of even the book reviews displays that quality found in his best writings which ferris greenslet has appropriately described as savory that such a quantity of good literature by so able a writer as lowell should have been allowed to repose buried in the files of old magazines so long is rather unfortunate the fact that lowell did not collect them is a tribute to his modesty a tribute all the more worthy in these days when some writers of ephemeral reviews on ephemeral books think it their duty to collect their opinions in book form  the essays herein represent the matured author as they were written in the latter part of his life between his thirtysixth and fiftyseventh years the only early essay is the one on poe it appeared in grahams magazine for february 1845 and was reprinted by griswold in his edition of poe it has also been reprinted in later editions of poe but has never been included in any of lowells works this was no doubt due to the slight break in the relations between poe and lowell due to poes usual accusations of plagiarism the essay still remains one of the best on poe ever written  though lowell became in later life quite conservative and academic it should not be thought that these essays show no sympathy with liberal ideas he was also appreciative of the first works of new writers and had good and prophetic insight his favorable reviews of the first works of howells and james and the subsequent career of these two men indicate the sureness of lowells critical mind many readers will enjoy in these days of the ouija board and messages from the dead the raps at spiritualism here and there moreover there is a passage in the first essay showing that lowell before freud understood the psychoanalytic theory of genius in its connection with childhood memories the passage follows lowells narration of the story of little montague  none of the essays in this volume has appeared in book form except a few fragments from some of the opening five essays which were reported from lowells lectures in the boston advertiser in 1855 and were privately printed some years ago charles eliot norton performed a service to the world when he published in the century magazine in 1893 and 1894 some lectures from lowells manuscripts these lectures are now collected and form the first five essays in this book i have also retained professor nortons introductions and notes attention is called to his remark that the function of the poet is not unworthy to stand with sidneys and shelleys essays on poetry  the rest of the essays in this volume appeared in lowells lifetime in the atlantic monthly the north american review and the nation they were all anonymous but are assigned to lowell by george willis cooke in his bibliography of james russell lowell lowell was editor of the atlantic from the time of its founding in 1857 to may 1861 he was editor of the north american review from january 1864 to the time he left for europe in 1872 with one exception that on poetry and nationalism which formed the greater part of a review of the poems of howellss friend piatt all the articles from these two magazines reprinted in this volume appeared during lowells editorship these articles include reviews of poems by his friends longfellow and whittier and in his review of the courtship of miles standish lowell makes effective use of his scholarship to introduce a lengthy and interesting discourse on the dactylic hexameter  while we are on the subject of the new england poets a word about the present misunderstanding and tendency to underrate them may not be out of place because it is growing to be the consensus of opinion that the two greatest poets america has produced are whitman and poe it does not follow that the newenglanders must be relegated to the scrapheap nor do i see any inconsistency in a man whose taste permits him to enjoy both the free verse and unpuritanic if i may coin a word poems of masters and sandburg and also whittiers snowbound and longfellows courtship of miles standish though these poems are not profound there is something of the universal in them they have pleasant schoolday memories for all of us and will no doubt have such for our children  lowells cosmopolitan tastes may be seen in his essays on men so different as thackeray swift and plutarch hardly any one knows that he even wrote about these authors lowell preferred thackeray to dickens a judgment in which many people today no longer agree with him as a young man he hated swift but he gives us a sane study of him the review of plutarchs essays edited by goodwin with an introduction by emerson is also of interest  the last essay in the volume on a plea for freedom from speech and figures of speechmakers shows lowells satirical powers at their best ferris greenslet tells us in his book on lowell that the philip vandal whose eloquence lowell ridicules is wendell phillips the essay gives lowells humorous comments on various matters especially on contemporary types of orators reformers and heroes it represents lowell as he is most known to us the lowell who is always ready with fun and who set the world agog with his biglow papers  lowells work as a critic dates from the rare volume conversations on some of the old poets published in 1844 in his twentyfifth year includes his bestknown volumes among my books and my study windows and most fitly concludes with the latest literary essays published in the year of his death in 1891 my sincere hope is that this book will not be found to be an unworthy successor to these volumes  though some of lowells literary opinions are oldfashioned to us one author even wrote an entire volume to demolish lowells reputation as a critic there is much in his work that the world will not let die he is highly regarded abroad and he is one of the few men in our literature who produced creative criticism  thanks and acknowledgments are due the century magazine and the literary representatives of lowell for permission to reprint in

1860     on poetry and belleslettres  the function of the poet   this was the concluding lecture in the course which lowell read before the lowell institute in the winter of 1855 doubtless lowell never printed it because as his genius matured he felt that its assertions were too absolute and that its style bore too many marks of haste in composition and was too rhetorical for an essay to be read in print how rapid was the growth of his intellectual judgment and the broadening of his imaginative view may be seen by comparing it with his essays on swinburne on percival and on rousseau published in 1866 and 1867essays in which the topics of this lecture were touched upon anew though not treated at large  but the spirit of this lecture is so fine its tone so full of the enthusiasm of youth its conception of the poet so lofty and the truths it contains so important that it may well be prized as the expression of a genius which if not yet mature is already powerful and aquiline alike in vision and in sweep of wing it is not unworthy to stand with sidneys and with shelleys defence of poesy and it is fitted to warm and inspire the poetic heart of the youth of this generation no less than of that to which it was first addressed as a close to the lecture lowell read his beautiful then unpublished poem to the muse  charles eliot norton                                       whether as some philosophers assume we possess only the fragments of a great cycle of knowledge in whose centre stood the primeval man in friendly relation with the powers of the universe and build our hovels out of the ruins of our ancestral palace or whether according to the development theory of others we are rising gradually and have come up out of an atom instead of descending from an adam so that the proudest pedigree might run up to a barnacle or a zoophyte at last are questions that will keep for a good many centuries yet confining myself to what little we can learn from history we find tribes rising slowly out of barbarism to a higher or lower point of culture and civility and everywhere the poet also is found under one name or other changing in certain outward respects but essentially the same  and however far we go back we shall find this alsothat the poet and the priest were united originally in the same person which means that the poet was he who was conscious of the world of spirit as well as that of sense and was the ambassador of the gods to men this was his highest function and hence his name of seer he was the discoverer and declarer of the perennial beneath the deciduous his were the epea pteroenta the true winged words that could fly down the unexplored future and carry the names of ancestral heroes of the brave and wise and good it was thus that the poet could reward virtue and by and by as society grew more complex could burn in the brand of shame this is homers character of demodocus in the eighth book of the odyssey whom the muse loved and gave the good and illthe gift of conferring good or evil immortality the first histories were in verse and sung as they were at feasts and gatherings of the people they awoke in men the desire of fame which is the first promoter of courage and selftrust because it teaches men by degrees to appeal from the present to the future we may fancy what the influence of the early epics was when they were recited to men who claimed the heroes celebrated in them for their ancestors by what bouchardon the sculptor said only two centuries ago when i read homer i feel as if i were twenty feet high nor have poets lost their power over the future in modern times dante lifts up by the hair the face of some petty traitor the smith or brown of some provincial italian town lets the fire of his inferno glare upon it for a moment and it is printed forever on the memory of mankind the historians may iron out the shoulders of richard the third as smooth as they can they will never get over the wrench that shakespeare gave them  the peculiarity of almost all early literature is that it seems to have a double meaning that underneath its natural we find ourselves continually seeing or suspecting a supernatural meaning in the older epics the characters seem to be half typical and only half historical thus did the early poets endeavor to make realities out of appearances for except a few typical men in whom certain ideas get embodied the generations of mankind are mere apparitions who come out of the dark for a purposeless moment and reënter the dark again after they have performed the nothing they came for  gradually however the poet as the seer became secondary to the maker his office became that of entertainer rather than teacher but always something of the old tradition was kept alive and if he has now come to be looked upon merely as the best expresser the gift of seeing is implied as necessarily antecedent to that and of seeing very deep too if any man would seem to have written without any conscious moral that man is shakespeare but that must be a dull sense indeed which does not see through his tragicyes and his comicmasks awful eyes that flame with something intenser and deeper than a mere scenic meaninga meaning out of the great deep that is behind and beyond all human and merely personal character nor was shakespeare himself unconscious of his place as a teacher and profound moralist witness that sonnet in which he bewails his having neglected sometimes the errand that was laid upon him    alas t is true i have gone here and there   and made myself a motley to the view   gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear   made old offences of affections new   most true it is that i have lookd on truth   askance and strangely  the application of which is made clear by the next sonnet in which he distinctly alludes to his profession  there is this unmistakable stamp on all the great poetsthat however in little things they may fall below themselves whenever there comes a great and noble thing to say they say it greatly and nobly and bear themselves most easily in the royalties of thought and language there is not a mature play of shakespeares in which great ideas do not jut up in mountainous permanence marking forever the boundary of provinces of thought and known afar to many kindreds of men  and it is for this kind of sight which we call insight and not for any faculty of observation and description that we value the poet it is in proportion as he has this that he is an adequate expresser and not a juggler with words it is by means of this that for every generation of man he plays the part of namer before him as before adam the creation passes to be named anew first the material world then the world of passions and emotions then the world of ideas but whenever a great imagination comes however it may delight itself with imaging the outward beauty of things however it may seem to flow thoughtlessly away in music like a brook yet the shadow of heaven lies also in its depth beneath the shadow of earth continually the visible universe suggests the invisible we are forever feeling this in shakespeare his imagination went down to the very bases of things and while his characters are the most natural that poet ever created they are also perfectly ideal and are more truly the personifications of abstract thoughts and passions than those of any allegorical writer whatever  even in what seems so purely a picturesque poem as the iliad we feel something of this beholding as homer did from the tower of contemplation the eternal mutability and nothing permanent but change he must look underneath the show for the reality great captains and conquerors came forth out of the eternal silence entered it again with their trampling hosts and shoutings and trumpetblasts and were as utterly gone as those echoes of their deeds which he sang and which faded with the last sound of his voice and the last tremble of his lyre history relating outward events alone was an unmeaning gossip with the world for a village this life could only become other than phantasmagoric could only become real as it stood related to something that was higher and permanent hence the idea of fate of a higher power unseenthat shadow as of an eagle circling to its swoop which flits stealthily and swiftly across the windy plains of troy in the odyssey we find pure allegory  now under all these namespraiser seer soothsayerwe find the same idea lurking the poet is he who can best see and best say what is idealwhat belongs to the world of soul and of beauty whether he celebrate the brave and good man or the gods or the beautiful as it appears in man or nature something of a religious character still clings to him he is the revealer of deity he may be unconscious of his mission he may be false to it but in proportion as he is a great poet he rises to the level of it the more often he does not always directly rebuke what is bad and base but indirectly by making us feel what delight there is in the good and fair if he besiege evil it is with such beautiful engines of war as plutarch tells us of demetrius that the besieged themselves are charmed with them whoever reads the great poets cannot but be made better by it for they always introduce him to a higher society to a greater style of manners and of thinking whoever learns to love what is beautiful is made incapable of the low and mean and bad if plato excludes the poets from his republic it is expressly on the ground that they speak unworthy things of the gods that is that they have lost the secret of their art and use artificial types instead of speaking the true universal language of imagination he who translates the divine into the vulgar the spiritual into the sensual is the reverse of a poet  the poet under whatever name always stands for the same thingimagination and imagination in its highest form gives him the power as it were of assuming the consciousness of whatever he speaks about whether man or beast or rock or tree fit is the ring of canace which whoso has on understands the language of all created things and as regards expression it seems to enable the poet to condense the whole of himself into a single word therefore when a great poet has said a thing it is finally and utterly expressed and has as many meanings as there are men who read his verse a great poet is something more than an interpreter between man and nature he is also an interpreter between man and his own nature it is he who gives us those keywords the possession of which makes us masters of all the unsuspected treasurecaverns of thought and feeling and beauty which open under the dusty path of our daily life  and it is not merely a dry lexicon that he compilesa thing which enables us to translate from one dead dialect into another as deadbut all his verse is instinct with music and his words open windows on every side to pictures of scenery and life the difference between the dry fact and the poem is as great as that between reading the shipping news and seeing the actual coming and going of the crowd of stately shipsthe city on the inconstant billows dancingas there is between ten minutes of happiness and ten minutes by the clock everybody remembers the story of the little montague who was stolen and sold to the chimneysweep how he could dimly remember lying in a beautiful chamber how he carried with him in all his drudgery the vision of a fair sad mothers face that sought him everywhere in vain how he threw himself one day all sooty as he was from his toil on a rich bed and fell asleep and how a kind person woke him questioned him pieced together his broken recollections for him and so at last made the visions of the beautiful chamber and the fair sad countenance real to him again it seems to me that the offices that the poet does for us are typified in this nurserytale we all of us have our vague reminiscences of the stately home of our childhoodfor we are all of us poets and geniuses in our youth while earth is all new to us and the chalice of every buttercup is brimming with the wine of poesyand we all remember the beautiful motherly countenance which nature bent over us there but somehow we all get stolen away thence life becomes to us a sooty taskmaster and we crawl through dark passages without endtill suddenly the word of some poet redeems us makes us know who we are and of helpless orphans makes us the heir to a great estate it is to our true relations with the two great worlds of outward and inward nature that the poet reintroduces us  but the imagination has a deeper use than merely to give poets a power of expression it is the everlasting preserver of the world from blank materialism it forever puts matter in the wrong and compels it to show its title to existence wordsworth tells us that in his youth he was sometimes obliged to touch the walls to find if they were visionary or no and such experiences are not uncommon with persons who converse much with their own thoughts dr johnson said that to kick ones foot against a stone was a sufficient confutation of berkeley and poor old pyrrho has passed into a proverb because denying the objectivity of matter he was run over by a cart and killed but all that he affirmed was that to the soul the cart was no more real than its own imaginative reproduction of it and perhaps the shade of the philosopher ran up to the first of his deriders who crossed the styx with a triumphant i told you so the cart did not run over me for here i am without a bone broken  and in another sense also do those poets who deal with human character as all the greater do continually suggest to us the purely phantasmal nature of life except as it is related to the world of ideas for are not their personages more real than most of those in history is not lear more authentic and permanent than lord raglan their realm is a purely spiritual one in which space and time and costume are nothing what matters it that shakespeare puts a seaport in bohemia and knew less geography than tommy who goes to the district school he understood eternal boundaries such as are laid down on no chart and are not defined by such transitory affairs as mountain chains rivers and seas  no great movement of the human mind takes place without the concurrent beat of those two wings the imagination and the understanding it is by the understanding that we are enabled to make the most of this world and to use the collected material of experience in its condensed form of practical wisdom and it is the imagination which forever beckons toward that other world which is always future and makes us discontented with this the one rests upon experience the other leans forward and listens after the inexperienced and shapes the features of that future with which it is forever in travail the imagination might be defined as the common sense of the invisible world as the understanding is of the visible and as those are the finest individual characters in which the two moderate and rectify each other so those are the finest eras where the same may be said of society in the voyage of life not only do we depend on the needle true to its earthly instincts but upon observation of the fixed stars those beacons lighted upon the eternal promontories of heaven above the stirs and shiftings of our lower system  but it seems to be thought that we have come upon the earth too late that there has been a feast of imagination formerly and all that is left for us is to steal the scraps we hear that there is no poetry in railroads and steamboats and telegraphs and especially none in brother jonathan if this be true so much the worse for him but because he is a materialist shall there be no more poets when we have said that we live in a materialistic age we have said something which meant more than we intended if we say it in the way of blame we have said a foolish thing for probably one age is as good as another and at any rate the worst is good enough company for us the age of shakespeare was richer than our own only because it was lucky enough to have such a pair of eyes as his to see it and such a gift of speech as his to report it and so there is always room and occasion for the poet who continues to be just as he was in the early time nothing more nor less than a seer he is always the man who is willing to take the age he lives in on trust as the very best that ever was shakespeare did not sit down and cry for the water of helicon to turn the wheels of his little private mill at the bankside he appears to have gone more quietly about his business than any other playwright in london to have drawn off what waterpower he needed from the great prosy current of affairs that flows alike for all and in spite of all to have ground for the public what grist they wanted coarse or fine and it seems a mere piece of luck that the smooth stream of his activity reflected with such ravishing clearness every changing mood of heaven and earth every stick and stone every dog and clown and courtier that stood upon its brink it is a curious illustration of the friendly manner in which shakespeare received everything that came alongof what a present man he wasthat in the very same year that the mulberrytree was brought into england he got one and planted it in his garden at stratford  it is perfectly true that this is a materialistic age and for that very reason we want our poets all the more we find that every generation contrives to catch its singing larks without the skys falling when the poet comes he always turns out to be the man who discovers that the passing moment is the inspired one and that the secret of poetry is not to have lived in homers day or dantes but to be alive now to be alive now that is the great art and mystery they are dead men who live in the past and men yet unborn that live in the future we are like hans in luck forever exchanging the burdensome good we have for something else till at last we come home emptyhanded  that palefaced drudge of time opposite me there that weariless sexton whose callous hands bury our rosy hours in the irrevocable past is even now reaching forward to a moment as rich in life in character and thought as full of opportunity as any since adam this little isthmus that we are now standing on is the point to which martyrs in their triumphant pain prophets in their fervor and poets in their ecstasy looked forward as the golden future as the land too good for them to behold with mortal eyes it is the point toward which the fainthearted and desponding hereafter will look back as the priceless past when there was still some good and virtue and opportunity left in the world  the people who feel their own age prosaic are those who see only its costume and that is what makes it prosaicthat we have not faith enough in ourselves to think our own clothes good enough to be presented to posterity in the artists fancy that the court dress of posterity is that of van dycks time or caesars i have seen the model of a statue of sir robert peela statesman whose merit consisted in yielding gracefully to the presentin which the sculptor had done his best to travesty the real man into a makebelieve roman at the period when england produced its greatest poets we find exactly the reverse of this and we are thankful that the man who made the monument of lord bacon had genius to copy every button of his dress everything down to the rosettes on his shoes and then to write under his statue thus sat francis baconnot cneius pompeiusviscount verulam those men had faith even in their own shoestrings  after all how is our poor scapegoat of a nineteenth century to blame why for not being the seventeenth to be sure it is always raining opportunity but it seems it was only the men two hundred years ago who were intelligent enough not to hold their cups bottomup we are like beggars who think if a piece of gold drop into their palm it must be counterfeit and would rather change it for the smoothworn piece of familiar copper and so as we stand in our mendicancy by the wayside time tosses carefully the great golden today into our hats and we turn it over grumblingly and suspiciously and are pleasantly surprised at finding that we can exchange it for beef and potatoes till dantes time the italian poets thought no language good enough to put their nothings into but latinand indeed a dead tongue was the best for dead thoughtsbut dante found the common speech of florence in which men bargained and scolded and made love good enough for him and out of the world around him made a poem such as no roman ever sang  in our day it is said despairingly the understanding reigns triumphant it is the age of common sense if this be so the wisest way would be to accept it manfully but after all what is the meaning of it looking at the matter superficially one would say that a striking difference between our science and that of the worlds gray fathers is that there is every day less and less of the element of wonder in it what they saw written in light upon the great arch of heaven and by a magnificent reach of sympathy of which we are incapable associated with the fall of monarchs and the fate of man is for us only a professor a piece of chalk and a blackboard the solemn and unapproachable skies we have vulgarized we have peeped and botanized among the flowers of light pulled off every petal fumbled in every calyx and reduced them to the bare stem of order and class the stars can no longer maintain their divine reserves but whenever there is a conjunction and congress of planets every enterprising newspaper sends thither its special reporter with his telescope over those arcana of life where once a mysterious presence brooded we behold scientific explorers skipping like so many incarnate notes of interrogation we pry into the counsels of the great powers of nature we keep our ears at the keyhole and know everything that is going to happen there is no longer any sacred inaccessibility no longer any enchanting unexpectedness and life turns to prose the moment there is nothing unattainable it needs no more a voice out of the unknown proclaiming great pan is dead we have found his tombstone deciphered the arrowheaded inscription upon it know his age to a day and that he died universally regretted  formerly science was poetry a mythology which broods over us in our cradle which mingles with the lullaby of the nurse which peoples the day with the possibility of divine encounters and night with intimation of demonic ambushes is something quite other as the material for thought and poetry from one that we take down from our bookshelves as sapless as the shelf it stood on as remote from all present sympathy with man or nature as a town history with its genealogies of mr nobodys greatgrandparents  we have utilized everything the egyptians found a hint of the solar system in the concentric circles of the onion and revered it as a symbol while we respect it as a condiment in cookery and can pass through all weathersfield without a thought of the stars our world is a museum of natural history that of our forefathers was a museum of supernatural history and the rapidity with which the change has been going on is almost startling when we consider that so modern and historical a personage as queen elizabeth was reigning at the time of the death of dr john faustus out of whose story the teutonic imagination built up a mythus that may be set beside that of prometheus  science looked at scientifically is bare and bleak enough on those sublime heights the air is too thin for the lungs and blinds the eyes it is much better living down in the valleys where one cannot see farther than the next farmhouse faith was never found in the bottom of a crucible nor peace arrived at by analysis or synthesis but all this is because science has become too grimly intellectual has divorced itself from the moral and imaginative part of man our results are not arrived at in that spirit which led kepler who had his theorytraps set all along the tracks of the stars to catch a discovery to say in my opinion the occasions of new discoveries have been no less wonderful than the discoveries themselves  but we are led back continually to the fact that science cannot if it would disengage itself from human nature and from imagination no two men have ever argued together without at least agreeing in this that something more than proof is required to produce conviction and that a logic which is capable of grinding the stubbornest facts to powder as every mans own logic always is is powerless against so delicate a structure as the brain do what we will we cannot contrive to bring together the yawning edges of proof and belief to weld them into one when thor strikes skrymir with his terrible hammer the giant asks if a leaf has fallen i need not appeal to the thors of argument in the pulpit the senate and the massmeeting if they have not sometimes found the popular giant as provokingly insensible the sqrt of x is nothing in comparison with the chancecaught smell of a single flower which by the magic of association recreates for us the unquestioning day of childhood demonstration may lead to the very gate of heaven but there she makes us a civil bow and leaves us to make our way back again to faith who has the key that science which is of the intellect alone steps with indifferent foot upon the dead body of belief if only she may reach higher or see farther  but we cannot get rid of our wonderwe who have brought down the wild lightning from writing fiery doom upon the walls of heaven to be our errandboy and pennypostman wonder is crude imagination and it is necessary to us for man shall not live by bread alone and exact knowledge is not enough do we get nearer the truth or farther from it that we have got a gas or an imponderable fluid instead of a spirit we go on exorcising one thing after another but what boots it the evasive genius flits into something else and defies us the powers of the outer and inner world form hand in hand a magnetic circle for whose connection man is necessary it is the imagination that takes his hand and clasps it with that other stretched to him in the dark and for which he was vainly groping it is that which renews the mystery in nature makes it wonderful and beautiful again and out of the gases of the man of science remakes the old spirit but we seem to have created too many wonders to be capable of wondering any longer as coleridge said when asked if he believed in ghosts that he had seen too many of them but nature all the more imperatively demands it and science can at best but scotch it not kill it in this day of newspapers and electric telegraphs in which common sense and ridicule can magnetize a whole continent between dinner and tea we say that such a phenomenon as mahomet were impossible and behold joe smith and the state of deseret turning over the yellow leaves of the same copy of webster on witchcraft which cotton mather studied i thought well that goblin is laid at lastand while i mused the tables were turning and the chairs beating the devils tattoo all over christendom i have a neighbor who dug down through tough strata of clay to a spring pointed out by a witchhazel rod in the hands of a seventh sons seventh son and the water is the sweeter to him for the wonder that is mixed with it after all it seems that our scientific gas be it never so brilliant is not equal to the dingy old aladdins lamp  it is impossible for men to live in the world without poetry of some sort or other if they cannot get the best they will get some substitute for it and thus seem to verify saint augustines slur that it is wine of devils the mind bound down too closely to what is practical either becomes inert or revenges itself by rushing into the savage wilderness of isms the insincerity of our civilization has disgusted some persons so much that they have sought refuge in indian wigwams and found refreshment in taking a scalp now and then nature insists above all things upon balance she contrives to maintain a harmony between the material and spiritual nor allows the cerebrum an expansion at the cost of the cerebellum if the character for example run on one side into religious enthusiasm it is not unlikely to develop on the other a counterpoise of worldly prudence thus the shaker and the moravian are noted for thrift and mystics are not always the worst managers through all changes of condition and experience man continues to be a citizen of the world of idea as well as the world of fact and the taxgatherers of both are punctual  and these antitheses which we meet with in individual character we cannot help seeing on the larger stage of the world also a moral accompanying a material development history the great satirist brings together alexander and the blower of peas to hint to us that the tube of the one and the sword of the other were equally transitory but meanwhile aristotle was conquering kingdoms out of the unknown and establishing a dynasty of thought from whose hand the sceptre has not yet passed so there are charles v and luther the expansion of trade resulting from the spanish and portuguese discoveries and the elizabethan literature the puritans seeking spiritual el dorados while so much valor and thought were spent in finding mineral ones it seems to be the purpose of god that a certain amount of genius shall go to each generation particular quantities being represented by individuals and while no one is complete in himself all collectively make up a whole ideal figure of a man nature is not like certain varieties of the apple that cannot bear two years in succession it is only that her expansions are uniform in all directions that in every age she completes her circle and like a tree adds a ring to her growth be it thinner or thicker  every man is conscious that he leads two lives the one trivial and ordinary the other sacred and recluse the one which he carries to the dinnertable and to his daily work which grows old with his body and dies with it the other that which is made up of the few inspiring moments of his higher aspiration and attainment and in which his youth survives for him his dreams his unquenchable longings for something nobler than success it is this life which the poets nourish for him and sustain with their immortalizing nectar through them he feels once more the white innocence of his youth his faith in something nobler than gold and iron and cotton comes back to him not as an upbraiding ghost that wrings its pale hands and is gone but beautiful and inspiring as a first love that recognizes nothing in him that is not high and noble the poets are natures perpetual pleaders and protest with us against what is worldly out of their own undying youth they speak to ours wretched is the man says goethe who has learned to despise the dreams of his youth it is from this misery that the imagination and the poets who are its spokesmen rescue us the world goes to church kneels to the eternal purity and then contrives to sneer at innocence and ignorance of evil by calling it green let every man thank god for what little there may be left in him of his vernal sweetness let him thank god if he have still the capacity for feeling an unmarketable enthusiasm for that will make him worthy of the society of the noble dead of the companionship of the poets and let him love the poets for keeping youth young woman womanly and beauty beautiful  there is as much poetry as ever in the world if we only knew how to find it out and as much imagination perhaps only that it takes a more prosaic direction every man who meets with misfortune who is stripped of material prosperity finds that he has a little outlying mountainfarm of imagination which did not appear in the schedule of his effects on which his spirit is able to keep itself alive though he never thought of it while he was fortunate job turns out to be a great poet as soon as his flocks and herds are taken away from him  there is no reason why our continent should not sing as well as the rest we have had the practical forced upon us by our position we have had a whole hemisphere to clear up and put to rights and we are descended from men who were hardened and stiffened by a downright wrestle with necessity there was no chance for poetry among the puritans and yet if any people have a right to imagination it should be the descendants of these very puritans they had enough of it or they could never have conceived the great epic they did whose books are states and which is written on this continent from maine to california  but there seems to be another reason why we should not become a poetical people formerly the poet embodied the hopes and desires of men in visible types he gave them the shoes of swiftness the cap of invisibility and the purse of fortunatus these were once stories for grown men and not for the nursery as now we are apt ignorantly to wonder how our forefathers could find satisfaction in fiction the absurdity of which any of our primaryschool children could demonstrate but we forget that the worlds gray fathers were children themselves and that in their little world with its circle of the black unknown all about it the imagination was as active as it is with people in the dark look at a childs toys and we shall understand the matter well enough imagination is the fairy godmother every child has one still at the wave of whose wand sticks become heroes the closet in which she has been shut fifty times for being naughty is turned into a palace and a bit of lath acquires all the potency of excalibur  but nowadays it is the understanding itself that has turned poet in her railroads she has given us the shoes of swiftness fineear herself could not hear so far as she who in her magnetic telegraph can listen in boston and hear what is going on in new orleans and what need of aladdins lamp when a man can build a palace with a patent pill the office of the poet seems to be reversed and he must give back these miracles of the understanding to poetry again and find out what there is imaginative in steam and iron and telegraphwires after all there is as much poetry in the iron horses that eat fire as in those of diomed that fed on men if you cut an apple across you may trace in it the lines of the blossom that the bee hummed around in may and so the soul of poetry survives in things prosaic borrowing money on a bond does not seem the most promising subject in the world but shakespeare found the merchant of venice in it themes of song are waiting everywhere for the right man to sing them like those enchanted swords which no one can pull out of the rock till the hero comes and he finds no more trouble than in plucking a violet  john quincy adams making a speech at new bedford many years ago reckoned the number of whaleships if i remember rightly that sailed out of that port and comparing it with some former period took it as a type of american success but alas it is with quite other oil that those farshining lamps of a nations true glory which burn forever must be filled it is not by any amount of material splendor or prosperity but only by moral greatness by ideas by works of imagination that a race can conquer the future no voice comes to us from the once mighty assyria but the hoot of the owl that nests amid her crumbling palaces of carthage whose merchantfleets once furled their sails in every port of the known world nothing is left but the deeds of hannibal she lies dead on the shore of her once subject sea and the wind of the desert only flings its handfuls of burialsand upon her corpse a fog can blot holland or switzerland out of existence but how large is the space occupied in the maps of the soul by little athens and powerless italy they were great by the soul and their vital force is as indestructible as the soul  till america has learned to love art not as an amusement not as the mere ornament of her cities not as a superstition of what is comme il faut for a great nation but for its humanizing and ennobling energy for its power of making men better by arousing in them a perception of their own instincts for what is beautiful and therefore sacred and religious and an eternal rebuke of the base and worldly she will not have succeeded in that high sense which alone makes a nation out of a people and raises it from a dead name to a living power were our little motherisland sunk beneath the sea or worse were she conquered by scythian barbarians yet shakespeare would be an immortal england and would conquer countries when the bones of her last sailor had kept their ghastly watch for ages in unhallowed ooze beside the quenched thunders of her navy  old purchas in his pilgrims tells of a sacred caste in india who when they go out into the street cry out poo poo to warn all the world out of their way lest they should be defiled by something unclean and it is just so that the understanding in its pride of success thinks to poohpooh all that it considers impractical and visionary but whatever of life there is in man except what comes of beef and pudding is in the visionary and unpractical and if it be not encouraged to find its activity or its solace in the production or enjoyment of art and beauty if it be bewildered or thwarted by an outward profession of faith covering up a practical unbelief in anything higher and holier than the world of sense it will find vent in such wretched holes and corners as tabletippings and mediums who sell news from heaven at a quarter of a dollar the item imagination cannot be banished out of the world she may be made a kitchendrudge a cinderella but there are powers that watch over her when her two proud sisters the intellect and understanding think her crouching over her ashes she startles and charms by her splendid apparition and prince soul will put up with no other bride  the practical is a very good thing in its wayif it only be not another name for the worldly to be absorbed in it is to eat of that insane root which the soldiers of antonius found in their retreat from parthiawhich whoso tasted kept gathering sticks and stones as if they were some great matter till he died  one is forced to listen now and then to a kind of talk which makes him feel as if this were the afterdinner time of the world and mankind were doomed hereafter forever to that kind of contented materialism which comes to good stomachs with the nuts and raisins the dozy old world has nothing to do now but stretch its legs under the mahogany talk about stocks and get rid of the hours as well as it can till bedtime the centuries before us have drained the goblet of wisdom and beauty and all we have left is to cast horoscopes in the dregs but divine beauty and the love of it will never be without apostles and messengers on earth till time flings his hourglass into the abyss as having no need to turn it longer to number the indistinguishable ages of annihilation it was a favorite speculation with the learned men of the sixteenth century that they had come upon the old age and decrepit second childhood of creation and while they maundered the soul of shakespeare was just coming out of the eternal freshness of deity trailing such clouds of glory as would beggar a platonic year of sunsets  no morning and the dewy prime are born into the earth again with every child it is our fault if drought and dust usurp the noon every age says to her poets like the mistress to her lover tell me what i am like and in proportion as it brings forth anything worth seeing has need of seers and will have them our time is not an unpoetical one we are in our heroic age still face to face with the shaggy forces of unsubdued nature and we have our theseuses and perseuses though they may be named israel putnam and daniel boone it is nothing against us that we are a commercial people athens was a trading community dante and titian were the growth of great marts and england was already commercial when she produced shakespeare  this lesson i learn from the past that grace and goodness the fair the noble and the true will never cease out of the world till the god from whom they emanate ceases out of it that they manifest themselves in an eternal continuity of change to every generation of men as new duties and occasions arise that the sacred duty and noble office of the poet is to reveal and justify them to men that so long as the soul endures endures also the theme of new and unexampled song that while there is grace in grace love in love and beauty in beauty god will still send poets to find them and bear witness of them and to hang their ideal portraitures in the gallery of memory god with us is forever the mystical name of the hour that is passing the lives of the great poets teach us that they were the men of their generation who felt most deeply the meaning of the present     humor wit fun and satire  prefatory note   in the winter of 1855 when lowell was thirtysix years old he gave a course of twelve lectures before the lowell institute in boston his subject was the english poets and the special topics of the successive lectures were 1 poetry and the poetic sentiment illustrating the imaginative faculty 2 piers ploughmans vision as the first characteristically english poem 3 the metrical romances marking the advent into our poetry of the sense of beauty 4 the ballads especially as models of narrative diction 5 chaucer as the poet of real lifethe poet outside of nature 6 spenser as the representative of the purely poetical 7 milton as representing the imaginative 8 butler as the wit 9 pope as the poet of artificial life 10 on poetic diction 11 wordsworth as representing the egotistic imaginative or the poet feeling himself in nature 12 on the function and prospects of poetry  these lectures were written rapidly many of them during the period of delivery of the course they bore marks of hastiness of composition but they came from a full and rich mind and they were the issues of familiar studies and long reflection no such criticism at once abundant in knowledge and in sympathetic insight and distinguished by breadth of view as well as by fluency grace and power of style had been heard in america they were listened to by large and enthusiastic audiences and they did much to establish lowells position as the ablest of living critics of poetry and in many respects as the foremost of american men of letters  in the same year he was made professor of belleslettres in harvard university and after spending somewhat more than a year in europe in special preparation he entered in the autumn of 1856 upon the duties of the chair which he continued to occupy till 1877 when he was appointed minister of the united states to spain  during the years of his professorship he delivered numerous courses of lectures to his classes few of them were written out but they were given more or less extemporaneously from full notes the subject of these courses was in general the study of literature treating in different years of different special topics from the literature of northern to that of southern europe from the kalevala and the niebelungen lied to the provençal poets from wolfram von eschenbach to rousseau from the cycle of romances of charlemagne and his peers to dante and shakespeare some of these lectures or parts of them were afterward prepared for publication with such changes as were required to give them proper literary form and the readers of lowells prose works know what gifts of native power what large and solid acquisitions of learning what wide and delightful survey of the field of life and of letters are to be found in his essays on shakespeare on dante on dryden and on many another poet or prose writer the abundance of his resources as critic in the highest sense have never been surpassed at least in english literature  but considerable portions of the earlier as well as of the later lectures remain unprinted partly no doubt because his points of view changed with the growth of his learning and the increasing depth as well as breadth of his vision there is but little in manuscript which he would himself i believe have been inclined to print without substantial change yet these unprinted remains contain so much that seems to me to possess permanent value that after some question and hesitation i have come to the conclusion that selections from them should be published the fragments must be read with the fact constantly held in mind that they do not always represent lowells mature opinions that in some instances they give but the first form of thoughts developed in other connections in one or other of his later essays that they have not received his last revision that they have the form of discourse addressed to the ear rather than that of literary work finished for the eye  if so read i trust that the reader while he may find little in them to increase lowells wellestablished reputation may find much in them to confirm a high estimate of his position as one of the rare masters of english prose as well as one of the most capable of critics much to interest him alike in their intrinsic character and in their illustration of the life and thought of the writer and much to make him feel a keen regret that they are the final contributions of their author to the treasures of english literature  charles eliot norton                                       hippel the german satirist divides the life of man into five periods according to the ruling desires which successively displace each other in the human soul our first longing he says is for trousers the second for a watch the third for an angel in pink muslin the fourth for money and the fifth for a place in the country i think he has overlooked one which i should be inclined to place second in point of timethe ambition to escape the gregarious nursery and to be master of a chamber to ones self  how charming is the memory of that cloistered freedom of that independence wide as desire though perhaps only ten feet by twelve how much of future tastes and powers lay in embryo there in that small chamber it is the egg of the coming life there the young sailor pores over the narratives of remarkable shipwrecks his longing heightened as the storm roars on the roof or blows its trumpet in the chimney there the unfledged naturalist gathers his menagerie and empties his pockets of bugs and turtles that awaken the ignorant animosity of the housemaid there the commencing chemist rehearses the experiment of schwarz and singes off those eyebrows which shall some day feel the cool shadow of the discoverers laurel there the antiquary begins his collections with a bullet from bunker hill as genuine as the epistles of phalaris or a button from the coattail of columbus late the property of a neighboring scarecrow and sold to him by a schoolmate who thus lays the foundation of that colossal fortune which is to make his children the ornaments of society there the potential dibdin or dowse gathers his library on a single pendulous shelfmore fair to him than the hanging gardens of babylon there stand robinson crusoe and gulliver perhaps gil blas goldsmiths histories of greece and rome original poems for infant minds the parents assistant and for sundays the shepherd of salisbury plain with other narratives of the excellent mrs hannah more too much neglected in maturer life with these are admitted also viri romae nepos florus phaedrus and even the latin grammar because they count playing here upon these mimic boards the silent but awful part of second and third conspirators a rôle in after years assumed by statelier and more celebrated volumesthe books without which no gentlemans library can be complete  i remember for i must call my memory back from this garrulous rookery of the past to some perch nearer the matter in hand that when i was first installed lord of such a manor and found myself the crusoe of that remote atticisland which for near thirty years was to be my unmolested hermitage i cast about for works of art with which to adorn it the garret that el dorado of boys supplied me with some prints which had once been the chief ornament of my greatgrandfathers study but which the growth of taste or luxury had banished from story to story till they had arrived where malice could pursue them no farther these were heads of ancient worthies1plato pythagoras socrates seneca and cicero whom from a prejudice acquired at school i shortly banished again with a quousque tandem besides those i have mentioned there were democritus and heraclitus which last in those days less the slave of tradition i called heraclĭtusan error which my excellent schoolmaster i thank him for it would have expelled from my head by the judicious application of a counterirritant for he regarded the birth as a kind of usher to the laurel as indeed the true tree of knowledge whose advantages could adam have enjoyed during early life he had known better than to have yielded to the temptation of any other  footnote 1 some readers may recall the reference to these heads of ancient wise men in an interview with miles standishcen  well over my chimney hung those two antithetical philosophersthe one showing his teeth in an eternal laugh while the tears on the cheek of the other forever ran and yet like the leaves on keatss grecian urn could never be shed i used to wonder at them sometimes believing as i did firmly that to weep and laugh had been respectively the sole business of their lives i was puzzled to think which had the harder time of it and whether it were more painful to be under contract for the delivery of so many tears per diem or to compel that greek anêrithmon gelasma1 i confess i pitied them both for if it be difficult to produce on demand what laura matilda would call the tender dew of sympathy he is also deserving of compassion who is expected to be funny whether he will or no as i grew older and learned to look on the two heads as types they gave rise to many reflections raising a question perhaps impossible to solve whether the vices and follies of men were to be washed away or exploded by a broadside of honest laughter i believe it is southwell who says that mary magdalene went to heaven by water and it is certain that the tears that people shed for themselves are apt to be sincere but i doubt whether we are to be saved by any amount of vicarious salt water and though the philosophers should weep us into another noahs flood yet commonly men have lumber enough of selfconceit to build a raft of and can subsist a good while on that beautiful charity for their own weaknesses in which the nerves of conscience are embedded and cushioned as in similar physical straits they can upon their fat  footnote 1 countlessie perpetualsmile  on the other hand man has a wholesome dread of laughter as he is the only animal capable of that phenomenonfor the laugh of the hyena is pronounced by those who have heard it to be no joke and to be classed with those greek gelasmata agelasta which are said to come from the other side of the mouth whether as shaftesbury will have it ridicule be absolutely the test of truth or no we may admit it to be relatively so inasmuch as by the reductio ad absurdum it often shows that abstract truth may become falsehood if applied to the practical affairs of life because its relation to other truths equally important or to human nature has been overlooked for men approach truth from the circumference and acquiring a knowledge at most of one or two points of that circle of which god is the centre are apt to assume that the fixed point from which it is described is that where they stand moreover ridentem dicere verum quid vetat  i side rather with your merry fellow than with dr young when he says    laughter though never censured yet as sin                                       is half immoral be it much indulged   by venting spleen or dissipating thought   it shows a scorner or it makes a fool   and sins as hurting others or ourselves                                       yet wouldst thou laugh but at thine own expense   this counsel strange should i presume to give   retire and read thy bible to be gay  with shame i confess it dr youngs night thoughts have given me as many hearty laughs as any humorous book i ever read  men of one ideathat is who have one idea at a timemen who accomplish great results men of action reformers saints martyrs are inevitably destitute of humor and if the idea that inspires them be great and noble they are impervious to it but through the perversity of human affairs it not infrequently happens that men are possessed by a single idea and that a small and rickety onesome seven months child of thoughtthat maintains a querulous struggle for life sometimes to the disquieting of a whole neighborhood these last commonly need no satirist but to use a common phrase make themselves absurd as if nature intended them for parodies on some of her graver productions for example how could the attempt to make application of mystical prophecy to current events be rendered more ridiculous than when we read that two hundred years ago it was a leading point in the teaching of lodowick muggleton a noted heresiarch that one john robins was the last great antichrist and son of perdition spoken of by the apostle in thessalonians i remember also an eloquent and distinguished person who beginning with the axiom that all the disorders of this microcosm the body had their origin in diseases of the soul carried his doctrine to the extent of affirming that all derangements of the macrocosm likewise were due to the same cause hearing him discourse you would have been wellnigh persuaded that you had a kind of complicity in the spots upon the sun had he not one day condensed his doctrine into an epigram which made it instantly ludicrous i consider myself exclaimed he personally responsible for the obliquity of the earths axis a prominent comeouter once told me with a look of indescribable satisfaction that he had just been kicked out of a quaker meeting i have had he said calvinistic kicks and unitarian kicks congregational presbyterian and episcopalian kicks but i never succeeded in getting a quaker kick before could the fanaticism of the collectors of worthless rarities be more admirably caricatured than thus unconsciously by our passive enthusiast  i think no one can go through a museum of natural curiosities or see certain animals without a feeling that nature herself has a sense of the comic there are some donkeys that one can scarce look at without laughing perhaps on ciceros principle of the haruspex haruspicem and feeling inclined to say my good fellow if you will keep my secret i will keep yours in human nature the sense of the comic seems to be implanted to keep man sane and preserve a healthy balance between body and soul but for this the sorcerer imagination or the witch enthusiasm would lead us an endless dance  the advantage of the humorist is that he cannot be a man of one ideafor the essence of humor lies in the contrast of two he is the universal disenchanter he makes himself quite as much the subject of ironical study as his neighbor is he inclined to fancy himself a great poet or an original thinker he remembers the man who dared not sit down because a certain part of him was made of glass and muses smilingly there are many forms of hypochondria this duality in his mind which constitutes his intellectual advantage is the defect of his character he is futile in action because in every path he is confronted by the horns of an eternal dilemma and is apt to come to the conclusion that nothing is very much worth the while if he be independent of exertion his life commonly runs to waste if he turn author it is commonly from necessity fielding wrote for money and don quixote was the fruit of a debtors prison  it seems to be an instinct of human nature to analyze to define and to classify we like to have things conveniently labelled and laid away in the mind and feel as if we knew them better when we have named them and so to a certain extent we do the mere naming of things by their appearance is science the knowing them by their qualities is wisdom and the being able to express them by some intense phrase which combines appearance and quality as they affect the imagination through the senses by impression is poetry a great part of criticism is scientific but as the laws of art are only echoes of the laws of nature it is possible in this direction also to arrive at real knowledge or if not so far as that at some kind of classification that may help us toward that excellent propertycompactness of mind  addison has given the pedigree of humor the union of truth and goodness produces wit that of wit with wrath produces humor we should say that this was rather a pedigree of satire for what trace of wrath is there in the humor of chaucer shakespeare rabelais cervantes sterne fielding or thackeray the absence of wrath is the characteristic of all of them ben jonson says that    when some one peculiar quality   doth so possess a man that it doth draw   all his affects his spirits and his powers   in their constructions all to run one way   this may be truly said to be a humor  but this again is the definition of a humorous characterof a good subject for the humoristsuch as don quixote for example  humortaken in the sense of the faculty to perceive what is humorous and to give it expressionseems to be greatly a matter of temperament hence probably its name it is something quite indefinable diffused through the whole nature of the man so that it is related of the great comic actors that the audience begin to laugh as soon as they show their faces or before they have spoken a word  the sense of the humorous is certainly closely allied with the understanding and no race has shown so much of it on the whole as the english and next to them the spanishboth inclined to gravity let us not be ashamed to confess that if we find the tragedy a bore we take the profoundest satisfaction in the farce it is a mark of sanity humor in its highest level is the sense of comic contradiction which arises from the perpetual comment which the understanding makes upon the impressions received through the imagination richter himself a great humorist defines it thus      humor is the sublime reversed it brings down the great in order to     set the little beside it and elevates the little in order to set it     beside the greatthat it may annihilate both because in the     presence of the infinite all are alike nothing only the universal     only totality moves its deepest spring and from this universality     the leading component of humor arise the mildness and forbearance     of the humorist toward the individual who is lost in the mass of     little consequence this also distinguishes the humorist from the     scoffer  we find it very natural accordingly to speak of the breadth of humor while wit is by the necessity of its being as narrow as a flash of lightning and as sudden humor may pervade a whole page without our being able to put our finger on any passage and say it is here wit must sparkle and snap in every line or it is nothing when the wise deacon shook his head and said that there was a good deal of human natur in man he might have added that there was a good deal more in some men than in others those who have the largest share of it may be humorists but wit demands only a clear and nimble intellect presence of mind and a happy faculty of expression this perfection of phrase this neatness is an essential of wit because its effect must be instantaneous whereas humor is often diffuse and roundabout and its impression cumulative like the poison of arsenic as galiani said of nature that her dice were always loaded so the wit must throw sixes every time and what the same galiani gave as a definition of sublime oratory may be applied to its dexterity of phrase it is the art of saying everything without being clapt in the bastile in a country where it is forbidden to say anything wit must also have the quality of unexpectedness sometimes says barrow an affected simplicity sometimes a presumptuous bluntness gives it being sometimes it rises only from a lucky hitting upon what is strange sometimes from a crafty wresting of obvious matter to the purpose often it consisteth in one knows not what and springeth up one can hardly tell how its ways are unaccountable and inexplicable being answerable to the numberless rovings of fancy and windings of language  that wit does not consist in the discovery of a merely unexpected likeness or even contrast in word or thought is plain if we look at what is called a conceit which has all the qualities of witexcept wit for example warner a contemporary of shakespeare wrote a long poem called albions england which had an immense contemporary popularity and is not without a certain value still to the student of language in this i find a perfect specimen of what is called a conceit queen eleanor strikes fair rosamond and warner says    hard was the heart that gave the blow   soft were those lips that bled1  footnote 1 this and one or two of the following illustrations were used again by mr lowell in his shakespeare once more works riverside edition iii 53  this is bad as fancy for precisely the same reason that it would be good as a pun the comparison is unintentionally wanting in logic just as a pun is intentionally so to make the contrast what it should have beento make it coherent if i may use that term of a contrastit should read    hard was the hand that gave the blow   soft were those lips that bled  for otherwise there is no identity of meaning in the word hard as applied to the two nouns it qualifies and accordingly the proper logical copula is wanting of the same kind is the conceit which belongs i believe to our countryman general morris    her heart and morning broke together   in tears  which is so preposterous that had it been intended for fun we might almost have laughed at it here again the logic is unintentionally violated in the word broke and the sentence becomes absurd though not funny had it been applied to a merchant ruined by the failure of the united states bank we should at once see the ludicrousness of it though here again there would be no true wit    his heart and biddle broke together   on change  now let me give an instance of true fancy from butler the author of hudibras certainly the greatest wit who ever wrote english and whose wit is so profound so purely the wit of thought that we might almost rank him with the humorists but that his genius was cramped with a contemporary and therefore transitory subject butler says of loyalty that it is    true as the dial to the sun   although it be not shined upon  now what is the difference between this and the examples from warner and morris which i have just quoted simply that the comparison turning upon the word true the mind is satisfied because the analogy between the word as used morally and as used physically is so perfect as to leave no gap for the reasoning faculty to jolt over but it is precisely this jolt not so violent as to be displeasing violent enough to discompose our thoughts with an agreeable sense of surprise which it is the object of a pun to give us wit of this kind treats logic with every possible outward demonstration of respectkeeps the word of promise to the ear and breaks it to the sense dean swifts famous question to the man carrying the hare pray sir is that your own hare or a wig is perfect in its way here there is an absolute identity of sound with an equally absolute and therefore ludicrous disparity of meaning hood abounds in examples of this sort of funonly that his analogies are of a more subtle and perplexing kind in his elegy on the old sailor he says    his head was turned and so he chewed   his pigtail till he died  this is inimitable like all the best of hoods puns to the ear it is perfect but so soon as you attempt to realize it to yourself the mind is involved in an inextricable confusion of comical non sequiturs and yet observe the gravity with which the forms of reason are kept up in the and so like this is the peddlers recommendation of his eartrumpet    i dont pretend with horns of mine   like some in the advertising line   to magnify sounds on such marvellous scales   that the sounds of a cod seem as large as a whales    there was mrs f so very deaf   that she might have worn a percussion cap   and been knocked on the head without hearing it snap   well i sold her a horn and the very next day   she heard from her husband in botany bay  again his definition of deafness    deaf as the dogs ears in enfields speaker  so in his description of the hardships of the wild beasts in the menagerie    who could not even prey   in their own way  and the monkeyreformer who resolved to set them all free beginning with the lion but    pug had only half unbolted nero   when nero bolted him  in hood there is almost always a combination of wit and fun the wit always suggesting the remote association of ideas and the fun jostling together the most obvious concords of sound and discords of sense hoods use of words reminds one of the kaleidoscope throw them down in a heap and they are the most confused jumble of unrelated bits but once in the magical tube of his fancy and with a shake and a turn they assume figures that have the absolute perfection of geometry in the droll complaint of the lover    perhaps it was right to dissemble your love   but why did you kick me downstairs  the selfsparing charity of phrase that could stretch the meaning of the word dissemble so as to make it cover so violent a process as kicking downstairs has the true zest the tang of contradiction and surprise hood not content with such a play upon ideas would bewitch the whole sentence with plays upon words also his fancy has the enchantment of huons horn and sets the gravest conceptions acapering in a way that makes us laugh in spite of ourselves  andrew marvells satire upon the dutch is a capital instance of wit as distinguished from fun it rather exercises than tickles the mind so full is it of quaint fancy    holland that scarce deserves the name of land   as but the offscouring of the british sand   and so much earth as was contributed   by english pilots when they heaved the lead   or what by oceans slow alluvium fell   of shipwrecked cockle and the muscleshell   this indigestful vomit of the sea   fell to the dutch by just propriety    glad then as miners who have found the ore   they with mad labor fished their land to shore   and dived as desperately for each piece   of earth as if t had been of ambergreese   collecting anxiously small loads of clay   less than what building swallows bear away   or than those pills which sordid beetles roll   transfusing into them their sordid soul    how did they rivet with gigantic piles   thorough the centre their newcatchèd miles   and to the stake a struggling country bound   where barking waves still bait the forcèd ground    yet still his claim the injured ocean laid   and oft at

t were a king of spades  i have cited this long passage not only because marvell both in his serious and comic verse is a great favorite of mine but because it is as good an illustration as i know how to find of that fancy flying off into extravagance and that nice compactness of expression that constitute genuine wit on the other hand smollett is only funny hardly witty where he condenses all his wrath against the dutch into an epigram of two lines    amphibious creatures sudden be your fall   may man undam you and god damn you all  of satirists i have hitherto said nothing because some perhaps the most eminent of them do not come under the head either of wit or humor with them as juvenal said of himself facit indignatio versus and wrath is the element as a general rule neither of wit nor humor swift in the epitaph he wrote for himself speaks of the grave as a place ubi saeva indignatio cor ulterius lacerare nequeat and this hints at the sadness which makes the ground of all humor there is certainly humor in gulliver especially in the chapters about the yahoos where the horses are represented as the superior beings and disgusted at the filthiness of the creatures in human shape but commonly swift too must be ranked with the wits if we measure him rather by what he wrote than by what he was take this for an example from the day of judgment    with a whirl of thought oppressed   i sank from reverie to rest   a horrid vision seized my head   i saw the graves give up their dead   jove armed with terrors burst the skies   and thunder roars and lightning flies   amazed confused its fate unknown   the world stands trembling at his throne   while each pale sinner hung his head   jove nodding shook the heavens and said   offending race of human kind   by nature

unexpectedness of the conclusion here after the somewhat solemn preface is entirely of the essence of wit so too is the sudden flirt of the scorpions tail to sting you it is almost the opposite of humor in one respectnamely that it would make us think the solemnest things in life were sham whereas it is the shamsolemn ones which humor delights in exposing this further difference is also true that wit makes you laugh once and loses some of its comicality though none of its point with every new reading while humor grows droller and droller the oftener we read it if we cannot safely deny that swift was a humorist we may at least say that he was one in whom humor had gone through the stage of acetous fermentation and become rancid we should never forget that he died mad satirists of this kind while they have this quality of true humor that they contrast a higher with a lower differ from their nobler brethren inasmuch as their comparison is always to the disadvantage of the higher they purposely disenchant uswhile the others rather show us how sad a thing it is to be disenchanted at all  ben jonson who had in respect of sturdy good sense very much the same sort of mind as his namesake samuel and whose discoveries as he calls them are well worth reading for the sound criticism they contain says      the parts of a comedy are the same with those of a tragedy and     the end is partly the same for they both delight and teach the     comics are called didaskaloi1 of the greeks no less than the     tragics nor is the moving of laughter always the end of comedy     that is rather a fowling for the peoples delight or their fooling     for as aristotle says rightly the moving of laughter is a fault in     comedy a kind of turpitude that depraves some part of a mans     nature without a disease as a wry face moves laughter or a     deformed vizard or a rude clown dressed in a ladys habit and using     her actions we dislike and scorn such representations which made     the ancient philosophers ever think laughter unfitting in a wise     man so that what either in the words or sense of an author or in     the language and actions of men is awry or depraved does strongly     stir mean affections and provoke for the most part to laughter and     therefore it was clear that all insolent and obscene speeches jests     upon the best men injuries to particular persons perverse and     sinister sayings and the rather unexpected in the old comedy did     move laughter especially where it did imitate any dishonesty and     scurrility came forth in the place of wit which who understands     the nature and genius of laughter cannot but perfectly know  footnote 1 teachers  he then goes on to say of aristophanes that      he expressed all the moods and figures of what was ridiculous     oddly in short as vinegar is not accounted good till the wine be     corrupted so jests that are true and natural seldom raise laughter     with that beast the multitude they love nothing that is right and     proper the farther it runs from reason or possibility with them     the better it is  in the latter part of this it is evident that ben is speaking with a little bitterness his own comedies are too rigidly constructed according to aristotles dictum that the moving of laughter was a fault in comedy i like the passage as an illustration of a fact undeniably true that shakespeares humor was altogether a new thing upon the stage and also as showing that satirists for such were also the writers of comedy were looked upon rather as censors and moralists than as movers of laughter dante accordingly himself in this sense the greatest of satirists in putting horace among the five great poets in limbo qualifies him with the title of satiro  but if we exclude the satirists what are we to do with aristophanes was he not a satirist and in some sort also a censor yes but as it appears to me of a different kind as well as in a different degree from any other ancient i think it is plain that he wrote his comedies not only to produce certain political moral and even literary ends but for the fun of the thing i am so poor a grecian that i have no doubt i miss three quarters of what is most characteristic of him but even through the fog of the latin on the opposite page i can make out more or less of the true lineaments of the man i can see that he was a master of language for it becomes alive under his handsputs forth buds and blossoms like the staff of joseph as it does always when it feels the hand and recognizes the touch of its legitimate sovereigns those prodigious combinations of his are like some of the strange polyps we hear of that seem a single organism but cut them into as many parts as you please each has a life of its own and stirs with independent being there is nothing that words will not do for him no service seems too mean or too high and then his abundance he puts one in mind of the definition of a competence by the only man i ever saw who had the true flavor of falstaff in hima million a minute and your expenses paid as burns said of himself the rhymes come skelpin rank and file now they are as graceful and sinuous as waternymphs and now they come tumbling head over heels throwing somersaults like clowns in the circus with a here we are i can think of nothing like it but rabelais who had the same extraordinary gift of getting all the go out of words they do not merely play with words they romp with them tickle them tease them and somehow the words seem to like it  i dare say there may be as much fancy and fun in the clouds or the birds but neither of them seems so rich to me as the frogs nor does the fun anywhere else climb so high or dwell so long in the region of humor as here lucian makes greek mythology comic to be sure but he has nothing like the scene in the frogs where bacchus is terrified with the strange outcries of a procession celebrating his own mysteries and of whose dithyrambic songs it is plain he can make neither head nor tail here is humor of the truest metal and so far as we can guess the first example of it here is the true humorous contrast between the ideal god and the god with human weaknesses and follies as he had been degraded in the popular conception and is it too absurd to be within the limits even of comic probability is it even so absurd as those handmills for grinding out so many prayers a minute which huc and gabet saw in tartary  cervantes was born on october 9 1547 and died on april 23 1616 on the same day as shakespeare he is i think beyond all question the greatest of humorists whether he intended it or notand i am inclined to believe he didhe has typified in don quixote and sancho panza his esquire the two component parts of the human mind and shapers of human characterthe imagination and understanding there is a great deal more than this for what is positive and intentional in a truly great book is often little in comparison with what is accidental and suggested the plot is of the meagrest a country gentleman of la mancha living very much by himself and continually feeding his fancy with the romances of chivalry becomes at last the victim of a monomania on this one subject and resolves to revive the order of chivalry in his own proper person he persuades a somewhat prosaic neighbor of his to accompany him as squire they sally forth and meet with various adventures from which they reap no benefit but the sad experience of plentiful ribroasting now if this were all of don quixote it would be simply broad farce as it becomes in butlers parody of it in sir hudibras and ralpho so far as mere external characteristics are concerned the latter knight and his squire are the most glaring absurdities without any sufficient reason for their being at all or for their adventures except that they furnished butler with mouthpieces for his own wit and wisdom they represent nothing and are intended to represent nothing  i confess that in my judgment don quixote is the most perfect character ever drawn as sir john falstaff is in a certain sense always a gentlemanthat is as he is guilty of no crime that is technically held to operate in defeasance of his title to that name as a man of the worldso is don quixote in everything that does not concern his monomania a perfect gentleman and a good christian besides he is not the merely technical gentleman of three descentsbut the true gentleman such a gentleman as only purity disinterestedness generosity and fear of god can make and with what consummate skill are the boundaries of his mania drawn he only believes in enchantment just so far as is necessary to account to sancho and himself for the ill event of all his exploits he always reasons rightly as madmen do from his own premises and this is the reason i object to cervantess treatment of him in the second partwhich followed the other after an interval of nearly eight years for except in so far as they delude themselves monomaniacs are as sane as other people and besides shocking our feelings the tricks played on the don at the dukes castle are so transparent that he could never have been taken in by them  don quixote is the everlasting type of the disappointment which sooner or later always overtakes the man who attempts to accomplish ideal good by material means sancho on the other hand with his proverbs is the type of the man with common sense he always sees things in the daylight of reason he is never taken in by his masters theory of enchantersalthough superstitious enough to believe such things possiblebut he does believe despite all reverses in his promises of material prosperity and advancement the island that has been promised him always floats before him like the airdrawn dagger before macbeth and beckons him on the whole character is exquisite and fitly enough when he at last becomes governor of his imaginary island of barataria he makes an excellent magistratebecause statesmanship depends for its success so much less on abstract principle than on precisely that traditional wisdom in which sancho was rich     the five indispensable authors  homer dante cervantes goethe shakespeare   the study of literature that it may be fruitful that it may not result in a mere gathering of names and dates and phrases must be a study of ideas and not of words of periods rather than of men or only of such men as are great enough or individual enough to reflect as much light upon their age as they in turn receive from it to know literature as the elder disraeli knew it is at best only an amusement an accomplishment great indeed for the dilettante but valueless for the scholar detached facts are nothing in themselves and become of worth only in their relation to one another it is little for example to know the date of shakespeare something more that he and cervantes were contemporaries and a great deal that he grew up in a time fermenting with reformation in church and state when the intellectual impulse from the invention of printing had scarcely reached its climax and while the new world stung the imaginations of men with its immeasurable promise and its temptations to daring adventure facts in themselves are clumsy and cumbrousthe cowrycurrency of isolated and uninventive men generalizations conveying great sums of knowledge in a little space mark the epoch of free interchange of ideas of higher culture and of something better than provincial scholarship  but generalizations again though in themselves the work of a happier moment of some genetic flash in the brain of man gone before one can say it lightens are the result of ideas slowly gathered and long steeped and clarified in the mind each in itself a composite of the carefully observed relations of separate and seemingly disparate facts what is the pedigree of almost all great fortunes through vast combinations of trade forlorn hopes of speculation you trace them up to a clear head and a selfearned sixpence it is the same with all large mental accumulations they begin with a steady brain and the first solid result of thought however smallthe nucleus of speculation the true aim of the scholar is not to crowd his memory but to classify and sort it till what was a heap of chaotic curiosities becomes a museum of science  it may well be questioned whether the invention of printing while it democratized information has not also levelled the ancient aristocracy of thought by putting a library within the power of every one it has taught men to depend on their shelves rather than on their brains it has supplanted a strenuous habit of thinking with a loose indolence of reading which relaxes the muscular fiber of the mind when men had few books they mastered those few but now the multitude of books lord it over the man the costliness of books was a great refiner of literature men disposed of single volumes by will with as many provisions and precautions as if they had been great landed estates a mitre would hardly have overjoyed petrarch as much as did the finding of a copy of virgil the problem for the scholar was formerly how to acquire books for us it is how to get rid of them instead of gathering we must sift when confucius made his collection of chinese poems he saved but three hundred and ten out of more than three thousand and it has consequently survived until our day  in certain respects the years do our weeding for us in our youth we admire the verses which answer our mood as we grow older we like those better which speak to our experience at last we come to look only upon that as poetry which appeals to that original nature in us which is deeper than all moods and wiser than all experience before a man is forty he has broken many idols and the milestones of his intellectual progress are the gravestones of dead and buried enthusiasms of his dethroned gods  there are certain books which it is necessary to read but they are very few looking at the matter from an aesthetic point of view merely i should say that thus far one man had been able to use types so universal and to draw figures so cosmopolitan that they are equally true in all languages and equally acceptable to the whole indoeuropean branch at least of the human family that man is homer and there needs it seems to me no further proof of his individual existence than this very fact of the solitary unapproachableness of the iliad and the odyssey the more wonderful they are the more likely to be the work of one person nowhere is the purely natural man presented to us so nobly and sincerely as in these poems not far below these i should place the divina commedia of dante in which the history of the spiritual man is sketched with equal command of material and grandeur of outline don quixote stands upon the same level and receives the same universal appreciation here we have the spiritual and the natural man set before us in humorous contrast in the knight and his squire cervantes has typified the two opposing poles of our dual naturethe imagination and the understanding as they appear in contradiction this is the only comprehensive satire ever written for it is utterly independent of time place and manners faust gives us the natural history of the human intellect mephistopheles being merely the projected impersonation of that scepticism which is the invariable result of a purely intellectual culture these four books are the only ones in which universal facts of human nature and experience are ideally represented they can therefore never be displaced whatever moral significance there may be in certain episodes of the odyssey the man of the homeric poems is essentially the man of the senses and the understanding to whom the other world is alien and therefore repulsive there is nothing that demonstrates this more clearly as there is nothing in my judgment more touching and picturesque in all poetry than that passage in the eleventh book of the odyssey where the shade of achilles tells ulysses that he would rather be the poorest shepherdboy on a grecian hill than king over the unsubstantial shades of hades dantes poem on the other hand sets forth the passage of man from the world of sense to that of spirit in other words his moral conversion it is dante relating his experience in the great campmeeting of mankind but relating it by virtue of his genius so representatively that it is no longer the story of one man but of all men then comes cervantes showing the perpetual and comic contradiction between the spiritual and the natural man in actual life marking the transition from the age of the imagination to that of the intellect and lastly goethe the poet of a period in which a purely intellectual culture reached its maximum of development depicts its onesidedness and its consequent failure these books then are not national but human and record certain phases of mans nature certain stages of his moral progress they are gospels in the lay bible of the race it will remain for the future poet to write the epic of the complete man as it remains for the future world to afford the example of his entire and harmonious development  i have not mentioned shakespeare because his works come under a different category though they mark the very highest level of human genius they yet represent no special epoch in the history of the individual mind the man of shakespeare is always the man of actual life as he is acted upon by the worlds of sense and of spirit under certain definite conditions we all of us may be in the position of macbeth or othello or hamlet and we appreciate their sayings and deeds potentially so to speak rather than actually through the sympathy of our common nature and not of our experience but with the four books i have mentioned our relation is a very different one we all of us grow up through the homeric period of the senses we all feel at some time sooner or later the need of something higher and like dante shape our theory of the divine government of the universe we all with cervantes discover the rude contrast between the ideal and real and with goethe the unattainableness of the highest good through the intellect alone therefore i set these books by themselves i do not mean that we read them or for their full enjoyment need to read them in this light but i believe that this fact of their universal and perennial application to our consciousness and our experience accounts for their permanence and insures their immortality     the imagination1   footnote 1 a small portion of this lecture appeared at the time of its delivery in january 1855 in a report printed in the boston daily advertiser  imagination is the wings of the mind the understanding its feet with these it may climb high but can never soar into that ampler ether and diviner air whence the eye dominates so uncontrolled a prospect on every hand through imagination alone is something like a creative power possible to man it is the same in aeschylus as in shakespeare though the form of its manifestation varies in some outward respects from age to age being the faculty of vision it is the essential part of expression also which is the office of all art  but in comparing ancient with modern imaginative literature certain changes especially strike us and chief among them a stronger infusion of sentiment and what we call the picturesque i shall endeavor to illustrate this by a few examples but first let us discuss imagination itself and give some instances of its working  art says lord verulam is man added to nature homo additus naturae and we may modernize his statement and adapt it to the demands of aesthetics if we define art to be nature infused with and shaped by the imaginative faculty of man thus as bacon says elsewhere conforming the shows of things to the desires of the mind art always platonizes it results from a certain finer instinct for form order proportion a certain keener sense of the rhythm there is in the eternal flow of the world about us and its products take shape around some idea preëxistent in the mind are quickened into life by it and strive always cramped and hampered as they are by the limitations and conditions of human nature of individual temperament and outward circumstances toward ideal perfectiontoward what michelangelo called    ideal form the universal mould  shakespeare whose careless generalizations have often the exactness of scientific definitions tells us that    the lunatic the lover and the poet   are of imagination all compact  that                as imagination bodies forth   the forms of things unknown the poets pen   turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing   a local habitation and a name  and a little before he had told us that    lovers and madmen have such seething brains   such shaping fantasies that apprehend   more than cool reason ever comprehends  plato had said before him in his ion that the poet is possessed by a spirit not his own and that he cannot poetize while he has a particle of understanding left again he says that the bacchantes possessed by the god drink milk and honey from the rivers and cannot believe till they recover their senses that they have been drinking mere water empedocles said that the mind could only conceive of fire by being fire  all these definitions imply in the imaginative faculty the capabilities of ecstasy and possession that is of projecting itself into the very consciousness of its object and again of being so wholly possessed by the emotion of its object that in expression it takes unconsciously the tone the color and the temperature thereof shakespeare is the highest example of thisfor example the parting of romeo and juliet there the poet is so possessed by the situation has so mingled his own consciousness with that of the lovers that all nature is infected too and is full of partings    look love what envious streaks   do lace the severing clouds in yonder east  in shelleys cenci on the other hand we have an instance of the poets imagination giving away its own consciousness to the object contemplated in this case an inanimate one    two miles on this side of the fort the road   crosses a deep ravine t is rough and narrow   and winds with short turns down the precipice   and in its depth there is a mighty rock   which has from unimaginable years   sustained itself with terror and with toil   over a gulf and with the agony   with which it clings seems slowly coming down   even as a wretched soul hour after hour   clings to the mass of life yet clinging leans   and leaning makes more dark the dread abyss   in which it fears to fall beneath this crag   huge as despair as if in weariness   the melancholy mountain yawns  the hint of this shelley took from a passage in the second act of calderons purgatorio de san patricio    no ves ese peñasco que parece   que se esta sustentando con trabajo   y con el ansia misma que padece   ha tantos siglos que se viene abajo  which retaining the measure of the original may be thus paraphrased    do you not see that rock there which appeareth   to hold itself up with a throe appalling   and through the very pang of what it feareth   so many ages hath been falling falling  you will observe that in the last instance quoted the poet substitutes his own impression of the thing for the thing itself he forces his own consciousness upon it and herein is the very root of all sentimentalism herein lies the fault of that subjective tendency whose excess is so lamented by goethe and schiller and which is one of the main distinctions between ancient and modern poetry i say in its excess for there are moods of mind of which it is the natural and healthy expression thus shakespeare in his ninetyseventh sonnet    how like a winter hath my absence been   from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year   what freezings have i felt what dark days seen   what old decembers bareness everywhere   and yet this time removd was summers time  it is only when it becomes a habit instead of a mood of the mind that it is a token of disease then it is properly dyspepsia livercomplaintwhat you will but certainly not imagination as the handmaid of art in that service she has two duties laid upon her one as the plastic or shaping faculty which gives form and proportion and reduces the several parts of any work to an organic unity foreordained in that idea which is its germ of life and the other as the realizing energy of thought which conceives clearly all the parts not only in relation to the whole but each in its several integrity and coherence  we call the imagination the creative faculty assuming it to be so in the one case it acts by deliberate forethought in the other by intense sympathya sympathy which enables it to realize an iago as happily as a cordelia a caliban as a prospero there is a passage in chaucers house of fame which very prettily illustrates this latter function    whan any speche yeomen ys   up to the paleys anon ryght   hyt wexeth lyke the same wight   which that the worde in erthe spak   be hyt clothed rede or blak   and so were hys lykenesse   and spake the word that thou wilt gesse   that it the same body be   man or woman he or she  we have the highest and indeed an almost unique example of this kind of sympathetic imagination in shakespeare who becomes so sensitive sometimes to the thought the feeling nay the mere whim or habit of body of his characters that we feel to use his own words as if the dull substance of his flesh were thought it is not in mere intensity of phrase but in the fitness of it to the feeling the character or the situation that this phase of the imaginative faculty gives witness of itself in expression i know nothing more profoundly imaginative therefore in its bald simplicity than a line in websters duchess of malfy ferdinand has procured the murder of his sister the duchess when her dead body is shown to him he stammers out    cover her face mine eyes dazzle she died young  the difference between subjective and objective in poetry would seem to be that the aim of the former is to express a mood of the mind often something in itself accidental and transitory while that of the latter is to convey the impression made upon the mind by something outside of it but taken up into the mind and idealized that is stripped of all unessential particulars by it the one would fain set forth your view of the thing modified perhaps by your breakfast the other would set forth the very thing itself in its most concise individuality subjective poetry may be profound and imaginative if it deal with the primary emotions of our nature with the souls inquiries into its own being and doing as was true of wordsworth but in the very proportion that it is profound its range is limited great poetry should have breadth as well as height and depth it should meet men everywhere on the open levels of their common humanity and not merely on their occasional excursions to the heights of speculation or their exploring expeditions among the crypts of metaphysics  but however we divide poetry the office of imagination is to disengage what is essential from the crowd of accessories which is apt to confuse the vision of ordinary minds for our perceptions of things are gregarious and are wont to huddle together and jostle one another it is only those who have been long trained to shepherd their thoughts that can at once single out each member of the flock by something peculiar to itself that the power of abstraction has something to do with the imagination is clear i think from the fact that everybody is a dramatic poet so far as the conception of character goes in his sleep his acquaintances walk and talk before him on the stage of dream precisely as in life when he wakes his genius has flown away with his sleep it was indeed nothing more than that his mind was not distracted by the multiplicity of details which the senses force upon it by day he thinks of smith and it is no longer a mere name on a doorplate or in a directory but smith himself is there with those marvellous commonplaces of his which could you only hit them off when you were awake you would have created justice shallow nay is not there too that offensively supercilious creak of the boots with which he enforced his remarks on the war in europe when he last caught you at the corner of the street and decanted into your ears the stale settlings of a week of newspapers now did not shakespeare tell us that the imagination bodies forth it is indeed the verbum caro factumthe word made flesh and blood  i said that the imagination always idealizes that in its highest exercise for example as in the representation of character it goes behind the species to the genus presenting us with everlasting types of human nature as in don quixote and hamlet antigone and cordelia alcestis and amelia by this i mean that those features are most constantly insisted upon not in which they differ from other men but from other kinds of men for example don quixote is never set before us as a mere madman but as the victim of a monomania and that when you analyze it of a very noble kindnothing less indeed than devotion to an unattainable ideal to an anachronism as the ideals of imaginative men for the most part are amid all his ludicrous defeats and disillusions this poetical side of him is brought to our notice at intervals just as a certain theme recurs again and again in one of beethovens symphonies a kind of clue to guide us through those intricacies of harmony so in lear one of shakespeares profoundest psychological studies the weakness of the man is emphasized as it were and forced upon our attention by his outbreaks of impotent violence so in macbeth that imaginative bias which lays him open to the temptation of the weird sisters is suggested from time to time through the whole tragedy and at last unmans him and brings about his catastrophe in his combat with macduff this is what i call ideal and imaginative representation which marks the outlines and boundaries of character not by arbitrary lines drawn at this angle or that according to the whim of the tracer but by those mountainranges of human nature which divide man from man and temperament from temperament and as the imagination of the reader must reinforce that of the poet reducing the generic again to the specific and defining it into sharper individuality by a comparison with the experiences of actual life so on the other hand the popular imagination is always poetic investing each new figure that comes before it with all the qualities that belong to the genus thus hamlet in some one or other of his characteristics has been the familiar of us all and so from an ideal and remote figure is reduced to the standard of real and contemporary existence while bismarck who if we knew him would probably turn out to be a comparatively simple character is invested with all the qualities which have ever been attributed to the typical statesman and is clearly as imaginative a personage as the marquis of posa in schillers don carlos we are ready to accept any coup de théâtre of him now this prepossession is precisely that for which the imagination of the poet makes us ready by working on our own  but there are also lower levels on which this idealization plays its tricks upon our fancy the greek who had studied profoundly what may be called the machinery of art made use even of mechanical contrivances to delude the imagination of the spectator and to entice him away from the associations of everyday life the cothurnus lifted the actor to heroic stature the mask prevented the ludicrous recognition of a familiar face in oedipus and agamemnon it precluded grimace and left the countenance as passionless as that of a god it gave a more awful reverberation to the voice and it was by the voice that most penetrating and sympathetic one might almost say incorporeal organ of expression that the great effects of the poet and tragic actor were wrought everything you will observe was if not lifted above at any rate removed however much or little from the plane of the actual and trivial their stage showed nothing that could be met in the streets we barbarians on the other hand take delight precisely in that we admire the novels of trollope and the groups of rogers because as we say they are so real while it is only because they are so matteroffact so exactly on the level with our own trivial and prosaic apprehensions when dante lingers to hear the dispute between sinon and master adam virgil type of the higher reason and the ideal poet rebukes him and even angrily    e fa ragion chio ti sia sempre allato   si più avvien che fortuna t accoglia   ove sien genti in simigliante piato   chè voler ciò udire è bassa voglia    remember i am always at thy side   if ever fortune bring thee once again   where there are people in dispute like this   for wishing to hear that is vulgar wish  verse is another of these expedients for producing that frame of mind that prepossession on the part of hearer or reader which is essential to the purpose of the poet who has lost much of his advantage by the invention of printing which obliges him to appeal to the eye rather than the ear the rhythm is no arbitrary and artificial contrivance it was suggested by an instinct natural to man it is taught him by the beating of his heart by his breathing hastened or retarded by the emotion of the moment nay it may be detected by what seems the most monotonous of motions the flow of water in which if you listen intently you will discover a beat as regular as that of the metronome with the natural presumption of all selftaught men i thought i had made a discovery in this secret confided to me by beaver brook till professor peirce told me it was always allowed for in the building of dams nay for my own part i would venture to affirm that not only metre but even rhyme itself was not without suggestion in outward nature look at the pine how its branches balancing each other ray out from the tapering stem in stanza after stanza how spray answers to spray in order strophe and antistrophe till the perfect tree stands an embodied ode natures triumphant vindication of proportion number and harmony who can doubt the innate charm of rhyme who has seen the blue river repeat the blue oerhead who has been ravished by the visible consonance of the tree growing at once toward an upward and downward heaven on the edge of the twilight cove or who has watched how as the kingfisher flitted from shore to shore his visible echo flies under him and completes the fleeting couplet in the visionary vault below at least there can be no doubt that metre by its systematic and regular occurrence gradually subjugates and tunes the senses of the hearer as the wood of the violin arranges itself in sympathy with the vibration of the strings and thus that predisposition to the proper emotion is accomplished which is essential to the purpose of the pest you must not only expect but you must expect in the right way you must be magnetized beforehand in every fibre by your own sensibility in order that you may feel what and how you ought the right reception of whatever is ideally represented demands as a preliminary condition an exalted or if not that then an excited frame of mind both in poet and hearer the imagination must be sensitized ere it will take the impression of those airy nothings whose image is traced and fixed by appliances as delicate as the golden pencils of the sun then that becomes a visible reality which before was but a phantom of the brain your own passion must penetrate and mingle with that of the artist that you may interpret him aright you must i say be prepossessed for it is the mind which shapes and colors the reports of the senses suppose you were expecting the bell to toll for the burial of some beloved person and the churchclock should begin to strike the first lingering blow of the hammer would beat upon your very heart and thence the shock would run to all the senses at once but after a few strokes you would be undeceived and the sound would become commonplace again on the other hand suppose that at a certain hour you knew that a criminal was to be executed then the ordinary striking of the clock would have the sullen clang of a funeral bell so in shakespeares instance of the lover does he not suddenly find himself sensible of a beauty in the world about him before undreamed of because his passion has somehow got into whatever he sees and hears will not the rustle of silk across a counter stop his pulse because it brings back to his sense the odorous whisper of parthenissas robe is not the beat of the horses hoofs as rapid to angelica pursued as the throbs of her own heart huddling upon one another in terror while it is slow to sister anne as the pulse that pauses between hope and fear as she listens on the tower for rescue and would have the rider spur though mounted on the wind  dr johnson tells us that that only is good poetry which may be translated into sensible prose i greatly doubt whether any very profound emotion can be so rendered man is a metrical animal and it is not in prose but in nonsense verses that the young mother croons her joy over the new centre of hope and terror that is sucking life from her breast translate passion into sensible prose and it becomes absurd because subdued to workaday associations to that level of common sense and convention where to betray intense feeling is ridiculous and unmannerly shall i ask shakespeare to translate me his love still climbing trees in the hesperides shall i ask marlowe how helen could make him immortal with a kiss or how in the name of all the monsieur jourdains at once her face could launch a thousand ships and burn the topless towers of ilion could aeschylus if put upon the stand defend his making prometheus cry out    o divine ether and swiftwinged winds   ye springs of rivers and of ocean waves   the innumerable smile all mother earth   and helios allbeholding round i call   behold what i a god from gods endure  or could lear justify his    i tax not you you elements with unkindness   i never gave you kingdoms calld you children  no precisely what makes the charm of poetry is what we cannot explain any more than we can describe a perfume there is a little quatrain of gongoras quoted by calderon in his alcalde of zalamea which has an inexplicable charm for me    las flores del romero     niña isabel   hoy son flores azules     y mañana serán miel  if i translate it t is nonsense yet i understand it perfectly and it will i dare say outlive much wiser things in my memory it is the very function of poetry to free us from that witchs circle of common sense which holds us fast in its narrow enchantment in this disenthralment language and verse have their share and we may say that language also is capable of a certain idealization here is a passage from the xxxth song of draytons polyolbion    which copland scarce had spoke but quickly every hill   upon her verge that stands the neighbouring valleys fill   helvillon from his height it through the mountains threw   from whom as soon again the sound dunbalrase drew   from whose stonetrophied head it on to wendrosse went   which towrds the sea again resounded it to dent   that broadwater therewith within her banks astound   in sailing to the sea told it in egremound  this gave a hint to wordsworth who in one of his poems on the naming of places thus prolongs the echo of it    joanna looking in my eyes beheld   that ravishment of mine and laughed aloud   the rock like something starting from a sleep   took up the ladys voice and laughed again   the ancient woman seated on helmcrag   was ready with her cavern hammarscar   and the tall steep of silverhow sent forth   a noise of laughter southern loughrigg heard   and fairfield answered with a mountain tone   helvellyn far into the clear blue sky   carried the ladys voiceold skiddaw blew   his speakingtrumpetback out of the clouds   of glaramara southward came the voice   and kirkstone tossed it from his misty head  now this passage of wordsworth i should call the idealization of that of drayton who becomes poetical only in the stonetrophied head of dunbalrase and yet the thought of both poets is the same  even what is essentially vulgar may be idealized by seizing and dwelling on the generic characteristics in antony and cleopatra shakespeare makes lepidus tipsy and nothing can be droller than the drunken gravity with which he persists in proving himself capable of bearing his part in the conversation we seem to feel the whirl in his head when we find his mind revolving round a certain fixed point to which he clings as to a post antony is telling stories of egypt to octavius and lepidus drawn into an eddy of the talk interrupts him    lepidus you gave strange serpents there    antony trying to shake him off ay lepidus    lepidus your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud   by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile    antony thinking to get rid of him they are so  presently lepidus has revolved again and continues as if he had been contradicted    nay certainly i have heard the ptolemies pyramises   are very goodly things without contradiction i have heard   that  and then after another pause still intent on proving himself sober he asks coming round to the crocodile again    what manner o thing is your crocodile  antony answers gravely    it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath   breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with its own   organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements   once out of it it transmigrates    lepidus what color is it of    antony of its own color too    lepidus meditatively t is a strange serpent  the ideal in expression then deals also with the generic and evades embarrassing particulars in a generalization we say tragedy with the dagger and bowl and it means something very different to the aesthetic sense from tragedy with the caseknife and the phial of laudanum though these would be as effectual for murder it was a misconception of this that led poetry into that slough of poetic diction where everything was supposed to be made poetical by being called something else and something longer a boot became the shining leather that the leg encased coffee the fragrant juice of mochas berry brown whereas the imaginative way is the most condensed and shortest conveying to the mind a feeling of the thing and not a paraphrase of it akin to this was a confounding of the pictorial with the imaginative and personification with that typical expression which is the true function of poetry compare for example collinss revenge with chaucers          revenge impatient rose   he threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down         and with a withering look       the wardenouncing trumpet took       and blew a blast so loud and dread     were neer prophetic sound so full of woe         and ever and anon he beat         the doubling drum with furious heat  words words horatio now let us hear chaucer with his single stealthy line that makes us glance over our shoulder as if we heard the murderous tread behind us    the smiler with the knife hid under the cloak  which is the more terrible which has more danger in itcollinss noise or chaucers silence here is not the mere difference you will perceive between ornament and simplicity but between a diffuseness which distracts and a condensation which concentres the attention chaucer has chosen out of all the rest the treachery and the secrecy as the two points most apt to impress the imagination  the imagination as concerns expression condenses the fancy on the other hand adorns illustrates and commonly amplifies the one is suggestive the other picturesque in chapmans hero and leander i read    her freshheat blood cast figures in her eyes   and she supposed she saw in neptunes skies   how her star wanderd washd in smarting brine   for her loves sake that with immortal wine   should be embathed and swim in more heartsease   than there was water in the sestian seas  in the epithet star heros thought implies the beauty and brightness of her lover and his being the lord of her destiny while in neptunes skies we have not only the simple fact that the waters are the atmosphere of the seagods realm but are reminded of that reflected heaven which hero must have so often watched as it deepened below her tower in the smooth hellespont i call this as high an example of fancy as could well be found it is picture and sentiment combinedthe very essence of the picturesque  but when keats calls mercury the star of lethe the word star makes us see him as the poor ghosts do who are awaiting his convoy while the word lethe intensifies our sympathy by making us feel his coming as they do who are longing to drink of forgetfulness and this again reacts upon the word star which as it before expressed only the shining of the god acquires a metaphysical significance from our habitual association of star with the notions of hope and promise again nothing can be more fanciful than this bit of henry more the platonist                          what doth move   the nightingale to sing so fresh and clear   the thrush or lark that mounting high above   chants her shrill notes to heedless ears of corn   heavily hanging in the dewy morn  but compare this with keats again    the voice i hear this passing night was heard   in ancient days by emperor and clown   perhaps the selfsame song that found a path   through the sad heart of ruth when sick for home   she stood in tears amid the alien corn  the imagination has touched that word alien and we see the field through ruths eyes as she looked round on the hostile spikes not merely through those of the poet     critical fragments  i life in literature and language   it is the office and function of the imagination to renew life in lights and sounds and emotions that are outworn and familiar it calls the soul back once more under the dead ribs of nature and makes the meanest bush burn again as it did to moses with the visible presence of god and it works the same miracle for language the word it has touched retains the warmth of life forever we talk about the age of superstition and fable as if they were passed away as if no ghost could walk in the pure white light of science yet the microscope that can distinguish between the disks that float in the blood of man and ox is helpless a mere dead eyeball before this mystery of being this wonder of life the sympathy which puts us in relation with all nature before that mighty circulation of deity in which stars and systems are but as the blooddisks in our own veins and so long as wonder lasts so long will imagination find thread for her loom and sit like the lady of shalott weaving that magical web in which the shows of things are accommodated to the desires of the mind  it is precisely before this phenomenon of life in literature and language that criticism is forced to stop short that it is there we know but what it is we cannot precisely tell it flits before us like the bird in the old story when we think to grasp it we already hear it singing just beyond us it is the imagination which enables the poet to give away his own consciousness in dramatic poetry to his characters in narrative to his language so that they react upon us with the same original force as if they had life in themselves   ii style and manner   where miltons style is fine it is very fine but it is always liable to the danger of degenerating into mannerism nay where the imagination is absent and the artifice remains as in some of the theological discussions in paradise lost it becomes mannerism of the most wearisome kind accordingly he is easily parodied and easily imitated philips in his splendid shilling has caught the trick exactly    not blacker tube nor of a shorter size   smokes cambrobriton versed in pedigree   sprung from cadwallader and arthur kings   full famous in romantic tale when he   oer many a craggy hill and barren cliff   upon a cargo of famed cestrian cheese   high overshadowing rides with a design   to vend his wares or at the arvonian mart   or maridunum or the ancient town   yclept brechinia or where vagas stream   encircles ariconium fruitful soil  philips has caught i say miltons trick his real secret he could never divine for where milton is best he is incomparable but all authors in whom imagination is a secondary quality and whose merit lies less in what they say than in the way they say it are apt to become mannerists and to have imitators because manner can be easily imitated milton has more or less colored all blank verse since his time and as those who imitate never fail to exaggerate his influence has in some respects been mischievous thomson was wellnigh ruined by him in him a leaf cannot fall without a latinism and there is circumlocution in the crow of a cock cowper was only saved by mixing equal proportions of dryden in his verse thus hitting upon a kind of cross between prose and poetry in judging milton however we should not forget that in verse the music makes a part of the meaning and that no one before or since has been able to give to simple pentameters the majesty and compass of the organ he was as much composer as poet  how is it with shakespeare did he have no style i think i find the proof that he had it and that of the very highest and subtlest kind in the fact that i can nowhere put my finger on it and say it is here or there1  footnote 1 in his essay shakespeare once more works in pp 3642 published in 1868 mr lowell has treated of shakespeares style in a passage of extraordinary felicity and depth of critical judgment  i do not mean that things in themselves artificial may not be highly agreeable we learn by degrees to take a pleasure in the mannerism of gibbon and johnson it is something like reading latin as a living language but in both these cases the man is only present by his thought it is the force of that and only that which distinguishes them from their imitators who easily possess themselves of everything else but with burke who has true style we have a very different experience if we go along with johnson or gibbon we are carried along by burke take the finest specimen of him for example the letter to a noble lord the sentences throb with the very pulse of the writer as he kindles the phrase glows and dilates and we feel ourselves sharing in that warmth and expansion at last we no longer read we seem to hear him so livingly is the whole man in what he writes and when the spell is over we can scarce believe that those dull types could have held such ravishing discourse and yet we are told that when burke spoke in parliament he always emptied the house  i know very well what the charm of mere words is i know very well that our nerves of sensation adapt themselves as the wood of the violin is said to do to certain modulations so that we receive them with a readier sympathy at every repetition this is a part of the sweet charm of the classics we are pleased with things in horace which we should not find especially enlivening in mr tupper cowper in one of his letters after turning a clever sentence says there if that had been written in latin seventeen centuries ago by mr flaccus you would have thought it rather neat how fully any particular rhythm gets possession of us we can convince ourselves by our dissatisfaction with any emendation made by a contemporary poet in his verses posterity may think he has improved them but we are jarred by any change in the old tune even without any habitual association we cannot help recognizing a certain power over our fancy in mere words in verse almost every ear is caught with the sweetness of alliteration i remember a line in thomsons castle of indolence which owes much of its fascination to three ms where he speaks of the hebrid isles    far placed amid the melancholy main  i remember a passage in prichards races of man which had for me all the moving quality of a poem it was something about the arctic regions and i could never read it without the same thrill dr prichard was certainly far from being an inspired or inspiring author yet there was something in those words or in their collocation that affected me as only genius can it was probably some dimly felt association something like that strange power there is in certain odors which in themselves the most evanescent and impalpable of all impressions on the senses have yet a wondrous magic in recalling and making present to us some forgotten experience  milton understood the secret of memory perfectly well and his poems are full of those little pitfalls for the fancy whatever you have read whether in the classics or in medieval romance all is there to stir you with an emotion not always the less strong because indefinable gray makes use of the same artifice and with the same success  there is a charm in the arrangement of words also and that not only in verse but in prose the finest prose is subject to the laws of metrical proportion for example in the song of deborah and barak awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam or again at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead  setting aside then all charm of association all the influence to which we are unconsciously subjected by melody by harmony or even by the mere sound of words we may say that style is distinguished from manner by the authors power of projecting his own emotion into what he writes the stylist is occupied with the impression which certain things have made upon him the mannerist is wholly concerned with the impression he shall make on others   iii kalevala   but there are also two kinds of imagination or rather two ways in which imagination may display itselfas an active power or as a passive quality of the mind the former reshapes the impressions it receives from nature to give them expression in more ideal forms the latter reproduces them simply and freshly without any adulteration by conventional phrase without any deliberate manipulation of them by the conscious fancy imagination as an active power concerns itself with expression whether it be in giving that unity of form which we call art or in that intenser phrase where word and thing leap together in a vivid flash of sympathy so that we almost doubt whether the poet was conscious of his own magic and whether we ourselves have not communicated the very charm we feel a few such utterances have come down to us to which every generation adds some new significance out of its own store till they do for the imagination what proverbs do for the understanding and passing into the common currency of speech become the property of every man and no man on the other hand wonder which is the raw material in which imagination finds food for her loom is the property of primitive peoples and primitive poets there is always here a certain intimacy with nature and a consequent simplicity of phrases and images that please us all the more as the artificial conditions remove us farther from it when a man happens to be born with that happy combination of qualities which enables him to renew this simple and natural relation with the world about him however little or however much we call him a poet and surrender ourselves gladly to his gracious and incommunicable gift but the renewal of these conditions becomes with the advance of every generation in literary culture and social refinement more difficult ballads for example are never produced among cultivated people like the mayflower they love the woods and will not be naturalized in the garden now the advantage of that primitive kind of poetry of which i was just speaking is that it finds its imaginative components ready made to its hand but an illustration is worth more than any amount of discourse let me read you a few passages from a poem which grew up under the true conditions of natural and primitive literatureremoteness primitiveness of manners and dependence on native traditions i mean the epic of finlandkalevala1  footnote 1 this translation is mr lowells and so far as i know has not been printedce norton    i am driven by my longing   of my thought i hear the summons   that to singing i betake me   that i give myself to speaking   that our races lay i utter   song for ages handed downward   words upon my lips are melting   and the eager tones escaping   will my very tongue outhasten   will my teeth despite me open    golden friend beloved brother   dear one that grew up beside me   join thee with me now in singing   join thee with me now in speaking   since we here have come together   journeying by divers pathways   seldom do we come together   one comes seldom to the other   in the barren fields farlying   on the hard breast of the northland    hand in hand together clasping   finger fast with finger clasping   gladly we our song will utter   of our lays will give the choicest   so that friends may understand it   and the kindly ones may hear it   in their youth which now is waxing   climbing upward into manhood   these our words of old tradition   these our lays that we have borrowed   from the belt of wainamoinen   from the forge of ilmarinen   from the sword of kaukomeli   from the bow of jonkahainen   from the borders of the icefields   from the plains of kalevala    these my father sang before me   as the axes helve he fashioned   these were taught me by my mother   as she sat and twirled her spindle   while i on the floor was lying   at her feet a child was rolling   never songs of sampo failed her   magic songs of lonhi never   sampo in her song grew aged   lonhi with her magic vanished   in her singing died wipunen   as i played died lunminkainen   other words there are a many   magic words that i have taught me   which i picked up from the pathway   which i gathered from the forest   which i snapped from wayside bushes   which i gleaned from slender grassblades   which i found upon the footbridge   when i wandered as a herdboy   as a child into the pastures   to the meadows rich in honey   to the sunbegoldened hilltops   following the black maurikki   by the side of brindled kimmo    lays the winter gave me also   song was given me by the rainstorm   other lays the windgusts blew me   and the waves of ocean brought them   words i borrowed of the songbirds   and wise sayings from the treetops    then into a skein i wound them   bound them fast into a bundle   laid upon my ledge the burthen   bore them with me to my dwelling   on the garret beams i stored them   in the great chest bound with copper    long time in the cold they lay there   under lock and key a long time   from the cold shall i forth bring them   bring my lays from out the frost there   neath this roof so widerenownèd   here my songchest shall i open   chest with runic lays oerrunning   shall i here untie my bundle   and begin my skein unwinding                                       now my lips at last must close them   and my tongue at last be fettered   i must leave my lay unfinished   and must cease from cheerful singing   even the horses must repose them   when all day they have been running   even the irons self grows weary   mowing down the summer grasses   even the water sinks to quiet   from its rushing in the river   even the fire seeks rest in ashes   that all night hath roared and crackled   wherefore should not music also   song itself at last grow weary   after the long eves contentment   and the fading of the twilight   i have also heard say often   heard it many times repeated   that the cataract swiftrushing   not in one gush spends its waters   and in like sort cunning singers   do not spend their utmost secret   yea to end betimes is better   than to break the thread abruptly    ending then as i began them   closing thus and thus completing   i fold up my pack of ballads   roll them closely in a bundle   lay them safely in the storeroom   in the strong bonecastles chamber   that they never thence be stolen   never in all time be lost thence   though the castles wall be broken   though the bones be rent asunder   though the teeth may be pried open   and the tongue be set in motion    how then were it sang i always   till my songs grew poor and poorer   till the dells alone would hear me   only the deaf firtrees listen   not in life is she my mother   she no longer is aboveground   she the golden cannot hear me   t is the firtrees now that hear me   t is the pinetops understand me   and the birchcrowns full of goodness   and the ashtrees now that love me   small and weak my mother left me   like a lark upon the clifftop   like a young thrush mid the flintstones   in the guardianship of strangers   in the keeping of the stepdame   she would drive the little orphan   drive the child with none to love him   to the cold side of the chimney   to the north side of the cottage   where the wind that felt no pity   bit the boy with none to shield him   larklike then i forth betook me   like a little bird to wander   silent oer the country straying   yon and hither full of sadness   with the winds i made acquaintance   felt the will of every tempest   learned of bitter frost to shiver   learned too well to weep of winter    yet there be full many people   who with evil voice assail me   and with tongue of poison sting me   saying that my lips are skilless   that the ways of song i know not   nor the ballads pleasant turnings   ah you should not kindly people   therein seek a cause to blame me   that a child i sang too often   that unfledged i twittered only   i have never had a teacher   never heard the speech of great men   never learned a word unhomely   nor fine phrases of the stranger   others to the school were going   i alone at home must keep me   could not leave my mothers elbow   in the wide world had her only   in the house had i my schooling   from the rafters of the chamber   from the spindle of my mother   from the axehelve of my father   in the early days of childhood   but for this it does not matter   i have shown the way to singers   shown the way and blazed the treebark   snapped the twigs and marked the footpath   here shall be the way in future   here the track at last be opened   for the singers bettergifted   for the songs more rich than mine are   of the youth that now are waxing   in the good time that is coming  like virgils husbandman our minstrel did not know how well off he was to have been without schooling this i think every one feels at once to be poetry that sings itself it makes its own tune and the heart beats in time to its measure by and by poets will begin to say like goethe i sing as the bird sings but this poet sings in that fashion without thinking of it or knowing it and it is the very music of his race and country which speaks through him with such simple pathos finland is the mother and russia is the stepdame and the listeners to the old national lays grow fewer every day before long the fins will be writing songs in the manner of heine and dramas in imitation of faust doubtless the material of original poetry lies in all of us but in proportion as the mind is conventionalized by literature it is apt to look about it for models instead of looking inward for that native force which makes models but does not follow them this rose of originality which we long for this bloom of imagination whose perfume enchants uswe can seldom find it when it is near us when it is part of our daily lives     reviews of contemporaries     henry james  jamess tales and sketches1   footnote 1 a passionate pilgrim and other tales by henry james jr boston jr osgood  co transatlantic sketches by the same author  whoever takes an interest whether of mere curiosity or of critical foreboding in the product and tendency of our younger literature must have had his attention awakened and detained by the writings of mr james whatever else they may be they are not common and have that air of good breeding which is the token of whatever is properly called literature they are not the overflow of a shallow talent for improvisation too full of self to be contained but show everywhere the marks of intelligent purpose and of the graceful ease that comes only of conscientious training undoubtedly there was a large capital of native endowment to start froma mind of singular subtlety and refinement a faculty of rapid observation yet patient of rectifying afterthought senses daintily alive to every aesthetic suggestion and a frank enthusiasm kept within due bounds by the doubleconsciousness of humor but it is plain that mr james is fortunate enough to possess or to be possessed by that finer sixth sense which we call the artistic and which controls corrects and discontents his felicities therefore are not due to a lucky turn of the dice but to forethought and afterthought accordingly he is capable of progress and gives renewed evidence of it from time to time while too many of our authors show premature marks of arrested development they strike a happy vein of starting perhaps and keep on grubbing at it with the rude helps of primitive mining seemingly unaware that it is daily growing more and more slender even should it wholly vanish they persist in the vain hope of recovering it further on as if in literature two successes of precisely the same kind were possible nay most of them have hit upon no vein at all but picked up a nugget rather and persevere in raking the surface of things if haply they may chance upon another the moral of one of hawthornes stories is that there is no element of treasuretrove in success but that true luck lies in the deep and assiduous cultivation of our own plot of ground be it larger or smaller for indeed the only estate of man that savors of the realty is in his mind mr james seems to have arrived early at an understanding of this and to have profited by the best modern appliances of selfculture in conception and expression is he essentially an artist and not an irresponsible trouvère if he allow himself an occasional carelessness it is not from incaution but because he knows perfectly well what he is about he is quite at home in the usages of the best literary society in his writing there is none of that hitormiss playing at snapdragon with language of that clownish bearingon in what should be the light strokes as if mere emphasis were meaning and naturally none of the slovenliness that offends a trained judgment in the work of so many of our writers later unmistakably clever as they are in short he has tone the last result and surest evidence of an intellect reclaimed from the rudeness of nature for it means selfrestraint the story of handels composing always in full dress conveys at least the useful lesson of a gentlemanlike deference for the art a man professes and for the public whose attention he claims mr james as we see in his sketches of travel is not averse to the lounging ease of a shootingjacket but he respects the usages of convention and at the canonical hours is sure to be found in the required toilet he does not expect the company to pardon his own indolence as one of the necessary appendages of originality always considerate himself his readers soon find reason to treat him with consideration for they soon come to see that literature may be light and at the same time thoughtful that lightness indeed results much more surely from serious study than from the neglect of it  we have said that mr james was emphatically a man of culture and we are oldfashioned enough to look upon him with the more interest as a specimen of exclusively modern culture of any classical training we have failed to detect the traces in him his allusions his citations are in the strictest sense contemporary and indicate if we may trust our divination a preference for french models balzac de musset feuillet taine gautier mérimée saintebeuve especially the three latter he emulates successfully their suavity their urbanity their clever knack of conveying a fuller meaning by innuendo than by direct bluntness of statement if not the best school for substance it is an admirable one for method and for so much of style as is attainable by example it is the same school in which the writers of what used to be called our classical period learned the superior efficacy of the french smallsword as compared with the english cudgel and mr james shows the graceful suppleness of that excellent academy of fence in which a man distinguishes by effacing himself he has the dexterous art of letting us feel the point of his individuality without making us obtrusively aware of his presence we arrive at an intimate knowledge of his character by confidences that escape egotism by seeming to be made always in the interest of the reader that we know all his tastes and prejudices appears rather a compliment to our penetration than a proof of indiscreetness on his part if we were disposed to find any fault with mr jamess style which is generally of conspicuous elegance it would be for his occasional choice of a french word or phrase like bouder se reconnaît banal and the like where our english without being driven to search her coffers round would furnish one quite as good and surer of coming home to the ordinary reader we could grow as near surly with him as would be possible for us with a writer who so generally endears himself to our taste when he foists upon us a disagreeable alien like abandon used as a noun as if it could show an honest baptismal certificate in the registers of johnson or webster perhaps mr james finds or fancies in such words a significance that escapes our obtuser sense a sweetness it may be of early association for he tells us somewhere that in his boyhood he was put to school in geneva in this way only can we account for his once slipping into the rusticism that remembers of a thing  but beyond any advantage which he may have derived from an intelligent study of french models it is plain that a much larger share of mr jamess education has been acquired by travel and through the eyes of a thoughtful observer of men and things he has seen more cities and manners of men than was possible in the slower days of ulysses and if with less gain of worldly wisdom yet with an enlargement of his artistic apprehensiveness and scope that is of far greater value to him we do not mean to imply that mr james lacks what is called knowledge of the world on the contrary he has a great deal of it but it has not in him degenerated into worldliness and a mellowing haze of imagination ransoms the edges of things from the hardness of overnear familiarity he shows on analysis that rare combination of qualities which results in a man of the world whose contact with it kindles instead of dampening the ardor of his fancy he is thus excellently fitted for the line he has chosen as a storyteller who deals mainly with problems of character and psychology which spring out of the artificial complexities of society and as a translator of the impressions received from nature and art into language that often lacks only verse to make it poetry mr james does not see things with his eyes alone his vision is always modified by his imaginative temperament he is the last man we should consult for statistics but his sketches give us the very marrow of sensitive impression and are positively better than the actual pilgrimage we are tolerably familiar with the scenes he describes but hardly knew before how much we had to be grateful for et ego in arcadia we murmur to ourselves as we read but surely this was not the name we found in our guidebook it is always dichtung und wahrheit goethe knew very well what he was about when he gave precedence to the giddier sisterit is always fact seen through imagination and transfigured by it a single example will best show what we mean it is partly doubtless because their mighty outlines are still unsoftened that the aqueducts are so impressive they seem the very source of the solitude in which they stand they look like architectural spectres and loom through the light mists of their grassy desert as you recede along the line with the same insubstantial vastness as if they rose out of egyptian sands such happy touches are frequent in mr jamess pages like flecks of sunshine that steal softened through every chance crevice in the leaves as where he calls the lark a disembodied voice or says of an english countrychurch that it made a sunday where it stood a lightfingered poet would find many a temptation in his prose but it is not merely our fancies that are pleased mr james tempts us into many byways of serious and fruitful thought especially valuable and helpful have we found his obiter dicta on the arts of painting sculpture and architecture for example when he says of the tuscan palaces that in their large dependence on pure symmetry for beauty of effect they reproduce more than other modern styles the simple nobleness of greek architecture and we would note also what he says of the albani antinoüs it must be a nimble wit that can keep pace with mr jamess logic in his aesthetic criticism it is apt to spring airily over the middle term to the conclusion leaving something in the likeness of a ditch across the path of our slower intelligences which look about them and think twice before taking the leap courage there are always fresh woods and pastures new on the other side a curious reflection has more than once flashed upon our minds as we lingered with mr james over his complex and refined sensations we mean the very striking contrast between the ancient and modern traveller the former saw with his bodily eyes and reported accordingly catering for the curiosity of homely wits as to the outsides and appearances of things even montaigne habitually introspective as he was sticks to the old method in his travels the modern traveller on the other hand superseded by the guidebook travels in himself and records for us the scenery of his own mind as it is affected by change of sky and the various weather of temperament  mr james in his sketches frankly acknowledges his preference of the old world lifewhich here seems all drab to him without due lights and shades of social contrast without that indefinable suggestion of immemorial antiquity which has so large a share in picturesque impressionis there a dome of manycolored glass irradiating both senses and imagination we shall not blame him too gravely for this as if an american had not as good a right as any ancient of them all to say ubi libertas ibi patria it is no real paradox to affirm that a mans love of his country may often be gauged by his disgust at it but we think it might fairly be argued against him that the very absence of that distracting complexity of associations might help to produce that solitude which is the main feeder of imagination certainly hawthorne with whom no modern european can be matched for the subtlety and power of this marvellous quality is a strong case on the american side of the question  mr jamess tales if without any obvious moral are sure to have a clearly defined artistic purpose they are careful studies of character thrown into dramatic action and the undercurrent of motive is as it should be not in the circumstances but in the characters themselves it is by delicate touches and hints that his effects are produced the reader is called upon to do his share and will find his reward in it for mr james as we cannot too often insist is first and always an artist nowhere does he show his fine instinct more to the purpose than in leaving the tragic element of tales dealing as they do with contemporary life and that mainly in the drawingroom to take care of itself and in confining the outward expression of passion within the limits of a decorous amenity those who must have their intellectual gullets tingled with the fiery draught of coarse sensation must go elsewhere for their dram but whoever is capable of the aroma of the more delicate vintages will find it here in the volume before us madame de mauves will illustrate what we mean there is no space for detailed analysis even if that were ever adequate to give the true impression of stories so carefully worked out and depending so much for their effect on a gradual cumulation of particulars each in itself unemphatic we have said that mr james shows promise as well as accomplishment gaining always in mastery of his material it is but a natural inference from this that his roderick hudson is the fullest and most finished proof of his power as a storyteller indeed we may say frankly that it pleases us the more because the characters are drawn with a bolder hand and in more determined outline for if mr james need any friendly caution it is against overdelicacy of handling     longfellow  the courtship of miles standish   the introduction and acclimatization of the hexameter upon english soil has been an affair of more than two centuries the attempt was first systematically made during the reign of elizabeth but the metre remained a feeble exotic that scarcely burgeoned under glass gabriel harveya kind of don adriano de armadowhose chief claim to remembrance is that he was the friend of spenser boasts that he was the first to whom the notion of transplantation occurred in his foure letters 1592 he says if i never deserve anye better remembraunce let mee rather be epitaphed the inventour of the english hexameter whome learned m stanihurst imitated in his virgill and excellent sir phillip sidney disdained not to follow in his arcadia and elsewhere this claim of invention however seems to have been an afterthought with harvey for in the letters which passed between him and spenser in 1579 he speaks of himself more modestly as only a collaborator with sidney and others in the good work the earl of surrey is said to have been the first who wrote thus in english the most successful person however was william webb who translated two of virgils eclogues with a good deal of spirit and harmony ascham in his schoolmaster 1570 had already suggested the adoption of the ancient hexameter by english poets but ascham as afterwards puttenham in his art of poesie thought the number of monosyllabic words in english an insuperable objection to verses in which there was a large proportion of dactyls and recommended therefore that a trial should be made with iambics spenser at harveys instance seems to have tried his hand at the new kind of verse he says      i like your late englishe hexameters so exceedingly well that i     also enure my penne sometimes in that kinde for the onely or     chiefest hardnesse whych seemeth is in the accente which sometime

the kingdome of our     owne language and measure our accentes by the sounde reserving the     quantitie to the verse  the amiable edmonde seems to be smiling in his sleeve as he writes this sentence he instinctively saw the absurdity of attempting to subdue english to misunderstood laws of latin quantities which would for example make the vowel in debt long in the teeth of use and wont  we give a specimen of the hexameters which satisfied so entirely the ear of master gabriel harveyan ear that must have been long by position in virtue of its place on his head    not the like discourser for

hill and downe hill like the waye betwixt stamford and beechfeeld and goes like a horse plunging through the myre in the deep of winter now soust up to the saddle and straight aloft on his tiptoes it will be noticed that his prose falls into a kind of tipsy hexameter the attempt in england at that time failed but the controversy to which it gave rise was so far useful that it called forth samuel daniels defence of ryme 1603 one of the noblest pieces of prose in the language hall also in his satires condemned the heresy in some verses remarkable for their grave beauty and strength  the revival of the hexameter in modern poetry is due to johann heinrich voss a man of genius an admirable metrist and schlegels sneer to the contrary notwithstanding hitherto the best translator of homer his odyssey 1783 his iliad 1791 and his luise 1795 were confessedly goethes teachers in this kind of verse the hermann and dorothea of the latter 1798 was the first true poem written in modern hexameters from germany southey imported that and other classic metres into england and we should be grateful to him at least for having given the model for cannings knifegrinder the exotic however again refused to take root and for many years after we have no example of english hexameters it was universally conceded that the temper of our language was unfriendly to them  it remained for a man of true poetic genius to make them not only tolerated but popular longfellows translation of the children of the lords supper may have softened prejudice somewhat but evangeline 1847 though encumbered with too many descriptive irrelevancies was so full of beauty pathos and melody that it made converts by thousands to the hitherto ridiculed measure more than this it made longfellow at once the most popular of contemporary english poets cloughs bothiepoem whose singular merit has hitherto failed of the wide appreciation it deservesfollowed not long after and kingsleys andromeda is yet damp from the press  while we acknowledge that the victory thus won by evangeline is a striking proof of the genius of the author we confess that we have never been able to overcome the feeling that the new metre is a dangerous and deceitful one it is too easy to write and too uniform for true pleasure in reading its ease sometimes leads mr longfellow into proseas in the verse    combed and wattled gules and all the rest of the blazon  and into a prosaic phraseology which has now and then infected his style in other metres as where he says    spectral gleam their snowwhite dresses  using a word as essentially unpoetic as surtout or peajacket we think one great danger of the hexameter is that it gradually accustoms the poet to be content with a certain regular recurrence of accented sounds to the neglect of the poetic value of language and intensity of phrase  but while we frankly avow our infidelity as regards the metre we as frankly confess our admiration of the high qualities of miles standish in construction we think it superior to evangeline the narrative is more straightforward and the characters are defined with a firmer touch it is a poem of wonderful picturesqueness tenderness and simplicity and the situations are all conceived with the truest artistic feeling nothing can be better to our thinking than the picture of standish and alden in the opening scene tinged as it is with a delicate humor which the contrast between the thoughts and characters of the two heightens almost to pathos the pictures of priscilla spinning and the bridal procession are also masterly we feel charmed to see such exquisite imaginations conjured out of the little old familiar anecdote of john aldens vicarious wooing we are astonished like the fisherman in the arabian tale that so much genius could be contained in so small and leaden a casket those who cannot associate sentiment with the fair priscillas maiden name of mullins may be consoled by hearing that it is only a corruption of the huguenot desmoulinsas barnum is of the norman vernon  indifferent poets comfort themselves with the notion that contemporary popularity is no test of merit and that true poetry must always wait for a new generation to do it justice the theory is not true in any general sense with hardly an exception the poetry that was ever to receive a wide appreciation has received it at once popularity in itself is no test of permanent literary fame but the kind of it is and always has been a very decided one mr longfellow has been greatly popular because he so greatly deserved it he has the secret of all the great poetsthe power of expressing universal sentiments simply and naturally a false standard of criticism has obtained of late which brings a brick as a sample of the house a line or two of condensed expression as a gauge of the poem but it is only the whole poem that is a proof of the poem and there are twenty fragmentary poets for one who is capable of simple and sustained beauty of this quality mr longfellow has given repeated and striking examples and those critics are strangely mistaken who think that what he does is easy to be done because he has the power to make it seem so we think his chief fault is a too great tendency to moralize or rather a distrust of his readers which leads him to point out the moral which he wishes to be drawn from any special poem we wish for example that the last two stanzas could be cut off from the two angels a poem which without them is as perfect as anything in the language  many of the pieces in this volume having already shone as captain jewels in magas carcanet need no comment from us and we should perhaps have avoided the delicate responsibility of criticizing one of our most precious contributors had it not been that we have seen some very unfair attempts to depreciate mr longfellow and that as it seemed to us for qualities which stamp him as a true and original poet the writer who appeals to more peculiar moods of mind to more complex or more esoteric motives of emotion may be a greater favorite with the few but he whose verse is in sympathy with moods that are human and not personal with emotions that do not belong to periods in the development of individual minds but to all men in all years wins the gratitude and love of whoever can read the language which he makes musical with solace and aspiration the present volume while it will confirm mr longfellows claim to the high rank he has won among lyric poets deserves attention also as proving him to possess that faculty of epic narration which is rarer than all others in the nineteenth century in our love of stimulants and our numbness of taste which craves the red pepper of a biting vocabulary we of the present generation are apt to overlook this almost obsolete and unobtrusive quality but we doubt if since chaucer we have had an example of more purely objective narrative than in the courtship of miles standish apart from its intrinsic beauty this gives the poem a claim to higher and more thoughtful consideration and we feel sure that posterity will confirm the verdict of the present in regard to a poet whose reputation is due to no fleeting fancy but to an instinctive recognition by the public of that which charms now and charms alwaystrue power and originality without grimace and distortion for apollo and not milo is the artistic type of strength     tales of a wayside inn   it is no wonder that mr longfellow should be the most popular of american we might say of contemporary poets the fine humanity of his nature the wise simplicity of his thought the picturesqueness of his images and the deliciously limpid flow of his style entirely justify the public verdict and give assurance that his present reputation will settle into fame that he has not this of tennyson nor that of browning may be cheerfully admitted while he has so many other things that are his own there may be none of those flashes of lightning in his verse that make day for a moment in this dim cavern of consciousness where we grope but there is an equable sunshine that touches the landscape of life with a new charm and lures us out into healthier air if he fall short of the highest reaches of imagination he is none the less a master within his own sphereall the more so indeed that he is conscious of his own limitations and wastes no strength in striving to be other than himself genial natural and original as much as in these latter days it is given to be he holds a place among our poets like that of irving among our prosewriters make whatever deductions and qualifications and they still keep their place in the hearts and minds of men in point of time he is our chaucerthe first who imported a finer foreign culture into our poetry  his present volume shows a greater ripeness than any of its predecessors we find a mellowness of early autumn in it there is the old sweetness native to the man with greater variety of character and experience the personages are all drawn from the life and sketched with the light firmness of a practised art they have no more individuality than is necessary to the purpose of the poem which consists of a series of narratives told by a party of travellers gathered in sudbury inn and each suited either by its scene or its sentiment to the speaker who recites it in this also there is a natural reminiscence of chaucer and if we miss the rich minuteness of his van eyck painting or the depth of his thoughtful humor we find the same airy grace tenderness simple strength and exquisite felicities of description nor are twinkles of sly humor wanting the interludes and above all the prelude are masterly examples of that perfect ease of style which is of all things the hardest to attain the verse flows clear and sweet as honey and with a faint fragrance that tells but not too plainly of flowers that grew in many fields we are made to feel that however tedious the processes of culture may be the ripe result in facile power and scope of fancy is purely delightful we confess that we are so heartily weary of those cataclysms of passion and sentiment with which literature has been convulsed of lateas if the main object were not to move the reader but to shake the house about his earsthat the homelike quiet and beauty of such poems as these is like an escape from noise to nature  as regards the structure of the work looked at as a whole it strikes us as a decided fault that the saga of king olaf is so disproportionately long especially as many of the pieces which compose it are by no means so well done as the more strictly original ones we have no quarrel with the foreign nature of the subject as suchfor any good matter is american enough for a truly american poet but we cannot help thinking that mr longfellow has sometimes mistaken mere strangeness for freshness and has failed to make his readers feel the charm he himself felt put into english the saga seems too norse and there is often a hitchiness in the verse that suggests translation with overmuch heed for literal closeness it is possible to assume alien forms of verse but hardly to enter into forms of thought alien both in time and in the ethics from which they are derived the building of the long serpent is not to be named with mr longfellows building of the ship which he learned from no heimskringla but from the dockyards of portland where he played as a boy we are willing however to pardon the parts which we find somewhat ineffectual in favor of the nun of nidaros which concludes and in its gracious piety more than redeems them all     whittier  in war time and other poems   it is a curious illustration of the attraction of opposites that among our elder poets the war we are waging finds its keenest expression in the quaker whittier here is indeed a soldier prisoner on parole in a drab coat with no hope of exchange but with a heart beating time to the tap of the drum mr whittier is on the whole the most american of our poets and there is a fire of warlike patriotism in him that burns all the more intensely that it is smothered by his creed but it is not as a singular antithesis of dogma and character that this peculiarity of his is interesting to us the fact has more significance as illustrating how deep an impress the fathers of new england stamped upon the commonwealth they founded here is a descendant and member of the sect they chiefly persecuted more deeply imbued with the spirit of the puritans than even their own lineal representatives the new englander is too strong for the sectarian and the hereditary animosity softens to reverence as the sincere man looking back conjures up the image of a sincerity as pure though more stern than his own and yet the poetic sentiment of whittier misleads him as far in admiration as the pitiful snobbery of certain renegades perverts them to depreciation of the puritans it is not in any sense true that these pious and earnest men brought with them to the new world the deliberate forethought of the democracy which was to develop itself from their institutions they brought over its seed but unconsciously and it was the kindly nature of the soil and climate that was to give it the chance to propagate and disperse itself the same conditions have produced the same results also at the south and nothing but slavery blocks the way to a perfect sympathy between the two sections  mr whittier is essentially a lyric poet and the fervor of his temperament gives his pieces of that kind a remarkable force and effectiveness twenty years ago many of his poems were in the nature of conciones ad populum vigorous stumpspeeches in verse appealing as much to the blood as the brain and none the less convincing for that by regular gradations ever since his tone has been softening and his range widening as a poet he stands somewhere between burns and cowper akin to the former in patriotic glow and to the latter in intensity of religious anxiety verging sometimes on morbidness his humanity if it lack the humorous breadth of the one has all the tenderness of the other in love of outward nature he yields to neither his delight in it is not a new sentiment or a literary tradition but the genuine passion of a man born and bred in the country who has not merely a visiting acquaintance with the landscape but stands on terms of lifelong friendship with hill stream rock and tree in his descriptions he often catches the expression of rural scenery a very different thing from the mere looks with the trained eye of familiar intimacy a somewhat shy and hermitical being we take him to be and more a student of his own heart than of men his characters where he introduces such are commonly abstractions with little of the flesh and blood of real life in them and this from want of experience rather than of sympathy for many of his poems show him capable of friendship almost womanly in its purity and warmth one quality which we especially value in him is the intense homefeeling which without any conscious aim at being american gives his poetry a flavor of the soil surprisingly refreshing without being narrowly provincial he is the most indigenous of our poets in these times especially his uncalculating love of country has a profound pathos in it he does not flare the flag in our faces but one feels the heart of a lover throbbing in his anxious verse  mr whittier if the most fervid of our poets is sometimes hurried away by this very quality in itself an excellence into being the most careless he draws off his verse while the fermentation is yet going on and before it has had time to compose itself and clarify into the ripe wine of expression his rhymes are often faulty beyond the most provincial license even of burns himself vigor without elegance will never achieve permanent success in poetry we think also that he has too often of late suffered himself to be seduced from the true path to which his nature set up fingerposts for him at every corner into metaphysical labyrinths whose clue he is unable to grasp the real life of his genius smoulders into what the woodmen call a smudge and gives evidence of itself in smoke instead of flame where he follows his truer instincts he is often admirable in the highest sense and never without the interest of natural thought and feeling naturally expressed     home ballads and poems   the natural product of a creed which ignores the aesthetical part of man and reduces nature to a uniform drab would seem to have been bernard barton his verse certainly infringed none of the superstitions of the sect for from titlepage to colophon there was no sin either in the way of music or color there was indeed a frugal and housewifely muse that brewed a cup neither cheering unduly nor inebriating out of the emptyings of wordsworths teapot how that little busy b improved each shining hour how neatly he laid his wax it gives us a cold shiver to think ofancora ci raccappriccia against a copy of verses signed bb as we remember them in the hardy annuals that went to seed so many years ago we should warn our incautious offspring as an experienced duck might her brood against a charge of bb shot it behooves men to be careful for one may chance to suffer lifelong from these intrusions of cold lead in early life as duellists sometimes carry about all their days a bullet from which no surgery can relieve them memory avenges our abuses of her and as an awful example we mention the fact that we have never been able to forget certain stanzas of another bb who under the title of boston bard whilom obtained from newspaper columns that concession which gods and men would unanimously have denied him  george fox utterly ignoring the immense stress which nature lays on established order and precedent got hold of a halftruth which made him crazy as halftruths are wont but the inward light whatever else it might be was surely not of that kind that never was on land or sea there has been much that was poetical in the lives of quakers little in the men themselves poetry demands a richer and more various culture and however good we may find such men as john woolman and elias boudinot they make us feel painfully that the salt of the earth is something very different to say the least from the attic variety of the same mineral let armstrong and whitworth and james experiment as they will they shall never hit on a size of bore so precisely adequate for the waste of human life as the journal of an average quaker compared with it the sandy intervals of swedenborg gush with singing springs and cotton mather is a very lucian for liveliness  yet this dry quaker stem has fairly blossomed at last and nature who can never be long kept under has made a poet of mr whittier as she made a general of greene to make a new england poet she had her choice between puritan and quaker and she took the quaker he is on the whole the most representative poet that new england has produced he sings her thoughts her prejudices her scenery he has not forgiven the puritans for hanging two or three of his cosectaries but he admires them for all that calls on his countrymen as    sons of men who sat in council with their bibles round the board   answering charless royal mandate with a stern thus saith the lord  and at heart we suspect has more sympathy with miles standish than with mary dyer indeed    sons of men who sat in meeting with their broadbrims oer their brow   answering charless royal mandate with a thee instead of thou  would hardly do whatever mr whittier may lack he has the prime merit that he smacks of the soil it is a new england heart he buttons his straightbreasted coat over and it gives the buttons a sharp strain now and then even the native idiom crops out here and there in his verses he makes abroad rhyme with god law with war us with curse scorner with honor been with men beard with shared for the last two we have a certain sympathy as archaisms but with the rest we can make no terms whateverthey must march out with no honors of war the yankee lingo is insoluble in poetry and the accent would give a flavor of essencepennyryl to the very beatitudes it differs from lowland scotch as a patois from a dialect  but criticism is not a game of jerkstraws and mr whittier has other and better claims on us than as a stylist there is true fire in the heart of the man and his eye is the eye of a poet a more juicy soil might have made him a burns or a béranger for us new england is dry and hard though she have a warm nook in her here and there where the magnolia grows after a fashion it is all very nice to say to our poets you have sky and wood and waterfall and men and womenin short the entire outfit of shakespeare nature is the same here as elsewhere and when the popular lecturer says it the popular audience gives a stir of approval but it is all bosh nevertheless nature is not the same here and perhaps never will be as in lands where man has mingled his being with hers for countless centuries where every field is steeped in history every crag is ivied with legend and the whole atmosphere of thought is hazy with the indian summer of tradition nature without an ideal background is nothing we may claim whatever merits we like and our orators are not too bashful we may be as free and enlightened as we choose but we are certainly not interesting or picturesque we may be as beautiful to the statistician as a column of figures and dear to the political economist as a social phenomenon but our hive has little of that marvellous beebread that can transmute the brain to finer issues than a gregarious activity in hoarding the puritans left us a fine estate in conscience energy and respect for learning but they disinherited us of the past not a single stageproperty of poetry did they bring with them but the good old devil with his graminivorous attributes and even he could not stand the climate neither horn nor hoof nor tail of him has been seen for a century he is as dead as the goatfooted pan whom he succeeded and we tenderly regret him  mr whittier himself complains somewhere of    the rigor of our frozen sky  and he seems to have been thinking of our clear thin intellectual atmosphere the counterpart of our physical one of which artists complain that it rounds no edges we have sometimes thought that his verses suffered from a new england taint in a too great tendency to metaphysics and morals which may be the bases on which poetry rests but should not be carried too high aboveground without this however he would not have been the typical new england poet that he is in the present volume there is little of it it is more purely objective than any of its forerunners and is full of the most charming rural pictures and glimpses in which every sight and sound every flower bird and tree is neighborly and homely he makes us see          the old swallowhaunted barns   browngabled long and full of seams   through which the moted sunlight streams   and winds blow freshly in to shake   the red plumes of the roosted cocks   and the loose haymows scented locks                  the cattleyard   with the white horns tossing above the wall  the springblossoms that drooped over the river    lighting up the swarming shad  and          the bulged nets sweeping shoreward   with their silversided haul  every picture is full of color and shows that true eye for nature which sees only what it ought and that artistic memory which brings home compositions and not catalogues there is hardly a hill rock stream or seafronting headland in the neighborhood of his home that he has not fondly remembered sometimes we think there is too much description the besetting sin of modern verse which has substituted what should be called wordypainting for the old art of painting in a single word the essential character of mr whittiers poetry is lyrical and the rush of the lyric like that of a brook allows few pictures now and then there may be an eddy where the feeling lingers and reflects a bit of scenery but for the most part it can only catch gleams of color that mingle with the prevailing tone and enrich without usurping on it this volume contains some of the best of mr whittiers productions in this kind skipper iresons ride we hold to be by long odds the best of modern ballads there are others nearly as good in their way and all with a single exception embodying native legends in telling the bees mr whittier has enshrined a country superstition in a poem of exquisite grace and feeling the garrison of cape ann would have been a fine poem but it has too much of the author in it and to put a moral at the end of a ballad is like sticking a cork on the point of a sword it is pleasant to see how much our quaker is indebted for his themes to cotton mather who belabored his unfriends of former days with so much bad english and worse latin with all his faults that conceited old pedant contrived to make one of the most entertaining books ever written on this side the water and we wonder that no one should take the trouble to give us a tolerably correct edition of it absurdity is common enough but such a genius for it as mather had is a rare and delightful gift  this last volume has given us a higher conception of mr whittiers powers we already valued as they deserved his force of faith his earnestness the glow and hurry of his thought and the if every third stumpspeaker among us were not a demosthenes we should have said demosthenean eloquence of his verse but here we meet him in a softer and more meditative mood he seems a berserker turned carthusian the halfmystic tone of the shadow and the light contrasts strangely and we think pleasantly with the warlike clang of from perugia the years deal kindly with good men and we find a clearer and richer quality in these verses where the ferment is over and the rile has quietly settled we have had no more purely american poet than mr whittier none in whom the popular thought found such ready and vigorous expression the future will not fail to do justice to a man who has been so true to the present     snowbound a winter idyl   at the close of his poem mr whittier utters a hope that it may recall some pleasant country memories to the overworked slaves of our great cities and that he may deserve those thanks which are all the more grateful that they are rather divined by the receiver than directly expressed by the giver the reviewer cannot aspire to all the merit of this confidential privacy and pleasing shyness of gratitude but he may fairly lay claim to a part of it inasmuch as though obliged to speak his thanks publicly he need not do it to the authors face we are again indebted to mr whittier as we have been so often before for a very real and a very refined pleasure the little volume before us has all his most characteristic merits it is true to nature and in local coloring pure in sentiment quietly deep in feeling and full of those simple touches which show the poetic eye and the trained hand here is a new england interior glorified with something of that inward light which is apt to be rather warmer in the poet than the quaker but which blending the qualities of both in mr whittier produces that kind of spiritual picturesqueness which gives so peculiar a charm to his verse there is in this poem a warmth of affectionate memory and religious faith as touching as it is uncommon and which would be altogether delightful if it did not remind us that the poet was growing old not that there is any other mark of senescence than the ripened sweetness of a life both publicly and privately well spent there is fire enough but it glows more equably and shines on sweeter scenes than in the poets earlier verse it is as if a brand from the campfire had kindled these logs on the old homesteads hearth whose flickering benediction touches tremulously those dear heads of long ago that are now transfigured with a holier light the father the mother the uncle the schoolmaster the uncanny guest are all painted in warm and natural colors with perfect truth of detail and yet with all the tenderness of memory of the family group the poet is the last on earth and there is something deeply touching in the pathetic sincerity of the affection which has outlived them all looking back to before the parting and forward to the assured reunion  but aside from its poetic and personal interest and the pleasure it must give to every one who loves pictures from the life snowbound has something of historical interest it describes scenes and manners which the rapid changes of our national habits will soon have made as remote from us as if they were foreign or ancient already alas even in farmhouses backlog and forestick are obsolescent words and closemouthed stoves chill the spirit while they bake the flesh with their grim and undemonstrative hospitality already are the railroads displacing the companionable cheer of crackling walnut with the dogged selfcomplacency and sullen virtue of anthracite even where wood survives he is too often shut in the dreary madhouse cell of an airtight round which one can no more fancy a social mug of flip circling than round a coffin let us be thankful that we can sit in mr whittiers chimneycorner and believe that the blaze he has kindled for us shall still warm and cheer when a wood fire is as faint a tradition in new as in old england  we have before had occasion to protest against mr whittiers carelessness in accents and rhymes as in pronouncing lyceum and joining in unhallowed matrimony such sounds as awn and orn ents and ence we would not have the muse emulate the unidiomatic preciseness of a normal schoolmistress but we cannot help thinking that if mr whittier writes thus on principle as we begin to suspect he errs in forgetting that thought so refined as his can be fitly matched only with an equal refinement of expression and loses something of its charm when cheated of it we hope he will at least never mount pegasus or water him in helicon and that he will leave museum to the more vulgar sphere and obtuser sensibilities of barnum where nature has sent genius she has a right to expect that it shall be treated with a certain elegance of hospitality     poetry and nationality1   footnote 1 this essay to which i have given the above title forms the greater part of a review of poems by john james piatt the brief concluding portion of the review is of little value and is omitted here piatt died several years ago he was a great friend of william dean howells and once published a volume of poems in collaboration with him am  one of the dreams of our earlier horoscopemongers was that a poet should come out of the west fashioned on a scale somewhat proportioned to our geographical pretensions our rivers forests mountains cataracts prairies and inland seas were to find in him their antitype and voice shaggy he was to be brownfisted careless of proprieties unhampered by tradition his pegasus of the halfhorse halfalligator breed by him at last the epos of the new world was to be fitly sung the great tragicomedy of democracy put upon the stage for all time it was a cheap vision for it cost no thought and like all judicious prophecy it muffled itself from criticism in the loose drapery of its terms till the advent of this splendid apparition who should dare affirm positively that he would never come that indeed he was impossible and yet his impossibility was demonstrable nevertheless  supposing a great poet to be born in the west though he would naturally levy upon what had always been familiar to his eyes for his images and illustrations he would almost as certainly look for his ideal somewhere outside of the life that lay immediately about him life in its large sense and not as it is temporarily modified by manners or politics is the only subject of the poet and though its elements lie always close at hand yet in its unity it seems always infinitely distant and the difference of angle at which it is seen in india and in minnesota is almost inappreciable moreover a rooted discontent seems always to underlie all great poetry if it be not even the motive of it the iliad and the odyssey paint manners that are only here and there incidentally true to the actual but which in their larger truth had either never existed or had long since passed away had dantes scope been narrowed to contemporary italy the divina commedia would have been a picturebook merely but his theme was man and the vision that inspired him was of an italy that never was nor could be his political theories as abstract as those of plato or spinoza shakespeare shows us less of the england that then was than any other considerable poet of his time the struggle of goethes whole life was to emancipate himself from germany and fill his lungs for once with a more universal air  yet there is always a flavor of the climate in these rare fruits some gift of the sun peculiar to the region that ripened them if we are ever to have a national poet let us hope that his nationality will be of this subtile essence something that shall make him unspeakably nearer to us while it does not provincialize him for the rest of mankind the popular recipe for compounding him would give us perhaps the most sublimely furnished bore in human annals the novel aspects of life under our novel conditions may give some freshness of color to our literature but democracy itself which many seem to regard as the necessary lucina of some new poetic birth is altogether too abstract an influence to serve for any such purpose if any american author may be looked on as in some sort the result of our social and political ideal it is emerson who in his emancipation from the traditional in the irresponsible freedom of his speculation and his faith in the absolute value of his own individuality is certainly to some extent typical but if ever author was inspired by the past it is he and he is as far as possible from the shaggy hero of prophecy of the shamshaggy who have tried the trick of jacob upon us we have had quite enough and may safely doubt whether this satyr of masquerade is to be our representative singer1 were it so it would not be greatly to the credit of democracy as an element of aesthetics but we may safely hope for better things  footnote 1 this is undoubtedly an allusion to walt whitman who is mentioned by name also derogatorily in the next essay on howells the howells essay appeared two years before the above am  the themes of poetry have been pretty much the same from the first and if a man should ever be born among us with a great imagination and the gift of the right wordfor it is these and not sublime spaces that make a poethe will be original rather in spite of democracy than in consequence of it and will owe his inspiration quite as much to the accumulations of the old world as to the promises of the new but for a long while yet the proper conditions will be wanting not perhaps for the birth of such a man but for his development and culture at present with the largest reading population in the world perhaps no country ever offered less encouragement to the higher forms of art or the more thorough achievements of scholarship even were it not so it would be idle to expect us to produce any literature so peculiarly our own as was the natural growth of ages less communicative less open to every breath of foreign influence literature tends more and more to become a vast commonwealth with no dividing lines of nationality any more cids or songs of roland or nibelungens or kalewalas are out of the questionnay anything at all like them for the necessary insulation of race of country of religion is impossible even were it desirable journalism translation criticism and facility of intercourse tend continually more and more to make the thought and turn of expression in cultivated men identical all over the world whether we like it or not the costume of mind and body is gradually becoming of one cut     wd howells  venetian life   those of our readers who watch with any interest the favorable omens of our literature from time to time must have had their eyes drawn to short poems remarkable for subtilty of sentiment and delicacy of expression and bearing the hitherto unfamiliar name of mr howells such verses are not common anywhere as the work of a young man they are very uncommon youthful poets commonly begin by trying on various manners before they settle upon any single one that is prominently their own but what especially interested us in mr howells was that his writings were from the very first not merely tentative and preliminary but had somewhat of the conscious security of matured style this is something which most poets arrive at through much tribulation it is something which has nothing to do with the measure of their intellectual powers or of their moral insight but is the one quality which essentially distinguishes the artist from the mere man of genius among the english poets of the last generation keats is the only one who early showed unmistakable signs of it and developed it more and more fully until his untimely death wordsworth though in most respects a far profounder man attained it only now and then indeed only once perfectlyin his laodamia now though it be undoubtedly true from one point of view that what a man has to say is of more importance than how he says it and that modern criticism especially is more apt to be guided by its moral and even political sympathies than by aesthetic principles it remains as true as ever that only those things have been said finally which have been said perfectly and that this finished utterance is peculiarly the office of poetry or of what for want of some word as comprehensive as the german dichtung we are forced to call imaginative literature indeed it may be said that in whatever kind of writing it is style alone that is able to hold the attention of the world long let a man be never so rich in thought if he is clumsy in the expression of it his sinking like that of an old spanish treasureship will be hastened by the very weight of his bullion and perhaps after the lapse of a century some lucky diver fishes up his ingots and makes a fortune out of him  that mr howells gave unequivocal indications of possessing this fine quality interested us in his modest preludings marked as they no doubt were by some uncertainty of aim and indefiniteness of thought that stinting as chaucer calls it of the nightingale ere he beginneth sing there was nothing in them of the presumption and extravagance which young authors are so apt to mistake for originality and vigor sentiment predominated over reflection as was fitting in youth but there was a refinement an instinctive reserve of phrase and a felicity of epithet only too rare in modern and especially in american writing he was evidently a man more eager to make something good than to make a sensationone of those authors more rare than ever in our day of handtomouth cleverness who has a conscious ideal of excellence and as we hope the patience that will at length reach it we made occasion to find out something about him and what we learned served to increase our interest this delicacy it appeared was a product of the roughandready west this finish the natural gift of a young man with no advantage of collegetraining who passing from the compositors desk to the editorship of a local newspaper had been his own faculty of the humanities but there are some men who are born cultivated a singular fruit we thought of our shaggy democracyas interesting a phenomenon in that regard as it has been our fortune to encounter where is the rudeness of a new community the pushing vulgarity of an imperfect civilization the licentious contempt of forms that marks our unchartered freedom and all the other terrible things which have so long been the bugaboos of european refinement here was a natural product as perfectly natural as the deliberate attempt of walt whitman to answer the demand of native and foreign misconception was perfectly artificial our institutions do not then irretrievably doom us to coarseness and to impatience of that restraining precedent which alone makes true culture possible and true art attainable unless we are mistaken there is something in such an example as that of mr howells which is a better argument for the american social and political system than any empirical theories that can be constructed against it  we know of no single word which will so fitly characterize mr howellss new volume about venice as delightful the artist has studied his subject for four years and at last presents us with a series of pictures having all the charm of tone and the minute fidelity to nature which were the praise of the dutch school of painters but with a higher sentiment a more refined humor and an airy elegance that recalls the better moods of watteau we do not remember any italian studies so faithful or the result of such continuous opportunity unless it be the roba di roma of mr story and what may be found scattered in the works of henri beyle but mr storys volumes recorded only the chance observations of a quick and familiar eye in the intervals of a profession to which one must be busily devoted who would rise to the acknowledged eminence occupied by their author and beyles mind though singularly acute and penetrating had too much of the hardness of a man of the world and of parisian cynicism to be altogether agreeable mr howells during four years of that consular leisure which only venice could make tolerable devoted himself to the minute study of the superb prison to which he was doomed and his book is his prigioni venice has been the university in which he has fairly earned the degree of master there is perhaps no european city not even bruges not even rome herself which not yet in ruins is so wholly of the past at once alive and turned to marble like the prince of the black islands in the story and what gives it a peculiar fascination is that its antiquity though venerable is yet modern and so to speak continuous while that of rome belongs half to a former world and half to this and is broken irretrievably in two the glory of venice too was the achievement of her own genius not an inheritance and great no longer she is more truly than any other city the monument of her own greatness she is something wholly apart and the silence of her watery streets accords perfectly with the spiritual mood which makes us feel as if we were passing through a city of dream fancy now an imaginative young man from ohio where the loghut was but yesterday turned to almost less enduring brick and mortar set down suddenly in the midst of all this almost immemorial permanence of grandeur we cannot think of any one on whom the impression would be so strangely deep or whose eyes would be so quickened by the constantly recurring shock of unfamiliar objects most men are poor observers because they are cheated into a delusion of intimacy with the things so long and so immediately about them but surely we may hope for something like seeing from fresh eyes and those too a poets when they open suddenly on a marvel so utterly alien to their daily vision and so perdurably novel as venice nor does mr howells disappoint our expectation we have here something like a fulllength portrait of the lady of the lagoons  we have been struck in this volume as elsewhere in writings of the same author with the charm of tone that pervades it it is so constant as to bear witness not only to a real gift but to the thoughtful cultivation of it here and there mr howells yields to the temptation of execution to which persons specially felicitous in language are liable and pushes his experiments of expression to the verge of being unidiomatic in his desire to squeeze the last drop of significance from words but this is seldom and generally we receive that unconscious pleasure in reading him which comes of naturalness the last and highest triumph of good writing mr howells of all men does not need to be told that as wine of the highest flavor and most delicate bouquet is made from juice pressed out by the unaided weight of the grapes so in expression we are in danger of getting something like acridness if we crush in with the first sprightly runnings the skins and kernels of words in our vain hope to win more than we ought of their color and meaning but as we have said this is rather a temptation to which he now and then shows himself liable than a fault for which he can often be blamed if a mind open to all poetic impressions a sensibility too sincere ever to fall into maudlin sentimentality a style flexible and sweet without weakness and a humor which like the bed of a stream is the support of deep feeling and shows waveringly through it in spots of full sunshineif such qualities can make a truly delightful book then mr howells has made one in the volume before us and we give him warning that much will be expected of one who at his years has already shown himself capable of so much     edgar a poe1   footnote 1 the following notice of mr poes life and works was written at his own request and accompanied a portrait of him published in grahams magazine for february 1845 it is here in rw griswolds edition of poes works 1850 given with a few alterations and omissions  the situation of american literature is anomalous it has no centre or if it have it is like that of the sphere of hermes it is divided into many systems each revolving round its several sun and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of a milkandwater way our capital city unlike london or paris is not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to the extremities but resembles more an isolated umbilicus stuck down as near as may be to the centre of the land and seeming rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any present need boston new york philadelphia each has its literature almost more distinct than those of the different dialects of germany and the young queen of the west has also one of her own of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us dwellers by the atlantic  perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism of contemporary literature it is even more grateful to give praise where it is needed than where it is deserved and friendship so often seduces the iron stylus of justice into a vague flourish that she writes what seems rather like an epitaph than a criticism yet if praise be given as an alms we could not drop so poisonous a one into any mans hat the critics ink may suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of sugar but it is easier to be generous than to be just and we might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hidingplace of truth did we judge from the amount of water which we usually find mixed with it  remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of imaginative men but mr poes biography displays a vicissitude and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with the offspring of a romantic marriage and left an orphan at an early age he was adopted by mr allan a wealthy virginian whose barren marriagebed seemed the warranty of a large estate to the young poet having received a classical education in england he returned home and entered the university of virginia where after an extravagant course followed by reformation at the last extremity he was graduated with the highest honors of his class then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the insurgent greeks which ended at st petersburg where he got into difficulties through want of a passport from which he was rescued by the american consul and sent home1 he now entered the military academy at west point from which he obtained a dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father by a second marriage an event which cut off his expectations as an heir the death of mr allan in whose will his name was not mentioned soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support previously to this however he had published in 1827 a small volume of poems which soon ran through three editions and excited high expectations of its authors future distinction in the minds of many competent judges  footnote 1 there is little evidence for this story which some biographers have dismissed as a myth created by poe himself see woodberrys poe v i p 337  that no certain augury can be drawn from a poets earliest lispings there are instances enough to prove shakespeares first poems though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness give but a very faint promise of the directness condensation and overflowing moral of his maturer works perhaps however shakespeare is hardly a case in point his venus and adonis having been published we believe in his twentysixth year miltons latin verses show tenderness a fine eye for nature and a delicate appreciation of classic models but give no hint of the author of a new style in poetry popes youthful pieces have all the singsong wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity and eloquent irreligion of his later productions collins callow nambypamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original genius which he afterwards displayed we have never thought that the world lost more in the marvellous boy chatterton than a very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated dulness where he becomes original as it is called the interest of ingenuity ceases and he becomes stupid kirke whites promises were endorsed by the respectable name of mr southey but surely with no authority from apollo they have the merit of a traditional piety which to our mind if uttered at all had been less objectionable in the retired closet of a diary and in the sober raiment of prose they do not clutch hold of the memory with the drowning pertinacity of watts neither have they the interest of his occasional simple lucky beauty burns having fortunately been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating society of the best models wrote well and naturally from the first had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste we should have had a series of poems from which as from his letters we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of chaff coleridges youthful efforts give no promise whatever of that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest tenderest most original and most purely imaginative poems of modern times byrons hours of idleness would never find a reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity in wordsworths first preludings there is but a dim foreboding of the creator of an era from southeys early poems a safer augury might have been drawn they show the patient investigator the close student of history and the unwearied explorer of the beauties of predecessors but they give no assurances of a man who should add aught to stock of household words or to the rarer and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor the earliest specimens of shelleys poetic mind already also give tokens of that ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to soar above the regions of words but leaves its body the verse to be entombed without hope of resurrection in a mass of them cowley is generally instanced as a wonder of precocity but his early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming and for the metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of words a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical organization and an unhappy memory an early poem is only remarkable when it displays an effort of reason and the rudest verses in which we can trace some conception of the ends of poetry are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile versification a schoolboy one would say might acquire the regular seesaw of pope merely by an association with the motion of the playground tilt  mr poes early productions show that he could see through the verse to the spirit beneath and that he already had a feeling that all the life and grace of the one must depend on and be modulated by the will of the other we call them the most remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read we know of none that can compare with them for maturity of purpose and a nice understanding of the effects of language and metre such pieces are only valuable when they display what we can only express by the contradictory phrase of innate experience we copy one of the shorter poems written when the author was only fourteen there is a little dimness in the filling up but the grace and symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain there is a smack of ambrosia about it    to helen    helen thy beauty is to me     like those nicean barks of yore   that gently oer a perfumed sea     the weary wayworn wanderer bore     to his own native shore    on desperate seas long wont to roam     thy hyacinth hair thy classic face   thy naiad airs have brought me home     to the glory that was greece     and the grandeur that was rome    lo in yon brilliant windowniche     how statuelike i see thee stand   the agate lamp within thy hand     ah psyche from the regions which     are holy land  it is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us here is no withering scorn no heart blighted ere it has safely got into its teens none of the drawingroom sansculottism which byron had brought into vogue all is limpid and serene with a pleasant dash of the greek helicon in it the melody of the whole too is remarkable it is not of that kind which can be demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers it is of that finer sort which the inner ear alone can estimate it seems simple like a greek column because of its perfection in a poem named ligeia under which title he intended to personify the music of nature our boypoet gives us the following exquisite picture    ligeia ligeia     my beautiful one   whose harshest idea     will to melody run   say is it thy will     on the breezes to toss   or capriciously still     like the lone albatross   incumbent on night     as she on the air   to keep watch with delight     on the harmony there  john neal himself a man of genius and whose lyre has been too long capriciously silent appreciated the high merit of these and similar passages and drew a proud horoscope for their author  mr poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to call genius no man could ever tell us precisely what it is and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence and its power let talent writhe and contort itself as it may it has no such magnetism larger of bone and sinew it may be but the wings are wanting talent sticks fast to earth and its most perfect works have still one foot of clay genius claims kindred with the very workings of nature herself so that a sunset shall seem like a quotation from dante or milton and if shakespeare be read in the very presence of the sea itself his verses shall but seem nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean talent may make friends for itself but only genius can give to its creations the divine power of winning love and veneration enthusiasm cannot cling to what itself is unenthusiastic nor will he ever have disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a disciple great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they are possessed and carried away by their demon while talent keeps him as paracelsus did securely prisoned in the pommel of its sword to the eye of genius the veil of the spiritual world is ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and evil who throng continually around it no man of mere talent ever flung his inkstand at the devil  when we say that mr poe had genius we do not mean to say that he has produced evidence of the highest but to say that he possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal industry and a reverence for the trust reposed in him to achieve the proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels if we may believe the longinuses and aristotles of our newspapers we have quite too many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them at all desirable whether for its hardness of attainment or its seclusion the highest peak of our parnassus is according to these gentlemen by far the most thickly settled portion of the country a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable residence for individuals of a poetical temperament if love of solitude be as immemorial tradition asserts a necessary part of their idiosyncrasy  mr poe has two of the prime qualities of genius a faculty of vigorous yet minute analysis and a wonderful fecundity of imagination the first of these faculties is as needful to the artist in words as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in colors or in stone this enables him to conceive truly to maintain a proper relation of parts and to draw a correct outline while the second groups fills up and colors both of these mr poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his prose works the last predominating in his earlier tales and the first in his later ones in judging of the merit of an author and assigning him his niche among our household gods we have a right to regard him from our own point of view and to measure him by our own standard but in estimating the amount of power displayed in his works we must be governed by his own design and placing them by the side of his own ideal find how much is wanting we differ from mr poe in his opinions of the objects of art he esteems that object to be the creation of beauty and perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we disagree with him but in what we shall say of his writings we shall take his own standard as our guide the temple of the god of song is equally accessible from every side and there is room enough in it for all who bring offerings or seek an oracle  in his tales mr poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of the probable into the weird confines of superstition and unreality he combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united a power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed both are in truth the natural results of the predominating quality of his mind to which we have before alluded analysis it is this which distinguishes the artist his mind at once reaches forward to the effect to be produced having resolved to bring about certain emotions in the reader he makes all subordinate parts tend strictly to the common centre even his mystery is mathematical to his own mind to him x is a known quantity all along in any picture that he paints he understands the chemical properties of all his colors however vague some of his figures may seem however formless the shadows to him the outline is as clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram for this reason mr poe has no sympathy with mysticism the mystic dwells in the mystery is enveloped with it it colors all his thoughts it affects his optic nerve especially and the commonest things get a rainbow edging from it mr poe on the other hand is a spectator ab extrà he analyzes he dissects he watches    with an eye serene   the very pulse of the machine  for such it practically is to him with wheels and cogs and pistonrods all working to produce a certain end  this analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical and by giving him the patience to be minute enables him to throw a wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies a monomania he paints with great power he loves to dissect one of these cancers of the mind and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its roots in raising images of horror also he has a strange success conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible doubt which is the secret of all horror he leaves to imagination the task of finishing the picture a task to which only she is competent    for much imaginary work was there   conceit deceitful so compact so kind   that for achilles image stood his spear   grasped in an armed hand himself behind   was left unseen save to the eye of mind  beside the merit of conception mr poes writings have also that of form his style is highly finished graceful and truly classical it would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such varied powers as an example of his style we would refer to one of his tales the house of usher in the first volume of his tales of the grotesque and arabesque it has a singular charm for us and we think that no one could read it without being strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty had its author written nothing else it would alone have been enough to stamp him as a man of genius and the master of a classic style in this tale occurs perhaps the most beautiful of his poems  the great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the vague and the unreal as sources of effect they have not used dread and horror alone but only in combination with other qualities as means of subjugating the fancies of their readers the loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about her mr poes secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror in this his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of art not artifice we cannot call his materials the noblest or purest but we must concede to him the highest merit of construction  as a critic mr poe was aesthetically deficient unerring in his analysis of dictions metres and plots he seemed wanting in the faculty of perceiving the profounder ethics of art his criticisms are however distinguished for scientific precision and coherence of logic they have the exactness and at the same time the coldness of mathematical demonstrations yet they stand in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague generalisms and sharp personalities of the day if deficient in warmth they are also without the heat of partizanship they are especially valuable as illustrating the great truth too generally overlooked that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the critic  on the whole it may be considered certain that mr poe has attained an individual eminence in our literature which he will keep he has given proof of power and originality he has done that which could only be done once with success or safety and the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness     thackeray  roundabout papers   the shock which was felt in this country at the sudden death of thackeray was a new proof if any were wanting that london is still our social and literary capital not even the loss of irving called forth so universal and strong an expression of sorrow and yet it had been the fashion to call thackeray a cynic we must take leave to doubt whether diogenes himself much less any of his disciples would have been so tenderly regretted we think there was something more in all this than mere sentiment at the startling extinction of a great genius there was a universal feeling that we had lost something even rarer and bettera true man  thackeray was not a cynic for the simple reason that he was a humorist and could not have been one if he would your true cynic is a sceptic also he is distrustful by nature his laugh is a bark of selfish suspicion and he scorns man not because he has fallen below himself but because he can rise no higher but humor of the truest quality always rests on a foundation of belief in something better than it sees and its laugh is a sad one at the awkward contrast between man as he is and man as he might be between the real snob and the ideal image of his creator swift is our true english cynic with his corrosive sarcasm the satire of thackeray is the recoil of an exquisite sensibility from the harsh touch of life with all his seeming levity thackeray used to say with the warmest sincerity that carlyle was his master and teacher he had not merely a smiling contempt but a deadly hatred of all manner of shams an equally intense love for every kind of manliness and for gentlemanliness as its highest type he had an eye for pretension as fatally detective as an acid for an alkali wherever it fell so clear and seemingly harmless the weak spot was sure to betray itself he called himself a disciple of carlyle but would have been the first to laugh at the absurdity of making any comparison between the playful heatlightnings of his own satire and that lurid light as of the divine wrath over the burning cities of the plain that flares out on us from the profoundest humor of modern times beside that ingenium perfervidum of the scottish seer he was but a pallmall jeremiah after all  it is curious to see how often nature original and profuse as she is repeats herself how often instead of sending one complete mind like shakespeare she sends two who are the complements of each otherfielding and richardson goethe and schiller balzac and george sand and now again thackeray and dickens we are not fond of comparative criticism we mean of that kind which brings forward the merit of one man as if it depreciated the different merit of another nor of supercilious criticism which measures every talent by some ideal standard of possible excellence and if it fall short can find nothing to admire a thing is either good in itself or good for nothing yet there is such a thing as a contrast of differences between two eminent intellects by which we may perhaps arrive at a clearer perception of what is characteristic in each it is almost impossible indeed to avoid some sort of parallel à la plutarch between thackeray and dickens we do not intend to make out which is the greater for they may be equally great though utterly unlike but merely to touch on a few striking points thackeray in his more elaborate works always paints character and dickens single peculiarities thackerays personages are all men those of dickens personified oddities the one is an artist the other a caricaturist the one pathetic the other sentimental nothing is more instructive than the difference between the illustrations of their respective works thackerays figures are such as we meet about the streets while the artists who draw for dickens invariably fall into the exceptionally grotesque thackerays style is perfect that of dickens often painfully mannered nor is the contrast less remarkable in the quality of character which each selects thackeray looks at life from the clubhouse window dickens from the reporters box in the policecourt dickens is certainly one of the greatest comic writers that ever lived and has perhaps created more types of oddity than any other his faculty of observation is marvellous his variety inexhaustible thackerays round of character is very limited he repeated himself continually and as we think had pretty well emptied his stock of invention but his characters are masterpieces always governed by those average motives and acted upon by those average sentiments which all men have in common they never act like heroes and heroines but like men and women  thackerays style is beyond praiseso easy so limpid showing everywhere by unobtrusive allusions how rich he was in modern culture it has the highest charm of gentlemanly conversation and it was natural to himhis early works the great hoggarty diamond for example being as perfect as low in tone as the latest he was in all respects the most finished example we have of what is called a man of the world in the pardonable eulogies which were uttered in the fresh grief at his loss there was a tendency to set him too high he was even ranked above fieldinga position which no one would have been so eager in disclaiming as himself no let us leave the old fames on their pedestals fielding is the greatest creative artist who has written in english since shakespeare of a broader and deeper nature of a larger brain than thackeray his theme is man as that of the latter is society the englishman with whom thackeray had most in common was richard steele as these roundabout papers show plainly enough he admired fielding but he loved steele     two great authors     swift1  i

the grave of its famous dean and that of stella in death as in life near yet divided from him as if to make their memories more inseparable and prolong the insoluble problem of their relation to each other nor was there wanting when we made our pilgrimage thither a touch of grim humor in the thought that our tipsy guide clerk of the works he had dubbed himself for the nonce as he monotonously recited his contradictory anecdotes of the sullybrutted dane varied by times with an irrelative hiccough of his own was no inapt type of the ordinary biographers of swift the skill with which long practice had enabled our cicerone to turn these involuntary hitches of his discourse into rhetorical flourishes and wellnigh to make them seem a new kind of conjunction would have been invaluable to the deans old servant patrick but in that sad presence his grotesqueness was as shocking as the clown in one of shakespeares tragedies to châteaubriand a shilling sent him back to the neighboring pothouse whence a halfdozen ragged volunteers had summoned him and we were left to our musings one dominating thought shouldered aside all othersnamely how strange a stroke of irony it was how more subtle even than any of the masters own that our most poignant association with the least sentimental of men should be one of sentiment and that a romance second only to that of abélard and héloïse should invest the memory of him who had done more than all others together to strip life and human nature of their last instinctive decency of illusion his life or such accounts as we had of it had been full of antitheses as startling as if some malign enchanter had embodied one of macaulays characters as a conundrum to bewilder the historian himself a generous miser a sceptical believer a devout scoffer a tenderhearted misanthrope a churchman faithful to his order yet loathing to wear its uniform an irishman hating the irish as heine did the jews1 because he was one of them yet defending them with the scornful fierceness of one who hated their oppressors more a man honest and of statesmanlike mind who lent himself to the basest services of party politics for purely selfish ends a poet whose predominant faculty was that of disidealizing a master of vernacular style in whose works an irish editor finds hundreds of faults of english to correct strangest of all a middleaged clergyman of brutal coarseness who could inspire two young beautiful and clever women the one with a fruitless passion that broke her heart the other with a love that survived hope and faith to suck away the very sources of that life whereof it was the only pride and consolation no wonder that a new life of so problematic a personage as this should be awaited with eagerness the more that it was to be illustrated with much hitherto unpublished material and was to be written by the practised hand of mr forster inconsistency of conduct of professed opinion whether of things or men we can understand but an inconsistent character is something without example and which nature abhors as she does false logic opportunity may develop hindrance may dwarf the prevailing set of temptation may give a bent to character but the germ planted at birth can never be wholly disnatured by circumstance any more than soil or exposure can change an oak into a pine character is continuous it is cumulative whether for good or ill the general tenor of the life is a logical sequence from it and a man can always explain himself to himself if not to others as a coherent whole because he always knows or thinks he knows the value of x in the personal equation were it otherwise that sense of conscious identity which alone makes life a serious thing and immortality a rational hope would be impossible it is with the means of finding out this unknown quantityin other words of penetrating to the mans motives or his understanding of themthat the biographer undertakes to supply us and unless he succeed in this his rummaging of old papers but raises a new cloud of dust to darken our insight  footnote 1 lowell was mistaken heine never lost his love for the jews he regretted his apostasy and always regarded himself as a jew and not a christian his own genius was hebraic and not as matthew arnold thought hellenic it should be incidentally stated that lowell had great admiration for the jews the late dr weir mitchell once told me that lowell regretted that he was not a jew and even wished that he had a hebraic nose several documents attest to lowells ideas on the subject he even claimed that his middle name russell showed that he had jewish blood am  if mr forsters mind had not the penetrative illuminating quality of genius he was not without some very definite qualifications for his task the sturdy temper of his intellect fits him for a subject which is beset with pitfalls for the sentimentalizer a finer sense might recoil before investigations whose importance is not at first so clear as their promise of unsavoriness so far as mr forster has gone we think he has succeeded in the highest duty of a biographer that of making his subject interesting and humanly sympathetic to the readera feat surely of some difficulty with a professed cynic like swift he lets him in the main tell his own storya method not always trustworthy to be sure but safer in the case of one who whatever else he may have been was almost brutally sincere when he could be so with safety or advantage still it should always be borne in mind that he could lie with an air of honest candor fit to deceive the very elect the author of the battle of the books written in 1697 tells us in the preface to the third part of temples miscellanea 1701 that he cannot well inform the reader upon what occasion the essay upon ancient and modern learning was writ having been at that time in another kingdom and the professed confidant of a ministry whom the stuart papers have proved to have been in correspondence with the pretender puts on an air of innocence in his enquiry into the behavior of the queens last ministry and undertakes to convince us that nothing could be more absurd than to accuse them of jacobitism it may be as orrery asserted that swift was employed not trusted but this is hardly to be reconciled with lewiss warning him on the queens death to burn his papers or his own jest to harley about the one being beheaded and the other hanged the fact is that while in certain contingencies swift was as unscrupulous a liar as voltaire he was naturally open and truthful and showed himself to be so whenever his passions or his interest would let him that mr forster should make a hero of the man whose life he has undertaken to write is both natural and proper for without sympathy there can be no right understanding and a hearty admiration is alone capable of that generosity in the interpretation of conduct to which all men have a right and which he needs most who most widely transcends the ordinary standards or most resolutely breaks with traditionary rules that so virile a character as swift should have been attractive to women is not wonderful but we think mr forster has gone far towards proving that he was capable of winning the deep and lasting affection of men also perhaps it may not always be safe to trust implicitly the fine phrases of his correspondents for there can be no doubt that swift inspired fear as well as love revengefulness is the great and hateful blot on his character his brooding temper turned slights into injuries gave substance to mere suspicion and once in the morbid mood he was utterly reckless of the means of vengeance his most playful scratch had poison in it his eye was equally terrible for the weak point of friend and foe but giving this all the value it may deserve the weight of the evidence is in favor of his amiability the testimony of a man so sweetnatured and fairminded as dr delany ought to be conclusive and we do not wonder that mr forster should lay great stress upon it the depreciatory conclusions of dr johnson are doubtless entitled to consideration but his evidence is all from hearsay and there were properties in swift that aroused in him so hearty a moral repulsion as to disenable him for an unprejudiced opinion admirable as the roughandready conclusions of his robust understanding often are he was better fitted to reckon the quantity of a mans mind than the quality of itthe real test of its value and there is something almost comically pathetic in the good faith with which he applies his beermeasure to juices that could fairly plead their privilege to be gauged by the wine standard mr forsters partiality qualifies him for a fairer judgment of swift than any which johnson was capable of forming or indeed would have given himself the trouble to form  but this partiality in a biographer though to be allowed and even commended as a quickener of insight should not be strong enough to warp his mind from its judicial level while we think that mr forster is mainly right in his estimate of swifts character and altogether so in insisting on trying him by documentary rather than hearsay evidence it is equally true that he is sometimes betrayed into overestimates and into positive statement where favorable inference would have been wiser now and then his exaggeration is merely amusing as where he tells us that swift as early as in his first two years after quitting dublin was accomplished in french the only authority for such a statement being a letter of recommendation from temple saying that he had some french such compulsory testimonials are not on their voir dire any more than epitaphs so in speaking of betty jones with whom in 1689 swift had a flirtation that alarmed his mother mr forster assumes that she was an educated girl on the sole ground so far as appears of her mother and swifts being cousins swift to be sure thirty years later on receiving some letters from his old sweetheart suspects them to be counterfeit because she spells like a kitchenmaid and this perhaps may be mr forsters authority but as the letters were genuine the inference should have been the other way the letters to eliza by the way which swift in 1699 directs winder his successor at kilroot to burn were doubtless those addressed to betty jones mr forster does not notice this but that swift should have preserved them or copies of them is of some consequence as tending to show that they were mere exercises in composition thus confirming what he says in the remarkable letter to kendall written in 1692 when he was already off with the old love and on with a new  these instances of the temptation which most easily besets mr forster are trifles but the same leaning betrays him sometimes into graver mistakes of overestimate he calls swift the best letterwriter in the language though gray walpole cowper and lamb be in some essential qualities his superiors he praises his political writing so extravagantly that we should think he had not read the examiner were it not for the thoroughness of his work in other respects all that swift wrote in this kind was partisan excellently fitted to its immediate purpose as we might expect from his imperturbable good sense but by its very nature ephemeral there is none of that reach of historical imagination none of that grasp of the clue of fatal continuity and progression none of that eye for country which divines the future highways of events that makes the occasional pamphlets of burke with all their sobs of passionate sentiment permanent acquisitions of political thinking mr forster finds in swifts examiners all the characteristic qualities of his mind and style though we believe that a dispassionate reader would rather conclude that the author as we have little doubt was the fact was trying all along to conceal his personality under a disguise of decorous commonplace in the same uncritical way mr forster tells us that the ancients could show no such humor and satire as the tale of a tub and the battle of the books in spite of this we shall continue to think aristophanes and even lucian clever writers considering the rudeness of the times in which they lived the tale of a tub has several passages of roughandtumble satire as good as any of their kind and some hints of deeper suggestion but the fable is clumsy and the execution unequal and disjointed in conception the battle is cleverer and it contains perhaps the most perfect apologue in the language but the best strokes of satire in it are personal that of drydens helmet for instance and we enjoy them with an uneasy feeling that we are accessaries in something like foul play indeed it may be said of swifts humor generally that it leaves us uncomfortable and that it too often impregnates the memory with a savor of mortal corruption proof against all disinfectants pure humor cannot flow from so turbid a source as soeva indignatio and if man be so filthy and disgusting a creature as swift represents him to be if he be truly by nature reason learning blind satire is thrown away upon him for reform and cruel as castigation  mr forster not only rejects the story of stellas marriage with swift as lacking substantial evidence but thinks that the limits of their intercourse were early fixed and never overpassed according to him their relation was to be from the first one of affection not desire we on the other hand believe that she was the only woman swift ever loved constantly that he wished and meant to marry her that he probably did marry her1 but only when all hope of the old openhearted confidence was gone forever chiefly through his own fault if partly through her jealous misconception of his relation to vanessa and that it was the sense of his own weakness which admitted of no explanation tolerable to an injured woman and entailed upon a brief folly all the consequences of guilt that more than all else darkened his lonely decline with unavailing regrets and embittered it with remorseful selfcontempt nothing could be more galling to a proud man than the feeling that he had been betrayed by his vanity it is commonly assumed that pride is incompatible with its weaker congener but pride after all is nothing more than a stiffened and congealed vanity and melts back to its original ductility when exposed to the milder temperature of female partiality swift could not deny himself the flattery of vanessas passion and not to forbid was to encourage he could not bring himself to administer in time the only effectual remedy by telling her that he was pledged to another woman when at last he did tell her it was too late and he learned like so many before and since that the most dangerous of all fires to play with is that of love this was the extent of his crime and it would have been none if there had been no such previous impediment this alone gives any meaning to what he says when vanessa declared her love    cadenus felt within him rise   shame disappointment guilt surprise  footnote 1 most of the authorities conclude that swift never married stella am  shame there might have been but surely no guilt on any theory except that of an implicit engagement with stella that there was something of the kind more or less definite and that it was of some ten years standing when the affair with vanessa came to a crisis we have no doubt when tisdall offered her marriage in 1704 and swift wrote to him that if my fortunes and humor served me to think of that state i should certainly among all persons on earth make your choice she accepted the implied terms and rejected her suitor though otherwise not unacceptable to her she would wait it is true that swift had not absolutely committed himself but she had committed him by dismissing tisdall without assuming some such tacit understanding his letters to her are unintelligible he repeatedly alludes to his absence from her as only tolerable because it was for her sake no less than his own and the details of his petty economies would be merely vulgar except to her for whom their motive gave them a sweetness of humorous pathos the evidence of the marriage seems to be as conclusive as that of a secret can well be dr delany who ought to have been able to judge of its probability and who had no conceivable motive of misstatement was assured of it by one whose authority was stella herself mr monckberkeley had it from the widow of bishop berkeley and she from her husband who had it from dr ashe by whom they were married these are at least unimpeachable witnesses the date of the marriage is more doubtful but sheridan is probably not far wrong when he puts it in 1716 it was simply a reparation and no union was implied in it delany intimates that vanessa like the young chevalier vulgarized her romance in drink more than this however was needful to palliate even in swift the brutal allusion to her importunacy in gulliver unless as is but too possible the passage in question be an outbreak of ferocious spleen against her victorious rival its coarseness need not make this seem impossible for that was by no means a queasy age and swift continued on intimate terms with lady betty germaine after the publication of the nasty verses on her father the communication of the secret to bishop berkeley who was one of vanessas executors may have been the condition of the suppressing swifts correspondence with her and would have exasperated him to ferocity   ii   we cannot properly understand swifts cynicism and bring it into any relation of consistency with our belief in his natural amiability without taking his whole life into account few give themselves the trouble to study his beginnings and few therefore give weight enough to the fact that he made a false start he the ground of whose nature was an acrid commonsense whose eye magnified the canker till it effaced the rose began as what would now be called a romantic poet with no mastery of verse for even the english heroic a balancingpole which has enabled so many feebler men to walk the ticklish rope of momentary success was uneasy to him he essayed the cowleian pindarique as the adjective was then rightly spelled with a hint of parisian rather than theban origin if the master was but a fresh example of the disasters that wait upon every new trial of the flyingmachine what could be expected of the disciple who had not even the secret of the mechanic wings and who stuck solidly to the earth while with perfect good faith he went through all the motions of soaring swift was soon aware of the ludicrousness of his experiment though he never forgave cousin dryden for being aware of it also and the recoil in a nature so intense as his was sudden and violent he who could not be a poet if he would angrily resolved that he would not if he could fullsail verse was beyond his skill but he could manage the simpler foreandaft rig of butlers octosyllabics as cowleyism was a trick of seeing everything as it was not and calling everything something else than it was he would see things as they wereor as in his sullen disgust they seemed to beand call them all by their right names with a resentful emphasis he achieved the naked sincerity of a hottentotnay he even went beyond it in rejecting the feeble compromise of the breechclout not only would he be naked and not ashamed but everybody else should be so with a blush of conscious exposure and human nature should be stripped of the hypocritical figleaves that betrayed by attempting to hide its identity with the brutes that perish his sincerity was not unconscious but selfwilled and aggressive but it would be unjust to overlook that he began with himself he despised mankind because he found something despicable in jonathan swift as he makes gulliver hate the yahoos in proportion to their likeness with himself he had more or less consciously sacrificed selfrespect for that false consideration which is paid to a mans accidents he had preferred the vain pomp of being served on plate as no other man of his level in ireland was to being happy with the woman who had sacrificed herself to his selfishness and the independence he had won turned out to be only a morose solitude after all money he was fond of saying is freedom but he never learned that selfdenial is freedom with the addition of selfrespect with a hearty contempt for the ordinary objects of human ambition he could yet bring himself for the sake of them to be the obsequious courtier of three royal strumpets how should he be happy who had defined happiness to be the perpetual possession of being well deceived and who could never be deceived himself it may well be doubted whether what he himself calls that pretended philosophy which enters into the depth of things and then comes gravely back with informations and discoveries that in the inside they are good for nothing be of so penetrative an insight as it is apt to suppose and whether the truth be not rather that to the empty all things are empty swifts diseased eye had the microscopic quality of gullivers in brobdingnag and it was the loathsome obscenity which this revealed in the skin of things that tainted his imagination when it ventured on what was beneath but with all swifts scornful humor he never made the pitiful mistake of his shallow friend gay that life was a jest to his nobler temper it was always profoundly tragic and the salt of his sarcasm was more often we suspect than with most humorists distilled out of tears the lesson is worth remembering that his apples of sodom like those of lesser men were plucked from boughs of his own grafting  but there are palliations for him even if the world were not too ready to forgive a man everything if he will only be a genius sir robert walpole used to say that it was fortunate so few men could be prime ministers as it was best that few should thoroughly know the shocking wickedness of mankind swift from his peculiar relation to two successive ministries was in a position to know all that they knew and perhaps as a recognized placebroker even more than they knew of the selfish servility of men he had seen the men who figure so imposingly in the stageprocessions of history too nearly he knew the real jacks and toms as they were over a pot of ale after the scenic illusion was done with he saw the destinies of a kingdom controlled by men far less able than himself the highest of arts that of politics degraded to a trade in places and the noblest opportunity that of office abused for purposes of private gain his disenchantment began early probably in his intimacy with sir william temple in whom though he says that all that was good and great died with him he must have seen the weak side of solemn priggery and the pretension that made a mystery of statecraft in his twentysecond year he writes    off fly the vizards and discover all     how plain i see through the deceit     how shallow and how gross the cheat                                         on what poor engines move   the thoughts of monarchs and designs of states   what petty motives rule their fates        i to such blockheads set my wit       i damn such fools go go youre bit  mr forsters own style simpler now than when he was under the immediate influence of dickens if more slipshod than when repressed by landor is not in essentials better or worse than usual it is not always clear nor always idiomatic on page 120 he tells us that scott did not care to enquire if it was likely that stories of the kind referred to should have contributed to form a character or if it were not likelier still that they had grown and settled round a character already famous as well as formed not to speak of the confusion of moods and tenses the phrase to form a character has been so long appropriated to another meaning than that which it has here that the sense of the passage vacillates unpleasantly he tells us that swift was under engagement to will frankland to christen the baby his wife is near bringing to bed parthenogenesis is a simple matter to this and why will frankland joe beaumont and the like we cannot claim so much intimacy with them as swift and the eighteenth century might be allowed to stand a little on its dignity if mr forster had been quoting the journal to stella there would be nothing to say except that swift took liberties with his friends in writing to her which he would not have ventured on before strangers in the same odd jargon which the english journals are fond of calling american mr forster says that tom leigh was not popular with swift mr forster is not only no model for contemporary english but what is more serious sometimes mistakes the meaning of words in swifts day as when he explains that strongly engaged meant interceded with or pressed it meant much more than that as could easily be shown from the writings of swift himself  all the earlier biographers of swift mr forster brushes contemptuously aside though we do not find much that is important in his own biography which industry may not hit upon somewhere or other in the confused narrative of sheridan for whom and for his sources of information he shows a somewhat unjust contempt he goes so far as sometimes to discredit anecdotes so thoroughly characteristic of swift that he cannot resist copying them himself he labors at needless length the question of swifts standing in college and seems to prove that it was not contemptible though there can be no doubt that the contrary opinion was founded on swifts own assertion often repeated we say he seems to prove it for we are by no means satisfied which of the two swifts on the college list of which a facsimile is given is the future dean mr forster assumes that the names are ranked in the order of seniority but they are more likely to have been arranged alphabetically in which case jonathan would have preceded thomas and at best there is little to choose between three mediocriters and one male one bene and one negligenter the document whatever we may think of its importance has been brought to light by mr forster of his other materials hitherto unpublished the most important is a letter proving that swifts whig friends did their best to make him a bishop in 1707 this shows that his own later account of the reasons of his change from whig to tory if not absolutely untrue is at least unjust to his former associates and had been shaped to meet the charge of inconsistency if not of desertion to the enemy whatever the motives of his change it would have been impossible to convince a sincere whig of their honesty and in spite of mr forsters assertion that addison continued to love and trust him to the last we do not believe that there was any cordiality in their intercourse after 1710 no one familiar with swifts manner of thinking will deem his political course of much import in judging of his moral character at the bottom of his heart he had an impartial contempt for both parties and a firm persuasion that the aims of both were more or less consciously selfish even if sincere the matters at issue between them were as despicable to a sound judgment as that which divided the big and littleendians in lilliput with him the question was simply one between men who galled his pride and men who flattered it sunderland and somers treated him as a serviceable inferior harley and bolingbroke had the wit to receive him on a footing of friendship to him they were all more or less indifferently rounds in the ladder by which he hoped to climb he always claimed to have been a consistent old whigthat is as he understood it a highchurchman who accepted the revolution of 1688 this to be sure was not quite true but it could not have been hard for a man who prided himself on a cavalier grandfather and whose first known verses were addressed to the nonjuring primate sancroft after his deprivation to become first a tory and then a conniver at the restoration of the stuarts as the best device for preventing a foreign succession and an endless chance of civil war a man of swifts way of thinking would hardly have balked at the scruple of creed for he would not have deemed it possible that the pretender should have valued a kingdom at any lower rate than his greatgrandfather had done before him  the more important part of mr forsters fresh material is to come in future volumes if now alas we are ever to have them for some of what he gives us in this we can hardly thank him one of the manuscripts he has unearthed is the original version of baucis and philemon as it was before it had passed under the criticism of addison he seems to think it in some respects better than the revised copy though in our judgment it entirely justifies the wisdom of the critic who counselled its curtailment and correction the piece as we have hitherto had it comes as near poetry as anything swift ever wrote except cadenus and vanessa though neither of them aspires above the region of cleverness and fancy indeed it is misleading to talk of the poetry of one whose fatal gift was an eye that disidealized but we are not concerned here with the discussion of swifts claim to the title of poet what we are concerned about is to protest in the interests of good literature against the practice now too common of hunting out and printing what the author would doubtless have burned it is unfair to the dead writer and the living reader by disturbing that unitary impression which every good piece of work aims at making and is sure to make only in proportion to the authors selfdenial and his skill in    the last and greatest art the art to blot  we do not wish nor have we any right to know those passages through which the castigating pen has been drawn  mr forster may almost claim to have rediscovered swifts journals to esther johnson to such good purpose has he used them in giving life and light to his narrative he is certainly wrong however in saying to the disparagement of former editors that the name stella was not invented till long after all the letters were written this statement improbable in itself as respects a man who forthwith refined betty waring and vanhomrigh into eliza varina and vanessa is refuted by a passage in the journal of 14th october 1710 printed by mr forster himself at least we know not what stellakins means unless it be little stella the value of these journals for their elucidation of swifts character cannot be overestimated and mr forster is quite right in insisting upon the importance of the little language though we are by no means sure that he is always so in his interpretation of the cipher it is quite impossible for instance that me can stand for madam elderly and so for dingley it is certainly addressed like the other endearing epithets to esther johnson and may mean my esther or even marry esther for anything we know to the contrary  mr forster brings down his biography no farther than the early part of 1710 so that we have no means of judging what his opinion would be of the conduct of swift during the three years that preceded the death of queen anne but he has told us what he thinks of his relations with esther johnson and it is in them as it seems to us that we are to seek the key to the greater part of what looks most enigmatical in his conduct at first sight it seems altogether unworthy of a man of swifts genius to waste so much of it and so many of the best years of his life in a sordid struggle after preferment in the churcha career in which such selfish ambitions look most out of place how much better to have stayed quietly at laracor and written immortal works very good only that was not swifts way of looking at the matter who had little appetite for literary fame and all of whose immortal progeny were begotten of the moments overmastering impulse were thrown nameless upon the world by their father and survived only in virtue of the vigor they had drawn from his stalwart loins but how if swifts worldly aspirations and the intrigues they involved him in were not altogether selfish how if he was seeking advancement in part at least for another and that other a woman who had sacrificed for him not only her chances of domestic happiness but her good name to whom he was bound by gratitude and the hope of repairing whose good fame by making her his own was so passionate in that intense nature as to justify any and every expedient and make the patronage of those whom he felt to be his inferiors endurable by the proudest of men we believe that this was the truth and that the woman was stella no doubt there were other motives coming to manhood with a haughtiness of temper that was almost savage he had forced himself to endure the hourly humiliation of what could not have been however mr forster may argue to the contrary much above domestic servitude this experience deepened in him the prevailing passions of his life first for independence and next for consideration the only ones which could and in the end perhaps did obscure the memory and hope of stella that he should have longed for london with a persistency that submitted to many a rebuff and overlived continual disappointment will seem childish only to those who do not consider that it was a longing for life it was there only that his mind could be quickened by the society and spur of equals in dublin he felt it dying daily of the inanition of inferior company his was not a nature if there be any such that could endure the solitude of supremacy without impair and he foreboded with reason a tiberian old age  this certainly is not the ordinary temper of a youth on whom the world is just opening in a letter to pope written in 1725 he says i desire that you and all my friends will take a special care that my disaffection to the world may not be imputed to my age for i have credible witnesses ready to depose that it hath never varied from the twentyfirst to the fiftyeighth year of my age his contempt for mankind would not be lessened by his knowledge of the lying subterfuges by which the greatest poet of his age sought at once to gratify and conceal his own vanity nor by listening to the professions of its cleverest statesman that he liked planting cabbages better than being prime minister how he must have laughed at the unconscious parody when his old printer barber wrote to him in the same strain of philosophic relief from the burthensome glories of lordmayoralty  nay he made another false start and an irreparable one in prose also with the tale of a tub its levity if it was not something worse twice balked him of the mitre when it seemed just within his reach justly or not he had the reputation of scepticism mr forster would have us believe him devout but the evidence goes no further than to prove him ceremonially decorous certain it is that his most intimate friends except arbuthnot were freethinkers and wrote to him sometimes in a tone that was at least odd in addressing a clergyman probably the feeling that he had made a mistake in choosing a profession which was incompatible with success in politics and with perfect independence of mind soured him even more than his disappointed hopes he saw addison a secretary of state and prior an ambassador while he was bubbled as he would have put it with a shabby deanery among savages perhaps it was not altogether his clerical character that stood in his way a mans little faults are more often the cause of his greatest miscarriages than he is able to conceive and in whatever respects his two friends might have been his inferiors they certainly had the advantage of him in that savoir vivre which makes so large an element of worldly success in judging him however we must take into account that his first literary hit was made when he was already thirtyseven with a confirmed bias towards moody suspicion of others and distrust of himself  the reaction in swifts temper and ambition told with the happiest effect on his prose for its own purposes as good working english his style if that may be called so whose chief success was that it had no style at all has never been matched it has been more praised than studied or its manifest shortcomings its occasional clumsiness its want of harmony and of feeling for the finer genialities of language would be more often present in the consciousness of those who discourse about it from a superficial acquaintance with him language was a means and not an end if he was plain and even coarse it was from choice rather than because he lacked delicacy of perception for in badinage the most ticklish use to which words can be put he was a master     plutarchs morals1   footnote 1 a review of the english translation edited by william w goodwin with an introduction by ralph waldo emerson  plutarch is perhaps the most eminent example of how strong a hold simple good humor and good sense lay upon the affections of mankind not a man of genius or heroism himself his many points of sympathy with both make him an admirable conductor of them in that less condensed form which is more wholesome and acceptable to the average mind of no man can it be more truly said that if not a rose himself he had lived all his days in the roses neighborhood such is the delightful equableness of his temperament and his singular talent for reminiscence so far is he always from undue heat while still susceptible of so much enthusiasm as shall not disturb digestion that he might seem to have been born middleaged few men have so amicably combined the love of a good dinner and of the higher morality he seems to have comfortably solved the problem of having your cake and eating it at which the ascetic interpreters of christianity teach us to despair he serves us up his worldly wisdom in a sauce of plato and gives a kind of sensuous relish to the disembodied satisfactions of immortality he is a better christian than many an orthodox divine if he do not like sir thomas browne love to lose himself in an o altitudo yet the skypiercing peaks and snowy solitudes of ethical speculation loom always on the horizon about the sheltered dwelling of his mind and he continually gets up from his books to rest and refresh his eyes upon them he seldom invites us to alpineclimbing and when he does it is to some warm nook like the jardin on mont blanc a parenthesis of homely summer nestled amid the sublime nakedness of snow if he glance upward at becoming intervals to the primal duties he turns back with a settled predilection to the sympathies that are nestled at the feet like flowers but it is within his villa that we love to be admitted to him and to enjoy that garrulity which we forgive more readily in the mother of the muses than in any of her daughters unless it be clio who is most like her if we are in the library he is reminded of this or that passage in a favorite author and going to the shelves takes down the volume to read it aloud with decorous emphasis if we are in the atrium where we like him best he has an anecdote to tell of all the great greeks and romans whose busts or statues are ranged about us and who for the first time soften from their marble alienation and become human it is this that makes him so amiable a moralist and brings his lessons home to us he does not preach up any remote and inaccessible virtue but makes all his lessons of magnanimity selfdevotion patriotism seem neighborly and practicable to us by an example which associates them with our common humanity his higher teaching is theosophy with no taint of theology he is a pagan tillotson disencumbered of the archiepiscopal robes a practical christian unbewildered with doctrinal punctilios this is evidently what commended him as a philosopher to montaigne as may be inferred from some hints which follow immediately upon the comparison between seneca and plutarch in the essay on physiognomy after speaking of some escripts encores plus révérez he asks in his idiomatic way à quoy faire nous allons nous gendarmant par ces efforts de la science more than this however montaigne liked him because he was good talk as it is called a better companion than writer yet he is not without passages which are noble in point of mere style landor remarks this in the conversation between johnson and tooke where he makes tooke say although his style is not valued by the critics i could inform them that there are in plutarch many passages of exquisite beauty in regard to style derived perhaps from authors much more ancient but if they are borrowed they have none of the discordant effect of the purpureus pannus for the warm sympathy of his nature assimilates them thoroughly and makes them his own oddly enough it is through his memory that plutarch is truly original who ever remembered so much and yet so well it is this selectness without being overfastidious that gauges the natural elevation of his mind he is a gossip but he has supped with plato or sat with alexander in his tent to bring away only memorable things we are speaking of him of course at his best many of his essays are trivial but there is hardly one whose sands do not glitter here and there with the proof that the stream of his thought and experience has flowed down through auriferous soil we sail on his memory into the ports of every nation says mr emerson admirably in his introduction to goodwins plutarchs morals no doubt we are becalmed pretty often and yet our old skipper almost reconciles us with our dreary isolation so well can he beguile the time when he chooses with anecdote and quotation  it would hardly be extravagant to say that this delightful old proser in whom his native boeotia is only too apparent at times and whose mind in some respects was strictly provincial had been more operative if we take the lives and the morals together in the thought and action of men than any other single author ancient or modern and on the whole it must be allowed that his influence has been altogether good has insensibly enlarged and humanized his readers winning them over to benevolence moderation and magnanimity and so wide was his own curiosity that they must be few who shall not find somewhat to their purpose in his discursive pages for he was equally at home among men and ideas openeared to the one and openminded to the other his influence too it must be remembered begins earlier than that of any other ancient author except aesop to boys he has always been the robinson crusoe of classic antiquity making what had hitherto seemed a remote island sequestered from them by a trackless flood of years living and real those obscure solitudes which their imagination had peopled with spectral equestrian statues are rescued by the sound of his cheery voice as part of the familiar and daylight world we suspect that agesilaus on his hobbyhorse first humanized antiquity for most of us here was the human footprint which persuaded us that the past was inhabited by creatures like ourselves     a plea for freedom from speech and figures of speechmakers     a plea for freedom from speech and figures of speechmakers   i must beg allowance to use the first person singular i cannot like old weller spell myself with a we ours is i believe the only language that has shown so much sense of the worth of the individual

letter it is in it every reader sees himself as in a glass as for me without my is i should be as poorly off as the great mole of hadrian which being the biggest must be also by parity of reason the blindest in the world when i was in college i confess i always liked those passages best in the choruses of the greek drama which were well sprinkled with ai ai they were so grandly simple the force of great men is generally to be found in their intense individualityin other words it is all in their i the merit of this essay will be similar  what i was going to say is this  my mind has been much exercised of late on the subject of two epidemics which showing themselves formerly in a few sporadic cases have begun to set in with the violence of the cattledisease i mean eloquence and statuary they threaten to render the country unfit for human habitation except by the deaf and blind we had hitherto got on very well in chesumpscot having caught a trick of silence perhaps from the fish which we cured more medicorum by laying them out but this summer some misguided young men among us got up a lectureassociation of course it led to a general quarrel for every pastor in the town wished to have the censorship of the list of lecturers a certain number of the original projectors however took the matter wholly into their own hands raised a subscription to pay expenses and resolved to call their lectures the universal brotherhood coursefor no other reason that i can divine but that they had set the whole village by the ears they invited that distinguished young apostle of reform mr philip vandal to deliver the opening lecture he has just done so and from what i have heard about his discourse it would have been fitter as the introductory to a nunnery of kilkenny cats than to anything like universal brotherhood he opened our lyceum as if it had been an oyster without any regard for the feelings of those inside he pitched into the world in general and all his neighbors past and present in particular even the babe unborn did not escape some unsavory epithets in the way of vaticination i sat down meaning to write you an essay on the right of private judgment as distinguished from the right of public vituperation but i forbear it may be that i do not understand the nature of philanthropy  why here is philip vandal for example he loves his kind so much that he has not a word softer than a brickbat for a single mothers son of them he goes about to save them by proving that not one of them is worth damning and he does it all from the point of view of an early a knurly christian let me illustrate i was sauntering along broadway once and was attracted by a birdfanciers shop i like dealers in outoftheway thingstraders in bigotry and virtue are too commonand so i went in the gem of the collection was a terriera perfect beauty uglier than philanthropy itself and hairier as a cockney would say than the ole british hairystocracy ant he a stunner said my disrespectable friend the master of the shop ah you should see him worry a rat he does it like a puffic christian since then the world has been divided for me into christians and perfect christians and i find so many of the latter species in proportion to the former that i begin to pity the rats they the rats have at least one virtuethey are not eloquent  it is i think a universally recognized truth of natural history that a young lady is sure to fall in love with a young man for whom she feels at first an unconquerable aversion and it must be on the same principle that the first symptoms of love for our neighbor almost always manifest themselves in a violent disgust at the world in general on the part of the apostles of that gospel they give every token of hating their neighbors consumedly argal they are going to be madly enamored of them or perhaps this is the manner in which universal brotherhood shows itself in people who wilfully subject themselves to infection as a prophylactic in the natural way we might find the disease inconvenient and even expensive but thus vaccinated with virus from the udders whatever they may be that yield the buttermilk of human kindness the inconvenience is slight and we are able still to go about our ordinary business of detesting our brethren as usual it only shows that the milder type of the disease has penetrated the system which will thus be enabled to outjenneral its more dangerous congener before long we shall have physicians of our ailing social system writing to the weekly brandreths pill somewhat on this wisei have a very marked and hopeful case in pequawgus four corners miss hepzibah tarbell daughter of that archenemy of his kind deacon joash t attended only one of my lectures in a day or two the

eudoxy trithemia of the variation of the magnetic needle if ever hopes of seeing a perfect case of primitive christian were wellfounded i think we may entertain them now  what i chiefly object to in the generaldenunciation sort of reformers is that they make no allowance for character and temperament they wish to repeal universal laws and to patch our natural skins for us as if they always wanted mending that while they talk so much of the godlike nature of man they should so forget the human natures of men the flathead indian squeezes the childs skull between two boards till it shapes itself into a kind of gambrel roof against the rainthe readiest way perhaps of uniforming a tribe that wear no clothes but does he alter the inside of the head not a hairsbreadth you remember the striking old gnomic poem that tells how aaron in a moment of fanatical zeal against that member by which mankind are so readily led into mischief proposes a rhinotomic sacrifice to moses what is the answer of

sphere of the croakers at a single hop why it is all he steers by without it he would be as helpless as a compass under the flare of northern lights and he no doubt regards it as a mark of blood the proof of his kinship with the preadamite family of the saurians shall we send missionaries to the bear to warn him against raw chestnuts because they are sometimes so discomforting to our human intestines which are so like his own one sermon from the colic were worth the whole american board  moreover as an author i protest in the name of universal grub street against a unanimity in goodness not to mention that a quaker world all faded out to an autumnal drab would be a little tediouswhat should we do for the villain of our tragedy or novel no rascals no literature you have your choice were we weak enough to consent to a sudden homogeneousness in virtue many industrious persons would be thrown out of employment the wife and mother for example with as indeterminate a number of children as the martyr rogers who visits me monthlywhat claim would she have upon me were not her husband forever taking to drink or the penitentiary or spiritualism the pusillanimous lapse of her lord into morality would not only take the very ground of her invention from under her feet but would rob her and him of an income that sustains them both in blissful independence of the curse of adam but do not let us be disheartened nature is strong she is persistent she completes her syllogism after we have long been feeding the roots of her grasses and has her own way in spite of us some ancestral cromwellian trooper leaps to life again in nathaniel greene and makes a general of him to confute five generations of broadbrims the puritans were good in their way and we enjoy them highly as a preterite phenomenon but they were not good at cakes and ale and that is one reason why they are a preterite phenomenon  i suppose we are all willing to let a public censor like pv run amuck whenever he likesso it be not down our street i confess to a good deal of tolerance in this respect and when i live in no 21 have plenty of stoicism to spare for the griefs of the dwellers in no 23 indeed i agreed with our young cato heartily in what he said about statues we must have an act for the suppression either of great men or else of sculptors i have not quite made up my mind which are the greater nuisances but i am sure of this that there are too many of both they used to be rare to use a yankeeism omitted by bartlett but nowadays they are overdone i am half inclined to think that the sculptors club together to write folks up during their lives in the newspapers quieting their consciences with the hope of some day making them look so mean in bronze or marble as to make all square again or do we really have so many cant they help growing twelve feet high in this new soil any more than our maize i suspect that posterity will not thank us for the hereditary disease of carrara we are entailing on him and will try some heroic remedy perhaps lithotripsy  nor was i troubled by what mr vandal said about the late benjamin webster i am not a boston man and have therefore the privilege of thinking for myself nor do i object to his claiming for women the right to make books and pictures and shall i say it statuesonly this last becomes a grave matter if we are to have statues of all the great women too to be sure there will not be the trousersdifficultyat least not at present what we may come to is none of my affair i even go beyond him in my opinions on what is called the woman question in the gift of speech they have always had the advantage of us and though the jealousy of the other sex have deprived us of the orations of xantippe yet even demosthenes does not seem to have produced greater effects if we may take the word of socrates for itas i for one very gladly do  nowhat i complain of is not the lecturers opinions but the eloquence with which he expressed them he does not like statues better than i do but is it possible that he fails to see that the one nuisance leads directly to the other and that we set up three images of talkers for one to any kind of man who was useful in his generation let him beware or he will himself be petrified after death boston seems to be specially unfortunate she has more statues and more speakers than any other city on this continent i have with my own eyes seen a book called the hundred boston orators this would seem to give her a fairer title to be called the tire than the hub of creation what with the speeches of her great men while they are alive and those of her surviving great men about those aforesaid after they are dead and those we look forward to from her ditto ditto yet to be upon her ditto ditto now in being and those of her paulopost ditto ditto upon her ditto ditto yet to be and thosebut i am getting into the house that jack built  and yet i remember once visiting the massachusetts state house and being struck with the pythagorean fish hung on high in the representatives chamber the emblem of a silence too sacred as would seem to be observed except on sundays eloquent philip vandal i appeal to you as a man and a brother let us two form not an antediluvian for there are plenty but an antidiluvian society against the flood of milkandwater that threatens the land let us adopt as our creed these two propositions  i tongues were given us to be held  ii dumbness sets the brute below the man silence elevates the man above the brute  every one of those hundred orators is to me a more fearful thought than that of a hundred men gathering samphire and when we take into account how large a portion of them if the present mania hold are likely to be commemorated in stone or some even more durable material the conception is positively stunning  let us settle all scores by subscribing to a colossal statue of the late town crier in bellmetal with the inscription vox et praeterea nihil as a comprehensive tribute to oratorical powers in general he at least never betrayed his clients as it is there is no end to it we are to set up horatius vir in effigy for inventing the normal schoolmaster and by and by we shall be called on to do the same illturn for elihu mulciber for getting uselessly learned as if any man had ideas enough for twenty languages without any schoolmaster at all we are the victims of a droll antithesis daniel would not give in to nebuchadnezzars taste in statuary and we are called on to fall down and worship an image of daniel which the assyrian monarch would have gone to grass again sooner than have it in his backparlor i do not think lions are agreeable especially the shavedpoodle variety one is so apt to encounteri met one once at an evening party but i would be thrown into a den of them rather than sleep in the same room with that statue posterity will think we cut pretty figures indeed in the monumental line perhaps there is a gleam of hope and a symptom of convalescence in the fact that the prince of wales during his late visit got off without a single speech the cheerful hospitalities of mount auburn were offered to him as to all distinguished strangers but nothing more melancholy in his case i doubt the expediency of the omission had we set a score or two of orators on him and his suite it would have given them a more intimidating notion of the offensive powers of the country than west point and all the navy yards put together  in the name of our common humanity consider too what shifts our friends in the sculpin line as we should call them in chesumpscot are put to for originality of design and what the country has to pay for it the clark mills that turns out equestrian statues as the stark mills do calicopatterns has pocketed fifty thousand dollars for making a very dead bronze horse stand on his hind legs for twentyfive cents i have seen a man at the circus do something more wonderfulmake a very living bay horse dance a redowa round the amphitheatre on his it occurs to me that hind legs is indelicate posterior extremities to the wayward music of an outoftown scoticè outotoon band now i will make a handsome offer to the public i propose for twentyfive thousand dollars to suppress my design for an equestrian statue of a distinguished general officer as he would have appeared at the battle of buena vista this monument is intended as a weathercock to crown the new dome of the capitol at washington by this happy contrivance the horse will be freed from the degrading necessity of touching the earth at allthus distancing mr mills by two feet in the race for originality the pivot is to be placed so far behind the middle of the horse that the statue like its original will always indicate which way the wind blows by going along with it the inferior animal i have resolved to model from a spirited sawhorse in my own collection in this way i shall combine two striking advantages the advocates of the ideal in art cannot fail to be pleased with a charger which embodies as it were merely the abstract notion or quality horse and the attention of the spectator will not be distracted from the principal figure the material to be pure brass i have also in progress an allegorical group commemorative of governor wise this likewise represents only a potentiality i have chosen as worthy of commemoration the moment when and the method by which the governor meant to seize the treasury at washington his excellency is modelled in the act of making one of his speeches before him a despairing reporter kills himself by falling on his own steel pen a broken telegraph wire hints at the weight of the thoughts to which it has found itself inadequate while the army and navy of the united states are conjointly typified in a horsemarine who flies headlong with his hands pressed convulsively over his ears i think i shall be able to have this ready for exhibition by the time mr wise is nominated for the presidencycertainly before he is elected the material to be plaster made of the shells of those oysters with which virginia shall have paid her public debt it may be objected that plaster is not durable enough for verisimilitude since bronze itself could hardly be expected to outlast one of the governors speeches but it must be remembered that his mere effigy cannot like its prototype have the pleasure of hearing itself talk so that to the mind of the spectator the oratorical despotism is tempered with some reasonable hope of silence this design also is intended only in terrorem and will be suppressed for an adequate consideration  i find one comfort however in the very hideousness of our statues the fear of what the sculptors will do for them after they are gone may deter those who are careful of their memories from talking themselves into greatness it is plain that mr caleb cushing has begun to feel a wholesome dread of this posthumous retribution i cannot in any other way account for that nightmare of the solitary horseman on the edge of the horizon in his hartford speech his imagination is infected with the terrible consciousness that mr mills as the younger man will in the course of nature survive him and will be left loose to seek new victims of his nefarious designs formerly the punishment of the wooden horse was a degradation inflicted on private soldiers only but mr mills whose genius could make even pegasus look wooden in whatever material flies at higher game and will be content with nothing short of a general  mr cushing advises extreme measures he counsels us to sell our real estate and stocks and to leave a country where no mans reputation with posterity is safe being merely as clay in the hands of the sculptor to a mind undisturbed by the terror natural in one whose military reputation insures his cutting and running i mean of course in marble and bronze the question becomes an interesting oneto whom in case of a general exodus shall we sell the statues will have the land all to themselvesuntil the aztecs perhaps repeopling their ancient heritage shall pay divine honors to these images whose ugliness will revive the traditions of the classic period of mexican art for my own part i never look at one of them now without thinking of at least one human sacrifice  i doubt the feasibility of mr cushings proposal and yet something ought to be done we must put up with what we have already i suppose and let mr webster stand threatening to blow us all up with his pistol pointed at the elongated keg of gunpowder on which his left hand restsno bad type of the great mans state of mind after the nomination of general taylor or of what a country member would call a penal statue but do we reflect that vermont is half marble and that lake superior can send us bronze enough for regiments of statues i go back to my first plan of a prohibitory enactment i had even gone so far as to make a rough draught of an act for the better observance of the second commandment but it occurred to me that convictions under it would be doubtful from the difficulty of satisfying a jury that our graven images did really present a likeness to any of the objects enumerated in the divine ordinance perhaps a doublebarrelled statute might be contrived that would meet both the oratorical and the monumental difficulty let a law be passed that all speeches delivered more for the benefit of the orator than that of the audience and all eulogistic ones of whatever description be pronounced in the chapel of the deaf and dumb asylum and all statues be set up within the grounds of the institution for the blind let the penalty for infringement in the one case be to read the last presidents message and in the other to look at the webster statue one hour a day for a term not so long as to violate the spirit of the law forbidding cruel and unusual punishments  perhaps it is too much to expect of our legislators that they should pass so selfdenying an ordinance they might perhaps make all oratory but their own penal and then who knows the reports of their debates might be read by the few unhappy persons who were demoniacally possessed by a passion for that kind of thing as girls are sometimes said to be by an appetite for slate pencils vita brevis lingua longa i protest that among lawgivers i respect numa who declared that of all the camenae tacita was most worthy of reverence the ancient greeks also though they left too much oratory behind them had some good notions especially if we consider that they had not like modern europe the advantage of communication with america now the greeks had a muse of beginning and the wonder is considering how easy it is to talk and how hard to say anything that they did not hit upon that other and more excellent muse of leavingoff the spartans i suspect found her out and kept her selfishly to themselves she were indeed a goddess to be worshipped a true sister of charity among that loquacious sisterhood  endlessness is the order of the day i ask you to compare plutarchs lives of demigods and heroes with our modern biographies of deminoughts and zeroes those will appear but tailors and ninthparts of men in comparison with these every one of whom would seem to have had nine lives like a cat to justify such prolixity yet the evils of print are as dust in the balance to those of speech  we were doing very well in chesumpscot but the lyceum has ruined all there are now two debating clubs seminaries of multiloquence a few of us oldfashioned fellows have got up an opposition club and called it the jolly oysters no member is allowed to open his mouth except at hightide by the calendar we have biennial festivals on the evening of election day when the constituency avenges itself in some small measure on its representative elect by sending a bakers dozen of orators to congratulate him  but i am falling into the very vice i condemnlike carlyle who has talked a quarter of a century in praise of holding your tongue and yet something should be done about it even when we get one orator safely underground there are ten to pronounce his eulogy and twenty to do it over again when the meeting is held about the inevitable statue i go to listen we all go we are under a spell t is true i find a casual refuge in sleep for drummond of hawthornden was wrong when he called sleep the child of silence speech begets her as often but there is no sure refuge save in death and when my life is closed untimely let there be written on my headstone with impartial application to these black brunswickers mounted on the high horse of oratory and to our equestrian statues    os sublime did it   the end
