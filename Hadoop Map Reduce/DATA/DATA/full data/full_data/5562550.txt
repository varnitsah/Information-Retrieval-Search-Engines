shall not try to be quite so extraordinarily clever           84    when he reached my face he looked searchingly at it             88    the tailor shrugged his shoulders                               98    something in the quiet dignity of the young man held me        114    the parisian dog                                               120    personally i plead guilty to something of the same  spirit     142    the ladys face is aglow with moral enthusiasm                 146    meanwhile he had become a quaintlooking elderly man           166    with all the low cunning of an author stamped on his features  174     behind the beyond  a modern problem play     act ibehind the beyond   the curtain rises disclosing the ushers of the theater still moving up and down the aisles cries of program program are heard there is a buzz of brilliant conversation illuminated with flashes of opera glasses and the rattle of expensive jewelry  then suddenly almost unexpectedly in fact just as if done so to speak by machinery the lights all over the theater except on the stage are extinguished absolute silence falls here and there is heard the crackle of a shirt front but there is no other sound  in this expectant hush a man in a check tweed suit walks on the stage only one man one single man because if he had been accompanied by a chorus that would have been a burlesque if four citizens in togas had been with him that would have been shakespeare if two russian soldiers had walked after him that would have been melodrama but this is none of these this is a problem play so he steps in alone all alone and with that absolute finish of step that ability to walk as ifhow can one express itas if he were walking that betrays the finished actor  he has in fact barely had time to lay down his silk hat when he is completely betrayed you can see that he is a finished actorfinished about fifteen years ago he lays the hat hollow side up on the silk hat table on the stage right centerbearing north northeast half a point west from the red mica fire on the stage which warms the theater  all this is done very very quietly very impressively no one in the theater has ever seen a man lay a silk hat on a table before and so there is a breathless hush then he takes off his gloves one by one not two or three at a time and lays them in his hat the expectancy is almost painful if he had thrown his gloves into the mica fire it would have been a relief but he doesnt  illustration the curtain rises  the man on the stage picks up a pile of letters from the letter department of the hat table there are a great many of these letters because all his business correspondence as well as his private letters are sent here by the general post office getting his letters in this way at night he is able to read them like lightning some of them he merely holds upside down for a fraction of a second  then at last he speaks it has become absolutely necessary or he wouldnt do it sosao paolo risen twohumrio tinto down againmoreby anxious better sell for half a million sterlinghum     did you hear that half a million sterling and he takes it just as quietly as that and it isnt really in the play either sao paolo and rio tinto just come in to let you know the sort of man youre dealing with  lady gathornedinnerthursday the ninthlunch with the ambassadorfriday the tenth  and mind you even this is just patter the ambassador doesnt come into the play either he and lady gathorne are just put in to let the people in the cheaper seats know the kind of thing theyre up against  then the man steps across the stage and presses a button a bell rings even before it has finished ringing nay just before it begins to ring a cardboard door swings aside and a valet enters you can tell he is a valet because he is dressed in the usual home dress of a stage valet  he says did you ring sir john  there is a rustle of programs all over the house you can hear a buzz of voices say hes sir john trevor theyre all on to him  when the valet says did you ring sir john he ought to answer no i merely knocked the bell over to see how it would sound but he misses it and doesnt say it  has her ladyship come home  yes sir john  has any one been here  mr harding sir john  any one else  no sir john  very good  the valet bows and goes out of the cardboard door and everybody in the theater or at least everybody in the seats worth over a dollar knows that theres something strange in the relations of lady cicely trevor and mr harding you noticemr harding was there and no one else was there thats enough in a problem play  the double door at the back of the stage used only by the principal characters is opened and lady cicely trevor enters she is young and very beautiful and wears a droopy hat and long slinky clothes which she drags across the stage she throws down her feather hat and her crêpe de whatyoucallit boa on the boa stand later on the valet comes in and gathers them up he is always gathering up things like this on the stagehats and boas and walking sticks thrown away by the actorsbut nobody notices him they are his perquisites  sir john says to lady cicely shall i ring for tea  and lady cicely says thanks no in a weary tone  this shows that they are the kind of people who can have tea at any time all through a problem play it is understood that any of the characters may ring for tea and get it tea in a problem play is the same as whisky in a melodrama  then there ensues a dialogue to this effect sir john asks lady cicely if she has been out he might almost have guessed it from her coming in in a hat and cloak but sir john is an english baronet  lady cicely says yes the usual round and distributes a few details about duchesses and princesses for the general good of the audience  then lady cicely says to sir john you are going out  yes immediately  to the house i suppose  this is very impressive it doesnt mean as you might think the workhouse or the white house or the station house or the bon marché it is the name given by people of lady cicelys class to the house of commons  yes i am extremely sorry i had hoped i might ask to go with you to the opera i fear it is impossiblean important sittingthe ministers will bring down the papersthe kafoonistan business the house will probably divide in committee gatherson will ask a question we must stop it at all costs the fate of the party hangs on it  sir john has risen his manner has changed his look is altered you can see him alter it it is now that of a statesman the technical details given above have gone to his head he cant stop  he goes on they will force a closure on the second reading go into committee come out of it again redivide subdivide and force us to bring down the estimates  while sir john speaks lady cicelys manner has been that of utter weariness she has picked up the london times and thrown it aside taken up a copy of punch and let it fall with a thud to the floor looked idly at a piece of music and decided evidently not to sing it sir john runs out of technical terms and stops  the dialogue has clearly brought out the following points sir john is in the house of commons lady cicely is not sir john is twentyfive years older than lady cicely he doesnt seeisnt he a fool when everybody in the gallery can see itthat his parliamentary work is meaningless to her that her life is insufficient thats it lady cicely is being starved all that she has is money position clothes and jewelry these things starve any woman they cramp her thats what makes problem plays  lady cicely speaks very quietly are you taking mr harding with you  why  nothing i thought perhaps i might ask him to take me to the opera puffi is to sing  do pray do take harding with you by all means poor boy do take him with you  sir john pauses he looks at lady cicely very quietly for a moment he goes on with a slight change in his voice  do you know cicely ive been rather troubled about harding lately theres something the matter with the boy something wrong  yes  he seems abstracted moodyi think in fact im sure that the boy is in love  yes  lady cicely has turned slightly pale the weariness is out of her manner  trust the instinct of an old man my dear theres a woman in it we old parliamentary hands are very shrewd you know even in these things some one is playing the devil with jackwith harding  sir john is now putting on his gloves again and gathering up his parliamentary papers from the parliamentary paper stand on the left  he cannot see the change in lady cicelys face he is not meant to see it but even the little girls in the tenth row of the gallery are wise  he goes on talk to harding get it out of him you women can do these things find out what the trouble is and let me know i must help him a pause sir john is speaking almost to himselfand the gallery i promised his mother when she sent him home sent him to england that i would  lady cicely speaks you knew mr hardings mother very well  sir john very well  that was long ago wasnt it  long ago  was she married then  no not then  here in london  yes in london i was only a barrister then with my way to make and she a famous beauty sir john is speaking with a forced levity that doesnt deceive even the ushers she married harding of the guards they went to india and there he spent her fortuneand broke her heart sir john sighs  you have seen her since  never  she has never written you  only once she sent her boy home and wrote to me for help that was how i took him as my secretary  and that was why he came to us in italy two years ago just after our marriage  yes that was why  does mr harding know  know what  that youknew his mother  sir john shakes his head i have never talked with him about his mothers early life  the stage clock on the mantelpiece begins to strike sir john lets it strike up to four or five and then says there eight oclock i must go i shall be late at the house goodby  he moves over to lady cicely and kisses her there is softness in his mannersuch softness that he forgets the bundle of parliamentary papers that he had laid down everybody can see that he has forgotten them they were right there under his very eye  sir john goes out  lady cicely stands looking fixedly at the fire she speaks out loud to herself how his voice changedtwentyfive years agoso long as thati wonder if jack knows  there is heard the ring of a bell off the stage the valet enters  mr harding is downstairs my lady  show him up ransome  a moment later mr harding enters he is a narrow young man in a frock coat his face is weak it has to be mr harding is meant to typify weakness lady cicely walks straight to him she puts her two hands on his shoulders and looks right into his face  my darling she says just like that in capital letters you can feel the thrill of it run through the orchestra chairs all the audience look at mr harding some with opera glasses others with eyeglasses on sticks they can see that he is just the sort of ineffectual young man that a starved woman in a problem play goes mad over  lady cicely repeats my darling several times mr harding says hush and tries to disengage himself she wont let him he offers to ring for tea she wont have any oh jack she says i cant go on any longer i cant when first you loved me i thought i could but i cant it throttles me herethis house this life everything she has drawn him to a sofa and has sunk down in a wave at his feet do you remember jack when first you came in italy that night at amalfi when we sat on the piazza of the palazzo she is looking rapturously into his face  mr harding says that he does  and that day at fiesole among the orange trees and pisa and the capello de terisa and the mona lisaoh jack take me away from all this take me to the riviera among the contadini where we can stand together with my head on your shoulder just as we did in the duomo at milano or on the piaggia at verona take me to corfu to the campo santo to civita vecchia to para noiaanywhere  mr harding smothered with her kisses says my dearest i will i will any man in the audience would do as much theyd take her to honolulu  while she is speaking sir johns voice had been heard off the stage no thank you ransome ill get them myself i know just where i left them sir john enters hurriedly advances and picks up his papers on the tableturnsand stands  he sees his wifes attitude and hears her say riviera amalfi orangieri contadini and capello santo it is enough he drops his parliamentary papers they fall against the fire irons with a crash these in falling upset a small table with one leg the ball of wool that is on it falls to the floor the noise of this disturbs the lovers  they turn all three look at one another for a moment they make a motion as if to ring for tea then they stand petrified  you gasps lady cicely she does this awfully well everybody says afterward that it was just splendid when she said you  sir john stands gazing in horror him my god he mr harding says nothing he looks very weak  lady cicely unpetrifies first  she breaks out speaking through her nostrils yes i love him i love him im not ashamed of it what right have you to deny it me you gave me nothing you made me a chattel a thing  you can feel the rustle of indignation through the house at this to make a woman a thing is the crowning horror of a problem play  you starved me here you throttled me lady cicely takes herself by the neck and throttles herself a little to show how  you smothered me i couldnt breatheand now im going do you hear going away to life to love behind the beyond she gathers up mr harding practically and carries him passionately away he looks back weakly as he goes  sir john has sunk down upon a chair his face is set  jack he mutters my god jack  as he sits there the valet enters with a telegram on a tray  a telegram sir john  sir john dazed and trying to collect himself what  a telegram sira cablegram  sir john takes it opens it and reads aloud  he is dead my duty is ended i am coming homemargaret harding  margaret coming home it only needed thatmy god          as he says it the curtain falls  the lights flick up there is a great burst of applause the curtain rises and falls lady cicely and mr harding and sir john all come out and bow charmingly there is no trace of worry on their faces and they hold one anothers hands then the curtain falls and the orchestra breaks out into a winter garden waltz the boxes buzz with discussion some of the people think that lady cicely is right in claiming the right to realize herself others think that before realizing herself she should have developed herself others ask indignantly how she could know herself if her husband refused to let her be herself but everybody feels that the subject is a delicious one  those of the people who have seen the play before very kindly explain how it ends so as to help the rest to enjoy it but the more seriousminded of the men have risen very gently and are sneaking up the aisles their expression is stamped with deep thought as if pondering over the play but their step is as that of leopards on the march and no one is deceived as to their purpose  the music continues the discussion goes on                                       the leopards come stealing back the orchestra boils over in a cadence and stops the theater is darkened again the footlights come on with a flash the curtain silently lifts and it is     act iisix months later   the programs rustle the people look to see where it is and they find that it is an apartment in paris notice that this place which is used in every problem play is just called an apartment it is not called mr hardings apartment or an apartment for which mr harding pays the rent not a bit it is just an apartment even if it were a apartment it would feel easier but an apartment the very words give the audience a delicious shiver of uncomfortableness  when the curtain rises it discloses a french maid moving about the stage in fourdollar silk stockings she is setting things on a little table evidently for supper she explains this in french as she does it so as to make it clear  illustration their expression is stamped with deep thought  bon la serviette de monsieur bon la serviette de madame biendu champagne bon langouste aux champignons bien bon this is all the french she knows poor little thing but langouste aux champignons beats the audience so she is all right  anyway this supper scene has to come in it is symbolical you cant really show amalfi and fiesole and the orange trees so this kind of supper takes their place  as the maid moves about there is a loud knock at the cardboard door of the apartment a man in official clothes sticks his head in he is evidently a postal special messenger because he is all in postal attire with a postal glazed hat  monsieur arrding he says  oui  bon une lettre  merci monsieur he goes out the audience feel a thrill of pride at having learned french and being able to follow the intense realism of this dialogue the maid lays the letter on the supper table  just as she does it the door opens and there enter mr harding and lady cicely yes them both of them the audience catches it like a flash they live here  lady cicely throws aside her cloak there is great gaiety in her manner her face is paler there is a bright spot in each cheek her eyes are very bright                                       there follows the wellknown supper scene lady cicely is very gay she pours champagne into mr hardings glass they both drink from it she asks him if he is a happy boy now he says he is she runs her fingers through his hair he kisses her on the bare shoulder this is also symbolic  lady cicely rattles on about amalfi and fiesole she asks mr harding if he remembers that night in the olive trees at santa clara with just one thrush singing in the night sky he says he does he remembers the very thrush you can see from the talk that they have been all over baedekers guide to the adriatic  at times lady cicelys animation breaks she falls into a fit of coughing and presses her hand to her side mr harding looks at her apprehensively she says it is nothing silly boy it will be gone in a moment it is only because she is so happy  illustration he kisses her on the bare shoulder  then quite suddenly she breaks down and falls at mr hardings knees  oh jack jack i cant stand it i cant stand it any longer it is choking me  my darling what is it  this all this it is choking methis apartment these pictures the french maid all of it i cant stand it im being suffocated oh jack take me awaytake me somewhere where it is quiet take me to norway to the great solemn hills and the fjords                                       then suddenly mr harding sees the letter in its light blue envelope lying on the supper table it has been lying right beside him for ten minutes everybody in the theater could see it and was getting uncomfortable about it he clutches it and tears it open there is a hunted look in his face as he reads  what is it  my mothergood god she is coming she is at the bristol and is coming here what can i do  lady cicely is quiet now  does she know  nothing nothing  how did she find you  i dont know i cant imagine i knew when i saw in the papers that my father was dead that she would come home but i kept back the address i told the solicitors curse them to keep it secret  mr harding paces the stage giving an imitation of a weak man trapped he keeps muttering what can i do  lady cicely speaks very firmly and proudly jack  what  there is only one thing to do tell her  mr harding aghast tell her  yes tell her about our love about everything i am not ashamed let her judge me  mr harding sinks into a chair he keeps shivering and saying i tell you i cant i cant she wouldnt understand the letter is fluttering in his hand his face is contemptible he does it splendidly lady cicely picks the letter from his hand she reads it aloud her eyes widening as she reads                                   hotel bristol paris          my darling boy          i have found you at lastwhy have you sought         to avoid me god grant there is nothing wrong         he is dead the man i taught you to call your         father and i can tell you all now i am coming         to you this instant                                        margaret harding  lady cicely reads her eyes widen and her voice chokes with horror  she advances to him and grips his hand what does it mean jack tell me what does it mean  good god cicely dont speak like that  thisthese linesabout your father  i dont know what it meansi dont carei hated him the brute im glad hes dead i dont care for that but shes coming here any minute and i cant face it  lady cicely more quietly jack tell me did mydid sir john trevor ever talk to you about your father  no he never spoke of him  did he know him  yesi think solong ago but they were enemiestrevor challenged him to a duelover some womanand he wouldnt fightthe cur  lady cicely dazed and aghastiunderstanditnow she recovers herself and speaks quickly  listen there is time yet go to the hotel go at once tell your mother nothing nothing you understand keep her from coming here anything but not that ernestineshe calls to the maid who reappears for a seconda taxiat once  she hurriedly gets hardings hat and coat the stage is full of bustle there is a great sense of hurry the audience are in an agony for fear ernestine is too slow or calls a fourwheel cab by mistake if the play is really well put on you can presently hear the taxi buzzing outside mr harding goes to kiss lady cicely she puts him from her in horror and hastens him out  she calls the maid ernestine quick put my things anything into a valise  madame is going away  yes yes at once  madame will not eat  no no  madame will not first rest the slow comprehension of these french maids is something exasperating madame will not await monsieur  madame will not first eat nor drinkno madame will not sleep  no noquick ernestine bring me what i want summon a fiacre i shall be ready in a moment lady cicely passes through a side door into an inner room  she is scarcely gone when mrs harding enters she is a woman about fortyfive still very beautiful she is dressed in deep black  the play is now moving very fast you have to sit tight to follow it all  she speaks to ernestine is this mr hardings apartment  yes madame  is he here she looks about her  no madame he is gone this moment in a taxito the hotel bristol i heard him say  mrs harding faltering isany onehere  no madame no onemilady was here a moment ago she too has gone out this is a lie but of course the maid is a french maid  then it is truethere is some one she is just saying this when the bell rings the door opens and there enterssir john trevor  you says mrs harding  i am too late gasps sir john  she goes to him tremblinglyafter all these years she says  it is a long time  you have not changed  she has taken his hands and is looking into his face and she goes on speaking i have thought of you so often in all these bitter yearsit sustained me even at the worstand i knew john that it was for my sake that you had never married                                       then as she goes on talking the audience realize with a thrill that mrs harding does not know that sir john married two years ago that she has come home as she thought to the man who loved her and more than that they get another thrill when they realize that lady cicely is learning it too she has pushed the door half open and is standing there unseen listening she wears a hat and cloak there is a folded letter in her handher eyes are wide mrs harding continues  and now john i want your help only you can help me you are so strongmy jack i must save him she looks about the room something seems to overcome her oh john this placehis being here like thisit seems a judgment on us  the audience are getting it fast now and when mrs harding speaks of our awful moment of folly the retribution of our own sins they grasp it and shiver with the luxury of it  after that when mrs harding says our wretched boy we must save himthey all know why she says our  she goes on more calmly i realized i knewhe is not alone here  sir johns voice is quiet almost hollow he is not alone  but this womancan you not deal with herpersuade herbeg her for my sakebribe her to leave my boy  lady cicely steps out there is no bribe needed i am going if i have wronged him and you it shall be atoned  sir john has given no sign he is standing stunned she turns to him i have heard and know now i cannot ask for pity but when i am gonewhen it is overi want you to give him this letterand i want you you two toto be as if i had never lived  she lays the letter in his hand then without a sign lady cicely passes out there is a great stillness in the house mrs harding has watched lady cicely and sir john in amazement sir john has sunk into a chair she breaks out john for gods sake what does it meanthis womanspeakthere is something awful i must know  yes you must know it is fate margaret you do not know all two years ago i married  but this woman this woman  she isshe wasmy wife          and at this moment harding breaks into the room cicely cicely i was too late he sees the others mother he says in agony and you he looks about where is she what is happening i must know  sir john as if following a mechanical impulse has handed harding the letter he tears it open and reads  dearest i am going away to die it cannot be long now the doctor told me today that was why i couldnt speak or explain it to you and was so strange at supper but i am glad now goodby  harding turns upon sir john with the snarl of a wolf what have you done why have you driven her away what right had you to her you devil i loved hershe was mine  he had seized a pointed knife from the supper table his shoulders are crouchedhe is about to spring on sir john mrs harding has thrown herself between them  jack jack you mustnt strike  out of the way i say ill  jack jack you mustnt strike cant you understand dont you seewhat it is     what do you meanstand back from me  jack heisyourfather  the knife clatters to the floor my god                                       and then the curtain fallsand theres a burst of applause and in accordance with all the best traditions of the stage one moment later lady cicely and mr harding and sir john and mrs harding are all bowing and smiling like anything and even the little french maid sneaks on in a corner of the stage and simpers  then the orchestra plays and the leopards sneak out and the people in the boxes are all talking gayly to show that theyre not the least affected and everybody is wondering how it will come out or rather how it can possibly come out at all because some of them explain that its all wrong and just as they are making it clear that there shouldnt be any third act the curtain goes up and its     act iii three months later   the curtain rises on a drawingroom in mrs hardings house in london mrs harding is sitting at a table she is sorting out parcels there is a great air of quiet about the scene the third act of a problem play always has to be very quiet it is like a punctured football with the wind going out of it the play has to just poof itself out noiselessly  for instance this is the way it is done  does mrs harding start to talk about lady cicely and jack and paris not a bit she is simply looking over the parcels and writing names and talking to herself so that the audience can get the names  for the orphans homepoor little things for the foundlings protection society for the lost infants preservation league a deep sighpoor poor children  now what is all this about what has this to do with the play why dont you see that it is the symbol of philanthropy of gentleness of melancholy sadness the storm is over and there is nothing in mrs hardings heart but pity dont you see that she is dressed in deeper black than ever and do you notice that look on her facethat thirdact airthat resignation  dont you see that the play is really all over theyre just letting the wind out of it  a man announces sir john trevor  sir john steps in mrs harding goes to meet him with both hands out  my dear dear friend she says in rich sad tones  sir john is all in black he is much aged but very firm and very quiet you can feel that hes been spending the morning with the committee of the homeless newsboys league or among the directorate of the lost waifs encouragement association in fact he begins to talk of these things at once the people who are not used to third acts are wondering what it is all about the real playgoers know that this is atmosphere  then presently  tea says mrs harding shall i ring  pray do says sir john he seats himself with great weariness the full melancholy of the third act is on him the tea which has been made for three acts is brought in they drink it and it begins to go to their heads the atmosphere clears off just a little  you have news i know says mrs harding you have seen him  i have seen him  and he is gone  yes he has sailed says sir john he went on board last night only a few hours after my return to london i saw him off poor jack gatherson has been most kind they will take him into the embassy at lima there please god he can begin life again the peruvian ambassador has promised to do all in his power  sir john sighs deeply and is silent this to let the fact soak into the audience that jack has gone to peru any reasonable person would have known it where else could he go to  he will do well in peru says mrs harding she is imitating a woman being very brave  yes i trust so says sir john there is silence again in fact the whole third act is diluted with thirty per cent of silence presently mrs harding speaks again in a low tone  you have other news i know  i have other news  of her  yes i have been to switzerland i have seen the curéa good man he has told me all there is to tell i found him at the hospice busy with his oeuvre de bienfaisance he led me to her grave  sir john is bowed in deep silence  lady cicely dead everybody in the theater gasps dead but what an unfair way to kill her to face an open death on the stage in fair hand to hand acting is one thing but this new system of dragging off the characters to switzerland between the acts and then returning and saying that they are dead is quite another  presently mrs harding speaks very softly and you you will take up your work here again  no i am going away  going  yes far away i am going to kafoonistan  mrs harding looks at him in pain to kafoonistan  yes to kafoonistan theres work there for me to do          there is silence again then sir john speaks and you you will settle down here in london  no i am going away  going away  yes back to balla walla i want to be alone i want to forget i want to think i want to try to realize  you are going alone  yes quite alone but i shall not feel alone when i get there the maharanee will receive me with open arms and my life will be useful there the women need me i will teach them to read to sew to sing  mrs hardingmargaretyou must not do this you have sacrificed your life enoughyou have the right to live  there is emotion in sir johns tone it is very rough on him to find his plan of going to kafoonistan has been outdone by mrs hardings going to balla walla she shakes her head  no no my life is of no account now but you john you are needed here the country needs you men look to you to lead them  mrs harding would particularize if she could but she cant just for the minute remember what it is sir john can lead them to sir john shakes his head  no no my work lies there in kafoonistan there is a mans work to be done there the tribes are ignorant uncivilized  this dialogue goes on for some time mrs harding keeps shaking her head and saying that sir john must not go to kafoonistan and sir john says she must not go to balla walla he protests that he wants to work and she claims that she wants to try to think clearly but it is all a bluff they are not going neither of them and everybody knows it presently mrs harding says  you will think of me sometimes  i shall never forget you  im glad of that  wherever i am i shall think of youout there in the deserts or at night alone there among the great silent hills with only the stars overhead i shall think of you your face will guide me wherever i am  he has taken her hand  and you he says you will think of me sometimes in balla walla  yes always all day while i am with the maharanee and her women and at night the great silent indian night when all the palace is asleep and there is heard nothing but the sounds of the jungle the cry of the hyena and the bray of the laughing jackass i shall seem to hear your voice  she is much moved she rises clenches her hands and then adds i have heard it so for five and twenty years  he has moved to her  margaret  john  i cannot let you go your life lies herewith menext my hearti want your help your love here inside the beyond  and as he speaks and takes her in his arms the curtain sinks upon them rises falls rises and then sinks again asbestos and all and the play is over the lights are on the audience rises in a body and puts on its wraps all over the theater you can hear the words perfectly rotten utterly untrue and so on the general judgment seems to be that it is a perfectly rotten play but very strong  they are saying this as they surge out in great waves of furs and silks with black crush hats floating on billows of white wraps among the foam of gossamer scarfs through it all is the squawk of the motor horn the call of the taxi numbers and the inrush of the fresh night air  but just inside the theater in the office is a man in a circus waistcoat adding up dollars with a blue pencil and he knows that the play is all right  illustration he takes her in his arms     familiar incidents     iwith the photographer   i want my photograph taken i said the photographer looked at me without enthusiasm he was a drooping man in a gray suit with the dim eye of a natural scientist but there is no need to describe him everybody knows what a photographer is like  sit there he said and wait  i waited an hour i read the ladies companion for 1912 the girls magazine for 1902 and the infants journal for 1888 i began to see that i had done an unwarrantable thing in breaking in on the privacy of this mans scientific pursuits with a face like mine  after an hour the photographer opened the inner door  come in he said severely  i went into the studio  sit down said the photographer  i sat down in a beam of sunlight filtered through a sheet of factory cotton hung against a frosted skylight  the photographer rolled a machine into the middle of the room and crawled into it from behind  he was only in it a secondjust time enough for one look at meand then he was out again tearing at the cotton sheet and the window panes with a hooked stick apparently frantic for light and air  then he crawled back into the machine again and drew a little black cloth over himself this time he was very quiet in there i knew that he was praying and i kept still  when the photographer came out at last he looked very grave and shook his head  the face is quite wrong he said  i know i answered quietly i have always known it  he sighed  i think he said the face would be better threequarters full  im sure it would i said enthusiastically for i was glad to find that the man had such a human side to him so would yours in fact i continued how many faces one sees that are apparently hard narrow limited but the minute you get them threequarters full they get wide large almost boundless in  but the photographer had ceased to listen he came over and took my head in his hands and twisted it sideways i thought he meant to kiss me and i closed my eyes  but i was wrong  he twisted my face as far as it would go and then stood looking at it  he sighed again  i dont like the head he said  then he went back to the machine and took another look  open the mouth a little he said  i started to do so  close it he added quickly  then he looked again  the ears are bad he said droop them a little more thank you now the eyes roll them in under the lids put the hands on the knees please and turn the face just a little upward yes thats better now just expand the lungs so and hump the neckthats itand just contract the waisthaand twist the hip up toward the elbownow i still dont quite like the face its just a trifle too full but  i swung myself round on the stool  stop i said with emotion but i think with dignity this face is my face it is not yours it is mine ive lived with it for forty years and i know its faults i know its out of drawing i know it wasnt made for me but its my face the only one i have i was conscious of a break in my voice but i went onsuch as it is ive learned to love it and this is my mouth not yours these ears are mine and if your machine is too narrow here i started to rise from the seat  snick  the photographer had pulled a string the photograph taken i could see the machine still staggering from the shock  i think said the photographer pursing his lips in a pleased smile that i caught the features just in a moment of animation  so i said bitinglyfeatures eh you didnt think i could animate them i suppose but let me see the picture  oh theres nothing to see yet he said i have to develop the negative first come back on saturday and ill let you see a proof of it  on saturday i went back  the photographer beckoned me in i thought he seemed quieter and graver than before i think too there was a certain pride in his manner  he unfolded the proof of a large photograph and we both looked at it in silence  is it me i asked  yes he said quietly it is you and we went on looking at it  the eyes i said hesitatingly dont look very much like mine  oh no he answered ive retouched them they come out splendidly dont they  fine i said but surely my eyebrows are not like that  no said the photographer with a momentary glance at my face the eyebrows are removed we have a process nowthe delphidefor putting in new ones youll notice here where weve applied it to carry the hair away from the brow i dont like the hair low on the skull  oh you dont dont you i said  no he went on i dont care for it i like to get the hair clear back to the superficies and make out a new brow line  what about the mouth i said with a bitterness that was lost on the photographer is that mine  its adjusted a little he said yours is too low i found i couldnt use it  the ears though i said strike me as a good likeness theyre just like mine  illustration is it me  yes said the photographer thoughtfully thats so but i can fix that all right in the print we have a process nowthe sulphidefor removing the ears entirely ill see if  listen i interrupted drawing myself up and animating my features to their full extent and speaking with a withering scorn that should have blasted the man on the spot listen i came here for a photographa picturesomething which mad though it seems would have looked like me i wanted something that would depict my face as heaven gave it to me humble though the gift may have been i wanted something that my friends might keep after my death to reconcile them to my loss it seems that i was mistaken what i wanted is no longer done go on then with your brutal work take your negative or whatever it is you call itdip it in sulphide bromide oxide cowhideanything you likeremove the eyes correct the mouth adjust the face restore the lips reanimate the necktie and reconstruct the waistcoat coat it with an inch of gloss shade it emboss it gild it till even you acknowledge that it is finished then when you have done all thatkeep it for yourself and your friends they may value it to me it is but a worthless bauble  i broke into tears and left     iithe dentist and the gas   i think said the dentist stepping outside again id better give you gas  then he moved aside and hummed an air from a light opera while he mixed up cement  i sat up in my shroud  gas i said  yes he repeated gas or else ether or a sulphuric anesthetic or else beat you into insensibility with a club or give you three thousand bolts of electricity  these may not have been his exact words but they convey the feeling of them very nicely  i could see the light of primitive criminality shining behind the mans spectacles  and to think that this was my faultthe result of my own reckless neglect i had grown so used to sitting back dozing in my shroud in the dentists chair listening to the twittering of the birds outside my eyes closed in the sweet half sleep of perfect security that the old apprehensiveness and mental agony had practically all gone  he didnt hurt me and i knew it  i had growni know it sounds madalmost to like him  for a time i had kept up the appearance of being hurt every few minutes just as a precaution then even that had ceased and i had dropped into vainglorious apathy  it was this of course which had infuriated the dentist he meant to reassert his power he knew that nothing but gas could rouse me out of my lethargy and he meant to apply iteither gas or some other powerful pain stimulant  so as soon as he said gas my senses were alert in a moment  when are you going to do it i said in horror  right now if you like he answered  his eyes were glittering with what the germans call blutlust all dentists have it  i could see that if i took my eye off him for a moment he might spring at me gas in hand and throttle me  no not now i cant stay now i said i have an appointment a whole lot of appointments urgent ones the most urgent i ever had i was unfastening my shroud as i spoke  well then tomorrow said the dentist  no i said tomorrow is saturday and saturday is a day when i simply cant take gas if i take gas even the least bit of gas on a saturday i find its misunderstood  monday then  monday im afraid wont do its a bad day for meworse than i can explain  tuesday said the dentist  not tuesday i answered tuesday is the worst day of all on tuesday my church society meets and i must go to it  i hadnt been near it in reality for three years but suddenly i felt a longing to attend it  on wednesday i went on speaking hurriedly and wildly i have another appointment a swimming club and on thursday two appointments a choral society and a funeral on friday i have another funeral saturday is market day sunday is washing day monday is drying day  hold on said the dentist speaking very firmly you come tomorrow morning ill write the engagement for ten oclock  i think it must have been hypnotism  before i knew it i had said yes  i went out  on the street i met a man i knew  have you ever taken gas from a dentist i asked  oh yes he said its nothing  soon after i met another man  have you ever taken gas i asked  oh certainly he answered its nothing nothing at all  altogether i asked about fifty people that day about gas and they all said that it was absolutely nothing when i said that i was to take it tomorrow they showed no concern whatever i looked in their faces for traces of anxiety there werent any they all said that it wouldnt hurt me that it was nothing  so then i was glad because i knew that gas was nothing  it began to seem hardly worth while to keep the appointment why go all the way downtown for such a mere nothing  but i did go  i kept the appointment  what followed was such an absolute nothing that i shouldnt bother to relate it except for the sake of my friends  the dentist was there with two assistants all three had white coats on as rigid as naval uniforms  i forget whether they carried revolvers  nothing could exceed their quiet courage let me pay them that tribute  i was laid out in my shroud in a long chair and tied down to it i think i was tied down perhaps i was fastened with nails this part of it was a mere nothing it simply felt like being tied down by three strong men armed with pinchers  after that a gas tank and a pump were placed beside me and a set of rubber tubes fastened tight over my mouth and nose even those who have never taken gas can realize how ridiculously simple this is  then they began pumping in gas the sensation of this part of it i cannot unfortunately recall it happened that just as they began to administer the gas i fell asleep i dont quite know why perhaps i was overtired perhaps it was the simple home charm of the surroundings the soft drowsy hum of the gas pump the twittering of the dentists in the treesdid i say the trees no of course they werent in the treesimagine dentists in the treesha ha here take off this gaspipe from my face till i laughreally i just want to laughonly to laugh  wellthats what it felt like  meanwhile they were operating  illustration i did go    i kept the appointment  of course i didnt feel it all i felt was that someone dealt me a powerful blow in the face with a sledgehammer after that somebody took a pickax and cracked in my jaw with it that was all  it was a mere nothing i felt at the time that a man who objects to a few taps on the face with a pickax is overcritical  i didnt happen to wake up till they had practically finished so i really missed the whole thing  the assistants had gone and the dentist was mixing up cement and humming airs from light opera just like old times it made the world seem a bright place  i went home with no teeth i only meant them to remove one but i realized that they had taken them all out still it didnt matter  not long after i received my bill i was astounded at the nerve of it for administering gas debtor so much for removing teeth debtor so muchand so on  in return i sent in my bill                       dr william jaws                           debtor    to mental agony                                        5000   to gross lies in regard to the nothingness of gas      10000   to putting me under gas                                 5000   to having fun with me under gas                        10000   to brilliant ideas occurred to me under gas and lost  10000                                                                           grand total                             40000  my bill has been contested and is in the hands of a solicitor the matter will prove i understand a test case and will go to the final courts if the judges have toothache during the trial i shall win     iiimy lost opportunities   the other day i took a walk with a real estate man out in the suburbs he leaned over the wooden fence of an empty lot and waved his hand at it  theres a lot he said that we sold last week for half a million dollars  did you really i exclaimed  yes he said and do you know that twentyfive years ago you could have picked that up for fifty thousand  what i said do you mean to say that i could have had all that beautiful grass and those mullin stalks for fifty thousand dollars  i do  you mean that when i was a student at college feeding on four dollars a week this opportunity was knocking at the door and i missed it  i turned my head away in bitterness as i thought of my own folly why had i never happened to walk out this way with fifty thousand dollars in my pocket and buy all this beautiful mud  the real estate man smiled complacently at my grief  i can show you more than that he said do you see that big stretch of empty ground out there past that last fence  yes yes i said excitedly the land with the beautiful tarpaper shack and the withered cedar treethe one withered cedar treestanding in its lonely isolation and seeming to beckon  say he said was you ever in the real estate business yourself  no i answered but i have a poetic mind and i begin to see the poetry the majesty of real estate  oh is that it he answered well that land out thereits an acre and a halfwas sold yesterday for three million dollars  for what  for three million dollars cold  not cold i said dont tell me it was cold  yes went on the real estate man and only three years ago you could have come out here and had it for a song  for a song i repeated  just think of it and i had missed it with a voice like mine if i had known what i know now i would have come out to that land and sung to it all night i never knew in the days when i was content with fifteen dollars a week what a hidden gift my voice was i should have taken up landsinging and made a fortune out of it  the thought of it saddened me all the way home and the talk of the real estate man as he went made me feel still worse  he showed me a church that i could have bought for a hundred thousand and sold now at half a million for a motor garage if i had started buying churches instead of working on a newspaper id have been rich today  there was a skating rink i could have bought and a theatre and a fruit store a beautiful little onestory wooden fruit store right on a corner with the darlingest italian in it that you ever saw there was the cutest little pet of a cowstable that i could have turned into an apartment store at a profit of a millionat the time when i was studying greek and forgetting it oh the wasted opportunities of life  and that evening when i got back to the club and talked about it at dinner to my business friends i found that i had only heard a small part of it  real estate thats nothing why they told me that fifteen years ago i could have had all sorts of thingstrunk line railways sugar refineries silver minesany of them for a song when i heard it i was half glad i hadnt sung for the land they told me that there was a time when i could have bought out the federal steel co for twenty million dollars and i let it go  illustration he showed me a church that i could have bought for a hundred thousand  the whole canadian pacific railway they said was thrown on the market for fifty millions i left it there writhing and didnt pick it up sheer lack of confidence i see now why these men get rich its their fine glorious confidence that enables them to write out a cheque for fifty million dollars and think nothing of it  if i wrote a cheque like that id be afraid of going to sing sing but they arent and so they get what they deserve  fortyfive years agoa man at the club told me this with almost a sob in his voiceeither rockefeller or carnegie could have been bought clean up for a thousand dollars  think of it  why didnt my father buy them for me as pets for my birthday and let me keep them till i grew up  if i had my life over again no school or education for me not with all this beautiful mud and these tarpaper shacks and corner lot fruit stores lying round id buy out the whole united states and take a chance a sporting chance on the rise in values     ivmy unknown friend   he stepped into the smoking compartment of the pullman where i was sitting alone  he had on a long furlined coat and he carried a fiftydollar suit case that he put down on the seat  then he saw me  well well he said and recognition broke out all over his face like morning sunlight  well well i repeated  by jove he said shaking hands vigorously who would have thought of seeing you  who indeed i thought to myself  he looked at me more closely  you havent changed a bit he said  neither have you said i heartily  you may be a little stouter he went on critically  yes i said a little but youre stouter yourself  this of course would help to explain away any undue stoutness on my part  no i continued boldly and firmly you look just about the same as ever  and all the time i was wondering who he was i didnt know him from adam i couldnt recall him a bit i dont mean that my memory is weak on the contrary it is singularly tenacious true i find it very hard to remember peoples names very often too it is hard for me to recall a face and frequently i fail to recall a persons appearance and of course clothes are a thing one doesnt notice but apart from these details i never forget anybody and i am proud of it but when it does happen that a name or face escapes me i never lose my presence of mind i know just how to deal with the situation it only needs coolness and intellect and it all comes right  my friend sat down  its a long time since we met he said  a long time i repeated with something of a note of sadness i wanted him to feel that i too had suffered from it  but it has gone very quickly  like a flash i assented cheerfully  strange he said how life goes on and we lose track of people and things alter i often think about it i sometimes wonder he continued where all the old gang are gone to  so do i i said in fact i was wondering about it at the very moment i always find in circumstances like these that a man begins sooner or later to talk of the old gang or the boys or the crowd thats where the opportunity comes in to gather who he is  do you ever go back to the old place he asked  never i said firmly and flatly this had to be absolute i felt that once and for all the old place must be ruled out of the discussion till i could discover where it was  no he went on i suppose youd hardly care to  not now i said very gently  i understand i beg your pardon he said and there was silence for a few moments  so far i had scored the first point there was evidently an old place somewhere to which i would hardly care to go that was something to build on  presently he began again  yes he said i sometimes meet some of the old boys and they begin to talk of you and wonder what youre doing  poor things i thought but i didnt say it  i knew it was time now to make a bold stroke so i used the method that i always employ i struck in with great animation  say i said wheres billy do you ever hear anything of billy now  this is really a very safe line every old gang has a billy in it  yes said my friend surebilly is ranching out in montana i saw him in chicago last springweighed about two hundred poundsyou wouldnt know him  no i certainly wouldnt i murmured to myself  and wheres pete i said this was safe ground there is always a pete  you mean billys brother he said  yes yes billys brother pete i often think of him  oh answered the unknown man old petes quite changedsettled down altogether here he began to chuckle why petes married  i started to laugh too under these circumstances it is always supposed to be very funny if a man has got married the notion of old peter whoever he is being married is presumed to be simply killing i kept on chuckling away quietly at the mere idea of it i was hoping that i might manage to keep on laughing till the train stopped i had only fifty miles more to go its not hard to laugh for fifty miles if you know how  but my friend wouldnt be content with it  i often meant to write to you he said his voice falling to a confidential tone especially when i heard of your loss  i remained quiet what had i lost was it money and if so how much and why had i lost it i wondered if it had ruined me or only partly ruined me  one can never get over a loss like that he continued solemnly  evidently i was plumb ruined but i said nothing and remained under cover waiting to draw his fire  yes the man went on death is always sad  death oh that was it was it i almost hiccoughed with joy that was easy handling a case of death in these conversations is simplicity itself one has only to sit quiet and wait to find out who is dead  yes i murmured very sad but it has its other side too  very true especially of course at that age  as you say at that age and after such a life  strong and bright to the last i suppose he continued very sympathetically  yes i said falling on sure ground able to sit up in bed and smoke within a few days of the end  what he said perplexed did your grandmother  my grandmother that was it was it  pardon me i said provoked at my own stupidity when i say smoked i mean able to sit up and be smoked to a habit she hadbeing read to and being smoked toonly thing that seemed to compose her  as i said this i could hear the rattle and clatter of the train running past the semaphores and switch points and slacking to a stop  my friend looked quickly out of the window  his face was agitated  great heavens he said thats the junction ive missed my stop i should have got out at the last station say porter he called out into the alleyway how long do we stop here  just two minutes sah called a voice back shes late now shes makin up tahm  my friend had hopped up now and had pulled out a bunch of keys and was fumbling at the lock of the suit case  ill have to wire back or something he gasped confound this lockmy moneys in the suit case  my one fear now was that he would fail to get off  here i said pulling some money out of my pocket dont bother with the lock heres money  thanks he said grabbing the roll of money out of my handin his excitement he took all that i hadill just have time  he sprang from the train i saw him through the window moving toward the waitingroom he didnt seem going very fast  i waited  the porters were calling all abawd all abawd there was the clang of a bell a hiss of steam and in a second the train was off  idiot i thought hes missed it and there was his fiftydollar suit case lying on the seat  i waited looking out of the window and wondering who the man was anyway  then presently i heard the porters voice again he evidently was guiding someone through the car  ah looked all through the kyar for it sah he was saying  i left it in the seat in the car there behind my wife said the angry voice of a stranger a welldressed man who put his head into the door of the compartment  then his face too beamed all at once with recognition but it was not for me it was for the fiftydollar valise  ah there it is he cried seizing it and carrying it off  i sank back in dismay the old gang petes marriage my grandmothers death great heavens and my money i saw it all the other man was making talk too and making it with a purpose  stung  and next time that i fall into talk with a casual stranger in a car i shall not try to be quite so extraordinarily clever     vunder the barbers knife   was you to the arena the other night said the barber leaning over me and speaking in his confidential whisper  yes i said i was there  he saw from this that i could still speak so he laid another thick wet towel over my face before he spoke again  what did you think of the game he asked  but he had miscalculated i could still make a faint sound through the wet towels he laid three or four more very thick ones over my face and stood with his five finger tips pressed against my face for support a thick steam rose about me through it i could hear the barbers voice and the flickflack of the razor as he stropped it  illustration i shall not try to be quite so extraordinarily clever  yes sir he went on in his quiet professional tone punctuated with the noise of the razor i knowed from the start them boys was sure to winflickflackflickflackas soon as i seen the ice that night and seen the getaway them boys made i knowed itflickflackand just as soon as jimmy got aholt of the puck  this was more than the barber at the next chair could stand  him get de puck he cried giving an angry dash with a full brush of soap into the face of the man under himhim get utdat stiffwhy boys he said and he turned appealingly to the eight barbers who all rested their elbows on the customers faces while they listened to the rising altercation even the manicure girl thrilled to attention clasped tight the lumpy hand of her client in her white digits and remained motionlesswhy boys dat feller cant no more play hockey than  see here said the barber suddenly and angrily striking his fist emphatically on the towels that covered my face ill bet you five dollars to one jimmy can skate rings round any two men in the league  him skate sneered the other squirting a jet of blinding steam in the face of the client he was treating he aint got no more go in him than dat ragand he slapped a wet towel across his clients face  all the barbers were excited now there was a babel of talk from behind each of the eight chairs he cant skate he can skate ill bet you ten  already they were losing their tempers slapping their customers with wet towels and jabbing great brushfuls of soap into their mouths my barber was leaning over my face with his whole body in another minute one or the other of them would have been sufficiently provoked to have dealt his customer a blow behind the ear  then suddenly there was a hush  the boss said one  in another minute i could realize though i couldnt see it that a majestic figure in a white coat was moving down the line all was still again except the quiet hum of the mechanical shampoo brush and the soft burble of running water  the barber began removing the wet towels from my face one by one he peeled them off with the professional neatness of an egyptologist unwrapping a mummy when he reached my face he looked searchingly at it there was suspicion in his eye  been out of town he questioned  yes i admitted  whos been doing your work he asked this question from a barber has no reference to ones daily occupation it means who has been shaving you  i knew it was best to own up id been in the wrong and i meant to acknowledge it with perfect frankness  ive been shaving myself i said  my barber stood back from me in contempt there was a distinct sensation all down the line of barbers one of them threw a wet rag in a corner with a thud and another sent a sudden squirt from an atomizer into his customers eyes as a mark of disgust  my barber continued to look at me narrowly  what razor do you use he said  a safety razor i answered  the barber had begun to dash soap over my face but he stoppedaghast at what i had said  a safety razor to a barber is like a red rag to a bull  if it was me he went on beating lather into me as he spoke i wouldnt let one of them things near my face no sir there aint no safety in them they tear the hide clean off youjust rake the hair right out by the follicles as he said this he was illustrating his meaning with jabs of his razorthem things just cut a mans face all to pieces he jabbed a stick of alum against an open cut that he had madeand as for cleanliness for sanitation for this here hygiene and for germs i wouldnt have them round me for a fortune  i said nothing i knew i had deserved it and i kept quiet  illustration when he reached my face he looked searchingly at it  the barber gradually subsided under other circumstances he would have told me something of the spring training of the baseball clubs or the last items from the jacksonville track or any of those things which a cultivated man loves to hear discussed between breakfast and business but i was not worth it as he neared the end of the shaving he spoke again this time in a confidential almost yearning tone  massage he said  no thank you  shampoo the scalp he whispered  no thanks  singe the hair he coaxed  no thanks  the barber made one more effort  say he said in my ear as a thing concerning himself and me alone your hairs pretty well all falling out youd better let me just shampoo up the scalp a bit and stop up them follicles or pretty soon you wont  no thank you i said not today  this was all the barber could stand he saw that i was just one of those miserable deadbeats who come to a barber shop merely for a shave and who carry away the scalp and the follicles and all the barbers perquisites as if they belonged to them  in a second he had me thrown out of the chair  next he shouted  as i passed down the line of the barbers i could see contempt in every eye while they turned on the full clatter of their revolving shampoo brushes and drowned the noise of my miserable exit in the roar of machinery     parisian pastimes     ithe advantages of a polite education   take it from me said my friend from kansas leaning back in his seat at the taverne royale and holding his cigar in his two fingersdont talk no french here in paris they dont expect it and they dont seem to understand it  this man from kansas mind you had a right to speak he knew french he had learned frenchhe told me so himselfgood french at the fayetteville classical academy later on he had had the natural method off a man from new orleans it had cost him fifty cents a throw all this i have on his own word but in france something seemed to go wrong with his french  no he said reflectively i guess what most of them speak here is a sort of patois  when he said it was a patois i knew just what he meant it was equivalent to saying that he couldnt understand it  i had seen him strike patois before there had been a french steward on the steamer coming over and the man from kansas after a couple of attempts had said it was no use talking french to that man he spoke a hopeless patois there were half a dozen cabin passengers too returning to their homes in france but we soon found from listening to their conversation on deck that what they were speaking was not french but some sort of patois  it was the same thing coming through normandy patois everywhere not a word of frenchnot a single sentence of the real language in the way they had it at fayetteville we stopped off a day at rouen to look at the cathedral a sort of abbot showed us round would you believe it that man spoke patois straight patoisthe very worst kind and fast the man from kansas had spotted it at once he hadnt listened to more than ten sentences before he recognized it patois he said  of course its fine to be able to detect patois like this its impressive the mere fact that you know the word patois shows that you must be mighty well educated  here in paris it was the same way everybody that the man from kansas triedwaiters hotel clerks shop peopleall spoke patois an educated person couldnt follow it  on the whole i think the advice of the man from kansas is good when you come to paris leave french behind you dont need it and they dont expect it of you  in any case you soon learn from experience not to use it  if you try to this is what happens you summon a waiter to you and you say to him very slowly syllable by syllable so as to give him every chance in case hes not an educated man  bringez moi de la soupe de la fish de la roast pork et de la fromage  and he answers  yes sir roast pork sir and a little bacon on the side  that waiter was raised in illinois  or suppose you stop a man on the street and you say to him  musshoo sil vous plait which is la direction pour aller à le palais royal  and he answers  well i tell you im something of a stranger here myself but i guess its straight down there a piece  now its no use speculating whether that man comes from dordogne inférieure or from auvergnesurlespuits because he doesnt  on the other hand you may strike a real frenchmanthere are some even in paris i met one the other day in trying to find my way about and i asked him  musshoo sil vous plait which is la direction pour aller à thomas cook  son  bnmssulvlanfssenssepas  i said thank you so much i had half suspected it myself but i didnt really know what he meant  so i have come to make it a rule never to use french unless driven to it thus for example i had a tremendous linguistic struggle in a french tailors shop  there was a sign in the window to the effect that completes might be had for a hundred it seemed a chance not to be missed moreover the same sign said that english and german were spoken  so i went in true to my usual principle of ignoring the french language i said to the head man  you speak english  he shrugged his shoulders spread out his hands and looked at the clock on the wall  presently he said  oh i said youll speak it presently thats splendid but why not speak it right away  the tailor again looked at the clock with a despairing shrug  at twelve oclock he said  come now i said be fair about this i dont want to wait an hour and a half for you to begin to talk lets get at it right now  but he was obdurate he merely shook his head and repeated  speak english at twelve oclock  judging that he must be under a vow of abstinence during the morning i tried another idea  allemand i asked german deutsch eh speak that  again the french tailor shook his head this time with great decision  not till four oclock he said  this was evidently final he might be lax enough to talk english at noon but he refused pointblank to talk german till he had his full strength  i was just wondering whether there wasnt some common sense in this after all when the solution of it struck me  ah i said speaking in french très bong there is somebody who comes at twelve quelquun qui vient à midi who can talk english  illustration the tailor shrugged his shoulders  precisément said the tailor wreathed in smiles and waving his tape coquettishly about his neck  you flirt i said but lets get to business i want a suit un soot un complete complet comprenezvous veston gilet une pair de pantelooneverythingdo you get it  the tailor was now all animation  ah certainement he said monsieur desires a fantasy une fantaisie is it not  a fantasy good heavens  the man had evidently got the idea from my naming so many things that i wanted a suit for a fancy dress carnival  fantasy nothing i saidpas de fantaisie un soot anglaishere an idea struck me and i tapped myself on the chestlike this i said comme ceci  bon said the tailor now perfectly satisfied une fantaisie comme porte monsieur  here i got mad  blast you i said this is not a fantaisie do you take me for a dragonfly or what now come lets get this fantaisie business cleared up this is what i wantand here i put my hand on a roll of very quiet grey cloth on the counter  très bien said the tailor une fantaisie  i stared at him  is that a fantaisie  certainement monsieur  now i said lets go into it further and i touched another piece of plain pepper and salt stuff of the kind that is called in the simple and refined language of my own country gents panting  this  une fantaisie said the french tailor  well i said youve got more imagination than i have  then i touched a piece of purple blue that would have been almost too loud for a carolina nigger  is this a fantaisie  the tailor shrugged his shoulders  ah non he said in deprecating tones  tell me i said speaking in french just exactly what it is you call a fantasy  the tailor burst into a perfect paroxysm of french gesticulating and waving his tape as he put the sentences over the plate one after another it was fast pitching but i took them every one and i got him  what he meant was that any single colour or combination of single coloursfor instance a pair of sky blue breeches with pink insertion behindis not regarded by a french tailor as a fantaisie or fancy but any mingled colour such as the ordinary drab grey of the business man is a fantaisie of the daintiest kind to the eye of a parisian tailor a quakers meeting is a glittering panorama of fantaisies whereas a negro ball at midnight in a yellow room with a band in scarlet is a plain simple scene  i thanked him then i said  measure me mesurezmoi passez le tape line autour de moi  he did it  i dont know what it is they measure you in whether in centimètres or cubic feet or what it is but the effect is appalling  the tailor runs his tape round your neck and calls sixty then he puts it round the lower part of the backat the major circumference you understandand shouts a hundred and fifty  it sounded a record breaker i felt that there should have been a burst of applause but to tell the truth i have friendsquiet sedentary men in the professoriatewho would easily hit up four or five hundred on the same scale  then came the last item  now i said when will this complete be ready  ah monsieur said the tailor with winsome softness we are very busy crushed écrasés with commands give us time dont hurry us  well i said how long do you want  ah monsieur he pleaded give us four days  i never moved an eyelash  what i said indignantly four days monstrous let me have this whole complete fantasy in one day or i wont buy it  ah monsieur three days  no i said make it two days  two days and a half monsieur  two days and a quarter i said give it me the day after tomorrow at three oclock in the morning  ah monsieur ten oclock  make it ten minutes to ten and its a go i said  bon said the tailor  he kept his word i am wearing the fantaisie as i write for a fantaisie it is fairly quiet except that it has three pockets on each side outside and a rolled back collar suitable for the throat of an opera singer and as many buttons as a harem skirt beyond that its a firstclass steady reliable quiet religious fantaisie such as any retired french ballet master might be proud to wear     iithe joys of philanthropy   goodmorning said the valet de chambre as i stepped from my room  goodmorning i answered pray accept twentyfive centimes  goodmorning sir said the maître dhôtel as i passed down the corridor a lovely morning sir  so lovely i replied that i must at once ask you to accept fortyfive centimes on the strength of it  a beautiful day monsieur said the head waiter rubbing his hands i trust that monsieur has slept well  so well i answered that monsieur must absolutely insist on your accepting seventyfive centimes on the spot come dont deny me this is personal matter every time i sleep i simply have to give money away  monsieur is most kind  kind i should think not if the valet de chambre and the maître dhôtel and the chef de service and the others of the ten men needed to supply me with fifteen cents worth of coffee could read my heart they would find it an abyss of the blackest hatred  yet they take their handful of coppersgreat grown men dressed up in monkey suits of black at eight in the morningand bow double for it  if they tell you it is a warm morning you must give them two cents if you ask the time it costs you two cents if you want a real genuine burst of conversation it costs anywhere from a cent to a cent and a half a word  such is paris all day long tip tip tip till the brain is weary not with the cost of it but with the arithmetical strain  no pleasure is perfect every rose has its thorn the thorn of the parisian holidaymaker is the perpetual necessity of handing out small gratuities to a set of overgrown flunkies too lazy to split wood  not that the amount of the tips all added together is anything serious no rational man would grudge it if it could be presented in a bill as a lump sum at breakfast time every morning and done with for the day  but the incessant necessity of handing out small tips of graded amounts gets on ones nerves it is necessary in paris to go round with enough money of different denominations in ones pocket to start a bankgold and paper notes for serious purchases and with them a huge dead weight of great silver pieces five franc bits as large as a quakers shoebuckle and a jingling mass of coppers in a side pocket these one must distribute as extras to cabmen waiters newsvendors beggars anybody and everybody in fact that one has anything to do with  the whole mass of the coppers carried only amounts perhaps to twentyfive cents in honest canadian money but the silly system of the french currency makes the case appear worse than it is and gives one the impression of being a walking treasury  morning noon and night the visitor is perpetually putting his hand into his side pocket and pulling out coppers he drips coppers all day in an unending stream you enter a french theatre you buy a programme fifty centimes and ten more to the man who sells it you hand your coat and cane to an aged harpy who presides over what is called the vestiaire pay her twentyfive centimes and give her ten you are shown to your seat by another old fairy in dingy black she has a french name but i forget it and give her twenty centimes just think of the silly business of it your ticket if it is a good seat in a good theatre has cost you about three dollars and a half one would almost think the theatre could afford to throw in eight cents worth of harpies for the sake of international good will  similarly in your hotel you ring the bell and there appears the valet de chambre dressed in a red waistcoat and a coat effect of black taffeta you tell him that you want a bath bien monsieur he will fetch the maître dhôtel oh he will will he how good of him but really one cant witness such kindness on his part without begging him to accept a twentyfive centime remembrance merci bien monsieur the maître dhôtel comes he is a noble looking person who wears a dress suit at eight oclock in the morning with patent leather shoes of the kind that i have always wanted but am still unable to afford yet i know from experience that the man merely lives and breathes at fifty centimes a breath for fifty centimes hell bow low enough to crack himself if you gave him a franc hed lie down on the floor and lick your boots i know he would ive seen them do it  so when the news comes that you propose to take a bath hes right along side of you in a minute all civility mind you in a really french hotel one with what is called the old french atmosphere taking a bath is quite an event and the maître dhôtel sees a dead sure fifty centimes in it with perhaps an extra ten centimes if times are good that is to say he may clear anything from ten to twelve cents on the transaction a bath monsieur nothing more simple this moment tout de suite right off he will at once give orders for it so you give him eleven cents and he then tells the hotel harpy dressed in black like the theatre harpies to get the bath and she goes and gets it she was there of course all the time right in the corridor and heard all that proceeded but she doesnt enter into her functions until the valet de chambre tells the maître dhôtel and the maître dhôtel informs her officially of the coming event  she gets the bath what does she do why merely opens the door of the bathroom which wasnt locked and turns on the water but of course no man with any chivalry in him could allow a harpy to be put to all that labour without pressing her to accept three cents as a mark of personal appreciation  thus the maître dhôtel and the valet de chambre and the harpy go on all day from six in the morning when they first enter into functions until heaven knows when at night when they leave off and they keep gathering in two cents and three cents and even five cents at a time then presently i suppose they go off and spend it in their own way the maître dhôtel transformed into a cheap parisian with a dragonfly coat and a sixty cent panama dances gaily at the bal wagram and himself hands out coppers to the musicians and gives a one cent tip to a lower order of maître dhôtel the harpy goes forth and with other harpies absorbs red wine and indescribable cheese at eleven at night in a crowded little café on the crowded sidewalk of a street about as wide as a wagon she tips the waiter who serves her at the rate of one cent per half hour of attendance and he i suppose later on tips someone else and so on endlessly  in this way about fifty thousand people in paris eke out a livelihood by tipping one another  the worst part of the tipping system is that very often the knowledge that tips are expected and the uncertainty of their amount causes one to forego a great number of things that might otherwise be enjoyable  i brought with me to paris for example a letter of introduction to the president of the republic i dont say this in any boasting spirit a university professor can always get all the letters of introduction that he wants everyone knows that he is too simple to make any commercial use of them but i never presented this letter to the president what was the use it wouldnt have been worth it he would have expected a tip and of course in his case it would have had to be a liberal one twentyfive cents straight out perhaps too some of his ministers would have strolled in as soon as they saw a stranger on the chance of picking up something put it as three ministers at fifteen cents each thats fortyfive cents or a total of seventy cents for ten minutes talk with the french government its not worth it  in all paris i only found one place where tipping is absolutely out of the question that was at the british embassy there they dont allow it not only the clerks and the secretaries but even the ambassador himself is forbidden to take so much as the smallest gratuity  and they live up to it  that is why i still feel proud of having made an exception to the rule  i went there because the present ambassador is a personal friend of mine i hadnt known this till i went to paris and i may say in fairness that we are friends no longer as soon as i came away our friendship seemed to have ceased  i will make no secret of the matter i wanted permission to read in the national library in paris all frenchmen are allowed to read there and in addition all the personal friends of the foreign ambassadors by a convenient fiction everybody is the friend of this ambassador and is given a letter to prove it provided he will call at the embassy and get it that is how i came to be a friend of the british ambassador whether our friendship will ripen into anything warmer and closer it is not for me to say  but i went to the embassy  the young man that i dealt with was i think a secretary he wasi could see it at oncethat perfect thing called an english gentleman i have seldom seen outside of baseball circles so considerate a manner he took my card and from sheer considerateness left me alone for half an hour then he came back for a moment and said it was a glorious day i had heard this phrase so often in paris that i reached into my pocket for ten cents but something in the quiet dignity of the young man held me back so i merely answered that it was indeed a glorious day and that the crops would soon head out nicely if we got this sunshine provided there wasnt dew enough to start the rust in which case i was afraid that if an early frost set in we might be badly fooled he said indeed and asked me if i had read the last london weekly times i said that i had not seen the last one but that i had read one about a year ago and that it seemed one of the most sparkling things i had ever read i had simply roared over it from cover to cover  he looked pleased and went away  when he came back he had the letter of commendation in his hand  would you believe it the civility of it they had printed the letter every word of itexcept my own nameand it explained all about the ambassador and me being close friends and told of his desire to have me read in the national library  i took the letter and i knew of course that the moment had come to do something handsome for the young man but he looked so calm that i still hesitated  i took ten cents out of my pocket and held it where the light could glitter from every point of its surface full in his face  and i said  my dear young friend i hope i dont insult you you are i can see it an english gentleman your manner betrays it i too though i may seem only what i am had i not been brought up in toronto might have been like you but enough of this weaknesswill you take ten cents  illustration something in the quiet dignity of the young man held me  he hesitated he looked all round i could see that he was making a great effort the spirit of paris battled against his better nature he was tempted but he didnt fall  im sorry sir he said id like to take it but im afraid i mustnt  young man i said i respect your feelings you have done me a service if you ever fall into want and need a position in the canadian cabinet or a seat in our senate let me know at once  i left him  then by an odd chance as i passed to the outer door there was the british ambassador himself he was standing beside the door waiting to open it there was no mistaking him i could tell by his cocked hat and brass buttons and the brass chain across his chest that it was the ambassador the way in which he swung the door back and removed his hat showed him a trained diplomat  the moment had come i still held my ten cents  my lord i said i understand your position as the only man in paris who must not accept a tip but i insist  i slipped the money into his hand  thankee kindly sir said the ambassador  diplomatically speaking the incident was closed     iiithe simple life in paris   parisat least the paris of luxury and fashionis a childless city its streets are thronged all day with a crowd that passes in endless succession but with never a child among them you may stand on the boulevards and count a thousand grownup persons for one child that goes by  the case of course is not so extreme in the quieter parts of the city i have seen children sometimes two or three together in the champs elysées in the garden of the tuileries i once saw six all in a group they seemed to be playing a passerby succeeded in getting a snapshot of them without driving them away in the poorer districts there are any quantity of children even enough to sell but in the paris of the rich the child is conspicuous by its absence the foreign visitors come without their children the true parisian lady has pretty well gone out of the business  here and there you may see driving past with its mother in an open barouche or parading the rue de la paix on the hand of its nurse the dolllike substitute for oldtime infancy the fashionable parisian child as far as the sex can be determined by looking at it it is generally a girl it is dressed in the height of fashion a huge picture hat reaches out in all directions from its head long gloves encase its little arms to prevent it from making a free use of them a dainty coat of powder on its face preserves it from the distorting effect of a smile its little hundred dollar frock reaches down in a sweet simplicity of outline it has a belt that runs round its thighs to divide it into two harmonious parts below that are bare pink legs ending in little silk socks at a dollar an inch and wee slippers clasped with a simple emerald buckle therein of course the child only obeys the reigning fashion simplicityso i am informed by the last number of la mode parisienneis the dominant note of parisian dress todaysimplicity plainness freedom from all display a french lady wears in her hair at the opera a single simple tiara bound with a plain row of solitaire diamonds it is so exquisitely simple in its outline that you can see the single diamonds sticking out from it and can count up the price of each the parisian gentleman wears in his buttonhole merely a single orchidnot half a dozenand pins his necktie with one plain ordinary ruby set in a perfectly unostentatious sunburst of sapphires there is no doubt of the superiority of this parisian simplicity to me when it broke upon me in reading la mode parisienne it came as a kind of inspiration i took away the stuffy black ribbon with its stupidly elaborate knot from my canadian christie hat and wound a single black ostrich feather about it fastened with just the plainest silver aigrette when i had put that on and pinned a piece of old lace to the tail of my coat with just one safety pin i walked the street with the quiet dignity of a person whose one idea is not to be conspicuous  but this is a digression the child i was saying wears about two hundred worth of visible clothing upon it and i believe that if you were to take it up by its tendollar slipper and hold it upside down you would see about fifty dollars more the french child has been converted into an elaborately dressed doll it is altogether a thing of show an appendage of its fashionably dressed mother with frock and parasol to match it is no longer a child but a living toy or plaything  even on these terms the child is not a success it has a rival who is rapidly beating it off the ground this is the parisian dog as an implement of fashion as a setoff to the fair sex as the recipient of ecstatic kisses and ravishing hugs the parisian dog can give the child forty points in a hundred and win out it can dress better look more intelligent behave better bark betterin fact the child is simply not in it  illustration the parisian dog  this is why i suppose in the world of parisian luxury the dog is ousting the infant altogether you will see as i said no children on the boulevards and avenues you will see dogs by the hundred every motor or open barouche that passes up the champs elysées with its little white cloud of fluffy parasols and gardenhats has a dainty beribboned dog sitting among its occupants in every avenue and promenade you will see hundreds of clipped poodles and toy spaniels in all the fashionable churches you will see dogs bowed at their devotions  it was a fair struggle the child had its chance and was beaten the child couldnt dress the dog could the child couldnt or wouldnt pray the dog couldor at least he learnt how no doubt it came awkwardly at first but he set himself to it till nowadays a french dog can enter a cathedral with just as much reverence as his mistress and can pray in the corner of the pew with the same humility as hers when you get to know the parisian dogs you can easily tell a roman catholic dog from a low church anglican i knew a dog once that was convertedeverybody said from motives of policyfrom a presbyterianbut stop its not fair to talk about itthe dog is dead now and its not right to speak ill of its belief no matter how mistaken it may have been  however let that pass what i was saying was that between the child and the dog each had its chance in a fair open contest and the child is nowhere  people who have never seen even from the outside the parisian world of fashion have no idea to what an extent it has been invaded by the dog craze dogs are driven about in motors and open carriages they are elaborately clipped and powdered and beribboned by special coiffeurs they wear little buckled coats and blankets and in motorsi dont feel quite sure of thisthey wear motor goggles there are at least three or fourand for all i know there may be morefashionable shops in paris for dogs supplies there is one that any curious visitor may easily find at once in the rue des petits champs close to the avenue de lopera there is another one midway in the galleries of the palais royal in these shops you will see in the first place the chains collars and whips that are marks of the servitude in which dogs still live though by the way there are already i think dog suffragettes heading a very strong movement you will see also the most delicious fashionable dog coats very very simple fastened in front with one silver clasp only one in the palais royal shop they advertise newest summer models for 1913 in dogs tailoring there are also dogs beds made in wickerwork in cradle shape with eiderdown coverlets worked over with silk  a little while ago the new york papers were filled with an account of a dogs lunch given at the vanderbilt hotel by an ultrafashionable american lady it was recorded that vi sin the pekin spaniel of mrs h of new york was host to about ten thousand dollars worth of smart dogs i do not know whether or not this story is true for i only read it in the parisian papers but certain it is that the episode would have made no sensation in paris a dog eating in a restaurant is a most ordinary spectacle only a few days ago i had lunch with a doga very quiet sensible belgian poodle very simply dressed in a plain morning stomach coat of ultramarine with leather insertions i took quite a fancy to him when i say that i had lunch with him i ought to explain that he had a lady his mistress with himthat also is quite usual in paris but i didnt know her and she sat on the further side of him so that i confined myself to ordinary table civilities with the dog i was having merely a plain omelette from motives of economy and the dog had a little dish of entrecote dagneau aux asperges maître dhôtel i took some of it while the lady was speaking to the waiter and found it excellent you may believe it or not but the entry of a dog into a french restaurant and his being seated at a table and having his food ordered creates not the slightest sensation to bring a child into a really good restaurant would i imagine be looked upon as rather a serious affair  not only is the dog the darling of the hour during his lifetime but even in death he is not forgotten there is in paris a special dog cemetery it lies among the drooping trees of a little island in the seine called the isle de la recette and you may find it by taking the suburban tramway for asnières it has little tombstones monuments and flowered walks one sorrowstricken master has inscribed over a dogs graveplus je vois les hommes plus jaime mon chien the most notable feature of the cemetery is the monument of barry a st bernard dog the inscription states that he saved forty lives in the alps  but the dog craze is after all only a sign and sample of the prevailing growth and extent of fashionable luxury nowhere in the world i suppose is this more conspicuous than in paris the very vanity fair of mundane pleasure the hostesses of dinners dances and fêtes vie with one another in seeking bizarre and extravagant effects here is a good example of it taken from actual life the other day it is an account of an oriental fête given at a private mansion in paris  it runs thusthe sumptuous paris mansion of the comtesse aynard de chabrillan in the rue christophecolomb was converted into a veritable scene from the thousand and one nights on the occasion of a persian fête given by her to a large company of friends  in the courtyard an immense tent was erected hung with superb persian stuffs and tapestries and here the élite of paris assembled in gorgeous oriental costumes  the countess herself presided in a magnificent persian costume of green and gold with an immense white aigrette in her hair  notice it the simplicity of it only green and gold in her costume no silver no tin no galvanized iron just gold plain gold and only one immense white aigrette the quiet dignity of it  the article goes oneach of the sensational entries was announced by m andré de fouquières the arbiter of parisian elegance  one of the most striking spectacles of the evening was the appearance of princesse p darenberg mounted on an elephant richly bedecked with indian trappings then came the duchesse de clermonttonnerre and the comtesse stanislas de castellane in gold cages followed by the marquise de brantes in a flowerstrewn egyptian litter accompanied by pharaoh and his slaves  the comtesse de lubersac danced an oriental measure with charming grace and prince luis fernando of spain in an ethereal costume his features stained a greenish hue executed a hindoo dance before the assembly  can you beat it his features stained with a greenish hue now look at that he might have put on high grade prepared paint or clear white leadhes rich enoughbut no just a quiet shingle stain is enough for him  i cannot resist adding from the same source the list of the chief guests anybody desiring a set of names for a burlesque show to run three hundred nights on the circuit may have them free of charge or without infringement of copyright  nearly everyone prominent in paris society was present including the maharajah of kapurthala princess prem kaur prince aga khan the austrian ambassador and countess szecsen the persian and bulgarian ministers mme stancioff duc and duchesse de noailles comtesse a potocka marquis and marquise de mun comtesse du bourg de bozas mrs moore comte and comtesse g de segonzec and prince and princess de croy  i am sorry that mrs moore was there she must have slipped in unnoticed  what is not generally known is that i was there myself i appearedin rivalry with prince luis fernandodressed as a bombay soda water bottle with aerial opalescent streaks of light flashing from the costume which was bound with single wire     iva visit to versailles   what said the man from kansas looking up from his asparagus do you mean to say that you have never seen the palace of versailles  no i said very firmly i have not  nor the fountains in the gardens  no  nor the battle pictures  no  and the hall of mirrorsadded the fat lady from georgia  and madame du barrys bedsaid her husband  her which i asked with some interest  her bed  all right i said ill go  i knew of course that i had to every tourist in paris has got to go and see versailles otherwise the superiority of the others becomes insufferable with foreigners it is different if they worry one about palaces and cathedrals and suchthe château at versailles and the kaiserhof and the duomo at milani answer them in kind i ask them if they have ever seen the schlitzerhof at milwaukee and the anheuserbusch at st louis and the dammo at niagara and the toboggo at montreal that quiets them wonderfully  but as i say i had to go  you get to versaillesas the best of various ways of transportby means of a contrivance something between a train and a street car it has a little puffing steamengine and two carsdouble deckerswith the top deck open to the air and covered with a wooden roof on rods the lower part inside is called the firstclass and a seat in it costs ten cents extra otherwise nobody would care to ride in it the engine is a quaint little thing and wears a skirt painted green all around it so that you can just see the tips of its wheels peeping modestly out below it was a great relief to me to see this engine it showed that there is such a thing as french delicacy after all there are so many sights along the boulevards that bring the carmine blush to the face of the tourist from the twisting of his neck in trying to avoid seeing them that it is well to know that the french draw the line somewhere the sight of the bare wheels of an engine is too much for them  the little train whirls its way out of paris past the great embankment and the fortifications and goes rocking along among green trees whose branches sweep its sides and trim villas with stone walls around quaint gardens at every moment it passes little inns and suburban restaurants with cool arbours in front of them and waiters in white coats pouring out glasses of red wine it makes one thirsty just to look at them  in due time the little train rattles and rocks itself over the dozen miles or so that separate paris from versailles and sets you down right in front of the great stone courtyard of the palace there through the long hours of a summer afternoon you may feast your eyes upon the wonderland of beauty that rose at the command of the grand monarch louis xiv from the sanded plains and wooded upland that marked the spot two hundred and fifty years ago  all that royal munificence could effect was lavished on the making of the palace so vast is it in size that in the days of its greatest splendour it harboured ten thousand inmates the sheer length of it from side to side is only about a hundred yards short of half a mile to make the grounds the kings chief landscape artist and his hundreds of workers laboured for twenty years they took in as it were the whole landscape the beauty of their work lies not only in the wonderful terraces gardens groves and fountains that extend from the rear of the château but in its blending with the scene beyond it is so planned that no distant house or building breaks into the picture the vista ends everywhere with the waving woods of the purple distance  louis xiv spent in all they say a hundred million dollars on the making of the palace when made it was filled with treasures of art not to be measured in price it was meant to be and it remains the last word of royal grandeur the kings court at versailles became the sun round which gravitated the fate and fortune of his twenty million subjects admission within its gates was itself a mark of royal favour now any person with fifteen cents may ride out from paris on the doubledecked street car and wander about the palace at will for a five cent tip to a guide you may look through the private apartments of marie antoinette and for two cents you may check your umbrella while you inspect the bedroom of napoleon the first for nothing at all you may stand on the vast terrace behind the château and picture to yourself the throng of gay ladies in paniered skirts and powdered gentlemen in seagreen inexpressibles who walked among its groves and fountains two hundred years ago the palace of the kings has become the playground of the democracy  the palaceor the château as it is modestly namedstands crosswise upon an elevation that dominates the scene for miles around the whole building throughout is only of three stories for french architecture has a horror of high buildings the two great wings of the château reach sideways north and south and one a shorter one runs westwards towards the rear in the front space between the wings is a vast paved courtyardthe royal courtshut in by a massive iron fence into this court penetrated one autumn evening in 1789 the raging mob led by the women of paris who had come to drag the descendant of the grand monarch into the captivity that ended only with the guillotine here they lighted their bonfires and here they sang and shrieked and shivered throughout the night that night of the fifth of october was the real end of monarchy in france  no one i thinknot even my friend from kansas who boasted that he had put in three hours at versaillescould see all that is within the château but there are certain things which no tourist passes by one of them is the suite of rooms of louis xiv a great series of square apartments all opening sideways into each other with gilded doors as large as those of a barn and with about as much privacy as a railway station one room was the kings council chamber next to this a larger one was the wigroom where the royal mind selected its wig for the day and where the royal hairdresser performed his stupendous task besides this again is the kings bedroom preserved in it within a little fence still stands the bed in which louis xiv died in 1715 after a reign of seventytwo years the bedroom would easily hold three hundred people outside of it is a great antechamber where the courtiers jealously waited their turn to be present at the kings lever or getting up eager to have the supreme honour of holding the royal breeches  but if the kings apartments are sumptuous they are as nothing to the hall of mirrors the showroom of the whole palace and estimated to be the most magnificent single room in the world it extends clear across the end of the rear wing and has a length of 236 feet it is lighted by vast windows that reach almost to the lofty arch that forms its ceiling the floor is of polished inlaid wood on which there stood in louis the greats time tables chairs and other furniture of solid silver the whole inner side of the room is formed by seventeen enormous mirrors set in spaces to correspond in shape to the window opposite and fitted in between with polished marble above them runs a cornice of glittering gilt and over that again the ceiling curves in a great arch each panel of it bearing some picture to recall the victories of the grand monarch ungrateful posterity has somewhat forgotten the tremendous military achievements of louis xivthe hardships of his campaign in the netherlands in which the staff of the royal cuisine was cut down to one hundred cooksthe passage of the rhine in which the king actually crossed the river from one side to the other and so on but the student of history can live again the triumphs of louis in this hall of mirrors it is an irony of history that in this room after the conquest of 1871 the king of prussia was proclaimed german emperor by his subjects and his allies  but if one wants to see battle pictures one has but to turn to the north wing of the château there you have them room after roomtwenty thirty fifty roomsfuli dont know how manythe famous gallery of battles depicting the whole military history of france from the days of king clovis till the french revolution they run in historical order the pictures begin with battles of early barbariansmen with long hair wielding huge battleaxes with their eyes blazing while other barbarians prod at them with pikes or take a sweep at them with a twohanded club after that there are rooms full of crusade picturescrusaders fighting the arabs crusaders investing jerusalem crusaders raising the siege of malta and others raising the siege of rhodes all very picturesque with the blue mediterranean the yellow sand of the desert prancing steeds in nickelplated armour and knights plumed and caparisoned or whatever it is and wearing as many crosses as an ambulance emergency staff all of these battles were apparently quite harmless that is the strange thing about these battle pictures the whole thing as depicted for the royal eye is wonderfully full of colour and picturesque but as far as one can see quite harmless nobody seems to be getting hurt wildlooking men are swinging maces round but you can see that they wont hit anybody a battleaxe is being brought down with terrific force but somebody is thrusting up a steel shield just in time to meet it there are no signs of blood or injury everybody seems to be getting along finely and to be having the most invigorating physical exercise here and here perhaps the artist depicts somebody jammed down under a beam or lying under the feet of a horse but if you look close you see that the beam isnt really pressing on him and that the horse is not really stepping on his stomach in fact the man is perfectly comfortable and is at the moment taking aim at somebody else with a twostring crossbow which would have deadly effect if he wasnt ass enough to aim right at the middle of a cowhide shield  you notice this quality more and more in the pictures as the history moves on after the invention of gunpowder when the combatants didnt have to be locked together but could be separated by fields and little groves and quaint farmhouses the battle seems to get quite lost in the scenery it spreads out into the landscape until it becomes one of the prettiest quietest scenes that heart could wish i know nothing so drowsily comfortable as the pictures in this gallery that show the battles of the seventeenth centurythe grand monarchs own particular epoch this is a wide rolling landscape with here and there little clusters of soldiers to add a touch of colour to the foliage of the woods there are woolly little puffs of smoke rising in places to show that the artillery is at its dreamy work on a hill side near the foreground is a small group of generals standing about a tree and gazing through glasses at the dim purple of the background there are sheep and cattle grazing in all the unused parts of the battle the whole thing has a touch of quiet rural feeling that goes right to the heart i have seen people from the ranching district of the middle west stand before these pictures in tears  it is strange to compare this sort of thing with some of the modern french pictures there is realism enough and to spare in them in the salon exhibition a year or two ago for instance there was one that represented lions turned loose into an arena to eat up christians i can imagine exactly how a louis quatorze artist would have dealt with the subjectan arena prettily sanded with here and there gooseberry bushes and wild gilly flowers not too wild of course lions with flowing manes in noble attitudes about to roartigers finely developed about to springchristians just going to prayand through it all a genial openair feeling very soothing to the royal senses not so the artist of today the picture in the salon is of blood there are torn limbs gnawed by crouching beasts as a dog holds and gnaws a bone there are faces being torn still quivering from the writhing bodyin fact perhaps after all there is something to be said for the way the grand monarch arranged his gallery  the battle pictures and the hall of mirrors and the fountains and so on are i say the things best worth seeing at versailles everybody says so i really wish now that i had seen them but i am free to confess that i am a poor sightseer at the best as soon as i get actually in reach of a thing it somehow dwindles in importance i had a friend once now a distinguished judge in the united states who suffered much in this way he travelled a thousand miles to reach the worlds fair but as soon as he had arrived at a comfortable hotel in chicago he was unable to find the energy to go out to the fair grounds he went once to visit niagara falls but failed to see the actual water partly because it no longer seemed necessary partly because his room in the hotel looked the other way  personally i plead guilty to something of the same spirit just where you alight from the steam tramway at versailles you will find close on your right a little openair café with tables under a trellis of green vines it is as cool a retreat of mingled sun and shadow as i know there is red wine at two francs and long imported cigars of as soft a flavour as even louis the fourteenth could have desired the idea of leaving a grotto like that to go trapesing all over a hot stuffy palace with a lot of fool tourists seemed ridiculous but i bought there a little illustrated book called the château de versailles which interested me so extremely that i decided that on some reasonable opportunity i would go and visit the place  illustration personally i plead guilty to something of the same spirit     vparis at night   what ahd like to do says the fat lady from georgia settling back comfortably in her seat after her fivedollar dinner at the café american while her husband is figuring whether ten francs is enough to give to the waiter is to go and see something real wicked ah tell him the word him is used in georgia to mean husband that while were here ah just want to see everything thats going  all right says the man from kansas who knows paris ill get a guide right here and hell take us round and show us the sights  can you get him heah asks the gentleman from georgia looking round at the glittering mirrors and gold cornices of the restaurant  can you get a guide well now can you keep away from them all day from the dewy hour of breakfast till late at night they meet you in the street and sidle up with the enquiry guide sir  where the parisian guide comes from and how he graduates for his job i do not know he is not french and as a rule he doesnt know paris he knows his way to the louvre and to two or three american bars and to the moulin rouge in montmartre but he doesnt need to know his way for that he falls back on the taxidriver now sir says the guide briskly to the gentleman who has engaged his services where would you like to go i should like to see napoleons tomb all right says the guide get into the taxi then he turns to the driver drive to napoleons tomb he says after they have looked at it the guide says what would you like to see next sir i am very anxious to see victor hugos house which i understand is now made open to the public the guide turns to the taxi man drive to victor hugos house he says  after looking through the house the visitor says in a furtive way i was just wondering if i could get a drink anywhere in this part of the town certainly says the guide drive to an american bar  isnt that simple can you imagine any more agreeable way of earning five dollars in three hours than that of course what the guide says to the taxi man is said in the french language or in something resembling it and the gentleman in the cab doesnt understand it otherwise after six or seven days of driving round in this way he begins to wonder what the guide is for but of course the guides life when you come to think of it is one full of difficulty and danger just suppose that while he was away off somewhere in victor hugos house or at napoleons grave the taxidriver were to be struck by lightning how on earth would he get home he might perhaps be up in the eiffel tower and the taxi man get a stroke of paralysis and then hed starve to death trying to find his way back after all the guide has to have the kind of pluck and hardihood that ought to be well rewarded why in other countries like switzerland they have to use dogs for it and in france when these plucky fellows throw themselves into it surely one wouldnt grudge the nominal fee of five dollars for which they risk their lives  but i am forgetting about the lady from georgia and her husband off they go in due course from the glittering doors of the restaurant in a huge taxi with a guide in a peaked hat the party is all animation the ladys face is aglow with moral enthusiasm the gentleman and his friend have their coats buttoned tight to their chins for fear that thieves might leap over the side of the taxi and steal their neckties  so they go buzzing along the lighted boulevard looking for something real wicked what they want is to see something really and truly wicked they dont know just what but something bad theyve got the idea that paris is one of the wickedest places on earth and they want to see it  illustration the ladys face is aglow with moral enthusiasm  strangely enough in their own home the lady from georgia is one of the leaders of the social purity movement and her husband whose skin at this moment is stretched as tight as a football with french brandy and soda is one of the finest speakers on the georgia temperance platform with a reputation that reaches from chattanooga to chickamauga they have a son at yale college whom they are trying to keep from smoking cigarettes but here in paris so they reckon it everything is different it doesnt occur to them that perhaps it is wicked to pay out a hundred dollars in an evening hiring other people to be wicked  so off they go and are whirled along in the brilliant glare of the boulevards and up the gloomy narrow streets that lead to montmartre they visit the moulin rouge and the bal tabarin and they see the oriental dances and the café of hell and the hundred and one other glittering fakes and false appearances that poor old meretricious paris works overtime to prepare for such people as themselves and the lady from georgia having seen it all thanks heaven that she at least is purewhich is a beginningand they go home more enthusiastic than ever in the social purity movement  but the fact is that if you have about twentyfive thousand new visitors pouring into a great city every week with their pockets full of money and clamoring for something wicked youve got to do the best you can for them  hence it results that parisin appearance anywayis a mighty gay place at night the sidewalks are crowded with the little tables of the coffee and liqueur drinkers the music of a hundred orchestras bursts forth from the lighted windows the air is soft with the fragrance of a june evening tempered by the curling smoke of fifty thousand cigars through the noise and chatter of the crowd there sounds unending the wail of the motor horn  the hours of parisian gaiety are late ordinary dinner is eaten at about seven oclock but fashionable dinners begin at eight or eight thirty theatres open at a quarter to nine and really begin at nine oclock special features and actsfamous singers and vaudeville artistsare brought on at eleven oclock so that dinnerparty people may arrive in time to see them the theatres come out at midnight after that there are the night suppers which flourish till two or half past but if you wish you can go between the theater and supper to some such sidelong place as the moulin rouge or the bal tabarin which reach the height of their supposed merriment at about one in the morning  at about two or two thirty the motors come whirling home squawking louder than ever with a speed limit of fifty miles an hour only the best of them can run faster than that quiet conservative people in paris like to get to bed at three oclock after all what is the use of keeping late hours and ruining ones health and complexion if you make it a strict rule to be in bed by three you feel all the better for it in the long runhealth better nerves steadier eyes clearerand youre able to get up earlyat halfpast elevenand feel fine  those who wont or dont go to bed at three wander about the town eat a second supper in an allnight restaurant circulate round with guides and visit the slums of the market where gaunteyed wretches sleep in crowded alleys in the mephitic air of a summer night and where the idle rich may feed their luxurious curiosity on the sufferings of the idle poor  the dinners the theaters the boulevards and the rest of it are all fun enough at any rate for one visit in a lifetime the real wicked part of it is practically fakeserved up for the curious foreigner with money to throw away the moulin rouge whirls the wide sails of its huge sign crimson with electric bulbs amid the false glaze of the place blanche inside of it there is more redthe full red of bad claret and the bright red of congested faces and painted cheeks part of the place is a theater with a vaudeville show much like any other another part is a vast promenoir where you may walk up and down or sit at a little table and drink bad brandy at one franc and a half in a fenced off part are the oriental dances a familiar feature of every parisian show these dancesat twenty cents a turnare supposed to represent all the languishing allurement of the oriental hourii think that is the word the dancers in parisit is only fair to statehave never been nearer to the orient than the faubourg st antoine where they were brought up and where they learned all the orientalism that they know their dance is performed with their feet continuously on the groundnever lifted i meanand is done by gyrations of the stomach beside which the paroxysms of an overdose of paris green are childs play in seeing these dances one realizes all the horrors of life in the east  not everyone however can be an oriental dancer in a french pleasure show to qualify you must be as scrawny as a parisian cabhorse and it appears as if few débutantes could break into the profession under the age of forty the dances go on at intervals till two in the morning after which the oriental houri crawls to her home at the same time as the parisian cabhorseher companion in arms  under the moulin rouge and in all similar places is a huge dance hall it has a hungarian orchestraa fact which is proved by the red and green jackets the tyrolese caps and by the printed sign which says this is a hungarian orchestra i knew that they were hungarians the night i saw them because i distinctly heard one of them say what tell do we play next boys the reference to william tell was obvious after every four tunes the orchestra are given a tall stein of beer and they all stand up and drink it shouting hoch or ha or hoo or something of the sort this is supposed to give a high touch of local colour everybody knows how hungarians always shout out loud when they see a glass of beer ive noticed it again and again in sugar refineries  the hungarians have to drink the beer whether they like it or notits part of their contract i noticed one poor fellow who was playing the long bassoon and who was doing a double nightshift overtime hed had twentyfour pints of beer already and there were still two hours before closing time you could tell what he was feeling like by the sobbing of his instrument but he stood up every now and then and yelled hoch or hiccoughor whatever it wasalong with the others  on the big floor in front of the hungarians the dance goes on most of the time the dances are endless waltzes and polkas shared in by the nondescript frequenters of the place while the tourist visitors sit behind a railing and watch to look at the dancing is about as interesting nothing more or less than the round dances at a canadian picnic on the first of july  every now and then to liven things up comes the cancan in theory this is a wild dance breaking out from sheer ebullience of spirit and shared in by a bevy of merry girls carried away by gaiety and joy of living in reality the cancan is performed by eight or ten old nagsexoriental dancers i should thinkat eighty cents a night but they are deserving women and work hardlike all the rest of the brigade in the factory of parisian gaiety  after the moulin rouge or the bal tabarin or such comes of course a visit to one of the night cafés of the montmartre district their names in themselves are supposed to indicate their weird and alluring characterthe café of heaven the café of nothingness andhow dreadfulthe café of hell montmartre says one of the latest english writers on paris is the scene of all that is wild mad and extravagant nothing is too grotesque too terrible too eccentric for the montmartre mind fiddlesticks what he means is that nothing is too damn silly for people to pay to go to see  take for example the notorious café of hell the portals are low and gloomy you enter in the dark a password is givenstranger who cometh heremore food for worms you sit and eat among coffins and shrouds there are muffled figures shuffling around to represent monks in cowls saints demons and apostles the angel gabriel watches at the door father time moves among the eaters the waiters are dressed as undertakers there are skulls and crossbones in the walls the light is that of dim tapers and so on  and yet i suppose some of the foreign visitors to the café of hell think that this is a truly french home scene and discuss the queer characteristics of the french people suggested by it  i got to know a family in paris that worked in one of these montmartre night cafésquiet decent people they were with a little home of their own in the suburbs the father worked as beelzebub mostly but he could double with st anthony and do a very fair st luke when it was called for the mother worked as mary magdalene but had grown so stout that it was hard for her to hold it there were two boys one of whom was working as john the baptist but had been promised to be promoted to judas iscariot in the fall they were good people and worked well but were tired of their present place like everyone else they had heard of canada and thought of coming out they were very anxious to know what openings there were in their line whether there would be any call for a judas iscariot in a canadian restaurant or whether a man would have any chance as st anthony in the west  i told them frankly that these jobs were pretty well filled up  listen it is striking three the motors are whirling down the asphalt street the brilliant lights of the boulevard windows are fading out here as in the silent woods of canada night comes at last the restless city of pleasure settles to its short sleep     the retroactive existence of mr juggins     the retroactive existence of mr juggins   i first met jugginsreally to notice himyears and years ago as a boy out camping somebody was trying to nail up a board on a tree for a shelf and juggins interfered to help him  stop a minute he said you need to saw the end of that board off before you put it up then juggins looked round for a saw and when he got it he had hardly made more than a stroke or two with it before he stopped this saw he said needs to be filed up a bit so he went and hunted up a file to sharpen the saw but found that before he could use the file he needed to put a proper handle on it and to make a handle he went to look for a sapling in the bush but to cut the sapling he found that he needed to sharpen up the axe to do this of course he had to fix the grindstone so as to make it run properly this involved making wooden legs for the grindstone to do this decently juggins decided to make a carpenters bench this was quite impossible without a better set of tools juggins went to the village to get the tools required and of course he never came back  he was rediscoveredweeks laterin the city getting prices on wholesale tool machinery  after that first episode i got to know juggins very well for some time we were students at college together but juggins somehow never got far with his studies he always began with great enthusiasm and then something happened for a time he studied french with tremendous eagerness but he soon found that for a real knowledge of french you need first to get a thorough grasp of old french and provençal but it proved impossible to do anything with these without an absolutely complete command of latin this juggins discovered could only be obtained in any thorough way through sanskrit which of course lies at the base of it so juggins devoted himself to sanskrit until he realised that for a proper understanding of sanskrit one needs to study the ancient iranian the rootlanguage underneath this language however is lost  so juggins had to begin over again he did it is true make some progress in natural science he studied physics and rushed rapidly backwards from forces to molecules and from molecules to atoms and from atoms to electrons and then his whole studies exploded backward into the infinities of space still searching a first cause  juggins of course never took a degree so he made no practical use of his education but it didnt matter he was very well off and was able to go straight into business with a capital of about a hundred thousand dollars he put it at first into a gas plant but found that he lost money at that because of the high price of the coal needed to make gas so he sold out for ninety thousand dollars and went into coal mining this was unsuccessful because of the awful cost of mining machinery so juggins sold his share in the mine for eighty thousand dollars and went in for manufacturing mining machinery at this he would have undoubtedly made money but for the enormous cost of gas needed as motivepower for the plant juggins sold out of the manufacture for seventy thousand and after that he went whirling in a circle like skating backwards through the different branches of allied industry  he lost a certain amount of money each year especially in good years when trade was brisk in dull times when everything was unsalable he did fairly well  juggins domestic life was very quiet  of course he never married he did it is true fall in love several times but each time it ended without result i remember well his first love story for i was very intimate with him at the time he had fallen in love with the girl in question utterly and immediately it was literally love at first sight there was no doubt of his intentions as soon as he had met her he was quite frank about it i intend he said to ask her to be my wife  when i asked right away  no he said i want first to fit myself to be worthy of her  so he went into moral training to fit himself he taught in a sunday school for six weeks till he realised that a man has no business in divine work of that sort without first preparing himself by serious study of the history of palestine and he felt that a man was a cad to force his society on a girl while he is still only half acquainted with the history of the israelites so juggins stayed away it was nearly two years before he was fit to propose by the time he was fit the girl had already married a brainless thing in patent leather boots who didnt even know who moses was  of course juggins fell in love again people always do and at any rate by this time he was in a state of moral fitness that made it imperative  so he fell in lovedeeply in love this timewith a charming girl commonly known as the eldest miss thorneycroft she was only called eldest because she had five younger sisters and she was very poor and awfully clever and trimmed all her own hats any man if hes worth the name falls in love with that sort of thing at first sight so of course juggins would have proposed to her only when he went to the house he met her next sister and of course she was younger still and i suppose poorer and made not only her own hats but her own blouses so juggins fell in love with her but one night when he went to call the door was opened by the sister younger still who not only made her own blouses and trimmed her own hats but even made her own tailormade suits after that juggins backed up from sister to sister till he went through the whole family and in the end got none of them  perhaps it was just as well that juggins never married it would have made things very difficult because of course he got poorer all the time you see after he sold out his last share in his last business he bought with it a diminishing life annuity so planned that he always got rather less next year than this year and still less the year after thus if he lived long enough he would starve to death  meantime he has become a quaintlooking elderly man with coats a little too short and trousers a little above his bootslike a boy his face too is like that of a boy with wrinkles  and his talk now has grown to be always reminiscent he is perpetually telling long stories of amusing times that he has had with different people that he names  he says for example  i remember a rather queer thing that happened to me in a train one day  and if you saywhen was that jugginshe looks at you in a vague way as if calculating and saysin 1875 or 1876 i think as near as i recall it  i notice too that his reminiscences are going further and further back he used to base his stories on his recollections as a young man now they are further back  the other day he told me a story about himself and two people that he called the harper brothersned and joe ned he said was a tremendously powerful fellow  i asked how old ned was and juggins said that he was three he added that there was another brother not so old but a very clever fellow abouthere juggins paused and calculatedabout eighteen months  so then i realised where juggins retroactive existence is carrying him to he has passed back through childhood into infancy and presently just as his annuity runs to a point and vanishes he will back up clear through the curtain of existence and dieor be born i dont know which to call it  meantime he remains to me as one of the most illuminating allegories i have met  illustration meanwhile he had become a quaintlooking elderly man     making a magazine  the dream of a contributor     making a magazine   i dreamt one night not long ago that i was the editor of a great illustrated magazine i offer no apology for this i have often dreamt even worse of myself than that  in any case i didnt do it on purpose very often i admit i try to dream that i am president wilson or mr bryan or the ritzcarlton hotel or a share of stock in the standard oil co for the sheer luxury and cheapness of it but this was an accident i had been sitting up late at night writing personal reminiscences of abraham lincoln i was writing against time the presidential election was drawing nearer every day and the market for reminiscences of lincoln was extremely brisk but of course might collapse any moment writers of my class have to consider this sort of thing for instance in the middle of lent i find that i can do fairly well with recent lights on the scriptures then of course when the hot weather comes the market for christmas poetry opens and theres a fairly good demand for voyages in the polar seas later on in the quiet of the autumn i generally write some unpublished letters from goethe to balzac and that sort of thing  but its a wearing occupation full of disappointments and needing the very keenest business instinct to watch every turn of the market  i am afraid that this is a digression i only wanted to explain how a mans mind could be so harassed and overwrought as to make him dream that he was an editor  i knew at once in my dream where and what i was as soon as i saw the luxury of the surroundingsthe spacious room with its vaulted ceiling lit with stained glassthe beautiful mahogany table at which i sat writing with a tendollar fountain pen the gift of the manufacturerson embossed stationery the gift of the embosserson which i was setting down words at eight and a half cents a word and deliberately picking out short ones through sheer business acutenessas soon as i sawthis i said to myself  i am an editor and this is my editorial sanctum not that i have ever seen an editor or a sanctum but i have sent so many manuscripts to so many editors and received them back with such unfailing promptness that the scene before me was as familiar to my eye as if i had been wide awake  as i thus mused revelling in the charm of my surroundings and admiring the luxurious black alpaca coat and the dainty dickie which i wore there was a knock at the door  a beautiful creature entered she evidently belonged to the premises for she wore no hat and there were white cuffs upon her wrists she has that indescribable beauty of effectiveness such as is given to hospital nurses  this i thought to myself must be my private secretary  i hope i dont interrupt you sir said the girl  my dear child i answered speaking in that fatherly way in which an editor might well address a girl almost young enough to be his wife pray do not mention it sit down you must be fatigued after your labours of the morning let me ring for a club sandwich  i came to say sir the secretary went on that theres a person downstairs waiting to see you  my manner changed at once  is he a gentleman or a contributor i asked  he doesnt look exactly like a gentleman  very good i said hes a contributor for sure tell him to wait ask the caretaker to lock him in the coal cellar and kindly slip out and see if theres a policeman on the beat in case i need him  very good sir said the secretary  i waited for about an hour wrote a few editorials advocating the rights of the people smoked some turkish cigarettes drank a glass of sherry and ate part of an anchovy sandwich  then i rang the bell bring that man here i said  presently they brought him in he was a timidlooking man with an embarrassed manner and all the low cunning of an author stamped on his features i could see a bundle of papers in his hand and i knew that the scoundrel was carrying a manuscript  now sir i said speak quickly whats your business  ive got here a manuscript he began  what i shouted at him a manuscript youd dare would you bringing manuscripts in here what sort of a place do you think this is  its the manuscript of a story he faltered  a story i shrieked what on earth do you think wed want stories for do you think weve nothing better to do than to print your idiotic ravings have you any idea you idiot of the expense were put to in setting up our fifty pages of illustrated advertising look here i continued seizing a bundle of proof illustrations that lay in front of me do you see this charming picture of an asbestos cooker guaranteed fireless odourless and purposeless do you see this patent motorcar with pneumatic cushions and the fullpage description of its properties can you form any idea of the time and thought that we have to spend on these things and yet you dare to come in here with your miserable stories by heaven i said rising in my seat ive a notion to come over there and choke you im entitled to do it by the law and i think i will  dont dont he pleaded ill go away i meant no harm ill take it with me  no you dont i interrupted none of your sharp tricks with this magazine youve submitted this manuscript to me and it stays submitted if i dont like it i shall prosecute you and i trust obtain full reparation from the courts  illustration with all the low cunning of an author stamped on his features  to tell the truth it had occurred to me that perhaps i might need after all to buy the miserable stuff even while i felt that my indignation at the low knavery of the fellow was justified i knew that it might be necessary to control it the present low state of public taste demands a certain amount of this kind of matter distributed among the advertising  i rang the bell again  please take this man away and shut him up again have them keep a good eye on him hes an author  very good sir said the secretary  i called her back for one moment  dont feed him anything i said  no said the girl  the manuscript lay before me on the table it looked bulky it bore the title dorothy dacres or only a clergymans daughter  i rang the bell again  kindly ask the janitor to step this way  he came in i could see from the straight honest look in his features that he was a man to be relied upon  jones i said can you read  yes sir he said some  very good i want you to take this manuscript and read it read it all through and then bring it back here  the janitor took the manuscript and disappeared i turned to my desk again and was soon absorbed in arranging a fullpage display of plumbers furnishings for the advertising it had occurred to me that by arranging the picture matter in a neat device with verses from home sweet home running through it in doubleleaded old english type i could set up a page that would be the delight of all business readers and make this number of the magazine a conspicuous success my mind was so absorbed that i scarcely noticed that over an hour elapsed before the janitor returned  well jones i said as he entered have you read that manuscript  yes sir  and you find it all rightpunctuation good spelling all correct  very good indeed sir  and there is i trust nothing of what one would call a humorous nature in it i want you to answer me quite frankly jonesthere is nothing in it that would raise a smile or even a laugh is there  oh no sir said jones nothing at all  and now tell mefor remember that the reputation of our magazine is at stakedoes this story make a decided impression on you has it and here i cast my eye casually at the latest announcement of a rival publication the kind of tour de force which at once excites you to the full qui vive and which contains a sustained brio that palpitates on every page answer carefully jones because if it hasnt i wont buy it  i think it has he said  very well i answered now bring the author to me  in the interval of waiting i hastily ran my eye through the pages of the manuscript  presently they brought the author back again he had assumed a look of depression  i have decided i said to take your manuscript  joy broke upon his face he came nearer to me as if to lick my hand  stop a minute i said i am willing to take your story but there are certain things certain small details which i want to change  yes he said timidly  in the first place i dont like your title dorothy dacres or only a clergymans daughter is too quiet i shall change it to read dorothea dashaway or the quicksands of society  but surely began the contributor beginning to wring his hands  dont interrupt me i said in the next place the story is much too long here i reached for a large pair of tailors scissors that lay on the table this story contains nine thousand words we never care to use more than six thousand i must therefore cut some of it off i measured the story carefully with a pocket tape that lay in front of me cut off three thousand words and handed them back to the author these words i said you may keep we make no claim on them at all you are at liberty to make any use of them that you like  but please he said you have cut off all the end of the story the whole conclusion is gone the readers cant possibly tell  i smiled at him with something approaching kindness  my dear sir i said they never get beyond three thousand words of the end of a magazine story the end is of no consequence whatever the beginning i admit may be but the end come come and in any case in our magazine we print the end of each story separately distributed among the advertisements to break the type but just at present we have plenty of these on hand you see i continued for there was something in the mans manner that almost touched me all that is needed is that the last words printed must have a look of finality thats all now let me see and i turned to the place where the story was cut what are the last words here dorothea sank into a chair there we must leave her excellent what better end could you want she sank into a chair and you leave her nothing more natural  the contributor seemed about to protest but i stopped him  there is one other small thing i said our coming number is to be a plumbers and motor number i must ask you to introduce a certain amount of plumbing into your story i rapidly turned over the pages i see i said that your story as written is laid largely in spain in the summer i shall ask you to alter this to switzerland and make it winter time to allow for the breaking of steampipes such things as these however are mere details we can easily arrange them  i reached out my hand  and now i said i must wish you a good afternoon  the contributor seemed to pluck up courage  what about remunerationhe faltered  i waived the question gravely aside you will of course be duly paid at our usual rate you receive a cheque two years after publication it will cover all your necessary expenses including ink paper string sealingwax and other incidentals in addition to which we hope to be able to make you a compensation for your time on a reasonable basis per hour goodbye  he left and i could hear them throwing him downstairs  then i sat down while my mind was on it and wrote the advance notice of the story it ran like this          next months number of the megalomania                magazine will contain a               thrilling story entitled    dorothea dashaway or the quicksands of society  the author has lately leaped into immediate recognition as the greatest master of the short story in the american world his style has a brio a poise a savoir faire a je ne sais quoi which stamps all his work with the cachet of literary superiority the sum paid for the story of dorothea dashaway is said to be the largest ever paid for a single ms every page palpitates with interest and at the conclusion of this remarkable narrative the reader lays down the page in utter bewilderment to turn perhaps to the almost equally marvellous illustration of messrs spiggott and fawcetts home plumbing device exposition which adorns the same number of the great review  i wrote this out rang the bell and was just beginning to say to the secretary  my dear childpray pardon my forgetfulness you must be famished for lunch will you permit me  and then i woke upat the wrong minute as one always does     homer and humbug  an academic discussion     homer and humbug an academic discussion   the following discussion is of course only of interest to scholars but as the public schools returns show that in the united states there are now over a million coloured scholars alone the appeal is wide enough  i do not mind confessing that for a long time past i have been very sceptical about the classics i was myself trained as a classical scholar it seemed the only thing to do with me i acquired such a singular facility in handling latin and greek that i could take a page of either of them distinguish which it was by merely glancing at it and with the help of a dictionary and a pair of compasses whip off a translation of it in less than three hours  but i never got any pleasure from it i lied about it at first perhaps i lied through vanity any coloured scholar will understand the feeling later on i lied through habit later still because after all the classics were all that i had and so i valued them i have seen thus a deceived dog value a pup with a broken leg and a pauper child nurse a dead doll with the sawdust out of it so i nursed my dead homer and my broken demosthenes though i knew in my heart that there was more sawdust in the stomach of one modern author than in the whole lot of them observe i am not saying which it is that has it full of it  so as i say i began to lie about the classics i said to people who knew no greek that there was a sublimity a majesty about homer which they could never hope to grasp i said it was like the sound of the sea beating against the granite cliffs of the ionian esophagus or words to that effect as for the truth of it i might as well have said that it was like the sound of a rum distillery running a night shift on half time at any rate this is what i said about homer and when i spoke of pindarthe dainty grace of his strophesand aristophanes the delicious sallies of his wit sally after sally each sally explained in a note calling it a sallyi managed to suffuse my face with an animation which made it almost beautiful  i admitted of course that virgil in spite of his genius had a hardness and a cold glitter which resembled rather the brilliance of a cut diamond than the soft grace of a flower certainly i admitted this the mere admission of it would knock the breath out of anyone who was arguing  from such talks my friends went away sad the conclusion was too cruel it had all the cold logic of a syllogism like that almost brutal form of argument so much admired in the paraphernalia of socrates for if    virgil and homer and pindar had all this grace and pith and     these sallies   and if i read virgil and homer and pindar   and if they only read mrs wharton and mrs humphrey ward   then where were they  so continued lying brought its own reward in the sense of superiority and i lied more  when i reflect that i have openly expressed regret as a personal matter even in the presence of women for the missing books of tacitus and the entire loss of the abacadabra of polyphemus of syracuse i can find no words in which to beg for pardon in reality i was just as much worried over the loss of the ichthyosaurus more indeed id like to have seen it but if the books tacitus lost were like those he didnt i wouldnt  i believe all scholars lie like this an ancient friend of mine a clergyman tells me that in hesiod he finds a peculiar grace that he doesnt find elsewhere hes a liar thats all another man in politics and in the legislature tells me that every night before going to bed he reads over a page or two of thucydides to keep his mind fresh either he never goes to bed or hes a liar doubly so no one could read greek at that frantic rate and anyway his mind isnt fresh how could it be hes in the legislature i dont object to this man talking freely of the classics but he ought to keep it for the voters my own opinion is that before he goes to bed he takes whiskey why call it thucydides  i know there are solid arguments advanced in favour of the classics i often hear them from my colleagues my friend the professor of greek tells me that he truly believes the classics have made him what he is this is a very grave statement if well founded indeed i have heard the same argument from a great many latin and greek scholars they all claim with some heat that latin and greek have practically made them what they are this damaging charge against the classics should not be too readily accepted in my opinion some of these men would have been what they are no matter what they were  be this as it may i for my part bitterly regret the lies i have told about my appreciation of latin and greek literature i am anxious to do what i can to set things right i am therefore engaged on indeed have nearly completed a work which will enable all readers to judge the matter for themselves what i have done is a translation of all the great classics not in the usual literal way but on a design that brings them into harmony with modern life i will explain what i mean in a minute  the translation is intended to be within reach of everybody it is so designed that the entire set of volumes can go on a shelf twentyseven feet long or even longer the first edition will be an édition de luxe bound in vellum or perhaps in buckskin and sold at five hundred dollars it will be limited to five hundred copies and of course sold only to the feeble minded the next edition will be the literary edition sold to artists authors actors and contractors after that will come the boarding house edition bound in board and paid for in the same way  my plan is to so transpose the classical writers as to give not the literal translation word for word but what is really the modern equivalent let me give an odd sample or two to show what i mean take the passage in the first book of homer that describes ajax the greek dashing into the battle in front of troy here is the way it runs as nearly as i remember in the usual word for word translation of the classroom as done by the very best professor his spectacles glittering with the literary rapture of it          then he too ajax on the one hand leaped or         possibly jumped into the fight wearing on the         other hand yes certainly a steel corselet or         possibly a bronze under tunic and on his head         of course yes without doubt he had a helmet         with a tossing plume taken from the mane or         perhaps extracted from the tail of some horse         which once fed along the banks of the scamander         and it sees the herd and raises its head and         paws the ground and in his hand a shield worth         a hundred oxen and on his knees too especially         in particular greaves made by some cunning         artificer or perhaps blacksmith and he blows         the fire and it is hot thus ajax leapt or         better was propelled from behind into the         fight  now thats grand stuff there is no doubt of it theres a wonderful movement and force to it you can almost see it move it goes so fast but the modern reader cant get it it wont mean to him what it meant to the early greek the setting the costume the scene has all got to be changed in order to let the reader have a real equivalent to judge just how good the greek verse is in my translation i alter it just a little not much but just enough to give the passage a form that reproduces the proper literary value of the verses without losing anything of the majesty it describes i may say the directors of the american industrial stocks rushing into the balkan war cloud          then there came rushing to the shock of war         mr mcnicoll of the c p r         he wore suspenders and about his throat         high rose the collar of a sealskin coat         he had on gaiters and he wore a tie         he had his trousers buttoned good and high         about his waist a woollen undervest         bought from a sadeyed farmer of the west         and every time he clips a sheep he sees         some bloated plutocrat who ought to freeze         thus in the stock exchange he burst to view         leaped to the post and shouted ninetytwo  there thats homer the real thing just as it sounded to the rude crowd of greek peasants who sat in a ring and guffawed at the rhymes and watched the minstrel stamp it out into feet as he recited it  or let me take another example from the socalled catalogue of the ships that fills up nearly an entire book of homer this famous passage names all the ships one by one and names the chiefs who sailed on them and names the particular town or hill or valley that they came from it has been much admired it has that same majesty of style that has been brought to an even loftier pitch in the new york business directory and the city telephone book it runs along as i recall it something like this  and first indeed oh yes was the ship of homistogetes the spartan long and swift having both its masts covered with cowhide and two rows of oars and he homistogetes was born of hermogenes and ophthalmia and was at home in syncope beside the fast flowing paresis and after him came the ship of preposterus the eurasian son of oasis and hyteria    and so on endlessly  instead of this i substitute with the permission of the new york central railway the official catalogue of their locomotives taken almost word for word from the list compiled by their superintendent of works i admit that he wrote in hot weather part of it runs          out in the yard and steaming in the sun         stands locomotive engine number fortyone         seated beside the windows of the cab         are pat mcgaw and peter james mcnab         pat comes from troy and peter from cohoes         and when they pull the throttle off she goes         and as she vanishes there comes to view         steam locomotive engine number fortytwo         observe her mighty wheels her easy roll         with william j macarthy in control         they say her engineer some time ago         lived on a farm outside of buffalo         whereas his fireman henry edward foy         attended school in springfield illinois         thus does the race of man decay or rot         some men can hold their jobs and some can not  please observe that if homer had actually written that last line it would have been quoted for a thousand years as one of the deepest sayings ever said orators would have rounded out their speeches with the majestic phrase quoted in sonorous and unintelligible greek verse some men can hold their jobs and some can not essayists would have begun their most scholarly dissertations with the wordsit has been finely said by homer that in greek some men can hold their jobs and the clergy in midpathos of a funeral sermon would have raised their eyes aloft and echoed some men can not  this is what i should like to do id like to take a large stone and write on it in very plain writing  the classics are only primitive literature they belong in the same class as primitive machinery and primitive music and primitive medicineand then throw it through the windows of a university and hide behind a fence to see the professors buzz  illustration
