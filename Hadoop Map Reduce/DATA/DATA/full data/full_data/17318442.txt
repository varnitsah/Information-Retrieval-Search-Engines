17318442	allan and the holy flower  by h rider haggard  first published 1915      chapter i                               brother john  i do not suppose that anyone who knows the name of allan quatermain would be likely to associate it with flowers and especially with orchids yet as it happens it was once my lot to take part in an orchid hunt of so remarkable a character that i think its details should not be lost at least i will set them down and if in the after days anyone cares to publish them wellhe is at liberty to do so  it was in the yearoh never mind the year it was a long while ago when i was much younger that i went on a hunting expedition to the north of the limpopo river which borders the transvaal my companion was a gentleman of the name of scroope charles scroope he had come out to durban from england in search of sport at least that was one of his reasons the other was a lady whom i will call miss margaret manners though that was not her name  it seems that these two were engaged to be married and really attached to each other unfortunately however they quarrelled violently about another gentlemen with whom miss manners danced four consecutive dances including two that were promised to her fiancé at a hunt ball in essex where they all lived explanations or rather argument followed mr scroope said that he would not tolerate such conduct miss manners replied that she would not be dictated to she was her own mistress and meant to remain so mr scroope exclaimed that she might so far as he was concerned she answered that she never wished to see his face again he declared with emphasis that she never should and that he was going to africa to shoot elephants  what is more he went starting from his essex home the next day without leaving any address as it transpired afterwards long afterwards had he waited till the post came in he would have received a letter that might have changed his plans but they were highspirited young people both of them and played the fool after the fashion of those in love  well charles scroope turned up in durban which was but a poor place then and there we met in the bar of the royal hotel  if you want to kill big game i heard some one say who it was i really forget theres the man to show you how to do ithunter quatermain the best shot in africa and one of the finest fellows too  i sat still smoking my pipe and pretending to hear nothing it is awkward to listen to oneself being praised and i was always a shy man  then after a whispered colloquy mr scroope was brought forward and introduced to me i bowed as nicely as i could and ran my eye over him he was a tall young man with dark eyes and a rather romantic aspect that was due to his love affair but i came to the conclusion that i liked the cut of his jib when he spoke that conclusion was affirmed i always think there is a great deal in a voice personally i judge by it almost as much as by the face this voice was particularly pleasant and sympathetic though there was nothing very original or striking in the words by which it was so to speak introduced to me these were  how do you do sir will you have a split  i answered that i never drank spirits in the daytime or at least not often but that i should be pleased to take a small bottle of beer  when the beer was consumed we walked up together to my little house on which is now called the berea the same in which amongst others i received my friends curtis and good in after days and there we dined indeed charlie scroope never left that house until we started on our shooting expedition  now i must cut all this story short since it is only incidentally that it has to do with the tale i am going to tell mr scroope was a rich man and as he offered to pay all the expenses of the expedition while i was to take all the profit in the shape of ivory or anything else that might accrue of course i did not decline his proposal  everything went well with us on that trip until its unfortunate end we only killed two elephants but of other game we found plenty it was when we were near delagoa bay on our return that the accident happened  we were out one evening trying to shoot something for our dinner when between the trees i caught sight of a small buck it vanished round a little promontory of rock which projected from the side of the kloof walking quietly not running in alarm we followed after it i was the first and had just wriggled round these rocks and perceived the buck standing about ten paces away it was a bushbok when i heard a rustle among the bushes on the top of the rock not a dozen feet above my head and charlie scroopes voice calling  look out quatermain hes coming  whos coming i answered in an irritated tone for the noise had made the buck run away  then it occurred to me all in an instant of course that a man would not begin to shout like that for nothing at any rate when his supper was concerned so i glanced up above and behind me to this moment i can remember exactly what i saw there was the granite waterworn boulder or rather several boulders with ferns growing in their cracks of the maidenhair tribe most of them but some had a silver sheen on the under side of their leaves on one of these leaves bending it down sat a large beetle with red wings and a black body engaged in rubbing its antennæ with its front paws and above just appearing over the top of the rock was the head of an extremely fine leopard as i write to seem to perceive its square jowl outlined against the arc of the quiet evening sky with the saliva dropping from its lips  this was the last thing which i did perceive for a little while since at that moment the leopardwe call them tigers in south africadropped upon my back and knocked me flat as a pancake i presume that it also had been stalking the buck and was angry at my appearance on the scene down i went luckily for me into a patch of mossy soil  all up i said to myself for i felt the brutes weight upon my back pressing me down among the moss and what was worse its hot breath upon my neck as it dropped its jaws to bite me in the head then i heard the report of scroopes rifle followed by furious snarling from the leopard which evidently had been hit also it seemed to think that i had caused its injuries for it seized me by the shoulder i felt its teeth slip along my skin but happily they only fastened in the shooting coat of tough corduroy that i was wearing it began to shake me then let go to get a better grip now remembering that scroope only carried a light singlebarrelled rifle and therefore could not fire again i knew or thought i knew that my time had come i was not exactly afraid but the sense of some great impending chance became very vivid i rememberednot my whole life but one or two odd little things connected with my infancy for instance i seemed to see myself seated on my mothers knee playing with a little jointed goldfish which she wore upon her watchchain  after this i muttered a word or two of supplication and i think lost consciousness if so it can only have been for a few seconds then my mind returned to me and i saw a strange sight the leopard and scroope were fighting each other the leopard standing on one hind leg for the other was broken seemed to be boxing scroope whilst scroope was driving his big hunting knife into the brutes carcase they went down scroope undermost the leopard tearing at him i gave a wriggle and came out of that mossy bedi recall the sucking sound my body made as it left the ooze  close by was my rifle uninjured and at full cock as it had fallen from my hand i seized it and in another second had shot the leopard through the head just as it was about to seize scroopes throat  it fell stone dead on the top of him one quiver one contraction of the claws in poor scroopes leg and all was over there it lay as though it were asleep and underneath was scroope  the difficulty was to get it off him for the beast was very heavy but i managed this at last with the help of a thorn bough i found which some elephant had torn from a tree this i used as a lever there beneath lay scroope literally covered with blood though whether his own or the leopards i could not tell at first i thought that he was dead but after i had poured some water over him from the little stream that trickled down the rock he sat up and asked inconsequently  what am i now  a hero i answered i have always been proud of that repartee  then discouraging further conversation i set to work to get him back to the camp which fortunately was close at hand  when we had proceeded a couple of hundred yards he still making inconsequent remarks his right arm round my neck and my left arm round his middle suddenly he collapsed in a dead faint and as his weight was more than i could carry i had to leave him and fetch help  in the end i got him to the tents by aid of the kaffirs and a blanket and there made an examination he was scratched all over but the only serious wounds were a bite through the muscles of the left upper arm and three deep cuts in the right thigh just where it joins the body caused by a stroke of the leopards claws i gave him a dose of laudanum to send him to sleep and dressed these hurts as best i could for three days he went on quite well indeed the wounds had begun to heal healthily when suddenly some kind of fever took him caused i suppose by the poison of the leopards fangs or claws  oh what a terrible week was that which followed he became delirious raving continually of all sorts of things and especially of miss margaret manners i kept up his strength as well as was possible with soup made from the flesh of game mixed with a little brandy which i had but he grew weaker and weaker also the wounds in the thigh began to suppurate  the kaffirs whom we had with us were of little use in such a case so that all the nursing fell on me luckily beyond a shaking the leopard had done me no hurt and i was very strong in those days still the lack of rest told on me since i dared not sleep for more than half an hour or so at a time at length came a morning when i was quite worn out there lay poor scroope turning and muttering in the little tent and there i sat by his side wondering whether he would live to see another dawn or if he did for how long i should be able to tend him i called to a kaffir to bring me my coffee and just was i was lifting the pannikin to my lips with a shaking hand help came  it arrived in a very strange shape in front of our camp were two thorn trees and from between these trees the rays from the rising sun falling full on him i saw a curious figure walking towards me in a slow purposeful fashion it was that of a man of uncertain age for though the beard and long hair were white the face was comparatively youthful save for the wrinkles round the mouth and the dark eyes were full of life and vigour tattered garments surmounted by a torn kaross or skin rug hung awkwardly upon his tall thin frame on his feet were veldschoen of untanned hide on his back a battered tin case was strapped and in his bony nervous hand he clasped a long staff made of the black and white wood the natives call unzimbiti on the top of which was fixed a butterfly net behind him were some kaffirs who carried cases on their heads  i knew him at once since we had met before especially on a certain occasion in zululand when he calmly appeared out of the ranks of a hostile native impi he was one of the strangest characters in all south africa evidently a gentleman in the true sense of the word none knew his history although i know it now and a strange story it is except that he was an american by birth for in this matter at times his speech betrayed him also he was a doctor by profession and to judge from his extraordinary skill one who must have seen much practice both in medicine and in surgery for the rest he had means though where they came from was a mystery and for many years past had wandered about south and eastern africa collecting butterflies and flowers  by the natives and i might add by white people also he was universally supposed to be mad this reputation coupled with his medical skill enabled him to travel wherever he would without the slightest fear of molestation since the kaffirs look upon the mad as inspired by god their name for him was dogeetah a ludicrous corruption of the english word doctor whereas white folk called him indifferently brother john uncle jonathan or saint john the second appellation he got from his extraordinary likeness when cleaned up and nicely dressed to the figure by which the great american nation is typified in comic papers as england is typified by john bull the first and third arose in the wellknown goodness of his character and a taste he was supposed to possess for living on locusts and wild honey or their local equivalents personally however he preferred to be addressed as brother john  oh who can tell the relief with which i saw him an angel from heaven could scarcely have been more welcome as he came i poured out a second jorum of coffee and remembering that he liked it sweet put in plenty of sugar  how do you do brother john i said proffering him the coffee  greeting brother allan he answeredin those days he affected a kind of old roman way of speaking as i imagine it then he took the coffee put his long finger into it to test the temperature and stir up the sugar drank it off as though it were a dose of medicine and handed back the tin to be refilled  bughunting i queried  he nodded that and flowers and observing human nature and the wonderful works of god wandering around generally  where from last i asked  those hills nearly twenty miles away left them at eight in the evening walked all night  why i said looking at him  because it seemed as though someone were calling me to be plain you allan  oh you heard about my being here and the trouble  no heard nothing meant to strike out for the coast this morning just as i was turning in at 85 exactly got your message and started thats all  my message i began then stopped and asking to see his watch compared it with mine oddly enough they showed the same time to within two minutes  it is a strange thing i said slowly but at 85 last night i did try to send a message for some help because i thought my mate was dying and i jerked my thumb towards the tent only it wasnt to you or any other man brother john understand  quite message was expressed on thats all expressed and i guess registered as well  i looked at brother john and brother john looked at me but at the time we made no further remark the thing was too curious that is unless he lied but nobody had ever known him to lie he was a truthful person painfully truthful at times and yet there are people who do not believe in prayer  what is it he asked  mauled by leopard wounds wont heal and fever i dont think he can last long  what do you know about it let me see him  well he saw him and did wonderful things that tin box of his was full of medicines and surgical instruments which latter he boiled before he used them also he washed his hands till i thought the skin would come off them using up more soap than i could spare first he gave poor charlie a dose of something that seemed to kill him he said he had that drug from the kaffirs then he opened up those wounds upon his thigh and cleaned them out and bandaged them with boiled herbs afterwards when scroope came to again he gave him a drink that threw him into a sweat and took away the fever the end of it was that in two days time his patient sat up and asked for a square meal and in a week we were able to begin to carry him to the coast  guess that message of yours saved brother scroopes life said old john as he watched him start  i made no answer here i may state however that through my own men i inquired a little as to brother johns movements at the time of what he called the message it seemed that he had arranged to march towards the coast on the next morning but that about two hours after sunset suddenly he ordered them to pack up everything and follow him this they did and to their intense disgust those kaffirs were forced to trudge all night at the heels of dogeetah as they called him indeed so weary did they become that had they not been afraid of being left alone in an unknown country in the darkness they said they would have thrown down their loads and refused to go any further  that is as far as i was able to take the matter which may be explained by telepathy inspiration instinct or coincidence it is one as to which the reader must form his own opinion  during our week together in camp and our subsequent journey to delagoa bay and thence by ship to durban brother john and i grew very intimate with limitations of his past as i have said he never talked or of the real object of his wanderings which i learned afterwards but of his natural history and ethnological i believe that is the word studies he spoke a good deal as in my humble way i also am an observer of such matters and know something about african natives and their habits from practical experience these subjects interested me  amongst other things he showed me many of the specimens that he had collected during his recent journey insects and beautiful butterflies neatly pinned into boxes also a quantity of dried flowers pressed between sheets of blotting paper amongst them some which he told me were orchids observing that these attracted me he asked me if i would like to see the most wonderful orchid in the whole world of course i said yes whereon he produced out of one of his cases a flat package about two feet six square he undid the grass mats in which it was wrapped striped delicately woven mats such as they make in the neighbourhood of zanzibar within these was the lid of a packingcase then came more mats and some copies of the cape journal spread out flat then sheets of blotting paper and last of all between two pieces of cardboard a flower and one leaf of the plant on which it grew  even in its dried state it was a wondrous thing measuring twentyfour inches from the tip of one wing or petal to the tip of the other by twenty inches from the top of the back sheath to the bottom of the pouch the measurement of the back sheath itself i forget but it must have been quite a foot across in colour it was or had been bright golden but the back sheath was white barred with lines of black and in the exact centre of the pouch was a single black spot shaped like the head of a great ape there were the overhanging brows the deep recessed eyes the surly mouth the massive jawseverything  although at that time i had never seen a gorilla in the flesh i had seen a coloured picture of the brute and if that picture had been photographed on the flower the likeness could not have been more perfect  what is it i asked amazed  sir said brother john sometimes he used this formal term when excited it is the most marvellous cypripedium in the whole earth and sir i have discovered it a healthy root of that plant will be worth £20000  thats better than gold mining i said well have you got the root  brother john shook his head sadly as he answered  no such luck  hows that as you have the flower  ill tell you allan for a year past and more i have been collecting in the district back of kilwa and found some wonderful things yes wonderful at last about three hundred miles inland i came to a tribe or rather a people that no white man had ever visited they are called the mazitu a numerous and warlike people of bastard zulu blood  i have heard of them i interrupted they broke north before the days of senzangakona two hundred years or more ago  well i could make myself understood among them because they still talk a corrupt zulu as do all the tribes in those parts at first they wanted to kill me but let me go because they thought that i was mad everyone thinks that i am mad allan it is a kind of public delusion whereas i think that i am sane and that most other people are mad  a private delusion i suggested hurriedly as i did not wish to discuss brother johns sanity well go on about the mazitu  later they discovered that i had skill in medicine and their king bausi came to me to be treated for a great external tumour i risked an operation and cured him it was anxious work for if he had died i should have died too though that would not have troubled me very much and he sighed of course from that moment i was supposed to be a great magician also bausi made a blood brotherhood with me transfusing some of his blood into my veins and some of mine into his i only hope he has not inoculated me with his tumours which are congenital so i became bausi and bausi became me in other words i was as much chief of the mazitu as he was and shall remain so all my life  that might be useful i said reflectively but go on  i learned that on the western boundary of the mazitu territory were great swamps that beyond these swamps was a lake called kirua and beyond that a large and fertile land supposed to be an island with a mountain in its centre this land is known as pongo and so are the people who live there  that is a native name for the gorilla isnt it i asked at least so a fellow who had been on the west coast told me  indeed then thats strange as you will see now these pongo are supposed to be great magicians and the god they worship is said to be a gorilla which if you are right accounts for their name or rather he went on they have two gods the other is that flower you see there whether the flower with the monkeys head on it was the first god and suggested the worship of the beast itself or vice versa i dont know indeed i know very little just what i was told by the mazitu and a man who called himself a pongo chief no more  what did they say  the mazitu said that the pongo people are devils who came by the secret channels through the reeds in canoes and stole their children and women whom they sacrificed to their gods sometimes too they made raids upon them at night howling like hyenas the men they killed and the women and children they took away the mazitu want to attack them but cannot do so because they are not water people and have no canoes and therefore are unable to reach the island if it is an island also they told me about the wonderful flower which grows in the place where the apegod lives and is worshipped like the god they had the story of it from some of their people who had been enslaved and escaped  did you try to get to the island i asked  yes allan that is i went to the edge of the reeds which lie at the end of a long slope of plain where the lake begins here i stopped for some time catching butterflies and collecting plants one night when i was camped there by myself for none of my men would remain so near the pongo country after sunset i woke up with a sense that i was no longer alone i crept out of my tent and by the light of the moon which was setting for dawn drew near i saw a man who leant upon the handle of a very widebladed spear which was taller than himself a big man over six feet two high i should say and broad in proportion he wore a long white cloak reaching from his shoulders almost to the ground on his head was a tightfitting cap with lappets also white in his ears were rings of copper or gold and on his wrists bracelets of the same metal his skin was intensely black but the features were not at all negroid they were prominent and finelycut the nose being sharp and the lips quite thin indeed of an arab type his left hand was bandaged and on his face was an expression of great anxiety lastly he appeared to be about fifty years of age so still did he stand that i began to wonder whether he were one of those ghosts which the mazitu swore the pongo wizards send out to haunt their country  for a long while we stared at each other for i was determined that i would not speak first or show any concern at last he spoke in a low deep voice and in mazitu or a language so similar that i found it easy to understand  is not your name dogeetah o white lord and are you not a master of medicine  yes i answered but who are you who dare to wake me from my sleep  lord i am the kalubi the chief of the pongo a great man in my own land yonder  then why do you come here alone at night kalubi chief of the pongo  why do you come here alone white lord he answered evasively  what do you want anyway i asked  o dogeetah i have been hurt i want you to cure me and he looked at his bandaged hand  lay down that spear and open your robe that i may see you have no knife  he obeyed throwing the spear to some distance  now unwrap the hand  he did so i lit a match the sight of which seemed to frighten him greatly although he asked no questions about it and by its light examined the hand the first joint of the second finger was gone from the appearance of the stump which had been cauterized and was tied tightly with a piece of flexible grass i judged that it had been bitten off  what did this i asked  monkey he answered poisonous monkey cut off the finger o dogeetah or tomorrow i die  why do you not tell your own doctors to cut off the finger you who are kalubi chief of the pongo  no no he replied shaking his head they cannot do it it is not lawful and i i cannot do it for if the flesh is black the hand must come off too and if the flesh is black at the wrist then the arm must be cut off  i sat down on my camp stool and reflected really i was waiting for the sun to rise since it was useless to attempt an operation in that light the man kalubi thought that i had refused his petition and became terribly agitated  be merciful white lord he prayed do not let me die i am afraid to die life is bad but death is worse o if you refuse me i will kill myself here before you and then my ghost will haunt you till you die also of fear and come to join me what fee do you ask gold or ivory or slaves say and i will give it  be silent i said for i saw that if he went on thus he would throw himself into a fever which might cause the operation to prove fatal for the same reason i did not question him about many things i should have liked to learn i lit my fire and boiled the instrumentshe thought i was making magic by the time that everything was ready the sun was up  now i said let me see how brave you are  well allan i performed that operation removing the finger at the base where it joins the hand as i thought there might be something in his story of the poison indeed as i found afterwards on dissection and can show you for i have the thing in spirits there was for the blackness of which he spoke a kind of mortification i presume had crept almost to the joint though the flesh beyond was healthy enough certainly that kalubi was a plucky fellow he sat like a rock and never even winced indeed when he saw that the flesh was sound he uttered a great sigh of relief after it was all over he turned a little faint so i gave him some spirits of wine mixed with water which revived him  o lord dogeetah he said as i was bandaging his hand while i live i am your slave yet do me one more service in my land there is a terrible wild beast that which bit off my finger it is a devil it kills us and we fear it i have heard that you white men have magic weapons which slay with a noise come to my land and kill me that wild beast with your magic weapon i say come come for i am terribly afraid and indeed he looked it  no i answered i shed no blood i kill nothing except butterflies and of these only a few but if you fear this brute why do you not poison it you black people have many drugs  no use no use he replied in a kind of wail the beast knows poisons some it swallows and they do not harm it others it will not touch moreover no black man can do it hurt it is white and it has been known from of old that if it dies at all it must be by the hand of one who is white  a very strange animal i began suspiciously for i felt sure that he was lying to me but just at that moment i heard the sound of my mens voices they were advancing towards me through the giant grass singing as they came but as yet a long way off the kalubi heard it also and sprang up  i must be gone he said none must see me here what fee o lord of medicine what fee  i take no payment for my medicine i said yetstay a wonderful flower grows in your country does it not a flower with wings and a cup beneath i would have that flower  who told you of the flower he asked the flower is holy still o white lord still for you it shall be risked oh return and bring with you one who can kill the beast and i will make you rich return and call to the reeds for the kalubi and the kalubi will hear and come to you  then he ran to his spear snatched it from the ground and vanished among the reeds that was the last i saw or am ever likely to see of him  but brother john you got the flower somehow  yes allan about a week later when i came out of my tent one morning there it was standing in a narrowmouthed earthenware pot filled with water of course i meant that he was to send me the plant roots and all but i suppose he understood that i wanted a bloom or perhaps he dared not send the plant anyhow it is better than nothing  why did you not go into the country and get it for yourself  for several reasons allan of which the best is that it was impossible the mazitu swear that if anyone sees that flower he is put to death indeed when they found that i had a bloom of it they forced me to move to the other side of the country seventy miles away so i thought that i would wait till i met with some companions who would accompany me indeed to be frank allan it occurred to me that you were the sort of man who would like to interview this wonderful beast that bites off peoples fingers and frightens them to death and brother john stroked his long white beard and smiled adding odd that we should have met so soon afterwards isnt it  did you i replied now did you indeed brother john people say all sorts of things about you but i have come to the conclusion that theres nothing the matter with your wits  again he smiled and stroked his long white beard     chapter ii                             the auction room  i do not think that this conversion about the pongo savages who were said to worship a gorilla and a golden flower was renewed until we reached my house at durban thither of course i took mr charles scroope and thither also came brother john who as bedroom accommodation was lacking pitched his tent in the garden  one night we sat on the step smoking brother johns only concession to human weakness was that he smoked he drank no wine or spirits he never ate meat unless he was obliged but i rejoice to say that he smoked cigars like most americans when he could get them  john said i i have been thinking over that yarn of yours and have come to one or two conclusions  what may they be allan  the first is that you were a great donkey not to get more out of the kalubi when you had the chance  agreed allan but amongst other things i am a doctor and the operation was uppermost in my mind  the second is that i believe this kalubi had charge of the gorillagod as no doubt youve guessed also that it was the gorilla which bit off his finger  why so  because i have heard of great monkeys called sokos that live in central east africa which are said to bite off mens toes and fingers i have heard too that they are very like gorillas  now you mention it so have i allan indeed once i saw a soko though some way off a huge brown ape which stood on its hind legs and drummed upon its chest with its fists i didnt see it for long because i ran away  the third is that this yellow orchid would be worth a great deal of money if one could dig it up and take it to england  i think i told you allan that i valued it at £20000 so that conclusion of yours is not original  the fourth is that i should like to dig up that orchid and get a share of the £20000  brother john became intensely interested  ah he said now we are getting to the point i have been wondering how long it would take you to see it allan but if you are slow you are sure  the fifth is i went on that such an expedition to succeed would need a great deal of money more than you or i could find partners would be wanted active or sleeping but partners with cash  brother john looked towards the window of the room in which charlie scroope was in bed for being still weak he went to rest early  no i said hes had enough of africa and you told me yourself that it will be two years before he is really strong again also theres a lady in this case now listen i have taken it on myself to write to that lady whose address i found out while he didnt know what he was saying i have said that he was dying but that i hoped he might live meanwhile i added i thought she would like to know that he did nothing but rave of her also that he was a hero with a big h twice underlined my word i did lay it on about the hero business with a spoon a real hotel gravy spoon if charlie scroope knows himself again when he sees my description of him well im a dutchman thats all the letter caught the last mail and will i hope reach the lady in due course now listen again scroope wants me to go to england with him to look after him on the voyagethats what he says what he means is that he hopes i might put in a word for him with the lady if i should chance to be introduced to her he offers to pay all my expenses and to give me something for my loss of time so as i havent seen england since i was three years old i think ill take the chance  brother johns face fell then how about the expedition allan he asked  this is the first of november i answered and the wet season in those parts begins about now and lasts till april so it would be no use trying to visit your pongo friends till then which gives me plenty of time to go to england and come out again if youll trust that flower to me ill take it with me perhaps i might be able to find someone who would be willing to put down money on the chance of getting the plant on which it grew meanwhile you are welcome to this house if you care to stay here  thank you allan but i cant sit still for so many months ill go somewhere and come back he paused and a dreamy look came into his dark eyes then went on you see brother it is laid on me to wander and wander through all this great land untili know  until you know what i asked sharply  he pulled himself together with a jerk as it were and answered with a kind of forced carelessness  until i know every inch of it of course there are lots of tribes i have not yet visited  including the pongo i said by the way if i can get the money together for a trip up there i suppose you mean to come too dont you if not the things off so far as i am concerned you see i am reckoning on you to get us through the mazitu and into pongoland by the help of your friends  certainly i mean to come in fact if you dont go i shall start alone i intend to explore pongoland even if i never come out of it again  once more i looked at him as i answered  you are ready to risk a great deal for a flower john or are you looking for more than a flower if so i hope you will tell me the truth  this i said as i was aware that brother john had a foolish objection to uttering or even acting lies  well allan as you put it like that the truth is that i heard something more about the pongo than i told you up country it was after i had operated on that kalubi or i would have tried to get in alone but this i could not do then as i have said  and what did you hear  i heard that they had a white goddess as well as a white god  well what of it a female gorilla i suppose  nothing except that goddesses have always interested me good night  you are an odd old fish i remarked after him and what is more you have got something up your sleeve well ill have it down one day meanwhile i wonder whether the whole thing is a lie no not a lie an hallucination it cant bebecause of that orchid no one can explain away the orchid a queer people these pongo with their white god and goddess and their holy flower but after all africa is a land of queer people and of queer gods too    and now the story shifts away to england dont be afraid my adventurous reader if ever i have one it is coming back to africa again in a very few pages  mr charles scroope and i left durban a day or two after my last conversation with brother john at cape town we caught the mail a wretched little boat you would think it now which after a long and wearisome journey at length landed us safe at plymouth our companions on that voyage were very dull i have forgotten most of them but one lady i do remember i imagine that she must have commenced life as a barmaid for she had the orthodox tow hair and blowsy appearance at any rate she was the wife of a winemerchant who had made a fortune at the cape unhappily however she had contracted too great a liking for her husbands wares and after dinner was apt to become talkative for some reason or other she took a particular aversion to me oh i can see her now seated in that saloon with the oil lamp swinging over her head she always chose the position under the oil lamp because it showed off her diamonds and i can hear her too dont bring any of your elephanthunting manners here mr allan with an emphasis on the allan quatermain they are not fit for polite society you should go and brush your hair mr quatermain i may explain that my hair sticks up naturally  then would come her little husbands horrified hush hush you are quite insulting my dear  oh why do i remember it all after so many years when i have even forgotten the peoples names one of those little things that stick in the mind i suppose the island of ascension where we called sticks also with its long swinging rollers breaking in white foam its bare mountain peak capped with green and the turtles in the ponds those poor turtles we brought two of them home and i used to look at them lying on their backs in the forecastle flapping their fins feebly one of them died and i got the butcher to save me the shell afterwards i gave it as a wedding present to mr and mrs scroope nicely polished and lined i meant it for a workbasket and was overwhelmed with confusion when some silly lady said at the marriage and in the hearing of the bride and bridegroom that it was the most beautiful cradle she had ever seen of course like a fool i tried to explain whereon everybody tittered  but why do i write of such trifles that have nothing to do with my story  i mentioned that i had ventured to send a letter to miss margaret manners about mr charles scroope in which i said incidentally that if the hero should happen to live i should probably bring him home by the next mail well we got into plymouth about eight oclock in the morning on a mild november day and shortly afterwards a tug arrived to take off the passengers and mails also some cargo i being an early riser watched it come and saw upon the deck a stout lady wrapped in furs and by her side a very pretty fairhaired young woman clad in a neat serge dress and a porkpie hat presently a steward told me that someone wished to speak to me in the saloon i went and found these two standing side by side  i believe you are mr allan quatermain said the stout lady where is mr scroope whom i understand you have brought home tell me at once  something about her appearance and fierce manner of address alarmed me so much that i could only answer feebly  below madam below  there my dear said the stout lady to her companion i warned you to be prepared for the worst bear up do not make a scene before all these people the ways of providence are just and inscrutable it is your own temper that was to blame you should never have sent the poor man off to these heathen countries  then turning to me she added sharply i suppose he is embalmed we should like to bury him in essex  embalmed i gasped embalmed why the man is in his bath or was a few minutes ago  in another second that pretty young lady who had been addressed was weeping with her head upon my shoulder  margaret exclaimed her companion she was a kind of heavy aunt i told you not to make a scene in public mr quatermain as mr scroope is alive would you ask him to be so good as to come here  well i fetched him halfshaved and the rest of the business may be imagined it is a very fine thing to be a hero with a big h henceforth thanks to me that was charlie scroopes lot in life he has grandchildren now and they all think him a hero what is more he does not contradict them i went down to the ladys place in essex a fine property with a beautiful old house on the night i arrived there was a dinnerparty of twentyfour people i had to make a speech about charlie scroope and the leopard i think it was a good speech at any rate everybody cheered including the servants who had gathered at the back of the big hall  i remember that to complete the story i introduced several other leopards a mother and two threepartgrown cubs also a wounded buffalo and told how mr scroope finished them off one after the other with a hunting knife the thing was to watch his face as the history proceeded luckily he was sitting next to me and i could kick him under the table it was all very amusing and very happy also for these two really loved each other thank god that i or rather brother john was able to bring them together again  it was during that stay of mine in essex by the way that i first met lord ragnall and the beautiful miss holmes with whom i was destined to experience some very strange adventures in the after years    after this interlude i got to work someone told me that there was a firm in the city that made a business of selling orchids by auction flowers which at this time were beginning to be very fashionable among rich horticulturists this thought i would be the place for me to show my treasure doubtless messrs may and primrosethat was their worldfamed stylewould be able to put me in touch with opulent orchidists who would not mind venturing a couple of thousands on the chance of receiving a share in a flower that according to brother john should be worth untold gold at any rate i would try  so on a certain friday about halfpast twelve i sought out the place of business of messrs may and primrose bearing with me the golden cypripedium which was now enclosed in a flat tin case  as it happened i chose an unlucky day and hour for on arriving at the office and asking for mr may i was informed that he was away in the country valuing  then i would like to see mr primrose i said  mr primrose is round at the rooms selling replied the clerk who appeared to be very busy  where are the rooms i asked  out of the door turn to the left turn to the left again and under the clock said the clerk and closed the shutter  so disgusted was i with his rudeness that i nearly gave up the enterprise thinking better of it however i followed the directions given and in a minute or two found myself in a narrow passage that led to a large room to one who had never seen anything of the sort before this room offered a curious sight the first thing i observed was a notice on the wall to the effect that customers were not allowed to smoke pipes i thought to myself that orchids must be curious flowers if they could distinguish between the smoke of a cigar and a pipe and stepped into the room to my left was a long table covered with pots of the most beautiful flowers that i had ever seen all of them orchids along the wall and opposite were other tables closely packed with withered roots which i concluded were also those of orchids to my inexperienced eye the whole lot did not look worth five shillings for they seemed to be dead  at the head of the room stood the rostrum where sat a gentleman with an extremely charming face he was engaged in selling by auction so rapidly that the clerk at his side must have had difficulty in keeping a record of the lots and their purchasers in front of him was a horseshoe table round which sat buyers the end of this table was left unoccupied so that the porters might exhibit each lot before it was put up for sale standing under the rostrum was yet another table a small one upon which were about twenty pots of flowers even more wonderful than those on the large table a notice stated that these would be sold at onethirty precisely all about the room stood knots of men such ladies as were present sat at the table many of whom had lovely orchids in their buttonholes these i found out afterwards were dealers and amateurs they were a kindlyfaced set of people and i took a liking to them  the whole place was quaint and pleasant especially by contrast with the horrible london fog outside squeezing my small person into a corner where i was in nobodys way i watched the proceedings for a while suddenly an agreeable voice at my side asked me if i would like a look at the catalogue i glanced at the speaker and in a sense fell in love with him at onceas i have explained before i am one of those to whom a first impression means a great deal he was not very tall though stronglooking and wellmade enough he was not very handsome though none so illfavoured he was just an ordinary fair young englishman four or fiveandtwenty years of age with merry blue eyes and one of the pleasantest expressions that i ever saw at once i felt that he was a sympathetic soul and full of the milk of human kindness he was dressed in a rough tweed suit rather worn with the orchid that seemed to be the badge of all this tribe in his buttonhole somehow the costume suited his rather pink and white complexion and rumpled fair hair which i could see as he was sitting on his cloth hat  thank you no i answered i did not come here to buy i know nothing about orchids i added by way of explanation except a few i have seen growing in africa and this one and i tapped the tin case which i held under my arm  indeed he said i should like to hear about the african orchids what is it you have in the case a plant or flowers  one flower only it is not mine a friend in africa asked me towell that is a long story which might not interest you  im not sure i suppose it must be a cymbidium scape from the size  i shook my head thats not the name my friend mentioned he called it a cypripedium  the young man began to grow curious one cypripedium in all that large case it must be a big flower  yes my friend said it is the biggest ever found it measures twentyfour inches across the wings petals i think he called them and about a foot across the back part  twentyfour inches across the petals and a foot across the dorsal sepal said the young man in a kind of gasp and a cypripedium sir surely you are joking  sir i answered indignantly i am doing nothing of the sort your remark is tantamount to telling me that i am speaking a falsehood but of course for all i know the thing may be some other kind of flower  let me see it in the name of the goddess flora let me see it  i began to undo the case indeed it was already halfopen when two other gentlemen who had either overheard some of our conversation or noted my companions excited look edged up to us i observed that they also wore orchids in their buttonholes  hullo somers said one of them in a tone of false geniality what have you got there  what has your friend got there asked the other  nothing replied the young man who had been addressed as somers nothing at all that isonly a case of tropical butterflies  oh butterflies said no 1 and sauntered away but no 2 a keenlooking person with the eye of a hawk was not so easily satisfied  let us see these butterflies he said to me  you cant ejaculated the young man my friend is afraid lest the damp should injure their colours aint you brown  yes i am somers i replied taking his cue and shutting the tin case with a snap  then the hawkeyed person departed also grumbling for that story about the damp stuck in his throat  orchidist whispered the young man dreadful people orchidists so jealous very rich too both of them mr browni hope that is your name though i admit the chances are against it  they are i replied my name is allan quatermain  ah much better than brown well mr allan quatermain theres a private room in this place to which i have admittance would you mind coming with that here the hawkeyed gentleman strolled past again that case of butterflies  with pleasure i answered and followed him out of the auction chamber down some steps through the door to the left and ultimately into a little cupboardlike room lined with shelves full of books and ledgers  he closed the door and locked it  now he said in a tone of the villain in a novel who at last has come face to face with the virtuous heroine now we are alone mr quatermain let me seethose butterflies  i placed the case on a deal table which stood under a skylight in the room i opened it i removed the cover of wadding and there pressed between two sheets of glass and quite uninjured after all its journeyings appeared the golden flower glorious even in death and by its side the broad green leaf  the young gentleman called somers looked at it till i thought his eyes would really start out of his head he turned away muttering something and looked again  oh heavens he said at last oh heavens is it possible that such a thing can exist in this imperfect world you havent faked it mr halfi mean quatermain have you  sir i said for the second time you are making insinuations good morning and i began to shut up the case  dont be offhanded he exclaimed pity the weaknesses of a poor sinner you dont understand if only you understood you would understand  no i said i am bothered if i do  well you will when you begin to collect orchids im not mad really except perhaps on this point mr quatermainthis in a low and thrilling voicethat marvellous cypripediumyour friend is right it is a cypripediumis worth a gold mine  from my experience of gold mines i can well believe that i said tartly and i may add prophetically  oh i mean a gold mine in the figurative and colloquial sense not as the investor knows it he answered that is the plant on which it grew is priceless where is the plant mr quatermain  in a rather indefinite locality in africa east by south i replied i cant place it to within three hundred miles  thats vague mr quatermain i have no right to ask it seeing that you know nothing of me but i assure you i am respectable and in short would you mind telling me the story of this flower  i dont think i should i replied a little doubtfully then after another good look at him suppressing all names and exact localities i gave him the outline of the tale explaining that i wanted to find someone who would finance an expedition to the remote and romantic spot where this particular cypripedium was believed to grow  just as i finished my narrative and before he had time to comment on it there came a violent knocking at the door  mr stephen said a voice are you there mr stephen  by jove thats briggs exclaimed the young man briggs is my fathers manager shut up the case mr quatermain come in briggs he went on unlocking the door slowly what is it  it is a good deal replied a thin and agitated person who thrust himself through the opening door your father i mean sir alexander has come to the office unexpectedly and is in a nice taking because he didnt find you there sir when he discovered that you had gone to the orchid sale he grew furious sir furious and sent me to fetch you  did he replied mr somers in an easy and unruffled tone well tell sir alexander i am coming at once now please go briggs and tell him i am coming at once  briggs departed not too willingly  i must leave you mr quatermain said mr somers as he shut the door behind him but will you promise me not to show that flower to anyone until i return ill be back within half an hour  yes mr somers ill wait half an hour for you in the sale room and i promise that no one shall see that flower till you return  thank you you are a good fellow and i promise you shall lose nothing by your kindness if i can help it  we went together into the sale room where some thought suddenly struck mr somers  by jove he said i nearly forgot about that odontoglossum wheres woodden oh come here woodden i want to speak to you  the person called woodden obeyed he was a man of about fifty indefinite in colouring for his eyes were very lightblue or grey and his hair was sandy toughlooking and strongly made with big hands that showed signs of work for the palms were horny and the nails worn down he was clad in a suit of shiny black such as folk of the labouring class wear at a funeral i made up my mind at once that he was a gardener  woodden said mr somers this gentleman here has got the most wonderful orchid in the whole world keep your eye on him and see that he isnt robbed there are people in this room mr quatermain who would murder you and throw your body into the thames for that flower he added darkly  on receipt of this information woodden rocked a little on his feet as though he felt the premonitory movements of an earthquake it was a habit of his whenever anything astonished him then fixing his pale eye upon me in a way which showed that my appearance surprised him he pulled a lock of his sandy hair with his thumb and finger and said  servant sir and where might this horchid be  i pointed to the tin case  yes its there went on mr somers and thats what youve got to watch mr quatermain if anyone attempts to rob you call for woodden and he will knock them down hes my gardener you know and entirely to be trusted especially if it is a matter of knocking anyone down  aye ill knock him down surely said woodden doubling his great fist and looking round him with a suspicious eye  now listen woodden have you looked at that odontoglossum pavo and if so what do you think of it and he nodded towards a plant which stood in the centre of the little group that was placed on the small table beneath the auctioneers desk it bore a spray of the most lovely white flowers on the top petal if it is a petal and also on the lip of each of these rounded flowers was a blotch or spot of which the general effect was similar to the iridescent eye on the tail feathers of a peacock whence i suppose the flower was named pavo or peacock  yes master and i think it the beautifullest thing that ever i saw there isnt a glossum in england like that there glossum paving he added with conviction and rocked again as he said the word but theres plenty after it i say theyre asmelling round that blossom like likedawgs round a rat hole and this triumphantly they dont do that for nothing  quite so woodden you have got a logical mind but look here we must have that pavo whatever it costs now the governor has sent for me ill be back presently but i might be detained if so youve got to bid on my behalf for i darent trust any of these agents heres your authority and he scribbled on a card woodden my gardener has directions to bid for mess now woodden he went on when he had given the card to an attendant who passed it up to the auctioneer dont you make a fool of yourself and let that pavo slip through your fingers  in another instant he was gone  what did the master say sir asked woodden of me that i was to get that there paving whatever it cost  yes i said thats what he said i suppose it will fetch a good dealseveral pounds  maybe sir cant tell all i know is that ive got to buy it as you can bear me witness master he aint one to be crossed for money what he wants hell have that is if it be in the orchid line  i suppose you are fond of orchids too mr woodden  fond of them sir why i loves em here he rocked dont feel for nothing else in the same way not even for my old woman then with a burst of enthusiasm no not even for the master himself and im fond enough of him god knows but begging your pardon sir with a pull at his forelock would you mind holding that tin of yours a little tighter ive got to keep an eye on that as well as on o paving and i just seed that chap with the tall hat alooking at it suspicious  after this we separated i retired into my corner while woodden took his stand by the table with one eye fixed on what he called the o paving and the other on me and my tin case  an odd fish truly i thought to myself positive the old woman comparative his master superlative the orchid tribe those were his degrees of affection honest and brave and a good fellow though i bet  the sale languished there were so many lots of one particular sort of dried orchid that buyers could not be found for them at a reasonable price and many had to be bought in at length the genial mr primrose in the rostrum addressed the audience  gentlemen he said i quite understand that you didnt come here today to buy a rather poor lot of cattleya mossiæ you came to buy or to bid for or to see sold the most wonderful odontoglossum that has ever been flowered in this country the property of a famous firm of importers whom i congratulate upon their good fortune in having obtained such a gem gentlemen this miraculous flower ought to adorn a royal greenhouse but there it is to be taken away by whoever will pay the most for it for i am directed to see that it will be sold without reserve now i think he added running his eye over the company that most of our great collectors are represented in this room today it is true that i do not see that spirited and liberal young orchidist mr somers but he has left his worthy headgardener mr woodden than whom there is no finer judge of an orchid in england here woodden rocked violently to bid for him as i hope for the glorious flower of which i have been speaking now as it is exactly halfpast one we will proceed to business smith hand the odontoglossum pavo round that everyone may inspect its beauties and be careful you dont let it fall gentlemen i must ask you not to touch it or to defile its purity with tobacco smoke eight perfect flowers in bloom gentlemen and fourno five more to open a strong plant in perfect health six pseudobulbs with leaves and three without two black leads which i am advised can be separated off at the proper time now what bids for the odontoglossum pavo ah i wonder who will have the honour of becoming the owner of this perfect this unmatched production of nature thank you sirthree hundred four five six seven in three places eight nine ten oh gentlemen let us get on a little faster thank you sirfifteen sixteen it is against you mr woodden ah thank you seventeen  there came a pause in the fierce race for o pavo which i occupied in reducing seventeen hundred shillings to pounds sterling  my word i thought to myself £85 is a goodish price to pay for one plant however rare woodden is acting up to his instructions with a vengeance  the pleading voice of mr primrose broke in upon my meditations  gentlemen gentlemen he said surely you are not going to allow the most wondrous production of the floral world on which i repeat there is no reserve to be knocked down at this miserable figure come come well if i must i must though after such a disgrace i shall get no sleep tonight one and his hammer fell for the first time think gentlemen upon my position think what the eminent owners who with their usual delicacy have stayed away will say to me when i am obliged to tell them the disgraceful truth two and his hammer fell a second time smith hold up that flower let the company see it let them know what they are losing  smith held up the flower at which everybody glared the little ivory hammer circled round mr primroses head it was about to fall when a quiet man with a long beard who hitherto had not joined in the bidding lifted his head and said softly  eighteen hundred  ah exclaimed mr primrose i thought so i thought that the owner of the greatest collection in england would not see this treasure slip from his grasp without a struggle against you mr woodden  nineteen sir said woodden in a stony voice  two thousand echoed the gentleman with the long beard  twentyone hundred said woodden  thats right mr woodden cried mr primrose you are indeed representing your principal worthily i feel sure that you do not mean to stop for a few miserable pounds  not if i knows it ejaculated woodden i has my orders and i acts up to them  twentytwo hundred said longbeard  twentythree echoed woodden  oh damn shouted longbeard and rushed from the room  odontoglossum pavo is going for twentythree hundred only twentytree hundred cried the auctioneer any advance on twentythree hundred what none then i must do my duty one two for the last timeno advance three gone to mr woodden bidding for his principal mr somers  the hammer fell with a sharp tap and at this moment my young friend sauntered into the room  well woodden he said have they put the pavo up yet  its up and its down sir ive bought him right enough  the deuce you have what did it fetch  woodden scratched his head  i dont rightly know sir never was good at figures not having much book learning but its twentythree something  £23 no it would have brought more than that by jingo it must be £230 thats pretty stiff but still it may be worth it  at this moment mr primrose who leaning over his desk was engaged in animated conversation with an excited knot of orchid fanciers looked up  oh there you are mr somers he said in the name of all this company let me congratulate you on having become the owner of the matchless odontoglossum pavo for what under all the circumstances i consider the quite moderate price of £2300  really that young man took it very well he shivered slightly and turned a little pale that is all woodden rocked to and fro like a tree about to fall i and my tin box collapsed together in the corner yes i was so surprised that my legs seemed to give way under me people began to talk but above the hum of the conversation i heard young somers say in a low voice  woodden youre a born fool also the answer thats what my mother always told me master and she ought to know if anyone did but whats wrong now i obeyed orders and bought o paving  yes dont bother my good fellow its my fault not yours im the born fool but heavens above how am i to face this then recovering himself he strolled up to the rostrum and said a few words to the auctioneer mr primrose nodded and i heard him answer  oh that will be all right sir dont bother we cant expect an account like this to be settled in a minute a month hence will do  then he went on with the sale     chapter iii                        sir alexander and stephen  it was just at this moment that i saw standing by me a finelooking stout man with a square grey beard and a handsome but not very goodtempered face he was looking about him as one does who finds himself in a place to which he is not accustomed  perhaps you could tell me sir he said to me whether a gentleman called mr somers is in this room i am rather shortsighted and there are a great many people  yes i answered he has just bought the wonderful orchid called odontoglossum pavo that is what they are all talking about  oh has he has he indeed and pray what did he pay for the article  a huge sum i answered i thought it was two thousand three hundred shillings but it appears it was £2300  the handsome elderly gentleman grew very red in the face so red that i thought he was going to have a fit for a few moments he breathed heavily  a rival collector i thought to myself and went on with the story which it occurred to me might interest him  you see the young gentleman was called away to an interview with his father i heard him instruct his gardener a man named woodden to buy the plant at any price  at any price indeed very interesting continue sir  well the gardener bought it thats all after tremendous competition look there he is packing it up whether his master meant him to go as far as he did i rather doubt but here he comes if you know him  the youthful mr somers looking a little pale and distrait strolled up apparently to speak to me his hands were in his pockets and an unlighted cigar was in his mouth his eyes fell upon the elderly gentleman a sight that caused him to shape his lips as though to whistle and drop the cigar  hullo father he said in his pleasant voice i got your message and have been looking for you but never thought that i should find you here orchids arent much in your line are they  didnt you indeed replied his parent in a choked voice no i havent much use forthis stinking rubbish and he waved his umbrella at the beautiful flowers but it seems that you have stephen this little gentlemen here tells me you have just bought a very fine specimen  i must apologize i broke in addressing mr somers i had not the slightest idea that thisbig gentleman here the son smiled faintly was your intimate relation  oh pray dont mr quatermain why should you not speak of what will be in all the papers yes father i have bought a very fine specimen the finest known or at least woodden has on my behalf while i was hunting for you which comes to the same thing  indeed stephen and what did you pay for this flower i have heard a figure but think that there must be some mistake  i dont know what you heard father but it seems to have been knocked down to me at £2300 its a lot more than i can find indeed and i was going to ask you to lend me the money for the sake of the family credit if not for my own but we can talk about that afterwards  yes stephen we can talk of that afterwards in fact as there is no time like the present we will talk of it now come to my office and sir this was to me as you seem to know something of the circumstances i will ask you to come also and you too blockhead this was to woodden who just then approached with the plant  now of course i might have refused an invitation conveyed in such a manner but as a matter of fact i didnt i wanted to see the thing out also to put in a word for young somers if i got the chance so we all departed from that room followed by a titter of amusement from those of the company who had overheard the conversation in the street stood a splendid carriage and pair a powdered footman opened its door with a ferocious bow sir alexander motioned to me to enter which i did taking one of the back seats as it gave more room for my tin case then came mr stephen then woodden bundled in holding the precious plant in front of him like a wand of office and last of all sir alexander having seen us safe entered also  where to sir asked the footman  office he snapped and we started  four disappointed relatives in a funeral coach could not have been more silent our feelings seemed to be too deep for words sir alexander however did make one remark and to me it was  if you will remove the corner of that infernal tin box of yours from my ribs i shall be obliged to you sir  your pardon i exclaimed and in my efforts to be accommodating dropped it on his toe i will not repeat the remark he made but i may explain that he was gouty his son suddenly became afflicted with a sense of the absurdity of the situation he kicked me on the shin he even dared to wink and then began to swell visibly with suppressed laughter i was in agony for if he had exploded i do not know what would have happened fortunately at this moment the carriage stopped at the door of a fine office without waiting for the footman mr stephen bundled out and vanished into the buildingi suppose to laugh in safety then i descended with the tin case then by command followed woodden with the flower and lastly came sir alexander  stop here he said to the coachman i shant be long be so good as to follow me mr whatsyourname and you too gardener  we followed and found ourselves in a big room luxuriously furnished in a heavy kind of way sir alexander somers i should explain was an enormously opulent bullionbroker whatever a bullionbroker may be in this room mr stephen was already established indeed he was seated on the windowsill swinging his leg  now we are alone and comfortable growled sir alexander with sarcastic ferocity  as the boaconstrictor said to the rabbit in the cage i remarked  i did not mean to say it but i had grown nervous and the thought leapt from my lips in words again mr stephen began to swell he turned his face to the window as though to contemplate the wall beyond but i could see his shoulders shaking a dim light of intelligence shone in wooddens pale eyes about three minutes later the joke got home he gurgled something about boaconstrictors and rabbits and gave a short loud laugh as for sir alexander he merely said  i did not catch your remark sir would you be so good as to repeat it  as i appeared unwilling to accept the invitation he went on  perhaps then you would repeat what you told me in that saleroom  why should i i asked i spoke quite clearly and you seemed to understand  you are right replied sir alexander to waste time is useless he wheeled round on woodden who was standing near the door still holding the paperwrapped plant in front of him now blockhead he shouted tell me why you brought that thing  woodden made no answer only rocked a little sir alexander reiterated his command this time woodden set the plant upon a table and replied  if youre aspeaking to me sir that baint my name and whats more if you calls me so again ill punch your head whoever you be and very deliberately he rolled up the sleeves on his brawny arms a sight at which i too began to swell with inward merriment  look here father said mr stephen stepping forward whats the use of all this the things perfectly plain i did tell woodden to buy the plant at any price what is more i gave him a written authority which was passed up to the auctioneer theres no getting out of it it is true it never occurred to me that it would go for anything like £2300the odd £300 was more my idea but woodden only obeyed his orders and ought not to be abused for doing so  theres what i call a master worth serving remarked woodden  very well young man said sir alexander you have purchased this article will you be so good as to tell me how you propose it should be paid for  i propose father that you should pay for it replied mr stephen sweetly two thousand three hundred pounds or ten times that amount would not make you appreciably poorer but if as is probable you take a different view then i propose to pay for it myself as you know a certain sum of money came to me under my mothers will in which you have only a life interest i shall raise the amount upon that securityor otherwise  if sir alexander had been angry before now he became like a mad bull in a china shop he pranced round the room he used language that should not pass the lips of any respectable merchant of bullion in short he did everything that a person in his position ought not to do when he was tired he rushed to a desk tore a cheque from a book and filled it in for a sum of £2300 to bearer which cheque he blotted crumpled up and literally threw at the head of his son  you worthless idle young scoundrel he bellowed i put you in this office here that you may learn respectable and orderly habits and in due course succeed to a very comfortable business what happens you dont take a haporth of interest in bullionbroking a subject of which i believe you to remain profoundly ignorant you dont even spend your money or rather my money upon any gentlemanlike vice such as horseracing or cards or evenwell never mind no you take to flowers miserable beastly flowers things that a cow eats and clerks grow in back gardens  an ancient and arcadian taste adam is supposed to have lived in a garden i ventured to interpolate  perhaps you would ask your friend with the stubbly hair to remain quiet snorted sir alexander i was about to add although for the sake of my name i meet your debts that i have had enough of this kind of thing i disinherit you or will do if i live till 4 pm when the lawyers office shuts for thank god there are no entailed estates and i dismiss you from the firm you can go and earn your living in any way you please by orchidhunting if you like he paused gasping for breath  is that all father asked mr stephen producing a cigar from his pocket  no it isnt you coldblooded young beggar that house you occupy at twickenham is mine you will be good enough to clear out of it i wish to take possession  i suppose father i am entitled to a weeks notice like any other tenant said mr stephen lighting the cigar in fact he added if you answer no i think i shall ask you to apply for an ejection order you will understand that i have arrangements to make before taking a fresh start in life  oh curse your cheek youyoucucumber raged the infuriated merchant prince then an inspiration came to him you think more of an ugly flower than of your father do you well at least ill put an end to that and he made a dash at the plant on the table with the evident intention of destroying the same  but the watching woodden saw with a kind of lurch he interposed his big frame between sir alexander and the object of his wrath  touch o paving and i knocks yer down he drawled out  sir alexander looked at o paving then he looked at wooddens legofmutton fist andchanged his mind  curse o paving he said and everyone who has to do with it and swung out of the room banging the door behind him  well thats over said mr stephen gently as he fanned himself with a pockethandkerchief quite exciting while it lasted wasnt it mr quatermainbut i have been there before so to speak and now what do you say to some luncheon pyms is close by and they have very good oysters only i think well drive round by the bank and hand in this cheque when hes angry my parent is capable of anything he might even stop it woodden get off down to twickenham with o pavo keep it warm for it feels rather like frost put it in the stove for tonight and give it a little just a little tepid water but be careful not to touch the flower take a fourwheeled cab its slow but safe and mind you keep the windows up and dont smoke i shall be home for dinner  woodden pulled his forelock seized the pot in his left hand and departed with his right fist raisedi suppose in case sir alexander should be waiting for him round the corner  then we departed also and after stopping for a minute at the bank to pay in the cheque which i noted notwithstanding its amount was accepted without comment ate oysters in a place too crowded to allow of conversation  mr quatermain said my host it is obvious that we cannot talk here and much less look at that orchid of yours which i want to study at leisure now for a week or so at any rate i have a roof over my head and in short will you be my guest for a night or two i know nothing about you and of me you only know that i am the disinherited son of a father to whom i have failed to give satisfaction still it is possible that we might pass a few pleasant hours together talking of flowers and other things that is if you have no previous engagement  i have none i answered i am only a stranger from south africa lodging at an hotel if you will give me time to call for my bag i will pass the night at your house with pleasure  by the aid of mr somers smart dogcart which was waiting at a city mews we reached twickenham while there was still half an hour of daylight the house which was called verbena lodge was small a square redbrick building of the early georgian period but the gardens covered quite an acre of ground and were very beautiful or must have been so in summer into the greenhouse we did not enter because it was too late to see the flowers also just when we came to them woodden arrived in his fourwheeled cab and departed with his master to see to the housing of o pavo  then came dinner a very pleasant meal my host had that day been turned out upon the world but he did not allow this circumstance to interfere with his spirits in the least also he was evidently determined to enjoy its good things while they lasted for his champagne and port were excellent  you see mr quatermain he said its just as well we had the row which has been boiling up for a long while my respected father has made so much money that he thinks i should go and do likewise now i dont see it i like flowers especially orchids and i hate bullionbroking to me the only decent places in london are that saleroom where we met and the horticultural gardens  yes i answered rather doubtfully but the matter seems a little serious your parent was very emphatic as to his intentions and after this kind of thing and i pointed to the beautiful silver and the port how will you like roughing it in a hard world  dont think i shall mind a bit it would be rather a pleasant change also even if my father doesnt alter his mind as he may for he likes me at bottom because i resemble my dear mother things aint so very bad i have got some money that she left me £6000 or £7000 and ill sell that odontoglossum pavo for what it will fetch to sir joshua tredgoldhe was the man with the long beard who you tell me ran up woodden to over £2000or failing him to someone else ill write about it tonight i dont think i have any debts to speak of for the governor has been allowing me £3000 a year at least that is my share of the profits paid to me in return for my bullionbroking labours and except flowers i have no expensive tastes so the devil take the past heres to the future and whatever it may bring and he polished off the glass of port he held and laughed in his jolly fashion  really he was a most attractive young man a little reckless it is true but then recklessness and youth mix well like brandy and soda  i echoed the toast and drank off my port for i like a good glass of wine when i can get it as would anyone who has had to live for months on rotten water although i admit that agrees with me better than the port  now mr quatermain he went on if you have done light your pipe and lets go into the other room and study that cypripedium of yours i shant sleep tonight unless i see it again first stop a bit though well get hold of that old ass woodden before he turns in  woodden said his master when the gardener had arrived this gentleman mr quatermain is going to show you an orchid that is ten times finer than o pavo  beg pardon sir answered woodden but if mr quatermain says that he lies it aint in nature it dont bloom nowhere  i opened the case and revealed the golden cypripedium woodden stared at it and rocked then he stared again and felt his head as though to make sure it was on his shoulders then he gasped  well if that there flower baint made up its a master one if i could see that there flower ablowing on the plant id die happy  woodden stop talking and sit down exclaimed his master yes there where you can look at the flower now mr quatermain will you tell us the story of that orchid from beginning to end of course omitting its habitat if you like for it isnt fair to ask that secret woodden can be trusted to hold his tongue and so can i  i remarked that i was sure they could and for the next halfhour talked almost without interruption keeping nothing back and explaining that i was anxious to find someone who would finance an expedition to search for this particular plant as i believed the only one of its sort that existed in the world  how much will it cost asked mr somers  i lay it at £2000 i answered you see we must have plenty of men and guns and stores also trade goods and presents  i call that cheap but supposing mr quatermain that the expedition proves successful and the plant is secured what then  then i propose that brother john who found it and of whom i have told you should take onethird of whatever it might sell for that i as captain of the expedition should take onethird and that whoever finds the necessary money should take the remaining third  good thats settled  whats settled i asked  why that we should divide in the proportions you named only i bargain to be allowed to take my whack in kindi mean in plant and to have the first option of purchasing the rest of the plant at whatever value may be agreed upon  but mr somers do you mean that you wish to find £2000 and make this expedition in person  of course i do i thought you understood that that is if you will have me your old friend the lunatic you and i will together seek for and find this golden flower i say thats settled  on the morrow accordingly it was settled with the help of a document signed in duplicate by both of us  before these arrangements were finally concluded however i insisted that mr somers should meet my late companion charlie scroope when i was not present in order that the latter might give him a full and particular report concerning myself apparently the interview was satisfactory at least so i judged from the very cordial and even respectful manner in which young somers met me after it was over also i thought it my duty to explain to him with much clearness in the presence of scroope as a witness the great dangers of such an enterprise as that on which he proposed to embark i told him straight out that he must be prepared to find his death in it from starvation fever wild beasts or at the hands of savages while success was quite problematical and very likely would not be attained  you are taking these risks he said  yes i answered but they are incident to the rough trade i follow which is that of a hunter and explorer moreover my youth is past and i have gone through experiences and bereavements of which you know nothing that cause me to set a very slight value on life i care little whether i die or continue in the world for some few added years lastly the excitement of adventure has become a kind of necessity for me i do not think that i could live in england for very long also im a fatalist i believe that when my time comes i must go that this hour is foreordained and that nothing i can do will either hasten or postpone it by one moment your circumstances are different you are quite young if you stay here and approach your father in a proper spirit i have no doubt but that he will forget all the rough words he said to you the other day for which indeed you know you gave him some provocation is it worth while throwing up such prospects and undertaking such dangers for the chance of finding a rare flower i say this to my own disadvantage since i might find it hard to discover anyone else who would risk £2000 upon such a venture but i do urge you to weigh my words  young somers looked at me for a little while then he broke into one of his hearty laughs and exclaimed whatever else you may be mr allan quatermain you are a gentleman no bullionbroker in the city could have put the matter more fairly in the teeth of his own interests  thank you i said  for the rest he went on i too am tired of england and want to see the world it isnt the golden cypripedium that i seek although i should like to win it well enough thats only a symbol what i seek are adventure and romance also like you i am a fatalist god chose his own time to send us here and i presume that he will choose his own time to take us away again so i leave the matter of risks to him  yes mr somers i replied rather solemnly you may find adventure and romance there are plenty of both in africa or you may find a nameless grave in some feverhaunted swamp well you have chosen and i like your spirit  still i was so little satisfied about this business that a week or so before we sailed after much consideration i took it upon myself to write a letter to sir alexander somers in which i set forth the whole matter as clearly as i could not blinking the dangerous nature of our undertaking in conclusion i asked him whether he thought it wise to allow his only son to accompany such an expedition mainly because of a not very serious quarrel with himself  as no answer came to this letter i went on with our preparations there was money in plenty since the resale of o pavo to sir joshua tredgold at some loss had been satisfactorily carried out which enabled me to invest in all things needful with a cheerful heart never before had i been provided with such an outfit as that which preceded us to the ship  at length the day of departure came we stood on the platform at paddington waiting for the dartmouth train to start for in those days the african mail sailed from that port a minute or two before the train left as we were preparing to enter our carriage i caught sight of a face that i seemed to recognise the owner of which was evidently searching for someone in the crowd it was that of briggs sir alexanders clerk whom i had met in the saleroom  mr briggs i said as he passed me are you looking for mr somers if so he is in here  the clerk jumped into the compartment and handed a letter to mr somers then he emerged again and waited somers read the letter and tore off a blank sheet from the end of it on which he hastily wrote some words he passed it to me to give to briggs and i could not help seeing what was written it was too late now god bless you my dear father i hope we may meet again if not try to think kindly of your troublesome and foolish son stephen  in another minute the train had started  by the way he said as we steamed out of the station i have heard from my father who enclosed this for you  i opened the envelope which was addressed in a bold round hand that seemed to me typical of the writer and read as follows    my dear siri appreciate the motives which caused you to write   to me and i thank you very heartily for your letter which shows   me that you are a man of discretion and strict honour as you   surmise the expedition on which my son has entered is not one   that commends itself to me as prudent of the differences between   him and myself you are aware for they came to a climax in your   presence indeed i feel that i owe you an apology for having   dragged you into an unpleasant family quarrel your letter only   reached me today having been forwarded to my place in the country   from my office i should have at once come to town but   unfortunately i am laid up with an attack of gout which makes it   impossible for me to stir therefore the only thing i can do is   to write to my son hoping that the letter which i send by a   special messenger will reach him in time and avail to alter his   determination to undertake this journey here i may add that   although i have differed and do differ from him on various points   i still have a deep affection for my son and earnestly desire his   welfare the prospect of any harm coming to him is one upon which   i cannot bear to dwell   now i am aware that any change of his plans at this eleventh hour   would involve you in serious loss and inconvenience i beg to   inform you formally therefore that in this event i will make   good everything and will in addition write off the £2000 which i   understand he has invested in your joint venture it may be   however that my son who has in him a vein of my own obstinacy   will refuse to change his mind in that event under a higher   power i can only commend him to your care and beg that you will   look after him as though he were your own child i can ask and you   can do no more tell him to write me as opportunity offers as   perhaps you will too also that although i hate the sight of   them i will look after the flowers which he has left at the house   at twickenham                          your obliged servant alexander somers   this letter touched me much and indeed made me feel very uncomfortable without a word i handed it to my companion who read it through carefully  nice of him about the orchids he said my dad has a good heart although he lets his temper get the better of him having had his own way all his life  well what will you do i asked  go on of course ive put my hand to the plough and i am not going to turn back i should be a cur if i did and whats more whatever he might say hed think none the better of me so please dont try to persuade me it would be no good  for quite a while afterwards young somers seemed to be comparatively depressed a state of mind that in his case was rare indeed at last he studied the wintry landscape through the carriage window and said nothing by degrees however he recovered and when we reached dartmouth was as cheerful as ever a mood that i could not altogether share  before we sailed i wrote to sir alexander telling him exactly how things stood and so i think did his son though he never showed me the letter  at durban just as we were about to start up country i received an answer from him sent by some boat that followed us very closely in it he said that he quite understood the position and whatever happened would attribute no blame to me whom he should always regard with friendly feelings he told me that in the event of any difficulty or want of money i was to draw on him for whatever might be required and that he had advised the african bank to that effect further he added that at least his son had shown grit in this matter for which he respected him  and now for a long while i must bid goodbye to sir alexander somers and all that has to do with england     chapter iv                             mavovo and hans  we arrived safely at durban at the beginning of march and took up our quarters at my house on the berea where i expected that brother john would be awaiting us but no brother john was to be found the old lame griqua jack who looked after the place for me and once had been one of my hunters said that shortly after i went away in the ship dogeetah as he called him had taken his tin box and his net and walked off inland he knew not where leaving as he declared no message or letter behind him the cases full of butterflies and dried plants were also gone but these i found he had shipped to some port in america by a sailing vessel bound for the united states which chanced to put in at durban for food and water as to what had become of the man himself i could get no clue he had been seen at maritzburg and according to some kaffirs whom i knew afterwards on the borders of zululand where so far as i could learn he vanished into space  this to say the least of it was disconcerting and a question arose as to what was to be done brother john was to have been our guide he alone knew the mazitu people he alone had visited the borders of the mysterious pongoland i scarcely felt inclined to attempt to reach that country without his aid  when a fortnight had gone by and still there were no signs of him stephen and i held a solemn conference i pointed out the difficulties and dangers of the situation to him and suggested that under the circumstances it might be wise to give up this wild orchidchase and go elephanthunting instead in a certain part of zululand where in those days these animals were still abundant  he was inclined to agree with me since the prospect of killing elephants had attractions for him  and yet i said after reflection its curious but i never remember making a successful trip after altering plans at the last moment that is unless one was driven to it  i vote we toss up said somers it gives providence a chance now then heads for the golden cyp and tails for the elephants  he spun a halfcrown into the air it fell and rolled under a great yellowwood chest full of curiosities that i had collected which it took all our united strength to move we dragged it aside and not without some excitement for really a good deal hung upon the chance i lit a match and peered into the shadow there in the dust lay the coin  what is it i asked of somers who was stretched on his stomach on the chest  orchidi mean head he answered well thats settled so we neednt bother any more  the next fortnight was a busy time for me as it happened there was a schooner in the bay of about one hundred tons burden which belonged to a portuguese trader named delgado who dealt in goods that he carried to the various east african ports and madagascar he was a villainouslooking person whom i suspected of having dealings with the slave traders who were very numerous and a great power in those days if indeed he were not one himself but as he was going to kilwa whence we proposed to start inland i arranged to make use of him to carry our party and the baggage the bargain was not altogether easy to strike for two reasons first he did not appear to be anxious that we should hunt in the districts at the back of kilwa where he assured me there was no game and secondly he said that he wanted to sail at once however i overcame his objections with an argument he could not resistnamely money and in the end he agreed to postpone his departure for fourteen days  then i set about collecting our men of whom i had made up my mind there must not be less than twenty already i had sent messengers summoning to durban from zululand and the upper districts of natal various hunters who had accompanied me on other expeditions to the number of a dozen or so they arrived in due course i have always had the good fortune to be on the best of terms with my kaffirs and where i went they were ready to go without asking any questions the man whom i had selected to be their captain under me was a zulu of the name of mavovo he was a short fellow past middle age with an enormous chest his strength was proverbial indeed it was said that he could throw an ox by the horns and myself i have seen him hold down the head of a wounded buffalo that had fallen until i could come up and shoot it  when i first knew mavovo he was a petty chief and witch doctor in zululand like myself he had fought for the prince umbelazi in the great battle of the tugela a crime which cetewayo never forgave him about a year afterwards he got warning that he had been smelt out as a wizard and was going to be killed he fled with two of his wives and a child the slayers overtook them before he could reach the natal border and stabbed the elder wife and the child of the second wife they were four men but made mad by the sight mavovo turned on them and killed them all then with the remaining wife cut to pieces as he was he crept to the river and through it to natal not long after this wife died also it was said from grief at the loss of her child mavovo did not marry again perhaps because he was now a man without means for cetewayo had taken all his cattle also he was made ugly by an assegai wound which had cut off his right nostril shortly after the death of his second wife he sought me out and told me he was a chief without a kraal and wished to become my hunter so i took him on a step which i never had any cause to regret since although morose and at times given to the practice of uncanny arts he was a most faithful servant and brave as a lion or rather as a buffalo for a lion is not always brave  another man whom i did not send for but who came was an old hottentot named hans with whom i had been more or less mixed up all my life when i was a boy he was my fathers servant in the cape colony and my companion in some of those early wars also he shared some very terrible adventures with me which i have detailed in the history i have written of my first wife marie marais for instance he and i were the only persons who escaped from the massacre of retief and his companions by the zulu king dingaan in the subsequence campaigns including the battle of the blood river he fought at my side and ultimately received a good share of captured cattle after this he retired and set up a native store at a place called pinetown about fifteen miles out of durban here i am afraid he got into bad ways and took to drink more or less also to gambling at any rate he lost most of his property so much of it indeed that he scarcely knew which way to turn thus it happened that one evening when i went out of the house where i had been making up my accounts i saw a yellowfaced whitehaired old fellow squatted on the verandah smoking a pipe made out of a corncob  good day baas he said here am i hans  so i see i answered rather coldly and what are you doing here hans how can you spare time from your drinking and gambling at pinetown to visit me here hans after i have not seen you for three years  baas the gambling is finished because i have nothing more to stake and the drinking is done too because but one bottle of cape smoke makes me feel quite ill next morning so now i only take water and as little of that as i can water and some tobacco to cover up its taste  i am glad to hear it hans if my father the predikant who baptised you were alive now he would have much to say about your conduct as indeed i have no doubt he will presently when you have gone into a hole ie a grave for there in the hole he will be waiting for you hans  i know i know baas i have been thinking of that and it troubles me your reverend father the predikant will be very cross indeed with me when i join him in the place of fires where he sits awaiting me so i wish to make my peace with him by dying well and in your service baas i hear that the baas is going on an expedition i have come to accompany the baas  to accompany me why you are old you are not worth five shillings a month and your scoff food you are a shrunken old brandy cask that will not even hold water  hans grinned right across his ugly face  oh baas i am old but i am clever all these years i have been gathering wisdom i am as full of it as a bees nest is with honey when the summer is done and baas i can stop those leaks in the cask  hans it is no good i dont want you i am going into great danger i must have those about me whom i can trust  well baas and who can be better trusted than hans who warned you of the attack of the quabies on maraisfontein and so saved the life of  hush i said  i understand i will not speak the name it is holy not to be mentioned it is the name of one who stands with the white angels before god not to be mentioned by poor drunken hans still who stood at your side in that great fight ah it makes me young again to think of it when the roof burned when the door was broken down when we met the quabies on the spears when you held the pistol to the head of the holy one whose name must not be mentioned the great one who knew how to die oh baas our lives are twisted up together like the creeper and the tree and where you go there i must go also do not turn me away i ask no wages only a bit of food and a handful of tobacco and the light of your face and a word now and again of the memories that belong to both of us i am still very strong i can shoot wellwell baas who was it that put it into your mind to aim at the tails of the vultures on the hill of slaughter yonder in zululand and so saved the lives of all the boer people and of her whose holy name must not be mentioned baas you will not turn me away  no i answered you can come but you will swear by the spirit of my father the predikant to touch no liquor on this journey  i swear by his spirit and by that of the holy one and he flung himself forward on to his knees took my hand and kissed it then he rose and said in a matteroffact tone if the baas can give me two blankets i shall thank him also five shillings to buy some tobacco and a new knife where are the baass guns i must go to oil them i beg that the baas will take with him that little rifle which is named intombi maiden the one with which he shot the vultures on the hill of slaughter the one that killed the geese in the goose kloof when i loaded for him and he won the great match against the boer whom dingaan called twofaces  good i said here are the five shillings you shall have the blankets and a new gun and all things needful you will find the guns in the little back room and with them those of the baas my companion who also is your master go see to them  at length all was ready the cases of guns ammunition medicines presents and food were on board the maria so were four donkeys that i had bought in the hope that they would prove useful either to ride or as pack beasts the donkey be it remembered and man are the only animals which are said to be immune from the poisonous effects of the bite of tsetse fly except of course the wild game it was our last night at durban a very beautiful night of full moon at the end of march for the portugee delgado had announced his intention of sailing on the following afternoon stephen somers and i were seated on the stoep smoking and talking things over  it is a strange thing i said that brother john should never have turned up i know that he was set upon making this expedition not only for the sake of the orchid but also for some other reason of which he would not speak i think that the old fellow must be dead  very likely answered stephen we had become intimate and i called him stephen now a man alone among savages might easily come to grief and never be heard of again hark whats that and he pointed to some gardenia bushes in the shadow of the house near by whence came a sound of something that moved  a dog i expect or perhaps it is hans he curls up in all sorts of places near to where i may be hans are you there  a figure arose from the gardenia bushes  ja i am here baas  what are you doing hans  i am doing what the dog does baaswatching my master  good i answered then an idea struck me hans you have heard of the white baas with the long beard whom the kaffirs call dogeetah  i have heard of him and once i saw him a few moons ago passing through pinetown a kaffir with him told me that he was going over the drakensberg to hunt for things that crawl and fly being quite mad baas  well where is he now hans he should have been here to travel with us  am i a spirit that i can tell the baas whither a white man has wandered yet stay mavovo may be able to tell he is a great doctor he can see through distance and even now this very night his snake of divination has entered into him and he is looking into the future yonder behind the house i saw him form the circle  i translated what hans said to stephen for he had been talking in dutch then asked him if he would like to see some kaffir magic  of course he answered but its all bosh isnt it  oh yes all bosh or so most people say i answered evasively still sometimes these inyangas tell one strange things  then led by hans we crept round the house to where there was a fivefoot stone wall at the back of the stable beyond this wall within the circle of some huts where my kaffirs lived was an open space with an antheap floor where they did their cooking here facing us sat mavovo while in a ring around him were all the hunters who were to accompany us also jack the lame griqua and the two houseboys in front of mavovo burned a number of little wood fires i counted them and found that there were fourteen which i reflected was the exact number of our hunters plus ourselves one of the hunters was engaged in feeding these fires with little bits of stick and handfuls of dried grass so as to keep them burning brightly the others sat round perfectly silent and watched with rapt attention mavovo himself looked like a man who is asleep he was crouched on his haunches with his big head resting almost upon his knees about his middle was a snakeskin and round his neck an ornament that appeared to be made of human teeth on his right side lay a pile of feathers from the wings of vultures and on his left a little heap of silver moneyi suppose the fees paid by the hunters for whom he was divining  after we had watched him for some while from our shelter behind the wall he appeared to wake out of his sleep first he muttered then he looked up to the moon and seemed to say a prayer of which i could not catch the words next he shuddered three times convulsively and exclaimed in a clear voice  my snake has come it is within me now i can hear now i can see  three of the little fires those immediately in front of him were larger than the others he took up his bundle of vultures feathers selected one with care held it towards the sky then passed it through the flame of the centre one of the three fires uttering as he did so my native name macumazana withdrawing it from the flame he examined the charred edges of the feather very carefully a proceeding that caused a cold shiver to go down my back for i knew well that he was inquiring of his spirit what would be my fate upon this expedition how it answered i cannot tell for he laid the feather down and took another with which he went through the same process this time however the name he called out was mwamwazela which in its shortened form of wazela was the kaffir appellation that the natives had given to stephen somers it means a smile and no doubt was selected for him because of his pleasant smiling countenance  having passed it through the righthand fire of the three he examined it and laid it down  so it went on one after another he called out the names of the hunters beginning with his own as captain passed the feather which represented each of them through the particular fire of his destiny examined and laid it down after this he seemed to go to sleep again for a few minutes then woke up as a man does from a natural slumber yawned and stretched himself  speak said his audience with great anxiety have you seen have you heard what does your snake tell you of me of me of me of me  i have seen i have heard he answered my snake tells me that this will be a very dangerous journey of those who go on it six will die by the bullet by the spear or by sickness and others will be hurt  ow said one of them but which will die and which will come out safe does not your snake tell you that o doctor  yes of course my snake tells me that but my snake tells me also to hold my tongue on the matter lest some of us should be turned to cowards it tells me further that the first who should ask me more will be one of those who must die now do you ask or you or you or you ask if you will  strange to say no one accepted the invitation never have i seen a body of men so indifferent to the future at least to every appearance one and all they seemed to come to the conclusion that so far as they were concerned it might be left to look after itself  my snake told me something else went on mavovo it is that if among this company there is any jackal of a man who thinking that he might be one of the six to die dreams to avoid his fate by deserting it will be of no use for then my snake will point him out and show me how to deal with him  now with one voice each man present there declared that desertion from the lord macumazana was the last thing that could possibly occur to him indeed i believe that those brave fellows spoke truth no doubt they put faith in mavovos magic after the fashion of their race still the death he promised was some way off and each hoped he would be one of the six to escape moreover the zulu of those days was too accustomed to death to fear its terrors over much  one of them did however venture to advance the argument which mavovo treated with proper contempt that the shillings paid for this divination should be returned by him to the next heirs of such of them as happened to decease why he asked should these pay a shilling in order to be told that they must die it seemed unreasonable  certainly the zulu kaffirs have a queer way of looking at things  hans i whispered is your fire among those that burn yonder  not so baas he wheezed back into my ear does the baas think me a fool if i must die i must die if i am to live i shall live why then should i pay a shilling to learn what time will declare moreover yonder mavovo takes the shillings and frightens everybody but tells nobody anything i call it cheating but baas do you and the baas wazela have no fear you did not pay shillings and therefore mavovo though without doubt he is a great inyanga cannot really prophesy concerning you since his snake will not work without a fee  the argument seems remarkably absurd yet it must be common for now that i come to think of it no gipsy will tell a true fortune unless her hand is crossed with silver  i say quatermain said stephen idly since our friend mavovo seems to know so much ask him what has become of brother john as hans suggested tell me what he says afterwards for i want to see something  so i went through the little gate in the wall in a natural kind of way as though i had seen nothing and appeared to be struck by the sight of the little fires  well mavovo i said are you doing doctors work i thought that it had brought you into enough trouble in zululand  that is so baba replied mavovo who had a habit of calling me father though he was older than i it cost me my chieftainship and my cattle and my two wives and my son it made of me a wanderer who is glad to accompany a certain macumazana to strange lands where many things may befall me yes he added with meaning even the last of all things and yet a gift is a gift and must be used you baba have a gift of shooting and do you cease to shoot you have a gift of wandering and can you cease to wander  he picked up one of the burnt feathers from the little pile by his side and looked at it attentively perhaps baba you have been toldmy ears are very sharp and i thought i heard some such words floating through the air just nowthat we poor kaffir inyangas can prophesy nothing true unless we are paid and perhaps that is a fact so far as something of the moment is concerned and yet the snake in the inyanga jumping over the little rock which hides the present from it may see the path that winds far and far away through the valleys across the streams up the mountains till it is lost in the heaven above thus on this feather burnt in my magic fire i seem to see something of your future o my father macumazana far and far your road runs and he drew his finger along the feather here is a journey and he flicked away a carbonised flake here is another and another and another and he flicked off flake after flake here is one that is very successful it leaves you rich and here is yet one more a wonderful journey this in which you see strange things and meet strange people thenand he blew on the feather in such a fashion that all the charred filaments brother john says that laminae is the right word for them fell away from itthen there is nothing left save such a pole as some of my people stick upright on a grave the shaft of memory they call it o my father you will die in a distant land but you will leave a great memory behind you that will live for hundreds of years for see how strong is this quill over which the fire has had no power with some of these others it is quite different he added  i daresay i broke in but mavovo be so good as to leave me out of your magic for i dont at all want to know what is going to happen to me today is enough for me without studying next month and next year there is a saying in our holy book which runs sufficient to the day is its evil  quite so o macumazana also that is a very good saying as some of those hunters of yours are thinking now yet an hour ago they were forcing their shillings on me that i might tell them of the future and you too want to know something you did not come through that gate to quote to me the wisdom of your holy book what is it baba be quick for my snake is getting very tired he wishes to go back to his hole in the world beneath  well then i answered in rather a shamefaced fashion for mavovo had an uncanny way of seeing into ones secret motives i should like to know if you can tell me which you cant what has become of the white man with the long beard whom you black people call dogeetah he should have been here to go on this journey with us indeed he was to be our guide and we cannot find him where is he and why is he not here  have you anything about you that belonged to dogeetah macumazana  no i answered that is yes and from my pocket i produced the stump of pencil that brother john had given me which being economical i had saved up ever since mavovo took it and after considering it carefully as he had done in the case of the feathers swept up a pile of ashes with his horny hand from the edge of the largest of the little fires that indeed which had represented myself these ashes he patted flat then he drew on them with the point of the pencil tracing what seemed to me to be the rough image of a man such as children scratch upon whitewashed walls when he had finished he sat up and contemplated his handiwork with all the satisfaction of an artist a breeze had risen from the sea and was blowing in little gusts so that the fine ashes were disturbed some of the lines of the picture being filled in and others altered or enlarged  for a while mavovo sat with his eyes shut then he opened them studied the ashes and what remained of the picture and taking a blanket that lay near by threw it over his own head and over the ashes withdrawing it again presently he cast it aside and pointed to the picture which was now quite changed indeed in the moonlight it looked more like a landscape than anything else  all is clear my father he said in a matteroffact voice the white wanderer dogeetah is not dead he lives but he is sick something is the matter with one of his legs so that he cannot walk perhaps a bone is broken or some beast has bitten him he lies in a hut such as kaffirs make only this hut has a verandah round it like your stoep and there are drawings on the wall the hut is a long way off i dont know where  is that all i asked for he paused  no not all dogeetah is recovering he will join us in that country whither we journey at a time of trouble that is all and the fee is halfacrown  you mean one shilling i suggested  no my father macumazana one shilling for simple magic such as foretelling the fate of common black people halfacrown for very difficult magic that has to do with white people magic of which only great doctors like me mavovo are the masters  i gave him the halfcrown and said  look here friend mavovo i believe in you as a fighter and a hunter but as a magician i think you are a humbug indeed i am so sure of it that if ever dogeetah turns up at a time of trouble in that land whither we are journeying i will make you a present of that doublebarrelled rifle of mine which you admired so much  one of his rare smiles appeared upon mavovos ugly face  then give it to me now baba he said for it is already earned my snake cannot lieespecially when the fee is halfacrown  i shook my head and declined politely but with firmness  ah said mavovo you white men are very clever and think that you know everything but it is not so for in learning so much that is new you have forgotten more that is old when the snake that is in you macumazana dwelt in a black savage like me a thousand thousand years ago you could have done and did what i do but now you can only mock and say mavovo the brave in battle the great hunter the loyal man becomes a liar when he blows the burnt feather or reads what the wind writes upon the charmed ashes  i do not say that you are a liar mavovo i say that you are deceived by your own imaginings it is not possible that man can know what is hidden from man  is it indeed so o macumazana watcher by night am i mavovo the pupil of zikali the opener of roads the greatest of wizards indeed deceived by my own imaginings and has man no other eyes but those in his head that he cannot see what is hidden from man well you say so and all we black people know that you are very clever and why should i a poor zulu be able to see what you cannot see yet when tomorrow one sends you a message from the ship in which we are to sail begging you to come fast because there is trouble on the ship then bethink you of your words and my words and whether or no man can see what is hidden from man in the blackness of the future oh that rifle of yours is mine already though you will not give it to me now you who think that i am a cheat well my father macumazana because you think i am a cheat never again will i blow the feather or read what the wind writes upon the ashes for you or any who eat your food  then he rose saluted me with uplifted right hand collected his little pile of money and bag of medicines and marched off to the sleeping hut  on our way round the house we met my old lame caretaker jack  inkoosi he said the white chief wazela bade me say that he and the cook sam have gone to sleep on board the ship to look after the goods sam came up just now and fetched him away he says he will show you why tomorrow  i nodded and passed on wondering to myself why stephen had suddenly determined to stay the night on the maria     chapter v                                  hassan  i suppose it must have been two hours after dawn on the following morning that i was awakened by knocks upon the door and the voice of jack saying that sam the cook wanted to speak to me  wondering what he could be doing there as i understood he was sleeping on the ship i called out that he was to come in now this sam i should say hailed from the cape and was a person of mixed blood the original stock i imagine was malay which had been crossed with indian coolie also somewhere or other there was a dash of white and possibly but of this i am not sure a little hottentot the result was a person of few vices and many virtues sammy i may say at once was perhaps the biggest coward i ever met he could not help it it was congenital though curiously enough this cowardice of his never prevented him from rushing into fresh danger thus he knew that the expedition upon which i was engaged would be most hazardous remembering his weakness i explained this to him very clearly yet that knowledge did not deter him from imploring that he might be allowed to accompany me perhaps this was because there was some mutual attachment between us as in the case of hans once a good many years before i had rescued sammy from a somewhat serious scrape by declining to give evidence against him i need not enter into the details but a certain sum of money over which he had control had disappeared i will merely say therefore that at the time he was engaged to a coloured lady of very expensive tastes whom in the end he never married  after this as it chanced he nursed me through an illness hence the attachment of which i have spoken  sammy was the son of a native christian preacher and brought up upon what he called the word he had received an excellent education for a person of his class and in addition to many native dialects with which a varied career had made him acquainted spoke english perfectly though in the most bombastic style never would he use a short word if a long one came to his hand or rather to his tongue for several years of his life he was i believe a teacher in a school at capetown where coloured persons received their education his department as he called it being english language and literature  wearying of or being dismissed from his employment for some reason that he never specified he had drifted up the coast to zanzibar where he turned his linguistic abilities to the study of arabic and became the manager or head cook of an hotel after a few years he lost this billet i know not how or why and appeared at durban in what he called a reversed position here it was that we met again just before my expedition to pongoland  in manners he was most polite in disposition most religious i believe he was a baptist by faith and in appearance a small brown dandy of a man of uncertain age who wore his hair parted in the middle and whatever the circumstances was always tidy in his garments  i took him on because he was in great distress an excellent cook the best of nurses and above all for the reason that as i have said we were in a way attached to each other also he always amused me intensely which goes for something on a long journey of the sort that i contemplated  such in brief was sammy  as he entered the room i saw that his clothes were very wet and asked him at once if it were raining or whether he had got drunk and been sleeping in the damp grass  no mr quatermain he answered the morning is extremely fine and like the poor hottentot hans i have abjured the use of intoxicants though we differ on much else in this matter we agree  then what the deuce is up i interrupted to cut short his flow of fine language  sir there is trouble on the ship remembering mavovo i started at these words where i passed the night in the company of mr somers at his special request it was the other way about really this morning before the dawn when he thought that everybody was asleep the portuguese captain and some of his arabs began to weigh the anchor quite quietly also to hoist the sails but mr somers and i being very much awake came out of the cabin and he sat upon the capstan with a revolver in his hand sayingwell sir i will not repeat what he said  no dont what happened then  then sir there followed much noise and confusion the portugee and the arabs threatened mr somers but he sir continued to sit upon the capstan with the stern courage of a rock in a rushing stream and remarked that he would see them all somewhere before they touched it after this sir i do not know what occurred since while i watched from the bulwarks someone knocked me head over heels into the sea and being fortunately a good swimmer i gained the shore and hurried here to advise you  and did you advise anyone else you idiot i asked  yes sir as i sped along i communicated to an officer of the port that there was the devil of a mess upon the maria which he would do well to investigate  by this time i was in my shirt and trousers and shouting to mavovo and the others soon they arrived for as the costume of mavovo and his company consisted only of a moocha and a blanket it did not take them long to dress  mavovo i began there is trouble on the ship  o baba he interrupted with something resembling a grin it is very strange but last night i dreamed that i told you  curse your dreams i said gather the men and go downno that wont work there would be murder done either it is all over now or it is all right get the hunters ready i come with them the luggage can be fetched afterwards  within less than an hour we were at that wharf off which the maria lay in what one day will be the splendid port of durban though in those times its shipping arrangements were exceedingly primitive a strangelooking band we must have been i who was completely dressed and i trust tidy marched ahead next came hans in the filthy wideawake hat which he usually wore and greasy corduroys and after him the oleaginous sammy arrayed in european reachmedowns a billycock and a bright blue tie striped with red garments that would have looked very smart had it not been for his recent immersion after him followed the fiercelooking mavovo and his squad of hunters all of whom wore the ring or isicoco as the zulus call it that is a circle of polished black wax sewn into their short hair they were a grim set of fellows but as according to a recent law it was not allowable for them to appear armed in the town their guns had already been shipped while their broad stabbing spears were rolled up in their sleeping mats the blades wrapped round with dried grass  each of them however bore in his hand a large knobkerry of redwood and they marched four by four in martial fashion it is true that when we embarked on the big boat to go to the ship much of their warlike ardour evaporated since these men who feared nothing on the land were terribly afraid of that unfamiliar element the water  we reached the maria an unimposing kind of tub and climbed aboard on looking aft the first thing that i saw was stephen seated on the capstan with a pistol in his hand as sammy had said near by leaning on the bulwark was the villainouslooking portugee delgado apparently in the worst of tempers and surrounded by a number of equally villainouslooking arab sailors clad in dirty white in front was the captain of the port a wellknown and esteemed gentleman of the name of cato like myself a small man who had gone through many adventures accompanied by some attendants he was seated on the afterskylight smoking with his eyes fixed upon stephen and the portugee  glad to see you quatermain he said theres some row on here but i have only just arrived and dont understand portuguese and the gentleman on the capstan wont leave it to explain  whats up stephen i asked after shaking mr cato by the hand  whats up replied somers this man and he pointed to delgado wanted to sneak out to sea with all our goods thats all to say nothing of me and sammy whom no doubt hed have chucked overboard as soon as he was out of sight of land however sammy who knows portuguese overheard his little plans and as you see i objected  well delgado was asked for his version of the affair and as i expected explained that he only intended to get a little nearer to the bar and there wait till we arrived of course he lied and knew that we were aware of the fact and that his intention had been to slip out to sea with all our valuable property which he would sell after having murdered or marooned stephen and the poor cook but as nothing could be proved and we were now in strong enough force to look after ourselves and our belongings i did not see the use of pursuing the argument so i accepted the explanation with a smile and asked everybody to join in a morning nip  afterwards stephen told me that while i was engaged with mavovo on the previous night a message had reached him from sammy who was on board the ship in charge of our belongings saying that he would be glad of some company knowing the cooks nervous nature fortunately enough he made up his mind at once to go and sleep upon the maria in the morning trouble arose as sammy had told me what he did not tell me was that he was not knocked overboard as he said but took to the water of his own accord when complications with delgado appeared imminent  i understand the position i said and alls well that ends well but its lucky you thought of coming on board to sleep  after this everything went right i sent some of the men back in the charge of stephen for our remaining effects which they brought safely aboard and in the evening we sailed our voyage up to kilwa was beautiful a gentle breeze driving us forward over a sea so calm that not even hans who i think was one of the worst sailors in the world or the zulu hunters were really sick though as sammy put it they declined their food  i think it was on the fifth night of our voyage or it may have been the seventh that we anchored one afternoon off the island of kilwa not very far from the old portuguese fort delgado with whom we had little to do during the passage hoisted some queer sort of signal in response a boat came off containing what he called the port officials a band of cutthroat desperatelooking black fellows in charge of a pockmarked elderly halfbreed who was introduced to us as the bey hassanbenmohammed that mr hassanbenmohammed entirely disapproved of our presence on the ship and especially of our proposed landing at kilwa was evident to me from the moment that i set eyes upon his illfavoured countenance after a hurried conference with delgado he came forward and addressed me in arabic of which i could not understand a word luckily however sam the cook who as i think i said was a great linguist had a fair acquaintance with this tongue acquired it appears while at the zanzibar hotel so not trusting delgado i called on him to interpret  what is he saying sammy i asked  he began to talk to hassan and replied presently  sir he makes you many compliments he says that he has heard what a great man who are from his friend delgado also that you and mr somers are english a nation which he adores  does he i exclaimed i should never have thought it from his looks thank him for his kind remarks and tell him that we are going to land here and march up country to shoot  sammy obeyed and the conversation went on somewhat as follows  with all humility i ie hassan request you not to land this country is not a fit place for such noble gentlemen there is nothing to eat and no head of game has been seen for years the people in the interior are savages of the worst sort whom hunger has driven to take to cannibalism i would not have your blood upon my head i beg of you therefore to go on in this ship to delagoa bay where you will find a good hotel or to any other place you may select  aq might i ask you noble sir what is your position at kilwa that you consider yourself responsible for our safety  h honoured english lord i am a trader here of portuguese nationality but born of an arab mother of high birth and brought up among that people i have gardens on the mainland tended by my native servants who are as children to me where i grow palms and cassava and ground nuts and plantains and many other kinds of produce all the tribes in this district look upon me as their chief and venerated father  aq then noble hassan you will be able to pass us through them seeing that we are peaceful hunters who wish to harm no one  a long consultation between hassan and delgado during which i ordered mavovo to bring his zulus on deck with their guns  h honoured english lord i cannot allow you to land  aq noble son of the prophet i intend to land with my friend my followers my donkeys and my goods early tomorrow morning if i can do so with your leave i shall be glad if not and i glanced at the fierce group of hunters behind me  h honoured english lord i shall be grieved to use force but let me tell you that in my peaceful village ashore i have at least a hundred men armed with rifles whereas here i see under twenty  aq after reflection and a few words with stephen somers can you tell me noble sir if from your peaceful village you have yet sighted the english manofwar crocodile i mean the steamer that is engaged in watching for the dhows of wicked slavers a letter from her captain informed me that he would be in these waters by yesterday perhaps however he has been delayed for a day or two  if i had exploded a bomb at the feet of the excellent hassan its effect could scarcely have been more remarkable than that of this question he turnednot pale but a horrible yellow and exclaimed  english manofwar crocodile i thought she had gone to aden to refit and would not be back at zanzibar for four months  aq you have been misinformed noble hassan she will not refit till october shall i read you the letter and i produced a piece of paper from my pocket it may be interesting since my friend the captain whom you remember is named flowers mentions you in it he says  hassan waved his hand it is enough i see honoured lord that you are a man of mettle not easily to be turned from your purpose in the name of god the compassionate land and go wheresoever you like  aq i think that i had almost rather wait until the crocodile comes in  h land land captain delgado get up the cargo and man your boat mine too is at the service of these lords you captain will like to get away by this nights tide there is still light lord quatermain and such hospitality as i can offer is at your service  aq ah i knew bey hassan that you were only joking with me when you said that you wished us to go elsewhere an excellent jest truly from one whose hospitality is so famous well to fall in with your wishes we will come ashore this evening and if the captain delgado chances to sight the queens ship crocodile before he sails perhaps he will be so good as to signal to us with a rocket  certainly certainly interrupted delgado who up to this time had pretended that he understood no english the tongue in which i was speaking to the interpreter sammy  then he turned and gave orders to his arab crew to bring up our belongings from the hold and to lower the marias boat  never did i see goods transferred in quicker time within half an hour every one of our packages was off that ship for stephen somers kept a count of them our personal baggage went into the marias boat and the goods together with the four donkeys which were lowered on to the top of them were rumbled pellmell into the bargelike punt belonging to hassan here also i was accommodated with about half of our people the rest taking their seats in the smaller boat under the charge of stephen  at length all was ready and we cast off  farewell captain i cried to delgado if you should sight the crocodile  at this point delgado broke into such a torrent of bad language in portuguese arabic and english that i fear the rest of my remarks never reached him  as we rowed shorewards i observed that hans who was seated near to me under the stomach of a jackass was engaged in sniffing at the sides and bottom of the barge as a dog might do and asked him what he was about  very odd smell in this boat he whispered back in dutch it stinks of kaffir man just like the hold of the maria i think this boat is used to carry slaves  be quiet i whispered back and stop nosing at those planks but to myself i thought hans is right we are in a nest of slavetraders and this hassan is their leader  we rowed past the island on which i observed the ruins of an old portuguese fort and some long grassroofed huts where i reflected the slaves were probably kept until they could be shipped away observing my glance fixed upon these hassan hastened to explain through sammy that they were storehouses in which he dried fish and hides and kept goods  how interesting i answered further south we dry hides in the sun  crossing a narrow channel we arrived at a rough jetty where we disembarked whence we were led by hassan not to the village which i now saw upon our left but to a pleasantlooking though dilapidated house that stood a hundred yards from the shore something about the appearance of this house impressed me with the idea that it was never built by slavers the whole look of the place with its verandah and garden suggested taste and civilisation evidently educated people had designed it and resided here i glanced about me and saw amidst a grove of neglected orange trees that were surrounded with palms of some age the ruins of a church about this there was no doubt for there surmounted by a stone cross was a little penthouse in which still hung the bell that once summoned the worshippers to prayer  tell the english lord said hassan to sammy that these buildings were a mission station of the christians who abandoned them more than twenty years ago when i came here i found them empty  indeed i answered and what were the names of those who dwelt in them  i never heard said hassan they had been gone a long while when i came  then we went up to the house and for the next hour and more were engaged with our baggage which was piled in a heap in what had been the garden and in unpacking and pitching two tents for the hunters which i caused to be placed immediately in front of the rooms that were assigned to us those rooms were remarkable in their way mine had evidently been a sitting chamber as i judged from some such broken articles of furniture that appeared to be of american make that which stephen occupied had once served as a sleepingplace for the bedstead of iron still remained there also there were a hanging bookcase now fallen and some tattered remnants of books one of these that oddly enough was wellpreserved perhaps because the white ants or other creatures did not like the taste of its morocco binding was a kebles christian year on the titlepage of which was written to my dearest elizabeth on her birthday from her husband i took the liberty to put it in my pocket on the wall moreover still hung the small watercolour picture of a very pretty young woman with fair hair and blue eyes in the corner of which picture was written in the same handwriting as that in the book elizabeth aged twenty this also i annexed thinking that it might come in useful as a piece of evidence  looks as if the owners of this place had left it in a hurry quatermain said stephen  thats it my boy or perhaps they didnt leave perhaps they stopped here  murdered  i nodded and said i dare say friend hassan could tell us something about the matter meanwhile as supper isnt ready yet let us have a look at that church while it is light  we walked through the palm and orange grove to where the building stood finely placed upon a mound it was wellconstructed of a kind of coral rock and a glance showed us that it had been gutted by fire the discoloured walls told their own tale the interior was now full of shrubs and creepers and an ugly yellowish snake glided from what had been the stone altar without the graveyard was enclosed by a broken wall only we could see no trace of graves near the gateway however was a rough mound  if we could dig into that i said i expect we should find the bones of the people who inhabited this place does that suggest anything to you stephen  nothing except that they were probably killed  you should learn to draw inferences it is a useful art especially in africa it suggests to me that if you are right the deed was not done by natives who would never take the trouble to bury the dead arabs on the contrary might do so especially if there were any bastard portuguese among them who called themselves christians but whatever happened must have been a long while ago and i pointed to a selfsown hardwood tree growing from the mound which could scarcely have been less than twenty years old  we returned to the house to find that our meal was ready hassan had asked us to dine with him but for obvious reasons i preferred that sammy should cook our food and that he should dine with us he appeared full of compliments though i could see hate and suspicion in his eye and we fell to on the kid that we had bought from him for i did not wish to accept any gifts from this fellow our drink was squareface gin mixed with water that i sent hans to fetch with his own hands from the stream that ran by the house lest otherwise it should be drugged  at first hassan like a good mohammedan refused to touch any spirits but as the meal went on he politely relented upon this point and i poured him out a liberal tot the appetite comes in eating as the frenchman said and the same thing applies to drinking so at least it was in hassans case who probably thought that the quantity swallowed made no difference to his sin after the third dose of squareface he grew quite amiable and talkative thinking the opportunity a good one i sent for sammy and through him told our host that we were anxious to hire twenty porters to carry our packages he declared that there was not such a thing as a porter within a hundred miles whereon i gave him some more gin the end of it was that we struck a bargain i forget for how much he promising to find us twenty good men who were to stay with us for as long as we wanted them  then i asked him about the destruction of the mission station but although he was halfdrunk on this point he remained very close all he would say was that he had heard that twenty years ago the people called the mazitu who were very fierce had raided right down to the coast and killed those who dwelt there except a white man and his wife who had fled inland and never been seen again  how many of them were buried in that mound by the church i asked quickly  who told you they were buried there he replied with a start but seeing his mistake went on i do not know what you mean i never heard of anyone being buried sleep well honoured lords i must go and see to the loading of my goods upon the maria then rising he salaamed and walked or rather rolled away  so the maria hasnt sailed after all i said and whistled in a certain fashion instantly hans crept into the room out of the darkness for this was my signal to him  hans i said i hear sounds upon that island slip down to the shore and spy out what is happening no one will see you if you are careful  no baas he answered with a grin i do not think that anyone will see hans if he is careful especially at night and he slid away as quietly as he had come  now i went out and spoke to mavovo telling him to keep a good watch and to be sure that every man had his gun ready as i thought that these people were slavetraders and might attack us in the night  in that event i said they were to fall back upon the stoep but not to fire until i gave the word  good my father he answered this is a lucky journey i never thought there would be hope of war so soon my snake forgot to mention it the other night sleep safe macumazana nothing that walks shall reach you while we live  dont be so sure i answered and we lay down in the bedroom with our clothes on and our rifles by our sides  the next thing i remember was someone shaking me by the shoulder i thought it was stephen who had agreed to keep awake for the first part of the night and to call me at one in the morning indeed he was awake for i could see the glow from the pipe he smoked  baas whispered the voice of hans i have found out everything they are loading the maria with slaves taking them in big boats from the island  so i answered but how did you get here are the hunters asleep without  he chuckled no they are not asleep they look with all their eyes and listen with all their ears yet old hans passed through them even the baas somers did not hear him  that i didnt said stephen thought a rat was moving no more  i stepped through the place where the door had been on to the stoep by the light of the fire which the hunters had lit without i could see mavovo sitting wide awake his gun upon his knees and beyond him two sentries i called him and pointed to hans  see i said what good watchmen you are when one can step over your heads and enter my room without your knowing it  mavovo looked at the hottentot and felt his clothes and boots to see whether they were wet with the night dew  ow he exclaimed in a surly voice i said that nothing which walks could reach you macumazana but this yellow snake has crawled between us on his belly look at the new mud that stains his waistcoat  yet snakes can bite and kill answered hans with a snigger oh you zulus think that you are very brave and shout and flourish spears and battleaxes one poor hottentot dog is worth a whole impi of you after all no dont try to strike me mavovo the warrior since we both serve the same master in our separate ways when it comes to fighting i will leave the matter to you but when it is a case of watching or spying do you leave it to hans look here mavovo and he opened his hand in which was a horn snuffbox such as zulus sometimes carry in their ears to whom does this belong  it is mine said mavovo and you have stolen it  yes jeered hans it is yours also i stole it from your ear as i passed you in the dark dont you remember that you thought a gnat had tickled you and hit up at your face  it is true growled mavovo and you snake of a hottentot are great in your own low way yet next time anything tickles me i shall strike not with my hand but with a spear  then i turned them both out remarking to stephen that this was a good example of the eternal fight between courage and cunning after this as i was sure that hassan and his friends were too busy to interfere with us that night we went to bed and slept the sleep of the just  when i got up the next morning i found that stephen somers had already risen and gone out nor did he appear until i was half through my breakfast  where on earth have you been i asked noting that his clothes were torn and covered with wet moss  up the tallest of those palm trees quatermain saw an arab climbing one of them with a rope and got another arab to teach me the trick it isnt really difficult though it looks alarming  what in the name of goodness i began  oh he interrupted my ruling passion looking through the glasses i thought i caught sight of an orchid growing near the crown so went up it wasnt an orchid after all only a mass of yellow pollen but i learned something for my pains sitting in the top of that palm i saw the maria working out from under the lee of the island also far away i noted a streak of smoke and watching it through the glasses made out what looked to me uncommonly like a manofwar steaming slowly along the coast in fact i am sure it was and english too then the mist came up and i lost sight of them  my word i said that will be the crocodile what i told our host hassan was not altogether bunkum mr cato the port officer at durban mentioned to me that the crocodile was expected to call there within the next fortnight to take in stores after a slavehunting cruise down the coast now it would be odd if she chanced to meet the maria and asked to have a look at her cargo wouldnt it  not at all quatermain for unless one or the other of them changes her course that is just what she must do within the next hour or so and i jolly well hope she will i havent forgiven that beast delgado the trick he tried to play on us by slipping away with our goods to say nothing of those poor devils of slaves pass the coffee will you  for the next ten minutes we ate in silence for stephen had an excellent appetite and was hungry after his morning climb  just as we finished our meal hassan appeared looking even more villainous than he had done the previous day i saw also that he was in a truculent mood induced perhaps by the headache from which he was evidently suffering as a result of his potations or perhaps the fact that the maria had got safe away with the slaves as he imagined unobserved by us was the cause of the change of his demeanour a third alternative may have been that he intended to murder us during the previous night and found no safe opportunity of carrying out his amiable scheme  we saluted him courteously but without salaaming in reply he asked me bluntly through sammy when we intended to be gone as such christian dogs defiled his house which he wanted for himself  i answered as soon as the twenty bearers whom he had promised us appeared but not before  you lie he said i never promised you bearers i have none here  do you mean that you shipped them all away in the maria with the slaves last night i asked sweetly  my reader have you ever taken note of the appearance and proceedings of a tomcat of established age and morose disposition when a little dog suddenly disturbs it on the prowl have you observed how it contorts itself into arched but unnatural shapes how it swells visibly to almost twice its normal size how its hair stands up and its eyes flash and the stream of unmentionable language that proceeds from its open mouth if so you will have a very good idea of the effect produced upon hassan by this remark of mine the fellow looked as though he were going to burst with rage he rolled about his bloodshot eyes seemed to protrude he cursed us horribly he put his hand upon the hilt of the great knife he wore and finally he did what the tomcat does he spat  now stephen was standing with me looking as cool as a cucumber and very much amused and being as it chanced a little nearer to hassan than i was received the full benefit of this rude proceeding my word didnt it wake him up he said something strong and the next second flew at the halfbreed like a tiger landing him a beauty straight upon the nose back staggered hassan drawing his knife as he did so but stephens left in the eye caused him to drop it as he dropped himself i pounced upon the knife and since it was too late to interfere for the mischief had been done let things take their course and held back the zulus who had rushed up at the noise  hassan rose and to do him credit came on like a man head down his great skull caught stephen who was the lighter of the two in the chest and knocked him over but before the arab could follow up the advantage he was on his feet again then ensued a really glorious mill hassan fought with head and fists and feet stephen with fists alone dodging his opponents rushes he gave it to him as he passed and soon his coolness and silence began to tell once he was knocked over by a hooked one under the jaw but in the next round he sent the arab literally flying head over heels oh how those zulus cheered and i too danced with delight up hassan came again spitting out several teeth and adopting new tactics grabbed stephen round the middle to and fro they swung the arab trying to kick the englishman with his knees and to bite him also till the pain reminded him of the absence of his front teeth once he nearly got him downnearly but not quite for the collar by which he had gripped him his object was to strangle burst and at that juncture hassans turban fell over his face blinding him for a moment  then stephen gripped him round the middle with his left arm and with his right pommelled him unmercifully till he sank in a sitting position to the ground and held up his hand in token of surrender  the noble english lord has beaten me he gasped  apologise yelled stephen picking up a handful of mud or i shove this down your dirty throat  he seemed to understand at any rate he bowed till his forehead touched the ground and apologised very thoroughly  now that is over i said cheerfully to him so how about those bearers  i have no bearers he answered  you dirty liar i exclaimed one of my people has been down to your village there and says it is full of men  then go and take them for yourself he replied viciously for he knew that the place was stockaded  now i was in a fix it was all very well to give a slavedealer the thrashing he deserved but if he chose to attack us with his arabs we should be in a poor way watching me with the eye that was not bunged up hassan guessed my perplexity  i have been beaten like a dog he said his rage returning to him with his breath but god is compassionate and just he will avenge in due time  the words had not left his lips for one second when from somewhere out at sea there floated the sullen boom of a great gun at this moment too an arab rushed up from the shore crying  where is the bey hassan  here i said pointing at him  the arab stared until i thought his eyes would drop out for the bey hassan was indeed a sight to see then he gabbled in a frightened voice  captain an english manofwar is chasing the maria  boom went the great gun for the second time hassan said nothing but his jaw dropped and i saw that he had lost exactly three teeth  that is the crocodile i remarked slowly causing sammy to translate and as i spoke produced from my inner pocket a union jack which i had placed there after i heard that the ship was sighted stephen i went on as i shook it out if you have got your wind would you mind climbing up that palm tree again and signalling with this to the crocodile out at sea  by george thats a good idea said stephen whose jovial face although swollen was now again wreathed in smiles hans bring me a long stick and a bit of string  but hassan did not think it at all a good idea  english lord he gasped you shall have the bearers i will go to fetch them  no you wont i said you will stop here as a hostage send that man  hassan uttered some rapid orders and the messenger sped away this time towards the stockaded village on the right  as he went another messenger arrived who also stared amazedly at the condition of his chief  beyif you are the bey he said in a doubtful voice for by now the amiable face of hassan had begun to swell and colour with the telescope we have seen that the english manofwar has sent a boat and boarded the maria  god is great muttered the discomfited hassan and delgado who is a thief and a traitor from his mothers breast will tell the truth the english sons of satan will land here all is finished nothing is left but flight bid the people fly into the bush and take the slavesi mean their servants i will join them  no you wont i interrupted through sammy at any rate not at present you will come with us  the miserable hassan reflected then he asked  lord quatermain i remember the title because it is the nearest i ever got or am likely to get to the peerage if i furnish you with the twenty bearers and accompany you for some days on your journey inland will you promise not to signal to your countrymen on the ship and bring them ashore  what do you think i asked of stephen  oh he answered i think id agree this scoundrel has had a pretty good dusting and if once the crocodile people land therell be an end of our expedition as sure as eggs are eggs they will carry us off to zanzibar or somewhere to give evidence before a slave court also nothing will be gained for by the time the sailors get here all these rascals will have bolted except our friend hassan you see it isnt as though we were sure he would be hung hed probably escape after all international law subject of a foreign power no direct proofthat kind of thing you know  give me a minute or two i said and began to reflect very deeply  whilst i was thus engaged several things happened i saw twenty natives being escorted towards us doubtless the bearers who had been promised also i saw many others accompanied by other natives flying from the village into the bush lastly a third messenger arrived who announced that the maria was sailing away apparently in charge of a prizecrew and that the manofwar was putting about as though to accompany her evidently she had no intention of effecting a landing upon what was nominally at any rate portuguese territory therefore if anything was to be done we must act at once  well the end of it was that like a fool i accepted stephens advice and did nothing always the easiest course and generally that which leads to most trouble ten minutes afterwards i changed my mind but then it was too late the crocodile was out of signalling distance this was subsequent to a conversation with hans  baas said that worthy in his leery fashion i think you have made a mistake you forget that these yellow devils in white robes who have run away will come back again and that when you return from up country they may be waiting for you now if the english manofwar had destroyed their town and their slavesheds they might have gone somewhere else however he added as an afterthought glancing at the disfigured hassan we have their captain and of course you mean to hang him baas or if you dont like to leave it to me i can hang men very well once when i was young i helped the executioner at cape town  get out i said but nevertheless i knew that hans was right     chapter vi                              the slave road  the twenty bearers having arrived in charge of five or six arabs armed with guns we went to inspect them taking hassan with us also the hunters they were a likely lot of men though rather thin and scaredlooking and evidently as i could see from their physical appearance and varying methods of dressing the hair members of different tribes having delivered them the arabs or rather one of them entered into excited conversation with hassan as sammy was not at hand i do not know what was said although i gathered that they were contemplating his rescue if so they gave up the idea and began to run away as their companions had done one of them however a bolder fellow than the rest turned and fired at me he missed by some yards as i could tell from the sing of the bullet for these arabs are execrable shots still his attempt at murder irritated me so much that i determined he should not go scotfree i was carrying the little rifle called intombi that with which as hans had reminded me i shot the vultures at dingaans kraal many years before of course i could have killed the man but this i did not wish to do or i could have shot him through the leg but then we should have had to nurse him or leave him to die so i selected his right arm which was outstretched as he fled and at about fifty paces put a bullet through it just above the elbow  there i said to the zulus as i saw it double up that low fellow will never shoot at anyone again  pretty macumazana very pretty said mavovo but as you can aim so well why not have chosen his head that bullet is halfwasted  next i set to work to get into communication with the bearers who thought poor devils that they had been but sold to a new master here i may explain that they were slaves not meant for exportation but men kept to cultivate hassans gardens fortunately i found that two of them belonged to the mazitu people who it may be remembered are of the same blood as the zulus although they separated from the parent stock generations ago these men talked a dialect that i could understand though at first not very easily the foundation of it was zulu but it had become much mixed with the languages of other tribes whose women the mazitu had taken to wife  also there was a man who could speak some bastard arabic sufficiently well for sammy to converse with him  i asked the mazitus if they knew the way back to their country they answered yes but it was far off a full months journey i told them that if they would guide us thither they should receive their freedom and good pay adding that if the other men served us well they also should be set free when we had done with them on receiving this information the poor wretches smiled in a sickly fashion and looked at hassanbenmohammed who glowered at them and us from the box on which he was seated in charge of mavovo  how can we be free while that man lives their look seemed to say as though to confirm their doubts hassan who understood or guessed what was passing asked by what right we were promising freedom to his slaves  by right of that i answered pointing to the union jack which stephen still had in his hand also we will pay you for them when we return according as they have served us  yes he muttered you will pay me for them when you return or perhaps before that englishman  it was three oclock in the afternoon before we were able to make a start there was so much to be arranged that it might have been wiser to wait till the morrow had we not determined that if we could help it nothing would induce us to spend another night in that place blankets were served out to each of the bearers who poor naked creatures seemed quite touched at the gift of them the loads were apportioned having already been packed at durban in cases such as one man could carry the pack saddles were put upon the four donkeys which proved to be none the worse for their journey and burdens to a weight of about 100 lbs each fixed on them in waterproof hide bags besides cooking calabashes and sleeping mats which hans produced from somewhere probably he stole them out of the deserted village but as they were necessary to us i confess i asked no questions lastly six or eight goats which were wandering about were captured to take with us for food till we could find game for these i offered to pay hassan but when i handed him the money he threw it down in a rage so i picked it up and put it in my pocket again with a clear conscience  at length everything was more or less ready and the question arose as to what was to be done with hassan the zulus like hans wished to kill him as sammy explained to him in his best arabic then this murderous fellow showed what a coward he was at heart he flung himself upon his knees he wept he invoked us in the name of the compassionate allah who he explained was after all the same god that we worshipped till mavovo growing impatient of the noise threatened him with his kerry whereon he became silent the easynatured stephen was for letting him go a plan that seemed to have advantages for then at least we should be rid of his abominable company after reflection however i decided that we had better take him along with us at any rate for a day or so to hold as a hostage in case the arabs should follow and attack us at first he refused to stir but the assegai of one of the zulu hunters pressed gently against what remained of his robe furnished an argument that he could not resist  at length we were off i with the two guides went ahead then came the bearers then half of the hunters then the four donkeys in charge of hans and sammy then hassan and the rest of the hunters except mavovo who brought up the rear with stephen needless to say all our rifles were loaded and generally we were prepared for any emergency the only path that which the guides said we must follow ran by the seashore for a few hundred yards and then turned inland through hassans village where he lived for it seemed that the old mission house was not used by him as we marched along a little rocky cliffit was not more than ten feet highwhere a deepwater channel perhaps fifty yards in breadth separated the mainland from the island whence the slaves had been loaded on to the maria some difficulty arose about the donkeys one of these slipped its load and another began to buck and evinced an inclination to leap into the sea with its precious burden the rearguard of hunters ran to get hold of it when suddenly there was a splash  the brutes in i thought to myself till a shout told me that not the ass but hassan had departed over the cliffs edge watching his opportunity and being it was clear a firstrate swimmer he had flung himself backwards in the midst of the confusion and falling into deep water promptly dived about twenty yards from the shore he came up for a moment then dived again heading for the island i dare say i could have potted him through the head with a snap shot but somehow i did not like to kill a man swimming for his life as though he were a hippopotamus or a crocodile moreover the boldness of the manoeuvre appealed to me so i refrained from firing and called to the others to do likewise  as our late host approached the shore of the island i saw arabs running down the rocks to help him out of the water either they had not left the place or had reoccupied it as soon as hms crocodile had vanished with her prize as it was clear that to recapture hassan would involve an attack upon the garrison of the island which we were in no position to carry out i gave orders for the march to be resumed these the difficulty with the donkey having been overcome were obeyed at once  it was fortunate that we did not delay for scarcely had the caravan got into motion when the arabs on the island began to fire at us luckily no one was hit and we were soon round a point and under cover also their shooting was as bad as usual one missile however it was a potleg struck a donkeyload and smashed a bottle of good brandy and a tin of preserved butter this made me angry so motioning to the others to proceed i took shelter behind a tree and waited till a torn and dirty turban which i recognised as that of hassan poked up above a rock well i put a bullet through that turban for i saw the thing fly but unfortunately not through the head beneath it having left this ppc card on our host i bolted from the rock and caught up the others  presently we passed round the village through it i would not go for fear of an ambuscade it was quite a big place enclosed with a strong fence but hidden from the sea by a rise in the intervening land in the centre was a large easternlooking house where doubtless hassan dwelt with his harem after we had gone a little way further to my astonishment i saw flames breaking out from the palmleaf roof of this house at the time i could not imagine how this happened but when a day or two later i observed hans wearing a pair of large and very handsome gold pendants in his ears and a gold bracelet on his wrist and found that he and one of the hunters were extremely well set up in the matter of british sovereignswell i had my doubts in due course the truth came out he and the hunter an adventurous spirit slipped through a gate in the fence without being observed ran across the deserted village to the house stole the ornaments and money from the womens apartments and as they departed fired the place in exchange for the bottle of good brandy as hans explained  i was inclined to be angry but after all as we had been fired on hanss exploit became an act of war rather than a theft so i made him and his companion divide the gold equally with the rest of the hunters who no doubt had kept their eyes conveniently shut not forgetting sammy and said no more they netted £8 apiece which pleased them very much in addition to this i gave £1 each or rather goods to that value to the bearers as their share of the loot  hassan i remarked was evidently a great agriculturist for the gardens which he worked by slave labour were beautiful and must have brought him in a large revenue  passing through these gardens we came to sloping land covered with bush here the track was not too good for the creepers hampered our progress indeed i was very glad when towards sunset we reached the crest of a hill and emerged upon a tableland which was almost clear of trees and rose gradually till it met the horizon in that bush we might easily have been attacked but in this open country i was not so much afraid since the loss to the arabs would have been great before we were overpowered as a matter of fact although spies dogged us for days no assault was ever attempted  finding a convenient place by a stream we camped for the night but as it was so fine did not pitch the tents afterwards i was sorry that we had not gone further from the water since the mosquitoes bred by millions in the marshes bordering the stream gave us a dreadful time on poor stephen fresh from england they fell with peculiar ferocity with the result that in the morning what between the bruises left by hassan and their bites he was a spectacle for men and angels another thing that broke our rest was the necessity of keeping a strict watch in case the slavetraders should elect to attack us in the hours of darkness also to guard against the possibility of our bearers running away and perhaps stealing the goods it is true that before they went to sleep i explained to them very clearly that any of them who attempted to give us the slip would certainly be seen and shot whereas if they remained with us they would be treated with every kindness they answered through the two mazitu that they had nowhere to go and did not wish to fall again into the power of hassan of whom they spoke literally with shudders pointing the while to their scarred backs and the marks of the slave yokes upon their necks their protestations seemed and indeed proved to be sincere but of this of course we could not then be sure  as i was engaged at sunrise in making certain that the donkeys had not strayed and generally that all was well i noted through the thin mist a little white object which at first i thought was a small bird sitting on an upright stick about fifty yards from the camp i went towards it and discovered that it was not a bird but a folded piece of paper stuck in a cleft wand such as natives often use for the carrying of letters i opened the paper and with great difficulty for the writing within was bad portuguese read as follows    english devilsdo not think that you have escaped me i know   where you are going and if you live through the journey it will   be but to die at my hands after all i tell you that i have at my   command three hundred brave men armed with guns who worship allah   and thirst for the blood of christian dogs with these i will   follow and if you fall into my hands alive you shall learn what   it is to die by fire or pinned over antheaps in the sun let us   see if your english manofwar will help you then or your false   god either misfortune go with you whiteskinned robbers of   honest men   this pleasing epistle was unsigned but its anonymous author was not hard to identify i showed it to stephen who was so infuriated at its contents that he managed to dab some ammonia with which he was treating his mosquito bites into his eye when at length the pain was soothed by bathing we concocted this answer    murderer known among men as hassanbenmohammedtruly we sinned   in not hanging you when you were in our power oh wolf who grows   fat upon the blood of the innocent this is a fault that we shall   not commit again your death is near to you and we believe at our   hands come with all your villains whenever you will the more   there are of them the better we shall be pleased who would rather   rid the world of many fiends than of a few                             till we meet again allan quatermain                                                   stephen somers   neat if not christian i said when i had read the letter over  yes replied stephen but perhaps just a little bombastic in tone if that gentleman did arrive with three hundred armed meneh  then my boy i answered in this way or in that we shall thrash him i dont often have an inspiration but ive got one now and it is to the effect that mr hassan has not very long to live and that we shall be intimately connected with his end wait till you have seen a slave caravan and you will understand my feelings also i know these gentry that little prophecy of ours will get upon his nerves and give him a foretaste of things hans go and set this letter in that cleft stick the postman will call for it before long    as it happened within a few days we did see a slave caravan some of the merchandise of the estimable hassan  we had been making good progress through a beautiful and healthy country steering almost due west or rather a little to the north of west the land was undulating and rich wellwatered and only bushclad in the neighbourhood of the streams the higher ground being open of a parklike character and dotted here and there with trees it was evident that once and not very long ago the population had been dense for we came to the remains of many villages or rather towns with large marketplaces now however these were burned with fire or deserted or occupied only by a few old bodies who got a living from the overgrown gardens these poor people who sat desolate and crooning in the sun or perhaps worked feebly at the once fertile fields would fly screaming at our approach for to them men armed with guns must of necessity be slavetraders  still from time to time we contrived to catch some of them and through one member of our party or the other to get at their stories really it was all one story the slaving arabs on this pretext or on that had set tribe against tribe then they sided with the stronger and conquered the weaker by aid of their terrible guns killing out the old folk and taking the young men women and children except the infants whom they butchered to be sold as slaves it seemed that the business had begun about twenty years before when hassanbenmohammed and his companions arrived at kilwa and drove away the missionary who had built a station there  at first this trade was extremely easy and profitable since the raw material lay near at hand in plenty by degrees however the neighbouring communities had been worked out countless numbers of them were killed while the pick of the population passed under the slave yoke and those of them who survived vanished in ships to unknown lands thus it came about that the slavers were obliged to go further afield and even to conduct their raids upon the borders of the territory of the great mazitu people the inland race of zulu origin of whom i have spoken according to our informants it was even rumoured that they proposed shortly to attack these mazitus in force relying on their guns to give them the victory and open to them a new and almost inexhaustible store of splendid human merchandise meanwhile they were cleaning out certain small tribes which hitherto had escaped them owing to the fact that they had their residence in bush or among difficult hills  the track we followed was the recognised slave road of this we soon became aware by the numbers of skeletons which we found lying in the tall grass at its side some of them with heavy slavesticks still upon their wrists these i suppose had died from exhaustion but others as their split skulls showed had been disposed of by their captors  on the eighth day of our march we struck the track of a slave caravan it had been travelling towards the coast but for some reason or other had turned back this may have been because its leaders had been warned of the approach of our party or perhaps they had heard that another caravan which was at work in a different district was drawing near bringing its slaves with it and wished to wait for its arrival in order that they might join forces  the spoor of these people was easy to follow first we found the body of a boy of about ten then vultures revealed to us the remains of two young men one of whom had been shot and the other killed by a blow from an axe their corpses were roughly hidden beneath some grass i know not why a mile or two further on we heard a child wailing and found it by following its cries it was a little girl of about four who had been pretty though now she was but a living skeleton when she saw us she scrambled away on all fours like a monkey stephen followed her while i sick at heart went to get a tin of preserved milk from our stores presently i heard him call to me in a horrified voice rather reluctantly for i knew that he must have found something dreadful i pushed my way through the bush to where he was there bound to the trunk of a tree sat a young woman evidently the mother of the child for it clung to her leg  thank god she was still living though she must have died before another day dawned we cut her loose and the zulu hunters who are kind folk enough when they are not at war carried her to camp in the end with much trouble we saved the lives of that mother and child i sent for the two mazitus with whom i could by now talk fairly well and asked them why the slavers did these things  they shrugged their shoulders and one of them answered with a rather dreadful laugh  because chief these arabs being blackhearted kill those who can walk no more or tie them up to die if they let them go they might recover and escape and it makes the arabs sad that those who have been their slaves should live to be free and happy  does it does it indeed exclaimed stephen with a snort of rage that reminded me of his father well if ever i get a chance ill make them sad with a vengeance  stephen was a tenderhearted young man and for all his soft and indolent ways an awkward customer when roused  within fortyeight hours he got his chance thus that day we camped early for two reasons the first was that the woman and child we had rescued wee so weak they could not walk without rest and we had no men to spare to carry them the second that we came to an ideal spot to pass the night it was as usual a deserted village through which ran a beautiful stream of water here we took possession of some outlying huts with a fence round them and as mavovo had managed to shoot a fat eland cow and her halfgrown calf we prepared to have a regular feast whilst sammy was making some broth for the rescued woman and stephen and i smoked our pipes and watched him hans slipped through the broken gate of the thorn fence or boma and announced that arabs were coming two lots of them with many slaves  we ran out to look and saw that as he had said two caravans were approaching or rather had reached the village but at some distance from us and were now camping on what had once been the marketplace one of these was that whose track we had followed although during the last few hours of our march we had struck away from it chiefly because we could not bear such sights as i have described it seemed to comprise about two hundred and fifty slaves and over forty guards all black men carrying guns and most of them by their dress arabs or bastard arabs in the second caravan which approached from another direction were not more than one hundred slaves and about twenty or thirty captors  now i said let us eat our dinner and then if you like we will go to call upon those gentlemen just to show that we are not afraid of them hans get the flag and tie it to the top of that tree it will show them to what country we belong  up went the union jack duly and presently through our glasses we saw the slavers running about in a state of excitement also we saw the poor slaves turn and stare at the bit of flapping bunting and then begin to talk to each other it struck me as possible that someone among their number had seen a union jack in the hands of an english traveller or had heard of it as flying upon ships or at points on the coast and what it meant to slaves or they may have understood some of the remarks of the arabs which no doubt were pointed and explanatory at any rate they turned and stared till the arabs ran among them with sjambocks that is whips of hippopotamus hide and suppressed their animated conversation with many blows  at first i thought that they would break camp and march away indeed they began to make preparations to do this then abandoned the idea probably because the slaves were exhausted and there was no other water they could reach before nightfall in the end they settled down and lit cooking fires also as i observed they took precautions against attack by stationing sentries and forcing the slaves to construct a boma of thorns about their camp  well said stephen when we had finished our dinner are you ready for that call  no i answered i do not think that i am i have been considering things and concluded that we had better leave well alone by this time those arabs will know all the story of our dealings with their worthy master hassan for no doubt he has sent messengers to them therefore if we go to their camp they may shoot us at sight or if they receive us well they may offer hospitality and poison us or cut our throats suddenly our position might be better still it is one that i believe they would find difficult to take so in my opinion we had better stop still and await developments  stephen grumbled something about my being overcautious but i took no heed of him one thing i did do however sending for hans i told him to take one of the mazitui dared not risk them both for they were our guidesand another of the natives whom we had borrowed from hassan a bold fellow who knew all the local languages and creep down to the slavers camp as soon as it was quite dark there i ordered him to find out what he could and if possible to mix with the slaves and explain that we were their friends hans nodded for this was exactly the kind of task that appealed to him and went off to make his preparations  stephen and i also made some preparations in the way of strengthening our defences building large watchfires and setting sentries  the night fell and hans with his companions departed stealthily as snakes the silence was intense save for the occasional wailings of the slaves which now and again broke out in bursts of melancholy sound lalulalua and then died away to be followed by horrid screams as the arabs laid their lashes upon some poor wretch once too a shot was fired  they have seen hans said stephen  i think not i answered for if so there would have been more than one shot either it was an accident or they were murdering a slave  after this nothing more happened for a long while till at length hans seemed to rise out of the ground in front of me and behind him i saw the figures of the mazitu and the other man  tell your story i said  baas it is this between us we have learned everything the arabs know all about you and what men you have hassan has sent them orders to kill you it is well that you did not go to visit them for certainly you would have been murdered we crept near and overheard their talk they purpose to attack us at dawn tomorrow morning unless we leave this place before which they will know of as we are being watched  and if so what then i asked  then baas they will attack as we are making up the caravan or immediately afterwards as we begin to march  indeed anything more hans  yes baas these two men crept among the slaves and spoke with them they are very sad those slaves and many of them have died of heartpain because they have been taken from their homes and do not know where they are going i saw one die just now a young woman she was talking to another woman and seemed quite well only tired till suddenly she said in a loud voice i am going to die that i may come back as a spirit and bewitch these devils till they are spirits too then she called upon the fetish of her tribe put her hands to her breast and fell down dead at least added hans spitting reflectively she did not fall quite down because the slavestick held her head off the ground the arabs were very angry both because she had cursed them and was dead one of them came and kicked her body and afterwards shot her little boy who was sick because the mother had cursed them but fortunately he did not see us because we were in the dark far from the fire  anything more hans  one thing baas these two men lent the knives you gave them to two of the boldest among the slaves that they might cut the cords of the slavesticks and the other cords with which they were tied and then pass them down the lines that their brothers might do the same but perhaps the arabs will find it out and then the mazitu and the other must lose their knives that is all has the baas a little tobacco  now stephen i said when hans had gone and i had explained everything there are two courses open to us either we can try to give these gentlemen the slip at once in which case we must leave the woman and child to their fate or we can stop where we are and wait to be attacked  i wont run said stephen sullenly it would be cowardly to desert that poor creature also we should have a worse chance marching remember hans said that they are watching us  then you would wait to be attacked  isnt there a third alternative quatermain to attack them  thats the idea i said let us send for mavovo  presently he came and sat down in front of us while i set out the case to him  it is the fashion of my people to attack rather than to be attacked and yet my father in this case my heart is against it hans he called him inblatu a zulu word which means spotted snake that was the hottentots kaffir name says that there are quite sixty of the yellow dogs all armed with guns whereas we have not more than fifteen for we cannot trust the slave men also he says that they are within a strong fence and awake with spies out so that it will be difficult to surprise them but here father we are in a strong fence and cannot be surprised also men who torture and kill women and children except in war must i think be cowards and will come on faintly against good shooting if indeed they come at all therefore i say wait till the buffalo shall either charge or run but the word is with you macumazana wise watcherbynight not with me your hunter speak you who are old in war and i will obey  you argue well i answered also another reason comes to my mind those arab brutes may get behind the slaves of whom we should butcher a lot without hurting them stephen i think we had better see the thing through here  all right quatermain only i hope that mavovo is wrong in thinking that those blackguards may change their minds and run away  really young man you are becoming very bloodthirstyfor an orchid grower i remarked looking at him now for my part i devoutly hope that mavovo is right for let me tell you if he isnt it may be a nasty job  ive always been peaceful enough up to the present replied stephen but the sight of those unhappy wretches of slaves with their heads cut open and of the woman tied to a tree to starve  make you wish to usurp the functions of god almighty i said well it is a natural impulse and perhaps in the circumstances one that will not displease him and now as we have made up our minds what we are going to do lets get to business so that these arab gentlemen may find their breakfast ready when they come to call     chapter vii                          the rush of the slaves  well we did all that we could in the way of making ready after we had strengthened the thorn fence of our boma as much as possible and lit several large fires outside of it to give us light i allotted his place to each of the hunters and saw that their rifles were in order and that they had plenty of ammunition then i made stephen lie down to sleep telling him that i would wake him to watch later on this however i had no intention of doing as i wanted him to rise fresh and with a steady nerve on the occasion of his first fight  as soon as i saw that his eyes were shut i sat down on a box to think to tell the truth i was not altogether happy in my mind to begin with i did not know how the twenty bearers would behave under fire they might be seized with panic and rush about in which case i determined to let them out of the boma to take their chance for panic is a catching thing  a worse matter was our rather awkward position there were a good many trees round the camp among which an attacking force could take cover but what i feared much more than this or even than the reedy banks of the stream along which they could creep out of reach of our bullets was a sloping stretch of land behind us covered with thick grass and scrub and rising to a crest about two hundred yards away now if the arabs got round to this crest they would fire straight into our boma and make it untenable also if the wind were in their favour they might burn us out or attack under the clouds of smoke as a matter of fact by the special mercy of providence none of these things happened for a reason which i will explain presently  in the case of a night or rather a dawn attack i have always found that hour before the sky begins to lighten very trying indeed as a rule everything that can be done is done so that one must sit idle also it is then that both the physical and the moral qualities are at their lowest ebb as is the mercury in the thermometer the night is dying the day is not yet born all nature feels the influence of that hour then bad dreams come then infants wake and call then memories of those who are lost to us arise then the hesitating soul often takes its plunge into the depths of the unknown it is not wonderful therefore that on this occasion the wheels of time drave heavily for me i knew that the morning was at hand by many signs the sleeping bearers turned and muttered in their sleep a distant lion ceased its roaring and departed to its own place an alertminded cock crew somewhere and our donkeys rose and began to pull at their tetherropes as yet however it was quite dark hans crept up to me i saw his wrinkled yellow face in the light of the watchfire  i smell the dawn he said and vanished again  mavovo appeared his massive frame silhouetted against the blackness  watcherbynight the night is done he said if they come at all the enemy should soon be here  saluting he too passed away into the dark and presently i heard the sounds of spearblades striking together and of rifles being cocked  i went to stephen and woke him he sat up yawning muttered something about greenhouses then remembering said  are those arabs coming we are in for a fight at last jolly old fellow isnt it  you are a jolly old fool i answered inconsequently and marched off in a rage  my mind was uneasy about this inexperienced young man if anything should happen to him what should i say to his father well in that event it was probable that something would happen to me too very possibly we should both be dead in an hour certainly i had no intention of allowing myself to be taken alive by those slaving devils hassans remarks about fires and antheaps and the sun were too vividly impressed upon my memory  in another five minutes everybody was up though it required kicks to rouse most of the bearers from their slumbers they poor men were accustomed to the presence of death and did not suffer him to disturb their sleep still i noted that they muttered together and seemed alarmed  if they show signs of treachery you must kill them i said to mavovo who nodded in his grave silent fashion  only we left the rescued slavewoman and her child plunged in the stupor of exhaustion in a corner of the camp what was the use of disturbing her  sammy who seemed far from comfortable brought two pannikins of coffee to stephen and myself  this is a momentous occasion messrs quatermain and somers he said as he gave us the coffee and i noted that his hand shook and his teeth chattered the cold is extreme he went on in his copybook english by way of explaining these physical symptoms which he saw i had observed mr quatermain it is all very well for you to paw the ground and smell the battle from afar as is written in the book of job but i was not brought up to the trade and take it otherwise indeed i wish i was back at the cape yes even within the whitewashed walls of the place of detention  so do i i muttered keeping my right foot on the ground with difficulty  but stephen laughed outright and asked  what will you do sammy when the fighting begins  mr somers he answered i have employed some wakeful hours in making a hole behind that treetrunk through which i hope bullets will not pass there being a man of peace i shall pray for our success  and if the arabs get in sammy  then sir under heaven i shall trust to the fleetness of my legs  i could stand it no longer my right foot flew up and caught sammy in the place at which i had aimed he vanished casting a reproachful look behind him  just then a terrible clamour arose in the slavers camp which hitherto had been very silent and just then also the first light of dawn glinted on the barrels of our guns  look out i cried as i gulped down the last of my coffee theres something going on there  the clamour grew louder and louder till it seemed to fill the skies with a concentrated noise of curses and shrieking distinct from it as it were i heard shouts of alarm and rage and then came the sounds of gunshots yells of agony and the thud of many running feet by now the light was growing fast as it does when once it comes in these latitudes three more minutes and through the grey mist of the dawn we saw dozens of black figures struggling up the slope towards us some seemed to have logs of wood tied behind them others crawled along on all fours others dragged children by the hand and all yelled at the top of their voices  the slaves are attacking us said stephen lifting his rifle  dont shoot i cried i think they have broken loose and are taking refuge with us  i was right these unfortunates had used the two knives which our men smuggled to them to good purpose having cut their bonds during the night they were running to seek the protection of the englishmen and their flag on they surged a hideous mob the slavesticks still fast to the necks of many of them for they had not found time or opportunity to loose them all while behind came the arabs firing the position was clearly very serious for if they burst into our camp we should be overwhelmed by their rush and fall victims to the bullets of their captors  hans i cried take the men who were with you last night and try to lead those slaves round behind us quick quick now before we are stamped flat  hans darted away and presently i saw him and the two other men running towards the approaching crowd hans waving a shirt or some other white object to attract their attention at the time the foremost of them had halted and were screaming mercy english save us english having caught sight of the muzzles of our guns  this was a fortunate occurrence indeed for otherwise hans and his companions could never have stopped them the next thing i saw was the white shirt bearing away to the left on a line which led past the fence of our boma into the scrub and high grass behind the camp after it struggled and scrambled the crowd of slaves like a flock of sheep after the bellwether to them hanss shirt was a kind of white helmet of navarre  so that danger passed by some of the slaves had been struck by the arab bullets or trodden down in the rush or collapsed from weakness and at those of them who still lived the pursuers were firing one woman who had fallen under the weight of the great slavestick which was fastened about her throat was crawling forward on her hands and knees an arab fired at her and the bullet struck the ground under her stomach but without hurting her for she wriggled forward more quickly i was sure that he would shoot again and watched presently for by now the light was good i saw him a tall fellow in a white robe step from behind the shelter of a bananatree about a hundred and fifty yards away and take a careful aim at the woman but i too took aim andwell i am not bad at this kind of snapshooting when i try that arabs gun never went off only he went up two feet or more into the air and fell backwards shot through the head which was the part of his person that i had covered  the hunters uttered a low ow of approval while stephen in a sort of ecstasy exclaimed  oh what a heavenly shot  not bad but i shouldnt have fired it i answered for they havent attacked us yet it is a kind of declaration of war and i added as stephens sunhelmet leapt from his head theres the answer down all of you and fire through the loopholes  then the fight began except for its grand finale it wasnt really much of a fight when compared with one or two we had afterwards on this expedition but on the other hand its character was extremely awkward for us the arabs made one rush at the beginning shouting on allah as they came but though they were plucky villains they did not repeat that experiment either by good luck or good management stephen knocked over two of them with his doublebarrelled rifle and i also emptied my largebore breechloaderthe first i ever ownedamong them not without results while the hunters made a hit or two  after this the arabs took cover getting behind trees and as i had feared hiding in the reeds on the banks of the stream thence they harassed us a great deal for amongst them were some very decent shots indeed had we not taken the precaution of lining the thorn fence with a thick bank of earth and sods we should have fared badly as it was one of the hunters was killed the bullet passing through the loophole and striking him in the throat as he was about to fire while the unfortunate bearers who were on rather higher ground suffered a good deal two of them being dispatched outright and four wounded after this i made the rest of them lie flat on the ground close against the fence in such a fashion that we could fire over their bodies  soon it became evident that there were more of these arabs than we had thought for quite fifty of them were firing from different places moreover by slow degrees they were advancing with the evident object of outflanking us and gaining the high ground behind some of them of course we stopped as they rushed from cover to cover but this kind of shooting was as difficult as that at bolting rabbits across a woodland ride and to be honest i must say that i alone was much good at the game for here my quick eye and long practice told  within an hour the position had grown very serious indeed so much so that we found it necessary to consider what should be done i pointed out that with our small number a charge against the scattered riflemen who were gradually surrounding us would be worse than useless while it was almost hopeless to expect to hold the boma till nightfall once the arabs got behind us they could rake us from the higher ground indeed for the last halfhour we had directed all our efforts to preventing them from passing this boma which fortunately the stream on the one side and a stretch of quite open land on the other made it very difficult for them to do without more loss than they cared to face  i fear there is only one thing for it i said at length during a pause in the attack while the arabs were either taking counsel or waiting for more ammunition to abandon the camp and everything and bolt up the hill as those fellows must be tired and we are all good runners we may save our lives in that way  how about the wounded asked stephen and the slavewoman and child  i dont know i answered looking down  of course i did know very well but here in an acute form arose the ancient question were we to perish for the sake of certain individuals in whom we had no great interest and whom we could not save by remaining with them if we stayed where we were our end seemed fairly certain whereas if we ran for it we had a good chance of escape but this involved the desertion of several injured bearers and a woman and child whom we had picked up starving all of whom would certainly be massacred save perhaps the woman and child  as these reflections flitted through my brain i remembered that a drunken frenchman named leblanc whom i had known in my youth and who had been a friend of napoleon or so he said told me that the great emperor when he was besieging acre in the holy land was forced to retreat being unable to carry off his wounded men he left them in a monastery on mount carmel each with a dose of poison by his side apparently they did not take the poison for according to leblanc who said he was present there not as a wounded man the turks came and butchered them so napoleon chose to save his own life and that of his army at the expense of his wounded but after all i reflected he was no shining example to christian men and i hadnt time to find any poison in a few words i explained the situation to mavovo leaving out the story of napoleon and asked his advice  we must run he answered although i do not like running life is more than stores and he who lives may one day pay his debts  but the wounded mavovo we cannot carry them  i will see to them macumazana it is the fortune of war or if they prefer it we can leave themto be nursed by the arabs which of course was just napoleon and his poison over again  i confess that i was about to assent not wishing that i and stephen especially stephen should be potted in an obscure engagement with some miserable slavetraders when something happened  it will be remembered that shortly after dawn hans using a shirt for a flag had led the fugitive slaves past the camp up to the hill behind there he and they had vanished and from that moment to this we had seen nothing of him or them now of a sudden he reappeared still waving the shirt after him rushed a great mob of naked men two hundred of them perhaps brandishing slavesticks stones and the boughs of trees when they had almost reached the boma whence we watched them amazed they split into two bodies half of them passing to our left apparently under the command of the mazitu who had accompanied hans to the slavecamp and the other half to the right following the old hottentot himself i stared at mavovo for i was too thunderstruck to speak  ah said mavovo that spotted snake of yours he referred to hans is great in his own way for he has even been able to put courage into the hearts of slaves do you not understand my father that they are about to attack those arabs yes and to pull them down as wild dogs do a buffalo calf  it was true this was the hottentots superb design moreover it succeeded up on the hillside he had watched the progress of the fight and seen how it must end then through the interpreter who was with him he harangued those slaves pointing out to them that we their white friends were about to be overwhelmed and that they must either strike for themselves or return to the yoke among them were some who had been warriors in their own tribes and through these he stirred the others they seized the slavesticks from which they had been freed pieces of rock anything that came to their hands and at a given signal charged leaving only the women and children behind them  seeing them come the scattered arabs began to fire at them killing some but thereby revealing their own hidingplaces at these the slaves rushed they hurled themselves upon the arabs they tore them they dashed out their brains in such fashion that within another five minutes quite twothirds of them were dead and the rest of whom we took some toll with our rifles as they bolted from cover were in full flight  it was a terrible vengeance never did i witness a more savage scene than that of these outraged men wreaking their wrongs upon their tormentors i remember that when most of the arabs had been killed and a few were escaped the slaves found one i think it was the captain of the gang who had hidden himself in a little patch of dead reeds washed up by the stream somehow they managed to fire these i expect that hans who had remained discreetly in the background after the fighting began emerged when it was over and gave them a match in due course out came the wretched arab then they flung themselves on him as marching ants do upon a caterpillar and despite his cries for mercy tore him to fragments literally to fragments being what they were it was hard to blame them if we had seen our parents shot our infants pitilessly butchered our homes destroyed and our women and children marched off in the slavesticks to be sold into bondage should we not have done the same i think so although we are not ignorant savages  thus our lives were saved by those whom we had tried to save and for once justice was done even in those dark parts of africa for in that time they were dark indeed had it not been for hans and the courage which he managed to inspire into the hearts of these crushed blacks i have little doubt but that before nightfall we should have been dead for i do not think that any attempt at retreat would have proved successful and if it had what would have happened to us in that wild country surrounded by enemies and with only the few rounds of ammunition that we could have carried in our flight  ah baas said the hottentot a little while later squinting at me with his beadlike eyes after all you did well to listen to my prayer and bring me with you old hans is a drunkard yes or at least he used to be and old hans gambles yes and perhaps old hans will go to hell but meanwhile old hans can think as he thought one day before the attack on maraisfontein as he thought one day on the hill of slaughter by dingaans kraal and as he thought this morning up there among the bushes oh he knew how it must end he saw that those dogs of arabs were cutting down a tree to make a bridge across that deep stream and get round to the high ground at the back of you whence they would have shot you all in five minutes and now baas my stomach feels very queer there was no breakfast on the hillside and the sun was very hot i think that just one tot of brandyoh i know i promised not to drink but if you give it me the sin is yours not mine  well i gave him the tot a stiff one which he drank quite neat although it was against my principles and locked up the bottle afterwards also i shook the old fellows hand and thanked him which seemed to please him very much for he muttered something to the effect that it was nothing since if i had died he would have died too and therefore he was thinking of himself not of me also two big tears trickled down his snub nose but these may have been produced by the brandy  well we were the victors and elated as may be imagined for we knew that the few slavers who had escaped would not attack us again our first thought was for food for it was now past midday and we were starving but dinner presupposed a cook which reminded us of sammy stephen who was in such a state of jubilation that he danced rather than walked the helmet with a bullethole through it stuck ludicrously upon the back of his head started to look for him and presently called to me in an alarmed voice i went to the back of the camp and staring into a hole like a small grave that had been hollowed behind a solitary thorn tree at the bottom of which lay a huddled heap i found him it was sammy to all appearance we got hold of him and up he came limp senseless but still holding in his hand a large thick bible bound in boards moreover in the exact centre of this bible was a bullethole or rather a bullet which had passed through the stout cover and buried itself in the paper behind i remember that the point of it reached to the first book of samuel  as for sammy himself he seemed to be quite uninjured and indeed after we had poured some water on himhe was never fond of waterhe revived quickly enough then we found out what had happened  gentlemen he said i was seated in my place of refuge being as i have told you a man of peace enjoying the consolation of religionhe was very pious in times of trouble at length the firing slackened and i ventured to peep out thinking that perhaps the foe had fled holding the book in front of my face in case of accidents after that i remember no more  no said stephen for the bullet hit the bible and the bible hit your head and knocked you silly  ah said sammy how true is what i was taught that the book shall be a shield of defence to the righteous now i understand why i was moved to bring the thick old bible that belonged to my mother in heaven and not the little thin one given to me by the sunday school teacher through which the ball of the enemy would have passed  then he went off to cook the dinner  certainly it was a wonderful escape though whether this was a direct reward of his piety as he thought is another matter  as soon as we had eaten we set to work to consider our position of which the crux was what to do with the slaves there they sat in groups outside the fence many of them showing traces of the recent conflict and stared at us stupidly then of a sudden as though with one voice they began to clamour for food  how are we to feed several hundred people asked stephen  the slavers must have done it somehow i answered lets go and search their camp  so we went followed by our hungry clients and in addition to many more things to our delight found a great store of rice mealies and other grain some of which was ground into meal of this we served out an ample supply together with salt and soon the cooking pots were full of porridge my word how those poor creatures did eat nor although it was necessary to be careful could we find it in our hearts to stint them of the first full meal that had passed their lips after weeks of starvation when at length they were satisfied we addressed them thanking them for their bravery telling them that they were free and asking what they meant to do  upon this point they seemed to have but one idea they said that they would come with us who were their protectors then followed a great indaba or consultation which really i have not time to set out the end of it was that we agreed that so many of them as wished should accompany us till they reached country that they knew when they would be at liberty to depart to their own homes meanwhile we divided up the blankets and other stores of the arabs such as trade goods and beads among them and then left them to their own devices after placing a guard over the foodstuffs for my part i hoped devoutly that in the morning we should find them gone  after this we returned to our boma just in time to assist at a sad ceremony that of the burial of my hunter who had been shot through the head his companions had dug a deep hole outside the fence and within a few yards of where he fell in this they placed him in a sitting position with his face turned towards zululand setting by his side two gourds that belonged to him one filled with water and the other with grain also they gave him a blanket and his two assegais tearing the blanket and breaking the handles of the spears to kill them as they said then quietly enough they threw in the earth about him and filled the top of the hole with large stones to prevent the hyenas from digging him up this done one by one they walked past the grave each man stopping to bid him farewell by name mavovo who came last made a little speech telling the deceased to namba kachle that is go comfortably to the land of ghosts as he added no doubt he would do who had died as a man should he requested him moreover if he returned as a spirit to bring good and not illfortune on us since otherwise when he mavovo became a spirit in his turn he would have words to say to him on the matter in conclusion he remarked that as his mavovos snake had foretold this event at durban a fact with which the deceased would now be acquainted he the said deceased could never complain of not having received value for the shilling he had paid as a divining fee  yes exclaimed one of the hunters with a note of anxiety in his voice but your snake mentioned six of us to you o doctor  it did replied mavovo drawing a pinch of snuff up his uninjured nostril and our brother there was the first of the six be not afraid the other five will certainly join him in due course for my snake must speak the truth still if anyone is in a hurry and he glared round the little circle let him stop and talk with me alone perhaps i could arrange that his turn here he stopped for they were all gone  glad i didnt pay a shilling to have my fortune told by mavovo said stephen when we were back in the boma but why did they bury his pots and spears with him  to be used by the spirit on its journey i answered although they do not quite know it these zulus believe like all the rest of the world that man lives on elsewhere     chapter viii                             the magic mirror  i did not sleep very well that night for now that the danger was over i found that the long strain of it had told upon my nerves also there were many noises thus the bearers who were shot had been handed over to their companions who disposed of them in a simple fashion namely by throwing them into the bush where they attracted the notice of hyenas then the four wounded men who lay near to me groaned a good deal or when they were not groaning uttered loud prayers to their local gods we had done the best we could for these unlucky fellows indeed that kindhearted little coward sammy who at some time in his career served as a dresser in a hospital had tended their wounds none of which were mortal very well indeed and from time to time rose to minister to them  but what disturbed me most was the fearful hubbub which came from the camp below many of the tropical african tribes are really seminocturnal in their habits i suppose because there the night is cooler than the day and on any great occasion this tendency asserts itself  thus every one of these freed slaves seemed to be howling his loudest to an accompaniment of clashing iron pots or stones which lacking their native drums they beat with sticks  moreover they had lit large fires about which they flitted in an ominous and unpleasant fashion that reminded me of some mediaeval pictures of hell which i had seen in an old book  at last i could stand it no longer and kicking hans who curled up like a dog slept at my feet asked him what was going on his answer caused me to regret the question  plenty of those slaves cannibal men baas think they eat the arabs and like them very much he said with a yawn then went to sleep again  i did not continue the conversation  when at length we made a start on the following morning the sun was high over us indeed there was a great deal to do the guns and ammunition of the dead arabs had to be collected the ivory of which they carried a good store must be buried for to take it with us was impossible and the loads apportioned also it was necessary to make litters for the wounded and to stir up the slaves from their debauch into the nature of which i made no further inquiries was no easy task on mustering them i found that a good number had vanished during the night where to i do not know still a mob of well over two hundred people a considerable portion of whom were women and children remained whose one idea seemed to be to accompany us wherever we might wander so with this miscellaneous following at length we started   to my sorrow we never saw this ivory againaq  to describe our adventures during the next month would be too long if not impossible for to tell the truth after the lapse of so many years these have become somewhat entangled in my mind our great difficulty was to feed such a multitude for the store of rice and grain upon which we were quite unable to keep a strict supervision they soon devoured fortunately the country through which we passed at this time of the year the end of the wet season was full of game of which travelling as we did very slowly we were able to shoot a great deal but this game killing delightful as it may be to the sportsman soon palled on us as a business to say nothing of the expenditure of ammunition it meant incessant work  against this the zulu hunters soon began to murmur for as stephen and i could rarely leave the camp the burden of it fell on them ultimately i hit upon this scheme picking out thirty or forty of the likeliest men among the slaves i served out to each of them ammunition and one of the arab guns in the use of which we drilled them as best we could then i told them that they must provide themselves and their companions with meat of course accidents happened one man was accidentally shot and three others were killed by a cow elephant and a wounded buffalo but in the end they learned to handle their rifles sufficiently well to supply the camp moreover day by day little parties of the slaves disappeared i presume to seek their own homes so that when at last we entered the borders of the mazitu country there were not more than fifty of them left including seventeen of those whom we had taught to shoot  then it was that our real adventures began  one evening after three days march through some difficult bush in which lions carried off a slave woman killed one of the donkeys and mauled another so badly that it had to be shot we found ourselves upon the edge of a great grassy plateau that according to my aneroid was 1640 feet above sea level  what place is this i asked of the two mazitu guides those same men whom we had borrowed from hassan  the land of our people chief they answered which is bordered on one side by the bush and on the other by the great lake where live the pongo wizards  i looked about me at the bare uplands that already were beginning to turn brown on which nothing was visible save vast herds of buck such as were common further south a dreary prospect it was for a slight rain was falling accompanied by mist and a cold wind  i do not see your people or their kraals i said i only see grass and wild game  our people will come they replied rather nervously no doubt even now their spies watch us from among the tall grass or out of some hole  the deuce they do i said or something like it and thought no more of the matter when one is in conditions in which anything may happen such as so far as i am concerned have prevailed through most of my life one grows a little careless as to what will happen for my part i have long been a fatalist to a certain extent i mean i believe that the individual or rather the identity which animates him came out from the source of all life a long while perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago and when his career is finished perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of years hence or perhaps tomorrow will return perfected but still as an individual to dwell in or with that source of life i believe also that his various existences here or elsewhere are foreknown and foreordained although in a sense he may shape them by the action of his free will and that nothing which he can do will lengthen or shorten one of them by a single hour therefore so far as i am concerned i have always acted up to the great injunction of our master and taken no thought for the morrow  however in this instance as in many others of my experience the morrow took plenty of thought for itself indeed before the dawn hans who never seemed really to sleep any more than a dog does woke me up with the ominous information that he heard a sound which he thought was caused by the tramp of hundreds of marching men  where i asked after listening without availto look was useless for the night was dark as pitch  he put his ear to the ground and said  there  i put my ear to the ground but although my senses are fairly acute could hear nothing  then i sent for the sentries but these too could hear nothing after this i gave the business up and went to sleep again  however as it proved hans was quite right in such matters he generally was right for his senses were as keen as those of any wild beast at dawn i was once more awakened this time by mavovo who reported that we were being surrounded by a regiment or regiments i rose and looked out through the mist there sure enough in dim and solemn outline though still far off i perceived rank upon rank of men armed men for the light glimmered faintly upon their spears  what is to be done macumazana asked mavovo  have breakfast i think i answered if we are going to be killed it may as well be after breakfast as before and calling the trembling sammy i instructed him to make the coffee also i awoke stephen and explained the situation to him  capital he answered no doubt these are the mazitu and we have found them much more easily than we expected people generally take such a lot of hunting for in this confounded great country  thats not such a bad way of looking at things i answered but would you be good enough to go round the camp and make it clear that not on any account is anyone to fire without orders stay collect all the guns from those slaves for heaven knows what they will do with them if they are frightened  stephen nodded and sauntered off with three or four of the hunters while he was gone in consultation with mavovo i made certain little arrangements of my own which need not be detailed they were designed to enable us to sell our lives as dearly as possible should things come to the worst one should always try to make an impression upon the enemy in africa for the sake of future travellers if for no other reason  in due course stephen and the hunters returned with the guns or most of them and reported that the slave people were in great state of terror and showed a disposition to bolt  let them bolt i answered they would be of no use to us in a row and might even complicate matters call in the zulus who are watching at once  he nodded and a few minutes later i heardfor the mist which hung about the bush to the east of the camp was still too dense to allow of my seeing anythinga clamour of voices followed by the sound of scuttling feet the slave people including our bearers had gone every one of them they even carried away the wounded just as the soldiers who surrounded us were completing their circle they bolted between the two ends of it and vanished into the bush out of which we had marched on the previous evening often since then i have wondered what became of them doubtless some perished and the rest worked their way back to their homes or found new ones among other tribes the experiences of those who escaped must be interesting to them if they still live i can well imagine the legends in which these will be embodied two or three generations hence  deducting the slave people and the bearers whom we had wrung out of hassan we were now a party of seventeen namely eleven zulu hunters including mavovo two white men hans and sammy and the two mazitus who had elected to remain with us while round us was a great circle of savages which closed in slowly  as the light grewit was long in coming on that dull morningand the mist lifted i examined these people without seeming to take any particular notice of them they were tall much taller than the average zulu and slighter in their build also lighter in colour like the zulus they carried large hide shields and one very broadbladed spear throwing assegais seemed to be wanting but in place of them i saw that they were armed with short bows which together with a quiver of arrows were slung upon their backs the officers wore a short skin cloak or kaross and the men also had cloaks which i found out afterwards were made from the inner bark of trees  they advanced in the most perfect silence and very slowly nobody said anything and if orders were given this must have been done by signs i could not see that any of them had firearms  now i said to stephen perhaps if we shot and killed some of those fellows they might be frightened and run away or they might not or if they did they might return  whatever happened he remarked sagely we should scarcely be welcome in their country afterwards so i think we had better do nothing unless we are obliged  i nodded for it was obvious that we could not fight hundreds of men and told sammy who was perfectly livid with fear to bring the breakfast no wonder he was afraid poor fellow for we were in great danger these mazitu had a bad name and if they chose to attack us we should all be dead in a few minutes  the coffee and some cold bucks flesh were put upon our little camptable in front of the tent which we had pitched because of the rain and we began to eat the zulu hunters also ate from a bowl of mealie porridge which they had cooked on the previous night each of them with his loaded rifle upon his knees our proceedings appeared to puzzle the mazitu very much indeed they drew quite near to us to within about forty yards and halted there in a dead circle staring at us with their great round eyes it was like a scene in a dream i shall never forget it  everything about us appeared to astonish them our indifference the colour of stephen and myself as a matter of fact at that date brother john was the only white man they had ever seen our tent and our two remaining donkeys indeed when one of these beasts broke into a bray they showed signs of fright looking at each other and even retreating a few paces  at length the position got upon my nerves especially as i saw that some of them were beginning to fiddle with their bows and that their general a tall oneeyed old fellow was making up his mind to do something i called to one of the two mazitus whom i forgot to say we had named tom and jerry and gave him a pannikin of coffee  take that to the captain there with my good wishes jerry and ask him if he will drink with us i said  jerry who was a plucky fellow obeyed advancing with the steaming coffee he held it under the captains nose evidently he knew the mans name for i heard him say  o babemba the white lords macumazana and wazela ask if you will share their holy drink with them  i could perfectly understand the words for these people spoke a dialect so akin to zulu that by now it had no difficulty for me  their holy drink exclaimed the old fellow starting back man it is hot redwater would these white wizards poison me with mwavi  here i should explain that mwavi or mkasa as it is sometimes called is the liquor distilled from the inner bark of a sort of mimosa tree or sometimes from a root of the strychnos tribe which is administered by the witchdoctors to persons accused of crime if it makes them sick they are declared innocent if they are thrown into convulsions or stupor they are clearly guilty and die either from the effects of the poison or afterwards by other means  this is no mwavi o babemba said jerry it is the divine liquor that makes the white lords shoot straight with their wonderful guns which kill at a thousand paces see i will swallow some of it and he did though it must have burnt his tongue  thus encouraged old babemba sniffed at the coffee and found it fragrant then he called a man who from his peculiar dress i took to be a doctor made him drink some and watched the results which were that the doctor tried to finish the pannikin snatching it away indignantly babemba drank himself and as i had halffilled the cup with sugar found the mixture good  it is indeed a holy drink he said smacking his lips have you any more of it  the white lords have more said jerry they invite you to eat with them  babemba stuck his finger into the tin and covering it with the sediment of sugar sucked and reflected  its all right i whispered to stephen i dont think hell kill us after drinking our coffee and whats more i believe he is coming to breakfast  this may be a snare said babemba who now began to lick the sugar out of the pannikin  no answered jerry with creditable resource though they could easily kill you all the white lords do not hurt those who have partaken of their holy drink that is unless anyone tries to harm them  cannot you bring some more of the holy drink here he asked giving a final polish to the pannikin with his tongue  no said jerry if you want it you must go there fear nothing would i one of your own people betray you  true exclaimed babemba by your talk and your face you are a mazitu how came youwell we will speak of that afterwards i am very thirsty i will come soldiers sit down and watch and if any harm happens to me avenge it and report to the king  now while all this was going on i had made hans and sammy open one of the boxes and extract therefrom a goodsized mirror in a wooden frame with a support at the back so that it could be stood anywhere fortunately it was unbroken indeed our packing had been so careful that none of the lookingglasses or other fragile things were injured to this mirror i gave a hasty polish then set it upright upon the table  old babemba came along rather suspiciously his one eye rolling over us and everything that belonged to us when he was quite close it fell upon the mirror he stopped he stared he retreated then drawn by his overmastering curiosity came on again and again stood still  what is the matter called his second in command from the ranks  the matter is he answered that here is great magic here i see myself walking towards myself there can be no mistake for one eye is gone in my other self  advance o babemba cried the doctor who had tried to drink all the coffee and see what happens keep your spear ready and if your witchself attempts to harm you kill it  thus encouraged babemba lifted his spear and dropped it again in a great hurry  that wont do fool of a doctor he shouted back my other self lifts a spear also and what is more all of you who should be behind are in front of me the holy drink has made me drunk i am bewitched save me  now i saw that the joke had gone too far for the soldiers were beginning to string their bows in confusion luckily at this moment the sun at length came out almost opposite to us  o babemba i said in a solemn voice it is true that this magic shield which we have brought as a gift to you gives you another self henceforth your labours will be halved and your pleasures doubled for when you look into this shield you will be not one but two also it has other propertiessee and lifting the mirror i used it as a heliograph flashing the reflected sunlight into the eyes of the long halfcircle of men in front of us my word didnt they run  wonderful exclaimed old babemba and can i learn to do that also white lord  certainly i answered come and try now hold it so while i say the spell and i muttered some hocuspocus then directed it towards certain of the mazitu who were gathering again there look look you have hit them in the eye you are a master of magic they run they run and run they did indeed is there anyone yonder whom you dislike  yes plenty answered babemba with emphasis especially that witchdoctor who drank nearly all the holy drink  very well byandby i will show you how you can burn a hole in him with this magic no not now not now for a while this mocker of the sun is dead look and dipping the glass beneath the table i produced it back first you cannot see anything can you  nothing except wood replied babemba staring at the deal slip with which it was lined  then i threw a dishcloth over it and to change the subject offered him another pannikin of the holy drink and a stool to sit on  the old fellow perched himself very gingerly upon the stool which was of the folding variety stuck the irontipped end of his great spear in the ground between his knees and took hold of the pannikin or rather he took hold of a pannikin and not the right one so ridiculous was his appearance that the lightminded stephen who forgetting the perils of the situation had for the last minute or two been struggling with inward laughter clapped down his coffee on the table and retired into the tent where i heard him gurgling in unseemly merriment it was this coffee that in the confusion of the moment sammy gave to old babemba presently stephen reappeared and to cover his confusion seized the pannikin meant for babemba and drank it or most of it then sammy seeing his mistake said  mr somers i regret that there is an error you are drinking from the cup which that stinking savage has just licked clean  the effect was dreadful and instantaneous for then and there stephen was violently sick  why does the white lord do that asked babemba now i see that you are truly deceiving me and that what you are giving me to swallow is nothing but hot mwavi which in the innocent causes vomiting but that in those who mean evil death  stop that foolery you idiot i muttered to stephen kicking him on the shins or youll get our throats cut then collecting myself with an effort i said  oh not at all general this white lord is the priest of the holy drink andwhat you see is a religious rite  is it so said babemba then i hope that the rite is not catching  never i replied proffering him a biscuit and now general babemba tell me why do you come against us with about five hundred armed men  to kill you white lordsoh how hot is this holy drink yet pleasant you said that it was not catching did you not for i feel  eat the cake i answered and why do you wish to kill us be so good as to tell me the truth now or i shall read it in the magic shield which portrays the inside as well as the out and lifting the cloth i stared at the glass  if you can read my thoughts white lord why trouble me to tell them asked babemba sensibly enough his mouth full of biscuit still as that bright thing may lie i will set them out bausi king of our people has sent me to kill you because news has reached him that you are great slave dealers who come hither with guns to capture the mazitus and take them away to the black water to be sold and sent across it in big canoes that move of themselves of this he has been warned by messengers from the arab men moreover we know that it is true for last night you had with you many slaves who seeing our spears ran away not an hour ago  now i stared hard at the lookingglass and answered coolly  this magic shield tells a somewhat different story it says that your king bausi for whom by the way we have many things as presents told you to lead us to him with honour that we might talk over matters with him  the shot was a good one babemba grew confused  it is true he stammered thati mean the king left it to my judgment i will consult the witchdoctor  if he left it to your judgment the matter is settled i said since certainly being so great a noble you would never try to murder those of whose holy drink you have just partaken indeed if you did so i added in a cold voice you would not live long yourself one secret word and that drink will turn to mwavi of the worst sort inside of you  oh yes white lord it is settled exclaimed babemba it is settled do not trouble the secret word i will lead you to the king and you shall talk with him by my head and my fathers spirit you are safe from me still with your leave i will call the great doctor imbozwi and ratify the agreement in his presence and also show him the magic shield  so imbozwi was sent for jerry taking the message presently he arrived he was a villainouslooking person of uncertain age humpbacked like the picture of punch wizened and squinteyed his costume was of the ordinary witchdoctor type being set off with snake skins fish bladders baboons teeth and little bags of medicine to add to his charms a broad strip of pigment red ochre probably ran down his forehead and the nose beneath across the lips and chin ending in a red mark the size of a penny where the throat joins the chest his woolly hair also in which was twisted a small ring of black gum was soaked with grease and powdered blue it was arranged in a kind of horn coming to a sharp point about five inches above the top of the skull altogether he looked extremely like the devil what was more he was a devil in a bad temper for the first words he said embodied a reproach to us for not having asked him to partake of our holy drink with babemba  we offered to make him some more but he refused saying that we should poison him  then babemba set the matter out rather nervously i thought for evidently he was afraid of this old wizard who listened in complete silence when babemba explained that without the kings direct order it would be foolish and unjustifiable to put to death such magicians as we were imbozwi spoke for the first time asking why he called us magicians  babemba instanced the wonders of the shining shield that showed pictures  pooh said imbozwi does not calm water or polished iron show pictures  but this shield will make fire said babemba the white lords say it can burn a man up  then let it burn me up replied imbozwi with ineffable contempt and i will believe that these white men are magicians worthy to be kept alive and not common slavetraders such as we have often heard of  burn him white lords and show him that i am right exclaimed the exasperated babemba after which they fell to wrangling evidently they were rivals and by this time both of them had lost their tempers  the sun was now very hot quite sufficiently so to enable us to give mr imbozwi a taste of our magic which i determined he should have not being certain whether an ordinary mirror would really reflect enough heat to scorch i drew from my pocket a very powerful burningglass which i sometimes used for the lighting of fires in order to save matches and holding the mirror in one hand and the burningglass in the other i worked myself into a suitable position for the experiment babemba and the witchdoctor were arguing so fiercely that neither of them seemed to notice what i was doing getting the focus right i directed the concentrated spark straight on to imbozwis greased topknot where i knew he would feel nothing my plan being to char a hole in it but as it happened this topknot was built up round something of a highly inflammable nature reed or camphorwood i expect at any rate about thirty seconds later the topknot was burning like a beautiful torch  ow said the kaffirs who were watching my aunt exclaimed stephen look look shouted babemba in tones of delight now will you believe o blownout bladder of a man that there are greater magicians than yourself in the world  what is the matter son of a dog that you make a mock of me screeched the unfuriated imbozwi who alone was unaware of anything unusual  as he spoke some suspicion rose in his mind which caused him to put his hand to his topknot and withdraw it with a howl then he sprang up and began to dance about which of course only fanned the fire that had now got hold of the grease and gum the zulus applauded babemba clapped his hands stephen burst into one of his idiotic fits of laughter for my part i grew frightened near at hand stood a large wooden pot such as the kaffirs make from which the coffee kettle had been filled that fortunately was still halffull of water i seized it and ran to him  save me white lord he howled you are the greatest of magicians and i am your slave  here i cut him short by clapping the pot bottom upwards on his burning head into which it vanished as a candle does into an extinguisher smoke and a bad smell issued from beneath the pot the water from which ran all over imbozwi who stood quite still when i was sure the fire was out i lifted the pot and revealed the discomfited wizard but without his elaborate headdress beyond a little scorching he was not in the least hurt for i had acted in time only he was bald for when touched the charred hair fell off at the roots  it is gone he said in an amazed voice after feeling at his scalp  yes i answered quite the magic shield worked very well did it not  can you put it back again white lord he asked  that will depend upon how you behave i replied  then without another word he turned and walked back to the soldiers who received him with shouts of laughter evidently imbozwi was not a popular character and his discomfiture delighted them  babemba also was delighted indeed he could not praise our magic enough and at once began to make arrangements to escort us to the king at his head town which was called beza vowing that we need fear no harm at his hands or those of his soldiers in fact the only person who did not appreciate our black arts was imbozwi himself i caught a look in his eye as he marched off which told me that he hated us bitterly and reflected to myself that perhaps i had been foolish to use that burningglass although in truth i had not intended to set his head on fire  my father said mavovo to me afterwards it would have been better to let that snake burn to death for then you would have killed his poison i am something of a doctor myself and i tell you there is nothing our brotherhood hates so much as being laughed at you have made a fool of him before all his people and he will not forget it macumazana     chapter ix                              bausi the king  about midday we made a start for beza town where king bausi lived which we understood we ought to reach on the following evening for some hours the regiment marched in front or rather round us but as we complained to babemba of the noise and dust with a confidence that was quite touching he sent it on ahead first however he asked us to pass our word by our mothers which was the most sacred of oaths among many african peoples that we would not attempt to escape i confess that i hesitated before giving an answer not being entirely enamoured of the mazitu and of our prospects among them especially as i had discovered through jerry that the discomfited imbozwi had departed from the soldiers on some business of his own had the matter been left to me indeed i should have tried to slip back into the bush over the border and there put in a few months shooting during the dry season while working my way southwards this too was the wish of the zulu hunters of hans and i need not add of sammy but when i mentioned the matter to stephen he implored me to abandon the idea  look here quatermain he said i have come to this godforsaken country to get that great cypripedium and get it i will or die in the attempt still he added after surveying our rather blank faces i have no right to play with your lives so if you think the thing too dangerous i will go on alone with this old boy babemba putting everything else aside i think that one of us ought to visit bausis kraal in case the gentleman who you call brother john should turn up there in short i have made up my mind so it is no use talking  i lit my pipe and for quite a time contemplated this obstinate young man while considering the matter from every point of view finally i came to the conclusion that he was right and i was wrong it was true that by bribing babemba or otherwise there was still an excellent prospect of effecting a masterly retreat and of avoiding many perils on the other hand we had not come to this wild place in order to retreat further at whose expense had we come here at that of stephen somers who wished to proceed lastly to say nothing of the chance of meeting brother john to whom i felt no obligation since he had given us the slip at durban i did not like the idea of being beaten we had started out to visit some mysterious savages who worshipped a monkey and a flower and we might as well go on till circumstances were too much for us after all dangers are everywhere those who turn back because of dangers will never succeed in any life that we can imagine  mavovo i said presently pointing to stephen with my pipe the inkoosi wazela does not wish to try to escape he wishes to go on to the country of the pongo people if we can get there and mavovo remember that he has paid for everything we are his hired servants also that he says that if we run back he will walk forward alone with these mazitus still if any of you hunters desire to slip off he will not look your way nor shall i what say you  i say macumazana that though young wazela is a chief with a great heart and that where you and he go i shall go also as i think will the rest of us i do not like these mazitu for if their fathers were zulus their mothers were low people they are bastards and of the pongo i hear nothing but what is evil still no good ox ever turns in the yoke because of a mudhole let us go on for if we sink in the swamp what does it matter moreover my snake tells me that we shall not sink at least not all of us  so it was arranged that no effort should be made to return sammy it is true wished to do so but when it came to the point and he was offered one of the remaining donkeys and as much food and ammunition as he could carry he changed his mind  i think it better mr quatermain he said to meet my end in the company of highborn lofty souls than to pursue a lonely career towards the inevitable in unknown circumstances  very well put sammy i answered so while waiting for the inevitable please go and cook the dinner  having laid aside our doubts we proceeded on the journey comfortably enough being well provided with bearers to take the place of those who had run away babemba accompanied by a single orderly travelled with us and from him we collected much information it seemed that the mazitu were a large people who could muster from five to seven thousand spears their tradition was that they came from the south and were of the same stock as the zulus of whom they had heard vaguely indeed many of their customs to say nothing of their language resembled those of that country their military organisation however was not so thorough and in other ways they struck me as a lower race in one particular it is true that of their houses they were more advanced for these as we saw in the many kraals that we passed were better built with doorways through which one could walk upright instead of the kaffir beeholes  we slept in one of these houses on our march and should have found it very comfortable had it not been for the innumerable fleas which at length drove us out into the courtyard for the rest these mazitu much resembled the zulus they had kraals and were breeders of cattle they were ruled by headmen under the command of a supreme chief or king they believed in witchcraft and offered sacrifice to the spirits of their ancestors also in some kind of a vague and mighty god who dominated the affairs of the world and declared his will through the doctors lastly they were and i dare say still are a race of fighting men who loved war and raided the neighbouring peoples upon any and every pretext killing their men and stealing their women and cattle they had their virtues too being kindly and hospitable by nature though cruel enough to their enemies moreover they detested dealing in slaves and those who practised it saying that it was better to kill a man than to deprive him of his freedom also they had a horror of the cannibalism which is so common in the dark regions of africa and for this reason more than any other loathed the pongo folk who were supposed to be eaters of men  on the evening of the second day of our march during which we had passed through a beautiful and fertile upland country very well watered and except in the valleys free from bush we arrived at beza this town was situated on a wide plain surrounded by low hills and encircled by a belt of cultivated land made beautiful by the crops of maize and other cereals which were then ripe to harvest it was fortified in a way that is a tall unclimbable palisade of timber surrounded the entire town which fence was strengthened by prickly pears and cacti planted on its either side  within this palisade the town was divided into quarters more or less devoted to various trades thus one part of it was called the ironsmiths quarter another the soldiers quarter another the quarter of the landtillers another that of the skindressers and so on the kings dwelling and those of his women and dependents were near the north gate and in front of these surrounded by semicircles of huts was a wide space into which cattle could be driven if necessary this however at the time of our visit was used as a market and a drilling ground  we entered the town that must in all have contained a great number of inhabitants by the south gate a strong log structure facing a wooded slope through which ran a road just as the sun was setting we marched to the guesthuts up a central street lined with the population of the place who had gathered to stare at us these huts were situated in the soldiers quarter not far from the kings house and surrounded by an inner fence to keep them private  none of the people spoke as we passed them for the mazitu are polite by nature also it seemed to me that they regarded us with awe tempered by curiosity they only stared and occasionally those of them who were soldiers saluted us by lifting their spears the huts into which we were introduced by babemba with whom we had grown very friendly were good and clean  here all our belongings including the guns which we had collected just before the slaves ran away were placed in one of the huts over which a mazitu mounted guard the donkeys being tied to the fence at a little distance outside this fence stood another armed mazitu also on guard  are we prisoners here i asked of babemba  the king watches over his guests he answered enigmatically have the white lords any message for the king whom i am summoned to see this night  yes i answered tell the king that we are the brethren of him who more than a year ago cut a swelling from his body whom we have arranged to meet here i mean the white lord with a long beard who among you black people is called dogeetah  babemba started you are the brethren of dogeetah how comes it then that you never mentioned his name before and when is he going to meet you here know that dogeetah is a great man among us for with him alone of all men the king has made bloodbrotherhood as the king is so is dogeetah among the mazitu  we never mentioned him because we do not talk about everything at once babemba as to when dogeetah will meet us i am not sure i am only sure that he is coming  yes lord macumazana but when when that is what the king will want to know and that is what you must tell him lord he added dropping his voice you are in danger here where you have many enemies since it is not lawful for white men to enter this land if you would save your lives be advised by me and be ready to tell the king tomorrow when dogeetah whom he loves will appear here to vouch for you and see that he does appear very soon and by the day you name since otherwise when he comes if come he does he may not find you able to talk to him now i your friend have spoken and the rest is with you  then without another word he rose slipped through the door of the hut and out by the gateway of the fence from which the sentry moved aside to let him pass i too rose from the stool on which i sat and danced about the hut in a perfect fury  do you understand what that infernal i am afraid i used a stronger word old fool told me i exclaimed to stephen he says that we must be prepared to state exactly when that other infernal old fool brother john will turn up at beza town and that if we dont we shall have our throats cut as indeed has already been arranged  rather awkward replied stephen there are no express trains to beza and if there were we couldnt be sure that brother john would take one of them i suppose there is a brother john he added reflectively to me he seems to beintimately connected with mrs harris  oh there is or there was i explained why couldnt the confounded ass wait quietly for us at durban instead of fooling off butterfly hunting to the north of zululand and breaking his leg or his neck there if he has done anything of the sort  dont know i am sure its hard enough to understand ones own motives let alone brother johns  then we sat down on our stools again and stared at each other at this moment hans crept into the hut and squatted down in front of us he might have walked in as there was a doorway but he preferred to creep on his hands and knees i dont know why  what is it you ugly little toad i asked viciously for that was just what he looked like even the skin under his jaw moved like a toads  the baas is in trouble remarked hans  i should think he was i answered and so will you be presently when you are wriggling on the point of a mazitu spear  they are broad spears that would make a big hole remarked hans again whereupon i rose to kick him out for his ideas were as usual unpleasant  baas he went on i have been listeningthere is a very good hole in this hut for listening if one lies against the wall and pretends to be asleep i have heard all and understood most of your talk with that oneeyed savage and the baas stephen  well you little sneak what of it  only baas that if we do not want to be killed in this place from which there is no escape it is necessary that you should find out exactly on what day and at what hour dogeetah is going to arrive  look here you yellow idiot i exclaimed if you are beginning that game too ill then i stopped reflecting that my temper was getting the better of me and that i had better hear what hans had to say before i vented it on him  baas mavovo is a great doctor it is said that his snake is the straightest and the strongest in all zululand save that of his master zikali the old slave he told you that dogeetah was laid up somewhere with a hurt leg and that he was coming to meet you here no doubt therefore he can tell you also when he is coming i would ask him but he wont set his snake to work for me so you must ask him baas and perhaps he will forget that you laughed at his magic and that he swore you would never see it again  oh blind one i answered how do i know that mavovos story about dogeetah was not all nonsense  hans stared at me amazed  mavovos story nonsense mavovos snake a liar oh baas that is what comes of being too much a christian now thanks to your father the predikant i am a christian too but not so much that i have forgotten how to know good magic from bad mavovos snake a liar and after he whom we buried yonder was the first of the hunters whom the feathers named to him at durban and he began to chuckle in intense amusement then added well baas there it is you must either ask mavovo and very nicely or we shall all be killed i dont mind much for i should rather like to begin again a little younger somewhere else but just think what a noise sammy will make and turning he crept out as he had crept in  heres a nice position i groaned to stephen when he had gone i a white man who in spite of some coincidences with which i am acquainted know that all this kaffir magic is bosh am to beg a savage to tell me something of which he must be ignorant that is unless we educated people have got hold of the wrong end of the stick altogether it is humiliating it isnt christian and im hanged if ill do it  i dare say you will behanged i meanwhether you do it or whether you dont replied stephen with his sweet smile but i say old fellow how do you know it is all bosh we are told about lots of miracles which werent bosh and if miracles ever existed why cant they exist now but there i know what you mean and it is no use arguing still if youre proud i aint ill try to soften the stony heart of mavovowe are rather pals you knowand get him to unroll the book of his occult wisdom and he went  a few minutes later i was called out to receive a sheep which with milk native beer some corn and other things including green forage for the donkeys bausi had sent for us to eat here i may remark that while we were among the mazitu we lived like fighting cocks there was none of that starvation which is or was so common in east africa where the traveller often cannot get food for love or moneygenerally because there is none  when this business was settled by my sending a message of thanks to the king with an intimation that we hoped to wait upon him on the morrow with a few presents i went to seek sammy in order to tell him to kill and cook the sheep after some search i found or rather heard him beyond a reed fence which divided two of the huts he was acting as interpreter between stephen somers and mavovo  this zulu man declares mr somers he said that he quite understands everything you have been explaining and that it is probable that we shall all be butchered by this savage bausi if we cannot tell him when the white man dogeetah whom he loves will arrive here he says also that he thinks that by his magic he could learn when this will happenif it is to happen at allwhich of course mr somers for your private information only is a mighty lie of the ignorant heathen he adds however that he does not care one brass farthinghis actual expression mr somers is one grain of corn on a mealiecobabout his or anybody elses life which from all i have heard of his proceedings i can well believe to be true he says in his vulgar language that there is no difference between the belly of a mazituland hyena and that of any other hyena and that the earth of mazituland is as welcome to his bones as any other earth since the earth is the wickedest of all hyenas in that he has observed that soon or late it devours everlastingly everything which once it bore you must forgive me for reproducing his empty and childish talk mr somers but you bade me to render the words of this savage with exactitude in fact mr somers this reckless person intimates in short that some power with which he is not acquaintedhe calls it the strength that makes the sun to shine and broiders the blanket of the night with stars forgive me for repeating his silly words caused him to be born into this world and at an hour already appointed will draw him from this world back into its dark eternal bosom there to be rocked in sleep or nursed to life again according to its unknown willi translate exactly mr somers although i do not know what it all meansand that he does not care a curse when this happens still he says that whereas he is growing old and has known many sorrowshe alludes here i gather to some nigger wives of his whom another savage knocked on the head also to a child to whom he appears to have been attachedyou are young with all your days and he hopes joys before you therefore he would gladly do anything in his power to save your life because although you are white and he is black he has conceived an affection for you and looks on you as his child yes mr somers although i blush to repeat it this black fellow says he looks upon you as his child he adds indeed that if the opportunity arises he will gladly give his life to save your life and that it cuts his heart in two to refuse you anything still he must refuse this request of yours that he will ask the creature he calls his snakewhat he means by that i dont know mr somersto declare when the white man named dogeetah will arrive in this place for this reason that he told mr quatermain when he laughed at him about his divinations that he would make no more magic for him or any of you and that he will die rather than break his word thats all mr somers and i dare say you will thinkquite enough too  i understand replied stephen tell the chief mavovo i observed he laid an emphasis on the word chief that i quite understand and that i thank him very much for explaining things to me so fully then ask him whether as the matter is so important there is no way out of this trouble  sammy translated into zulu which he spoke perfectly as i noted without interpolations or additions  only one way answered mavovo in the intervals of taking snuff it is that macumazana himself shall ask me to do this thing macumazana is my old chief and friend and for his sake i will forget what in the case of others i should always remember if he will come and ask me without mockery to exercise my skill on behalf of all of us i will try to exercise it although i know very well that he believes it to be but as an idle little whirlwind that stirs the dust that raises the dust and lets it fall again without purpose or meaning forgetting as the wise white men forget that even the wind which blows the dust is the same that breathes in our nostrils and that to it we also are as is the dust  now i the listener thought for a moment or two the words of this fighting savage mavovo even those of them of which i had heard only the translation garbled and beslavered by the mean comments of the unutterable sammy stirred my imagination who was i that i should dare to judge of him and his wild unknown gifts who was i that i should mock at him and by my mockery intimate that i believed him to be a fraud  stepping through the gateway of the fence i confronted him  mavovo i said i have overheard your talk i am sorry if i laughed at you in durban i do not understand what you call your magic it is beyond me and may be true or may be false still i shall be grateful to you if you will use your power to discover if you can whether dogeetah is coming here and if so when now do as it may please you i have spoken  and i have heard macumazana my father tonight i will call upon my snake whether it will answer or what it will answer i cannot say  well he did call upon his snake with due and portentous ceremony and according to stephen who was present which i declined to be that mystic reptile declared that dogeetah alias brother john would arrive in beza town precisely at sunset on the third day from that night now as he had divined on friday according to our almanac this meant that we might hope to see himhope exactly described my state of mind on the matteron the monday evening in time for supper  all right i said briefly please do not talk to me any more about this impious rubbish for i want to go to sleep  next morning early we unpacked our boxes and made a handsome selection of gifts for the king bausi hoping thus to soften his royal heart it included a bale of calico several knives a musical box a cheap american revolver and a bundle of toothpicks also several pounds of the best and most fashionable beads for his wives this truly noble present we sent to the king by our two mazitu servants tom and jerry who were marched off in the charge of several sentries for i hoped that these men would talk to their compatriots and tell them what good fellows we were indeed i instructed them to do so  imagine our horror therefore when about an hour later just as we were tidying ourselves up after breakfast there appeared through the gate not tom and jerry for they had vanished but a long line of mazitu soldiers each of whom carried one of the articles that we had sent indeed the last of them held the bundle of toothpicks on his fuzzy head as though it were a huge faggot of wood one by one they set them down upon the lime flooring of the verandah of the largest hut then their captain said solemnly  bausi the great black one has no need of the white mens gifts  indeed i replied for my dander was up then he wont get another chance at them  the men turned away without more words and presently babemba turned up with a company of about fifty soldiers  the king is waiting to see you white lords he said in a voice of very forced jollity and i have come to conduct you to him  why would he not accept our presents i asked pointing to the row of them  oh that is because of imbozwis story of the magic shield he said he wanted no gifts to burn his hair off but come come he will explain for himself if the elephant is kept waiting he grows angry and trumpets  does he i said and how many of us are to come  all all white lord he wishes to see every one of you  not me i suppose said sammy who was standing close by i must stop to make ready the food  yes you too replied babemba the king would look on the mixer of the holy drink  well there was no way out of it so off we marched all well armed as i need not say and were instantly surrounded by the soldiers to give an unusual note to the proceedings i made hans walk first carrying on his head the rejected musical box from which flowed the touching melody of home sweet home then came stephen bearing the union jack on a pole then i in the midst of the hunters and accompanied by babemba then the reluctant sammy and last of all the two donkeys led by mazitus for it seemed that the king had especially ordered that these should be brought also  it was a truly striking cavalcade the sight of which under any other circumstances would have made me laugh nor did it fail in its effect for even the silent mazitu people through whom we wended our way were moved to something like enthusiasm home sweet home they evidently thought heavenly though perhaps the two donkeys attracted them most especially when these brayed  where are tom and jerry i asked of babemba  i dont know he answered i think they have been given leave to go to see their friends  imbozwi is suppressing evidence in our favour i thought to myself and said no more  presently we reached the gate of the royal enclosure here to my dismay the soldiers insisted on disarming us taking away our rifles our revolvers and even our sheath knives in vain did i remonstrate saying that we were not accustomed to part with these weapons the answer was that it was not lawful for any man to appear before the king armed even with so much as a dancingstick mavovo and the zulus showed signs of resisting and for a minute i thought there was going to be a row which of course would have ended in our massacre for although the mazitus feared guns very much what could we have done against hundreds of them i ordered him to give way but for once he was on the point of disobeying me then by a happy thought i reminded him that according to his snake dogeetah was coming and that therefore all would be well so he submitted with an ill grace and we saw our precious guns borne off we knew not where  then the mazitu soldiers piled their spears and bows at the gate of the kraal and we proceeded with only the union jack and the musical box which was now discoursing britannia rules the waves  across the open space we marched to where several broadleaved trees grew in front of a large native house not far from the door of this house a fat middleaged and angrylooking man was seated on a stool naked except for a moocha of catskins about his loins and a string of large blue beads round his neck  bausi the king whispered babemba  at his side squatted a little hunchbacked figure in whom i had no difficulty in recognising imbozwi although he had painted his scorched scalp white with vermillion spots and adorned his snub nose with a purple tip his dress of ceremony i presume round and behind there were a number of silent councillors at some signal or on reaching a given spot all the soldiers including old babemba fell upon their hands and knees and began to crawl they wanted us to do the same but here i drew the line feeling that if once we crawled we must always crawl  so at my word we advanced upright but with slow steps in the midst of all this wriggling humanity and at length found ourselves in the august presence of bausi the beautiful black one king of the mazitu     chapter x                               the sentence  we stared at bausi and bausi stared at us  i am the black elephant bausi he exclaimed at last worn out by our solid silence and i trumpet i trumpet i trumpet it appeared that this was the ancient and hallowed formula with which a mazitu king was wont to open a conversation with strangers  after a suitable pause i replied in a cold voice  we are the white lions macumazana and wazela and we roar we roar we roar  i can trample said bausi  and we can bite i said haughtily though how we were to bite or do anything else effectual with nothing but a union jack i did not in the least know  what is that thing asked bausi pointing to the flag  that which shadows the whole earth i answered proudly a remark that seemed to impress him although he did not at all understand it for he ordered a soldier to hold a palm leaf umbrella over him to prevent it from shadowing him  and that he asked again pointing to the music box which is not alive and yet makes a noise  that sings the warsong of our people i said we sent it to you as a present and you returned it why do you return our presents o bausi  then of a sudden this potentate grew furious  why do you come here white men he asked uninvited and against the law of my land where only one white man is welcome my brother dogeetah who cured me of sickness with a knife i know who you are you are dealers in men you come here to steal my people and sell them into slavery you had many slaves with you on the borders of my country but you sent them away you shall die you shall die you who call yourselves lions and the painted rag which you say shadows the world shall rot with your bones as for that box which sings a warsong i will smash it it shall not bewitch me as your magic shield bewitched my great doctor imbozwi burning off his hair  then springing up with wonderful agility for one so fat he knocked the musical box from hans head so that it fell to the ground and after a little whirring grew silent  that is right squeaked imbozwi trample on their magic o elephant kill them o black one burn them as they burned my hair  now things were i felt very serious for already bausi was looking about him as though to order his soldiers to make an end of us so i said in desperation  o king you mentioned a certain white man dogeetah a doctor of doctors who cured you of sickness with a knife and called him your brother well he is our brother also and it was by his invitation that we have come to visit you here where he will meet us presently  if dogeetah is your friend then you are my friends answered bausi for in this land he rules as i rule he whose blood flows in my veins as my blood flows in his veins but you lie dogeetah is no brother of slavedealers his heart is good and yours are evil you say that he will meet you here when will he meet you tell me and if it is soon i will hold my hand and wait to hear his report of you before i put you to death for if he speaks well of you you shall not die  now i hesitated as well i might for i felt that looking at our case from his point of view bausi believing us to be slavetraders was not angry without cause while i was racking my brains for a reply that might be acceptable to him and would not commit us too deeply to my astonishment mavovo stepped forward and confronted the king  who are you fellow shouted bausi  i am a warrior o king as my scars show and he pointed to the assegai wounds upon his breast and to his cut nostril i am a chief of a people from whom your people sprang and my name is mavovo mavovo who is ready to fight you or any man whom you may name and to kill him or you if you will is there one here who wishes to be killed  no one answered for the mightychested zulu looked very formidable  i am a doctor also went on mavovo one of the greatest of doctors who can open the gates of distance and read that which is hid in the womb of the future therefore i will answer your questions which you put to the lord macumazana the great and wise white man whom i serve because we have fought together in many battles yes i will be his mouth i will answer the white man dogeetah who is your bloodbrother and whose word is your word among the mazitu will arrive here at sunset on the second day from now i have spoken  bausi looked at me in question  yes i exclaimed feeling that i must say something and that it did not much matter what i said dogeetah will arrive here on the second day from now within half an hour after sunset  something i know not what prompted me to allow that extra halfhour which in the event saved all our lives now bausi consulted a while with the execrable imbozwi and also with the old oneeyed general babemba while we watched knowing that our fate hung upon the issue  at length he spoke  white men he said imbozwi the head of the witchfinders here whose hair you burnt off by your evil magic says that it would be better to kill you at once as your hearts are bad and you are planning mischief against my people so i think also but babemba my general with whom i am angry because he did not obey my orders and put you to death on the borders of my country when he met you there with your caravan of slaves thinks otherwise he prays me to hold my hand first because you have bewitched him into liking you and secondly because if you should happen to be speaking the truthwhich we do not believeand to have come here at the invitation of my brother dogeetah he dogeetah would be pained if he arrived and found you dead nor could even he bring you to life again this being so since it matters little whether you die now or later my command is that you be kept prisoners till sunset of the second day from this and that then you will be led out and tied to stakes in the marketplace there to wait till the approach of darkness by when you say dogeetah will be here if he arrives and owns you as his brethren well and good if he does not arrive or disowns youbetter still for then you shall be shot to death with arrows as a warning to all other stealers of men not to cross the borders of the mazitu  i listened to this atrocious sentence with horror then gasped out  we are not stealers of men o king we are freers of men as tom and jerry of your own people could tell you  who are tom and jerry he asked indifferently well it does not matter for doubtless they are liars like the rest of you i have spoken take them away feed them well and keep them safe till within an hour of sunset on the second day from this  then without giving us any further opportunity of speaking bausi rose and followed by imbozwi and his councillors marched off into his big hut we too were marched off this time under a double guard commanded by someone whom i had not seen before at the gate of the kraal we halted and asked for the arms that had been taken from us no answer was given only the soldiers put their hands upon our shoulders and thrust us along  this is a nice business i whispered to stephen  oh it doesnt matter he answered there are lots more guns in the huts i am told that these mazitus are dreadfully afraid of bullets so all we have to do is just to break out and shoot our way through them for of course they will run when we begin to fire  i looked at him but did not answer for to tell the truth i felt in no mood for argument  presently we arrived at our quarters where the soldiers left us to camp outside full of his warlike plan stephen went at once to the hut in which the slavers guns had been stored with our own spare rifles and all the ammunition i saw him emerge looking very blank indeed and asked him what was the matter  matter he answered in a voice that for once really was full of dismay the matter is that those mazitu have stolen all the guns and all the ammunition theres not enough powder left to make a blue devil  well i replied with the kind of joke one perpetrates under such circumstances we shall have plenty of blue devils without making any more  truly ours was a dreadful situation let the reader imagine it within a little more than fortyeight hours we were to be shot to death with arrows if an erratic old gentleman who for aught i knew might be dead did not turn up at what was then one of the remotest and most inaccessible spots in central africa moreover our only hope that such a thing would happen if hope it could be called was the prophecy of a kaffir witchdoctor  to rely on this in any way was so absurd that i gave up thinking of it and set my mind to considering if there were any possible means of escape after hours of reflection i could find none even hans with all his experience and nearly superhuman cunning could suggest none we were unarmed and surrounded by thousands of savages all of whom save perhaps babemba believed us to be slavetraders a race that very properly they held in abhorrence who had visited the country with the object of stealing their women and children the king bausi a very prejudiced fellow was dead against us also by a piece of foolishness which i now bitterly regretted as indeed i regretted the whole expedition or at any rate entering on it in the absence of brother john we had made an implacable enemy of the head medicineman who to these folk was a sort of archbishop of canterbury short of a miracle there was no hope for us all that we could do was to say our prayers and prepare for the end  mavovo it is true remained cheerful his faith in his snake was really touching he offered to go through that divination process again in our presence and demonstrate that there was no mistake i declined because i had no faith in divinations and stephen also declined for another reason namely that the result might prove to be different which he held would be depressing the other zulus oscillated between belief and scepticism as do the unstable who set to work to study the evidences of christianity but sammy did not oscillate he literally howled and prepared the food which poured in upon us so badly that i had to turn on hans to do the cooking for however little appetite we might have it was necessary that we should keep up our strength by eating  what mr quatermain asked sammy between his tears is the use of dressing viands that our systems will never have time to thoroughly assimilate  the first night passed somehow and so did the next day and the next night which heralded our last morning i got up quite early and watched the sunrise never i think had i realised before what a beautiful thing the sunrise is at least not to the extent i did now when i was saying goodbye to it for ever unless indeed there should prove to be still lovelier sunrises beyond the dark of death then i went into our hut and as stephen who had the nerves of a rhinoceros was still sleeping like a tortoise in winter i said my prayers earnestly enough mourned over my sins which proved to be so many that at last i gave up the job in despair and then tried to occupy myself by reading the old testament a book to which i have always been extremely attached  as a passage that i lit on described how the prophet samuel for whom i could not help reading imbozwi hewed agag in pieces after bausii mean saulhad relented and spared his life i cannot say that it consoled me very much doubtless i reflected these people believe that i like agag had made women childless by my sword so there remained nothing save to follow the example of that unhappy king and walk delicately to doom  then as stephen was still sleepinghow could he do it i wonderedi set to work to make up the accounts of the expedition to date it had already cost £1423 just fancy expending £1423 in order to be tied to a post and shot to death with arrows and all to get a rare orchid oh i reflected to myself if by some marvel i should escape or if i should live again in any land where these particular flowers flourish i would never even look at them and as a matter of fact i never have  at length stephen did wake up and as criminals are reported to do in the papers before execution made an excellent breakfast  whats the good of worrying he said presently i shouldnt if it werent for my poor old father it must have come to this one day and the sooner it is over the sooner to sleep as the song says when one comes to think of it there are enormous advantages in sleep for thats the only time one is quite happy still i should have liked to see that cypripedium first  oh drat the cypripedium i exclaimed and blundered from the hut to tell sammy that if he didnt stop his groaning i would punch his head  jumps regular jumps whod have thought it of quatermain i heard stephen mutter in the intervals of lighting his pipe  the morning went like lightning that is greased as sammy remarked three oclock came and mavovo and his following sacrificed a kid to the spirits of their ancestors which as sammy remarked again was a horrible heathen ceremony much calculated to prejudice our cause with powers above  when it was over to my delight babemba appeared he looked so pleasant that i jumped to the conclusion that he brought the best of news with him perhaps that the king had pardoned us or perhapsblessed thoughtthat brother john had really arrived before his time  but not a bit of it all he had to say was that he had caused inquiries to be made along the route that ran to the coast and that certainly for a hundred miles there was at present no sign of dogeetah so as the black elephant was growing more and more enraged under the stirrings up of imbozwi it was obvious that that evenings ceremony must be performed indeed as it was part of his duty to superintend the erection of the posts to which we were to be tied and the digging of our graves at their bases he had just come to count us again to be sure that he had not made any mistake as to the number also if there were any articles that we would like buried with us would we be so kind as to point them out and he would be sure to see to the matter it would be soon over and not painful he added as he had selected the very best archers in beza town who rarely missed and could most of them send an arrow up to the feather into a buffalo  then he chatted a little about other matters as to where he should find the magic shield i had given him which he would always value as a souvenir etc took a pinch of snuff with mavovo and departed saying that he would be sure to return again at the proper time  it was now four oclock and as sammy was quite beyond it stephen made himself some tea it was very good tea especially as we had milk to put in it although i did not remember what it tasted like till afterwards  now having abandoned hope i went into a hut alone to compose myself to meet my end like a gentleman and seated there in silence and semidarkness my spirit grew much calmer after all i reflected why should i cling to life in the country whither i travelled as the reader who has followed my adventures will know were some whom i clearly longed to see again notably my father and my mother and two noble women who were even more to me my boy it is true remained he was alive then but i knew that he would find friends and as i was not so badly off at that time i had been able to make a proper provision for him perhaps it was better that i should go seeing that if i lived on it would only mean more troubles and more partings  what was about to befall me of course i could not tell but i knew then as i know now that it was not extinction or even that sleep of which stephen had spoken perhaps i was passing to some place where at length the clouds would roll away and i should understand whence too i should see all the landscape of the past and future as an eagle does watching from the skies and be no longer like one struggling through dense bush wildbeast and serpent haunted beat upon by the storms of heaven and terrified with its lightnings nor knowing whither i hewed my path perhaps in that place there would be no longer what st paul describes as another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin perhaps there the past would be forgiven by the power which knows whereof we are made and i should become what i have always longed to begood in every sense and even find open to me new and better roads of service i take these thoughts from a note that i made in my pocketbook at the time  thus i reflected and then wrote a few lines of farewell in the fond and foolish hope that somehow they might find those to whom they were addressed i have those letters still and very oddly they read today this done i tried to throw out my mind towards brother john if he still lived as indeed i had done for days past so that i might inform him of our plight and i am afraid reproach him for having brought us to such an end by his insane carelessness or want of faith  whilst i was still engaged thus babemba arrived with his soldiers to lead us off to execution it was hans who came to tell me that he was there the poor old hottentot shook me by the hand and wiped his eyes with his ragged coatsleeve  oh baas this is our last journey he said and you are going to be killed baas and it is all my fault baas because i ought to have found a way out of the trouble which is what i was hired to do but i cant my head grows so stupid oh if only i could come even with imbozwi i shouldnt mind and i will i will if i have to return as a ghost to do it well baas you know the predikant your father told us that we dont go out like a fire but burn again for always elsewhere  i hope not i thought to myself  and that quite easily without anything to pay for the wood so i hope that we shall always burn together baas and meanwhile i have brought you a little something and he produced what looked like a peculiarly obnoxious horseball you swallow this now and you will never feel anything it is a very good medicine that my grandfathers grandfather got from the spirit of his tribe you will just go to sleep as nicely as though you were very drunk and wake up in the beautiful fire which burns without any wood and never goes out for ever and ever amen  no hans i said i prefer to die with my eyes open  and so would i baas if i thought there was any good in keeping them open but i dont for i cant believe any more in the snake of that black fool mavovo if it had been a good snake it would have told him to keep clear of beza town so i will swallow one of these pills and give the other to the baas stephen and he crammed the filthy mess into his mouth and with an effort got it down as a young turkey does a ball of meal that is too big for its throat  then as i heard stephen calling me i left him invoking a most comprehensive and polyglot curse upon the head of imbozwi to whom he rightly attributed all our woes  our friend here says it is time to start said stephen rather shakily for the situation seemed to have got a hold of him at last and nodding towards old babemba who stood there with a cheerful smile looking as though he were going to conduct us to a wedding  yes white lord said babemba it is time and i have hurried so as not to keep you waiting it will be a very fine show for the black elephant himself is going to do you the honour to be present as will all the people of beza town and those for many miles round  hold your tongue you old idiot i said and stop your grinning if you had been a man and not a false friend you would have got us out of this trouble knowing as you do very well that we are no sellers of men but rather the enemy of those who do such things  oh white lord said babemba in a changed voice believe me i only smile to make you happy up to the end my lips smile but i am crying inside i know that you are good and have told bausi so but he will not believe me who thinks that i have been bribed by you what can i do against that evilhearted imbozwi the head of the witchdoctors who hates you because he thinks you have better magic than he has and who whispers day and night into the kings ear telling him that if he does not kill you all our people will be slain or sold for slaves as you are only the scouts or a big army that is coming only last night imbozwi held a great divination indaba and read this and a great deal more in the enchanted water making the king think he saw it in pictures whereas i looking over his shoulder could see nothing at all except the ugly face of imbozwi reflected in the water also he swore that his spirit told me that dogeetah the kings bloodbrother being dead would never come to beza town again i have done my best keep your heart white towards me o macumazana and do not haunt me for i tell you i have done my best and if ever i should get a chance against imbozwi which i am afraid i shant as he will poison me first i will pay him back oh he shall not die quickly as you will  i wish i could get a chance at him i muttered for even in this solemn moment i could cultivate no christian spirit towards imbozwi  feeling that he was honest after all i shook old babembas hand and gave him the letters i had written asking him to try and get them to the coast then we started on our last walk  the zulu hunters were already outside the fence seated on the ground chatting and taking snuff i wondered if this was because they really believed in mavovos confounded snake or from bravado inspired by the innate courage of their race when they saw me they sprang to their feet and lifting their right hands gave me a loud and hearty salute of inkoosi baba inkoosi macumazana then at a signal from mavovo they broke into some zulu warchant which they kept up till we reached the stakes sammy too broke into a chant but one of quite a different nature  be quiet i said to him cant you die like a man  no indeed i cannot mr quatermain he answered and went on howling for pity in about twenty different languages  stephen and i walked together he still carrying the union jack of which no one tried to deprive him i think the mazitu believed it was his fetish we didnt talk much though once he said  well the love of orchids has brought many a man to a bad end i wonder whether the governor will keep my collection or sell it  after this he relapsed into silence and not knowing and indeed not caring what would happen to his collection i made no answer  we had not far to go personally i could have preferred a longer walk passing with our guards down a kind of bystreet we emerged suddenly at the head of the marketplace to find that it was packed with thousands of people gathered there to see our execution i noticed that they were arranged in orderly companies and that a broad open roadway was left between them running to the southern gate of the market i suppose to facilitate the movements of so large a crowd  all this multitude received us in respectful silence though sammys howls caused some of them to smile while the zulu warchant appeared to excite their wonder or admiration at the head of the marketplace not far from the kings enclosure fifteen stout posts had been planted on as many mounds these mounds were provided so that everyone might see the show and in part at any rate were made of soil hollowed from fifteen deep graves dug almost at the foot of the mounds or rather there were seventeen posts an extra large one being set at each end of the line in order to accommodate the two donkeys which it appeared were also to be shot to death a great number of soldiers kept a space clear in front of the posts on this space were gathered bausi his councillors some of his head wives imbozwi more hideously painted than usual and perhaps fifty or sixty picked archers with strung bows and an ample supply of arrows whose part in the ceremony it was not difficult for us to guess  king bausi i said as i was led past that potentate you are a murderer and heaven above will be avenged upon you for this crime if our blood is shed soon you shall die and come to meet us where we have power and your people shall be destroyed  my words seemed to frighten the man for he answered  i am no murderer i kill you because you are robbers of men moreover it is not i who have passed sentence on you it is imbozwi here the chief of the doctors who has told me all about you and whose spirit says you must die unless my brother dogeetah appears to save you if dogeetah comes which he cannot do because he is dead and vouches for you then i shall know that imbozwi is a wicked liar and as you were to die so he shall die  yes yes screeched imbozwi if dogeetah comes as that false wizard prophesies and he pointed to mavovo then i shall be ready to die in your place white slavedealers yes yes then you may shoot me with arrows  king take note of those words and people take note of those words that they may be fulfilled if dogeetah comes said mavovo in a great deep voice  i take note of them answered bausi and i swear by my mother on behalf of all the people that they shall be fulfilledif dogeetah comes  good exclaimed mavovo and stalked on to the stake which had been pointed out to him  as he went he whispered something into imbozwis ear that seemed to frighten that limb of satan for i saw him start and shiver however he soon recovered for in another minute he was engaged in superintending those whose business it was to lash us to the posts  this was done simply and effectively by tying our wrists with a grass rope behind these posts each of which was fitted with two projecting pieces of wood that passed under our arms and practically prevented us from moving stephen and i were given the places of honour in the middle the union jack being fixed by his own request to the top of stephens stake mavovo was on my right and the other zulus were ranged on either side of us hans and sammy occupied the end posts respectively except those to which the poor jackasses were bound i noted that hans was already very sleepy and that shortly after he was fixed up his head dropped forward on his breast evidently his medicine was working and almost i regretted that i had not taken some while i had the chance  when we were all fastened imbozwi came round to inspect moreover with a piece of white chalk he made a round mark on the breast of each of us a kind of bulls eye for the archers to aim at  ah white man he said to me as he chalked away at my shooting coat you will never burn anyones hair again with your magic shield never never for presently i shall be treading down the earth upon you in that hole and your goods will belong to me  i did not answer for what was the use of talking to this vile brute when my time was so short so he passed on to stephen and began to chalk him stephen however in whom the natural man still prevailed shouted  take your filthy hands off me and lifting his leg which was unfettered gave the painted witchdoctor such an awful kick in the stomach that he vanished backwards into the grave beneath him  ow well done wazela said the zulus we hope that you have killed him  i hope so too said stephen and the multitude of spectators gasped to see the sacred person of the head witchdoctor of whom they evidently went in much fear treated in such a way only babemba grinned and even the king bausi did not seem displeased  but imbozwi was not to be disposed of so easily for presently with the help of sundry myrmidons minor witchdoctors he scrambled out of the grave cursing and covered with mud for it was wet down there after that i took no more heed of him or of much else seeing that i had only half an hour to live as may be imagined i was otherwise engaged     chapter xi                          the coming of dogeetah  the sunset that day was like the sunrise particularly fine although as in the case of the tea i remembered little of it till afterwards in fact thunder was about which always produces grand cloud effects in africa  the sun went down like a great red eye over which there dropped suddenly a black eyelid of cloud with a fringe of purple lashes  theres the last i shall see of you my old friend thought i to myself unless i catch you up presently  the gloom began to gather the king looked about him also at the sky overhead as though he feared rain then whispered something to babemba who nodded and strolled up to my post  white lord he said the elephant wishes to know if you are ready as presently the light will be very bad for shooting  no i answered with decision not till half an hour after sundown as was agreed  babemba went to the king and returned to me  white lord the king says that a bargain is a bargain and he will keep to his word only you must not then blame him if the shooting is bad since of course he did not know that the night would be so cloudy which is not usual at this time of year  it grew darker and darker till at length we might have been lost in a london fog the dense masses of the people looked like banks and the archers flitting to and fro as they made ready might have been shadows in hades once or twice lightning flashed and was followed after a pause by the distant growling of thunder the air too grew very oppressive dense silence reigned in all those multitudes no one spoke or stirred even sammy ceased his howling i suppose because he had become exhausted and fainted away as people often do just before they are hanged it was a most solemn time nature seemed to be adapting herself to the mood of sacrifice and making ready for us a mighty pall  at length i heard the sound of arrows being drawn from their quivers and then the squeaky voice of imbozwi saying  wait a little the cloud will lift there is light behind it and it will be nicer if they can see the arrows coming  the cloud did begin to lift very slowly and from beneath it flowed a green light like that in a cats eye  shall we shoot imbozwi asked the voice of the captain of the archers  not yet not yet not till the people can watch them die  the edge of cloud lifted a little more the green light turned to a fiery red thrown by the sunk sun and reflected back upon the earth from the dense black cloud above it was as though all the landscape had burst into flames while the heaven over us remained of the hue of ink again the lightning flashed showing the faces and staring eyes of the thousands who watched and even the white teeth of a great bat that flittered past that flash seemed to burn off an edge of the lowering cloud and the light grew stronger and stronger and redder and redder  imbozwi uttered a hiss like a snake i heard a bowstring twang and almost at the same moment the thud of an arrow striking my post just above my head indeed by lifting myself i could touch it i shut my eyes and began to see all sorts of queer things that i had forgotten for years and years my brain swam and seemed to melt into a kind of confusion through the intense silence i thought i heard the sound of some animal running heavily much as a fat bull eland does when it is suddenly disturbed someone uttered a startled exclamation which caused me to open my eyes again the first thing i saw was the squad of savage archers lifting their bowsevidently that first arrow had been a kind of trial shot the next looking absolutely unearthly in that terrible and ominous light was a tall figure seated on a white ox shambling rapidly towards us along the open roadway that ran from the southern gate of the marketplace  of course i knew that i dreamed for this figure exactly resembled brother john there was his long snowy beard there in his hand was his butterfly net with the handle of which he seemed to be prodding the ox only he was wound about with wreaths of flowers as were the great horns of the ox and on either side of him and before and behind him ran girls also wreathed with flowers it was a vision nothing else and i shut my eyes again awaiting the fatal arrow  shoot screamed imbozwi  nay shoot not shouted babemba dogeetah is come  a moments pause during which i heard arrows falling to the ground then from all those thousands of throats a roar that shaped itself to the words  dogeetah dogeetah is come to save the white lords  i must confess that after this my nerve which is generally pretty good gave out to such an extent that i think i fainted for a few minutes during that faint i seemed to be carrying on a conversation with mavovo though whether it ever took place or i only imagined it i am not sure since i always forgot to ask him  he said or i thought he said to me  and now macumazana my father what have you to say does my snake stand upon its tail or does it not answer i am listening  to which i replied or seemed to reply  mavovo my child certainly it appears as though your snake does stand upon its tail still i hold that all this is a phantasy that we live in a land of dream in which nothing is real except those things which we cannot see or touch or hear that there is no me and no you and no snake at all nothing but a power in which we move that shows us pictures and laughs when we think them real  whereon mavovo said or seemed to say  ah at last you touch the truth o macumazana my father all things are a shadow and we are shadows in a shadow but what throws the shadow o macumazana my father why does dogeetah appear to come hither riding on a white ox and why do all these thousands think that my snake stands so very stiff upon its tail  im hanged if i know i replied and woke up  there without doubt was old brother john with a wreath of flowersi noted in disgust that they were orchidshanging in a bacchanalian fashion from his dinted sunhelmet over his left eye he was in a furious rage and reviling bausi who literally crouched before him and i was in a furious rage and reviling him what i said i do not remember but he said his white beard bristling with indignation while he threatened bausi with the handle of the butterfly net  you dog you savage whom i saved from death and called brother what were you doing to these white men who are in truth my brothers and to their followers were you about to kill them oh if so i will forget my vow i will forget the bond that binds us and  dont pray dont said bausi it is all a horrible mistake i am not to be blamed at all it is that witchdoctor imbozwi whom by the ancient law of the land i must obey in such matters he consulted his spirit and declared that you were dead also that these white lords were the most wicked of men slavetraders with spotted hearts who came hither to spy out the mazitu people and to destroy them with magic and bullets  then he lied thundered brother john and he knew that he lied  yes yes it is evident that he lied answered bausi bring him here and with him those who serve him  now by the light of the moon which was shining brightly in the heavens for the thunderclouds had departed with the last glow of sunset soldiers began an active search for imbozwi and his confederates of these they caught eight or ten all wickedlooking fellows hideously painted and adorned like their master but imbozwi himself they could not find  i began to think that in the confusion he had given us the slip when presently from the far end of the line for we were still all tied to our stakes i heard the voice of sammy hoarse it is true but quite cheerful now saying  mr quatermain in the interests of justice will you inform his majesty that the treacherous wizard for whom he is seeking is now peeping and muttering at the bottom of the grave which was dug to receive my mortal remains  i did inform his majesty and in doublequick time our friend imbozwi was once more fished out of a grave by the strong arms of babemba and his soldiers and dragged into the presence of the irate bausi  loose the white lords and their followers said bausi and let them come here  so our bonds were undone and we walked to where the king and brother john stood the miserable imbozwi and his attendant doctors huddled in a heap before them  who is this said bausi to him pointing at brother john is it not he whom you vowed was dead  imbozwi did not seem to think that the question required an answer so bausi continued  what was the song that you sang in our ears just nowthat if dogeetah came you would be ready to be shot to death with arrows in the place of these white lords whose lives you swore away was it not  again imbozwi made no answer although babemba called his attention to the kings query with a vigorous kick then bausi shouted  by your own mouth are you condemned o liar and that shall be done to you which you have yourself decreed adding almost in the words of elijah after he had triumphed over the priests of baal take away these false prophets let none of them escape say you not so o people  aye roared the multitude fiercely take them away  not a popular character imbozwi stephen remarked to me in a reflective voice well he is going to be served hot on his own toast now and serve the brute right  who is the false doctor now mocked mavovo in the silence that followed who is about to sup on arrowheads o painterofwhitespots and he pointed to the mark that imbozwi had so gleefully chalked over his heart as a guide to the arrows of the archers  now seeing that all was lost the little humpbacked villain with a sudden twist caught me by the legs and began to plead for mercy so piteously did he plead that being already softened by the fact of our wonderful escape from those black graves my heart was melted in me i turned to ask the king to spare his life though with little hope that the prayer would be granted for i saw that bausi feared and hated the man and was only too glad of the opportunity to be rid of him imbozwi however interpreted my movement differently since among savages the turning of the back always means that a petition is refused then in his rage and despair the venom of his wicked heart boiled over he leapt to his feet and drawing a big carved knife from among his witchdoctors trappings sprang at me like a wild cat shouting  at least you shall come too white dog  most mercifully mavovo was watching him for that is a good zulu saying which declares that wizard is wizards fate with one bound he was on him just as the knife touched meit actually pricked my skin though without drawing blood which was fortunate as probably it was poisonedhe gripped imbozwis arm in his grasp of iron and hurled him to the ground as though he were but a child  after this of course all was over  come away i said to stephen and brother john this is no place for us  so we went and gained our huts without molestation and indeed quite unobserved for the attention of everyone in beza town was fully occupied elsewhere from the marketplace behind us rose so hideous a clamour that we rushed into my hut and shut the door to escape or lessen the sound it was dark in the hut for which i was really thankful for the darkness seemed to soothe my nerves especially was this so when brother john said  friend allan quatermain and you young gentleman whose name i dont know i will tell you what i think i never mentioned to you before that in addition to being a doctor i am a clergyman of the american episcopalian church well as a clergyman i will ask your leave to return thanks for your very remarkable deliverance from a cruel death  by all means i muttered for both of us and he did so in a most earnest and beautiful prayer brother john may or may not have been a little touched in the head at this time of his life but he was certainly an able and a good man  afterwards as the shrieks and shouting had now died down to a confused murmur of many voices we went and sat outside under the projecting eaves of the hut where i introduced stephen somers to brother john  and now i said in the name of goodness where do you come from tied up in flowers like a roman priest at sacrifice and riding on a bull like the lady called europa and what on earth do you mean by playing us such a scurvy trick down there in durban leaving us without a word after you had agreed to guide us to this hellish hole  brother john stroked his long beard and looked at me reproachfully  i guess allan he said in his american fashion there is a mistake somewhere to answer the last part of your question first i did not leave you without a word i gave a letter to that lame old griqua gardener of yours jack to be handed to you when you arrived  then the idiot either lost it and lied to me as griquas will or he forgot all about it  that is likely i ought to have thought of that allan but i didnt well in that letter i said that i would meet you here where i should have been six weeks ago awaiting you also i sent a message to bausi to warn him of your coming in case i should be delayed but i suppose that something happened to it on the road  why did you not wait and come with us like a sensible man  allan as you ask me straight out i will tell you although the subject is one of which i do not care to speak i knew that you were going to journey by kilwa indeed it was your only route with a lot of people and so much baggage and i did not wish to visit kilwa he paused then went on a long while ago nearly twentythree years to be accurate i went to live at kilwa as a missionary with my young wife i built a mission station and a church there and we were happy and fairly successful in our work then on one evil day the swahili and other arabs came in dhows to establish a slavedealing station i resisted them and the end of it was that they attacked us killed most of my people and enslaved the rest in that attack i received a cut from a sword on the headlook here is the mark of it and drawing his white hair apart he showed us a long scar that was plainly visible in the moonlight  the blow knocked me senseless just about sunset one evening when i came to myself again it was broad daylight and everybody was gone except one old woman who was tending me she was halfcrazed with grief because her husband and two sons had been killed and another son a boy and a daughter had been taken away i asked her where my young wife was she answered that she too had been taken away eight or ten hours before because the arabs had seen the lights of a ship out at sea and thought they might be those of a british manofwar that was known to be cruising on the coast on seeing these they had fled inland in a hurry leaving me for dead but killing the wounded before they went the old woman herself had escaped by hiding among some rocks on the seashore and after the arabs had gone had crept back to the house and found me still alive  i asked her where my wife had been taken she said she did not know but some others of our people told her that they had heard the arabs say they were going to some place a hundred miles inland to join their leader a halfbred villain named hassanbenmohammed to whom they were carrying my wife as a present  now we knew this wretch for after the arabs landed at kilwa but before actual hostilities broke out between us he had fallen sick of smallpox and my wife had helped to nurse him had it not been for her indeed he would have died however although the leader of the band he was not present at the attack being engaged in some slaveraiding business in the interior  when i learned this terrible news the shock of it or the loss of blood brought on a return of insensibility from which i only awoke two days later to find myself on board a dutch trading vessel that was sailing for zanzibar it was the lights of this ship that the arabs had seen and mistaken for those of an english manofwar she had put into kilwa for water and the sailors finding me on the verandah of the house and still living in the goodness of their hearts carried me on board of the old woman they had seen nothing i suppose that at their approach she ran away  at zanzibar in an almost dying condition i was handed over to a clergyman of our mission in whose house i lay desperately ill for a long while indeed six months went by before i fully recovered my right mind some people say that i have never recovered it perhaps you are one of them allan  at last the wound in my skull healed after a clever english naval surgeon had removed some bits of splintered bone and my strength came back to me i was and still am an american subject and in those days we had no consul at zanzibar if there is one there now of which i am not sure and of course no warship the english made what inquiries they could for me but could find out little or nothing since all the country about kilwa was in possession of arab slavetraders who were supported by a ruffian who called himself the sultan of zanzibar  again he paused as though overcome by the sadness of his recollections  did you never hear any more of your wife asked stephen  yes mr somers i heard at zanzibar from a slave whom our mission bought and freed that he had seen a white woman who answered to her description alive and apparently well at some place i was unable to identify he could only tell me that it was fifteen days journey from the coast she was then in charge of some black people he did not know of what tribe who he believed had found her wandering in the bush he noted that the black people seemed to treat her with the greatest reverence although they could not understand what she said on the following day whilst searching for six lost goats he was captured by arabs who he heard afterwards were out looking for this white woman the day after the man had told me this he was seized with inflammation of the lungs of which being in a weak state from his sufferings in the slave gang he quickly died now you will understand why i was not particularly anxious to revisit kilwa  yes i said we understand that and a good deal more of which we will talk later but to change the subject where do you come from now and how did you happen to turn up just in the nick of time  i was journeying here across country by a route i will show you on my map he answered when i met with an accident to my leg here stephen and i looked at each other which kept me laid up in a kaffir hut for six weeks when i got better as i could not walk very well i rode upon oxen that i had trained that white beast you saw is the last of them the others died of the bite of the tsetse fly a fear which i could not define caused me to press forward as fast as possible for the last twentyfour hours i have scarcely stopped to eat or sleep when i got into the mazitu country this morning i found the kraals empty except for some women and girls who knew me again and threw these flowers over me they told me that all the men had gone to beza town for a great feast but what the feast was they either did not know or would not reveal so i hurried on and arrived in timethank god in time it is a long story i will tell you the details afterwards now we are all too tired whats that noise  i listened and recognised the triumphant song of the zulu hunters who were returning from the savage scene in the marketplace presently they arrived headed by sammy a very different sammy from the wailing creature who had gone out to execution an hour or two before now he was the gayest of the gay and about his neck were strung certain weird ornaments which i identified as the personal property of imbozwi  virtue is victorious and justice has been done mr quatermain these are the spoils of war he said pointing to the trappings of the late witchdoctor  oh get out you little cur we want to know nothing more i said go cook us some supper and he went not in the least abashed  the hunters were carrying between them what appeared to be the body of hans at first i was frightened thinking that he must be dead but examination showed that he was only in a state of insensibility such as might be induced by laudanum brother john ordered him to be wrapped up in a blanket and laid by the fire and this was done  presently mavovo approached and squatted down in front of us  macumazana my father he said quietly what words have you for me  words of thanks mavovo if you had not been so quick imbozwi would have finished me as it is the knife only touched my skin without breaking it for dogeetah has looked to see  mavovo waved his hand as though to sweep this little matter aside and asked looking me straight in the eyes  and what other words macumazana as to my snake i mean  only that you were right and i was wrong i answered shamefacedly things have happened as you foretold how or why i do not understand  no my father because you white men are so vain blown out was his word that you think you have all wisdom now you have learned that this is not so i am content the false doctors are all dead my father and i think that imbozwi  i held up my hand not wishing to hear details mavovo rose and with a little smile went about his business  what does he mean about his snake inquired brother john curiously  i told him as briefly as i could and asked him if he could explain the matter he shook his head  the strangest example of native vision that i have ever heard of he answered and the most useful explain there is no explanation except the old one that there are more things in heaven and earth etc and that god gives different gifts to different men  then we ate our supper i think one of the most joyful meals of which i have ever partaken it is wonderful how good food tastes when one never expected to swallow another mouthful after it was finished the others went to bed but with the still unconscious hans for my only companion i sat for a while smoking by the fire for on this high tableland the air was chilly i felt that as yet i could not sleep if for no other reason because of the noise that the mazitu were making in the town i suppose in celebration of the execution of the terrible witchdoctors and the return of dogeetah  suddenly hans awoke and sitting up stared at me through the bright flame which i had recently fed with dry wood  baas he said in a hollow voice there you are here i am and there is the fire which never goes out a very good fire but baas why are we not inside of it as your father the predikant promised instead of outside here in the cold  because you are still in the world you old fool and not where you deserve to be i answered because mavovos snake was a snake with a true tongue after all and dogeetah came as it foretold because we are all alive and well and it is imbozwi with his spawn who are dead upon the posts that is why hans as you would have seen for yourself if you had kept awake instead of swallowing filthy medicine like a frightened woman just because you were afraid of death which at your age you ought to have welcomed  oh baas broke in hans dont tell me that things are so and that we are really alive in what your honoured father used to call this gourd full of tears dont tell me baas that i made a coward of myself and swallowed that beastlinessif you knew what it was made of you would understand baasfor nothing but a bad headache dont tell me that dogeetah came when my eyes were not open to see him and worst of all that imbozwi and his children were tied to those poles when i was not able to help them out of the bottle of tears into the fire that burns for ever and ever oh it is too much and i swear baas that however often i have to die henceforward it shall always be with my eyes open and holding his aching head between his hands he rocked himself to and fro in bitter grief  well might hans be sad seeing that he never heard the last of the incident the hunters invented a new and gigantic name for him which meant the littleyellowmousewhofeedsonsleepwhiletheblackrats eatuptheirenemies even sammy made a mock of him showing him the spoils which he declared he had wrenched unaided from the mighty master of magic imbozwi as indeed he hadafter the said imbozwi was stone dead at the stake  it was very amusing until things grew so bad that i feared hans would kill sammy and had to put a stop to the joke     chapter xii                           brother johns story  although i went to bed late i was up before sunrise chiefly because i wished to have some private conversation with brother john whom i knew to be a very early riser indeed he slept less than any man i ever met  as i expected i found him astir in his hut he was engaged in pressing flowers by candlelight  john i said i have brought you some property which i think you have lost and i handed him the moroccobound christian year and the watercolour drawing which we had found in the sacked mission house at kilwa  he looked first at the picture and then at the book at least i suppose he did for i went outside the hut for a whileto observe the sunrise in a few minutes he called me and when the door was shut said in an unsteady voice  how did you come by these relics allan  i told him the story from beginning to end he listened without a word and when i had finished said  i may as well tell what perhaps you have guessed that the picture is that of my wife and the book is her book  is i exclaimed  yes allan i say is because i do not believe that she is dead i cannot explain why any more than i could explain last night how that great zulu savage was able to prophesy my coming but sometimes we can wring secrets from the unknown and i believe that i have won this truth in answer to my prayers that my wife still lives  after twenty years john  yes after twenty years why do you suppose he asked almost fiercely that for twothirds of a generation i have wandered about among african savages pretending to be crazy because these wild people revere the mad and always let them pass unharmed  i thought it was to collect butterflies and botanical specimens  butterflies and botanical specimens these were the pretext i have been and am searching for my wife you may think it a folly especially considering what was her condition when we separatedshe was expecting a child allanbut i do not i believe that she is hidden away among some of these wild peoples  then perhaps it would be as well not to find her i answered bethinking me of the fate which had overtaken sundry white women in the old days who had escaped from shipwrecks on the coast and become the wives of kaffirs  not so allan on that point i fear nothing if god has preserved my wife he has also protected her from every harm and now he went on you will understand why i wish to visit these pongothe pongo who worship a white goddess  i understand i said and left him for having learned all there was to know i thought it best not to prolong a painful conversation to me it seemed incredible that this lady should still live and i feared the effect upon him of the discovery that she was no more how full of romance is this poor little world of ours think of brother john eversley was his real name as i discovered afterwards and what his life had been a highminded educated man trying to serve his faith in the dark places of the earth and taking his young wife with him which for my part i have never considered a right thing to do neither tradition nor holy writ record that the apostles dragged their wives and families into the heathen lands where they went to preach although i believe that some of them were married but this is by the way  then falls the blow the mission house is sacked the husband escapes by a miracle and the poor young lady is torn away to be the prey of a vile slavetrader lastly according to the quite unreliable evidence of some savage already in the shadow of death she is seen in the charge of other unknown savages on the strength of this the husband playing the part of a mad botanist hunts for her for a score of years enduring incredible hardships and yet buoyed up by a high and holy trust to my mind it was a beautiful and pathetic story still for reasons which i have suggested i confess that i hoped that long ago she had returned into the hands of the power which made her for what would be the state of a young white lady who for two decades had been at the mercy of these black brutes  and yet and yet after my experience of mavovo and his snake i did not feel inclined to dogmatise about anything who and what was i that i should venture not only to form opinions but to thrust them down the throats of others after all how narrow are the limits of the knowledge upon which we base our judgments perhaps the great sea of intuition that surrounds us is safer to float on than are these little islets of individual experience whereon we are so wont to take our stand  meanwhile my duty was not to speculate on the dreams and mental attitudes of others but like a practical hunter and trader to carry to a successful issue an expedition that i was well paid to manage and to dig up a certain rare flower root if i could find it in the marketable value of which i had an interest i have always prided myself upon my entire lack of imagination and all such mental phantasies and upon an aptitude for hard business and an appreciation of the facts of life that after all are the things with which we have to do this is the truth at least i hope it is for if i were to be quite honest which no one ever has been except a gentleman named mr pepys who i think lived in the reign of charles ii and who to judge from his memoirs which i have read lately did not write for publication i should have to admit that there is another side to my nature i sternly suppress it however at any rate for the present  while we were at breakfast hans who still suffering from headache and remorse was lurking outside the gateway far from the madding crowd of critics crept in like a beaten dog and announced that babemba was approaching followed by a number of laden soldiers i was about to advance to receive him then i remembered that owing to a queer native custom such as that which caused sir theophilus shepstone whom i used to know very well to be recognised as the holder of the spirit of the great chaka and therefore as the equal of the zulu monarchs brother john was the really important man in our company so i gave way and asked him to be good enough to take my place and to live up to that station in savage life to which it had pleased god to call him  i am bound to say he rose to the occasion very well being by nature and appearance a dignified old man swallowing his coffee in a hurry he took his place at a little distance from us and stood there in a statuesque pose to him entered babemba crawling on his hands and knees and other native gentlemen likewise crawling also the burdened soldiers in as obsequious an attitude as their loads would allow  o king dogeetah said babemba your brother king bausi returns the guns and firegoods of the white men your children and sends certain gifts  glad to hear it general babemba said brother john although it would be better if he had never taken them away put them down and get on to your feet i do not like to see men wriggling on their stomachs like monkeys  the order was obeyed and we checked the guns and ammunition also our revolvers and the other articles that had been taken away from us nothing was missing or damaged and in addition there were four fine elephants tusks an offering to stephen and myself which as a business man i promptly accepted some karosses and mazitu weapons presents to mavovo and the hunters a beautiful native bedstead with ivory legs and mats of finelywoven grass a gift to hans in testimony to his powers of sleep under trying circumstances the zulus roared when they heard this and hans vanished cursing behind the huts and for sammy a weird musical instrument with a request that in future he would use it in public instead of his voice  sammy i may add did not see the joke any more than hans had done but the rest of us appreciated the mazitu sense of humour very much  it is very well mr quatermain he said for these black babes and sucklings to sit in the seat of the scornful on such an occasion silent prayers would have been of little use but i am certain that my loud crying to heaven delivered you all from the bites of the heathen arrows  o dogeetah and white lords said babemba the king invites your presence that he may ask your forgiveness for what has happened and this time there will be no need for you to bring arms since henceforward no hurt can come to you from the mazitu people  so presently we set out once more taking with us the gifts that had been refused our march to the royal quarters was a veritable triumphal progress the people prostrated themselves and clapped their hands slowly in salutation as we passed while the girls and children pelted us with flowers as though we were brides going to be married our road ran by the place of execution where the stakes at which i confess i looked with a shiver were still standing though the graves had been filled in  on our arrival bausi and his councillors rose and bowed to us indeed the king did more for coming forward he seized brother john by the hand and insisted upon rubbing his ugly black nose against that of this revered guest this it appeared was the mazitu method of embracing an honour which brother john did not seem at all to appreciate then followed long speeches washed down with draughts of thick native beer bausi explained that his evil proceedings were entirely due to the wickedness of the deceased imbozwi and his disciples under whose tyranny the land had groaned for long since the people believed them to speak with the voice of heaven above  brother john on our behalf accepted the apology and then read a lecture or rather preached a sermon that took exactly twentyfive minutes to deliver he is rather long in the wind in which he demonstrated the evils of superstition and pointed to a higher and a better path bausi replied that he would like to hear more of that path another time which as he presumed that we were going to spend the rest of our lives in his company could easily be foundsay during the next spring when the crops had been sown and the people had leisure on their hands  after this we presented our gifts which now were eagerly accepted then i took up my parable and explained to bausi that so far from stopping in beza town for the rest of our lives we were anxious to press forward at once to pongoland the kings face fell as did those of his councillors  listen o lord macumazana and all of you he said these pongo are horrible wizards a great and powerful people who live by themselves amidst the swamps and mix with none if the pongo catch mazitu or folk of any other tribe either they kill them or take them as prisoners to their own land where they enslave them or sometimes sacrifice them to the devils they worship  that is so broke in babemba for when i was a lad i was a slave to the pongo and doomed to be sacrificed to the white devil it was in escaping from them that i lost this eye  needless to say i made a note of this remark though i did not think the moment opportune to follow the matter up if babemba has once been to pongoland i reflected to myself babemba can go again or show us the way there  and if we catch any of the pongo went on bausi as sometimes we do when they come to hunt for slaves we kill them ever since the mazitu have been in this place there has been hate and war between them and the pongo and if i could wipe out those evil ones then i should die happily  that you will never do o king while the white devil lives said babemba have you not heard the pongo prophecy that while the white devil lives and the holy flower blooms they will live but when the white devil dies and the holy flower ceases to bloom then their women will become barren and their end will be upon them  well i suppose that this white devil will die some day i said  not so macumazana it will never die of itself like its wicked priest it has been there from the beginning and will always be there unless it is killed but who is there that can kill the white devil  i thought to myself that i would not mind trying but again i did not pursue the point  my brother dogeetah and lords exclaimed bausi it is not possible that you should visit these wizards except at the head of an army but how can i send an army with you seeing that the mazitu are a land people and have no canoes in which to cross the great lake and no trees whereof to make them  we answered that we did not know but would think the matter over as we had come from our own place for this purpose and meant to carry it out  then the audience came to an end and we returned to our huts leaving dogeetah to converse with his brother bausi on matters connected with the latters health as i passed babemba i told him that i should like to see him alone and he said that he would visit me that evening after supper the rest of the day passed quietly for we had asked that people might be kept away from our encampment  we found hans who had not accompanied us being a little shy of appearing in public just then engaged in cleaning the rifles and this reminded me of something taking the doublebarrelled gun of which i have spoken i called mavovo and handed it to him saying  it is yours o true prophet  yes my father he answered it is mine for a little while then perhaps it will be yours again  the words struck me but i did not care to ask their meaning somehow i wanted to hear no more of mavovos prophecies  then we dined and for the rest of that afternoon slept for all of us including brother john needed rest badly in the evening babemba came and we three white men saw him alone  tell us about the pongo and this white devil they worship i said  macumazana he answered fifty years have gone by since i was in that land and i see things that happened to me there as through a mist i went to fish amongst the reeds when i was a boy of twelve and tall men robed in white came in a canoe and seized me they led me to a town where there were many other such men and treated me very well giving me sweet things to eat till i grew fat and my skin shone then in the evening i was taken away and we marched all night to the mouth of a great cave in this cave sat a horrible old man about whom danced robed people performing the rites of the white devil  the old man told me that on the following morning i was to be cooked and eaten for which reason i had been made so fat there was a canoe at the mouth of the cave beyond which lay water while all were asleep i crept to the canoe as i loosed the rope one of the priests woke up and ran at me but i hit him on the head with the paddle for though only a boy i was bold and strong and he fell into the water he came up again and gripped the edge of the canoe but i struck his fingers with the paddle till he let go a great wind was blowing that night tearing off boughs from the trees which grew upon the other shore of the water it whirled the canoe round and round and one of the boughs struck me in the eye i scarcely felt it at the time but afterwards the eye withered or perhaps it was a spear or a knife that struck me in the eye i do not know i paddled till i lost my senses and always that wind blew the last thing that i remember was the sound of the canoe being driven by the gale through reeds when i woke up again i found myself near a shore to which i waded through the mud scaring great crocodiles but this must have been some days later for now i was quite thin i fell down upon the shore and there some of our people found me and nursed me till i recovered that is all  and quite enough too i said now answer me how far was the town from the place where you were captured in mazituland  a whole days journey in the canoe macumazana i was captured in the morning early and we reached the harbour in the evening at a place where many canoes were tied up perhaps fifty of them some of which would hold forty men  and how far was the town from this harbour  quite close macumazana  now brother john asked a question  did you hear anything about the land beyond the water by the cave  yes dogeetah i heard then or afterwardsfor from time to time rumours reach us concerning these pongothat it is an island where grows the holy flower of which you know for when last you were here you had one of its blooms i heard too that this holy flower was tended by a priestess named mother of the flower and her servants all of whom were virgins  who was the priestess  i do not know but i heave heard that she was one of those people who although their parents are black are born white and that if any females among the pongo are born white or with pink eyes or deaf and dumb they are set apart to be the servants of the priestess but this priestess must now be dead seeing that when i was a boy she was already old very very old and the pongo were much concerned because there was no one of white skin who could be appointed to succeed her indeed she is dead since many years ago there was a great feast in pongoland and numbers of slaves were eaten because the priests had found a beautiful new princess who was white with yellow hair and had fingernails of the right shape  now i bethought me that this finding of the priestess named mother of the flower who must be distinguished by certain personal peculiarities resembled not a little that of the finding of the apis bullgod which also must have certain prescribed and holy markings by the old egyptians as narrated by herodotus however i said nothing about it at the time because brother john asked sharply  and is this priestess also dead  i do not know dogeetah but i think not if she were dead i think that we should have heard some rumour of the feast of the eating of the dead mother  eating the dead mother i exclaimed  yes macumazana it is the law among the pongo that for a certain sacred reason the body of the mother of the flower when she dies must be partaken of by those who are privileged to the holy food  but the white devil neither dies nor is eaten i said  no as i have told you he never dies it is he who causes others to die as if you go to pongoland doubtless you will find out babemba added grimly  upon my word thought i to myself as the meeting broke up because babemba had nothing more to say if i had my way i would leave pongoland and its white devil alone then i remembered how brother john stood in reference to this matter and with a sigh resigned myself to fate as it proved it i mean fate was quite equal to the occasion the very next morning early babemba turned up again  lords lords he said a wonderful thing has happened last night we spoke of the pongo and now behold an embassy from the pongo is here it arrived at sunrise  what for i asked  to propose peace between their people and the mazitu yes they ask that bausi should send envoys to their town to arrange a lasting peace as if anyone would go he added  perhaps some might dare to i answered for an idea occurred to me but let us go to see bausi  half an hour later we were seated in the kings enclosure that is stephen and i were for brother john was already in the royal hut talking to bausi as we went a few words had passed between us  has it occurred to you john i asked that if you really wish to visit pongoland here is perhaps what you would call a providential opportunity certainly none of these mazitu will go since they fear lest they should find a permanent peaceinside of the pongo well you are a bloodbrother to bausi and can offer to play the part of envoy extraordinary with us as the members of your staff  i have already thought of it allan he replied stroking his long beard  we sat down among a few of the leading councillors and presently bausi came out of his hut accompanied by brother john and having greeted us ordered the pongo envoys to be admitted they were led in at once tall lightcoloured men with regular and semitic features who were clothed in white linen like arabs and wore circles of gold or copper upon their necks and wrists  in short they were imposing persons quite different from ordinary central african natives though there was something about their appearance which chilled and repelled me i should add that their spears had been left outside and that they saluted the king by folding their arms upon their breasts and bowing in a dignified fashion  who are you asked bausi and what do you want  i am komba answered their spokesman quite a young man with flashing eyes the acceptedofthegods who in a day to come that perhaps is near will be the kalubi of the pongo people and these are my servants i have come here bearing gifts of friendship which are without by the desire of the holy motombo the high priest of the gods  i thought that the kalubi was the priest of your gods interrupted bausi  not so the kalubi is the king of the pongo as you are the king of the mazitu the motombo who is seldom seen is king of the spirits and the mouth of the gods  bausi nodded in the african fashion that is by raising the chin not depressing it and komba went on  i have placed myself in your power trusting to your honour you can kill me if you wish though that will avail nothing since there are others waiting to become kalubi in my place  am i a pongo that i should wish to kill messengers and eat them asked bausi with sarcasm a speech at which i noticed the pongo envoys winced a little  king you are mistaken the pongo only eat those whom the white god has chosen it is a religious rite why should they who have cattle in plenty desire to devour men  i dont know grunted bausi but there is one here who can tell a different story and he looked at babemba who wriggled uncomfortably  komba also looked at him with his fierce eyes  it is not conceivable he said that anybody should wish to eat one so old and bony but let that pass i thank you king for your promise of safety i have come here to ask that you should send envoys to confer with the kalubi and the motombo that a lasting peace may be arranged between our peoples  why do not the kalubi and the motombo come here to confer asked bausi  because it is not lawful that they should leave their land o king therefore they have sent me who am the kalubitocome hearken there has been war between us for generations it began so long ago that only the motombo knows of its beginning which he has from the gods once the pongo people owned all this land and only had their sacred places beyond the water then your forefathers came and fell on them killing many enslaving many and taking their women to wife now say the motombo and the kalubi in the place of war let there be peace where there is but barren sand there let corn and flowers grow let the darkness wherein men lose their way and die be changed to pleasant light in which they can sit in the sun holding each others hands  hear hear i muttered quite moved by this eloquence but bausi was not at all moved indeed he seemed to view these poetic proposals with the darkest suspicion  give up killing our people or capturing them to be sacrificed to your white devil and then in a year or two we may listen to your words that are smeared with honey he said as it is we think that they are but a trap to catch flies still if there are any of our councillors willing to visit your motombo and your kalubi and hear what they have to propose taking the risk of whatever may happen to them there i do not forbid it now o my councillors speak not altogether but one by one and be swift since to the first that speaks shall be given this honour  i think i never heard a denser silence than that which followed this invitation each of the indunas looked at his neighbour but not one of them uttered a single word  what exclaimed bausi in affected surprise do none speak well well you are lawyers and men of peace what says the great general babemba  i say o king that i went once to pongoland when i was young taken by the hair of my head to leave an eye there and that i do not wish to visit it again walking on the soles of my feet  it seems o komba that since none of my people are willing to act as envoys if there is to be talk of peace between us the motombo and the kalubi must come here under safe conduct  i have said that cannot be o king  if so all is finished o komba rest eat of our food and return to your own land  then brother john rose and said  we are bloodbrethren bausi and therefore i can speak for you if you and your councillors are willing and these pongos are willing i and my friends do not fear to visit the motombo and the kalubi to talk with them of peace on behalf of your people since we love to see new lands and new races of mankind say komba if the king allows will you accept us as ambassadors  it is for the king to name his own ambassadors answered komba yet the kalubi has heard of the presence of you white lords in mazituland and bade me say that if it should be your pleasure to accompany the embassy and visit him he would give you welcome only when the matter was laid before the motombo the oracle spoke thus  let the white men come if come they will or let them stay away but if they come let them bring with them none of those iron tubes great or small whereof the land has heard that vomit smoke with a noise and cause death from afar they will not need them to kill meat for meat shall be given to them in plenty moreover among the pongo they will be safe unless they offer insult to the god  these words komba spoke very slowly and with much emphasis his piercing eyes fixed upon my face as though to read the thoughts it hid as i heard them my courage sank into my boots well i knew that the kalubi was asking us to pongoland that we might kill this great white devil that threatened his life which i took it was a monstrous ape and how could we face that or some other frightful brute without firearms my mind was made up in a minute  o komba i said my gun is my father my mother my wife and all my other relatives i do not stir from here without it  then white lord answered komba you will do well to stop in this place in the midst of your family since if you try to bring it with you to pongoland you will be killed as you set foot upon the shore  before i could find an answer brother john spoke saying  it is natural that the great hunter macumazana should not wish to be parted from what which to him is as a stick to a lame man but with me it is different for years i have used no gun who kill nothing that god made except a few brightwinged insects i am ready to visit your country with naught save this in my hand and he pointed to the butterfly net that leaned against the fence behind him  good you are welcome said komba and i thought that i saw his eyes gleam with unholy joy there followed a pause during which i explained everything to stephen showing that the thing was madness but here to my horror that young mans mulish obstinacy came in  i say you know quatermain he said we cant let the old boy go alone or at least i cant its another matter for you who have a son dependent on you but putting aside the fact that i mean to get he was about to add the orchid when i nudged him of course it was ridiculous but an uneasy fear took me lest this komba should in some mysterious way understand what he was saying whats up oh i see but the beggar cant understand english well putting aside everything else it isnt the game and there you are you know if mr brother john goes ill go too and indeed if he doesnt go ill go alone  you unutterable young ass i muttered in a stage aside  what is it the young white lord says he wishes in our country asked the cold komba who with diabolical acuteness had read some of stephens meaning in his face  he says that he is a harmless traveller who would like to study the scenery and to find out if you have any gold there i answered  indeed well he shall study the scenery and we have gold and he touched the bracelets on his arm of which he shall be given as much as he can carry away but perchance white lords you would wish to talk this matter over alone have we your leave to withdraw a while o king  five minutes later we were seated in the kings great house with bausi himself and babemba here there was a mighty argument bausi implored brother john not to go and so did i babemba said that to go would be madness as he smelt witchcraft and murder in the air he who knew the pongo  brother john replied sweetly that he certainly intended to avail himself of this heavensent opportunity to visit one of the few remaining districts in this part of africa through which he had not yet wandered stephen yawned and fanned himself with a pockethandkerchief for the hut was hot and remarked that having come so far after a certain rare flower he did not mean to return emptyhanded  i perceive dogeetah said bausi at last that you have some reason for this journey which you are hiding from me still i am minded to hold you here by force  if you do it will break our brotherhood answered brother john seek not to know what i would hide bausi but wait till the future shall declare it  bausi groaned and gave in babemba said that dogeetah and wazela were bewitched and that i macumazana alone retained my senses  then thats settled exclaimed stephen john and i are to go as envoys to the pongo and you quatermain will stop here to look after the hunters and the stores  young man i replied do you wish to insult me after your father put you in my charge too if you two are going i shall come also if i have to do so mothernaked but let me tell you once and for all in the most emphatic language i can command that i consider you a brace of confounded lunatics and that if the pongo dont eat you it will be more than you deserve to think that at my age i should be dragged among a lot of cannibal savages without even a pistol to fight some unknown brute with my bare hands well we can only die oncethat is so far as we know at present  how true remarked stephen how strangely and profoundly true  oh i could have boxed his ears  we went into the courtyard again whither komba was summoned with his attendants this time they came bearing gifts or having them borne for them these consisted i remember of two fine tusks of ivory which suggested to me that their country could not be entirely surrounded by water since elephants would scarcely live upon an island gold dust in a gourd and copper bracelets which showed that it was mineralized white native linen very well woven and some really beautiful decorated pots indicating that the people had artistic tastes where did they get them from i wonder and what was the origin of their race i cannot answer the question for i never found out with any certainty nor do i think they knew themselves  the indaba was resumed bausi announced that we three white men with a servant apiece i stipulated for this would visit pongoland as his envoys taking no firearms with us there to discuss terms of peace between the two peoples and especially the questions of trade and intermarriage komba was very insistent that this should be included at the time i wondered why he komba on behalf of the motombo and the kalubi the spiritual and temporal rulers of his land guaranteed us safe conduct on the understanding that we attempted no insult or violence to the gods a stipulation from which there was no escape though i liked it little he swore also that we should be delivered safe and sound in the mazitu country within six days of our having left its shores  bausi said that it was good adding that he would send five hundred armed men to escort us to the place where we were to embark and to receive us on our return also that if any hurt came to us he would wage war upon the pongo people for ever until he found means to destroy them  so we parted it being agreed that we were to start upon our journey on the following morning     chapter xiii                                rica town  as a matter of fact we did not leave beza town till twentyfour hours later than had been arranged since it took some time for old babemba who was to be in charge of it to collect and provision our escort of five hundred men  here i may mention that when we got back to our huts we found the two mazitu bearers tom and jerry eating a hearty meal but looking rather tired it appeared that in order to get rid of their favourable evidence the ceased witchdoctor imbozwi who for some reason or other had feared to kill them caused them to be marched off to a distant part of the land where they were imprisoned on the arrival of the news of the fall and death of imbozwi and his subordinates they were set at liberty and at once returned to us at beza town  of course it became necessary to explain to our servants what we were about to do when they understood the nature of our proposed expedition they shook their heads and when they learned that we had promised to leave our guns behind us they were speechless with amazement  kransick kransick which means ill in the skull or mad exclaimed hans to the others as he tapped his forehead significantly they have caught it from dogeetah one who lives on insects which he entangles in a net and carries no gun to kill game well i knew they would  the hunters nodded in assent and sammy lifted his arms to heaven as though in prayer only mavovo seemed indifferent then came the question of which of them was to accompany us  so far as i am concerned that is soon settled said mavovo i go with my father macumazana seeing that even without a gun i am still strong and can fight as my male ancestors fought with a spear  and i too go with the baas quatermain grunted hans seeing that even without a gun i am cunning as my female ancestors were before me  except when you take medicine spotted snake and lose yourself in the mist of sleep mocked one of the zulus does that fine bedstead which the king sent you go with you  no son of a fool answered hans ill lend it to you who do not understand that there is more wisdom within me when i am asleep than there is in you when you are awake  it remained to be decided who the third man should be as neither of brother johns two servants who had accompanied him on his crosscountry journey was suitable one being ill and the other afraid stephen suggested sammy as the man chiefly because he could cook  no mr somers no said sammy with earnestness at this proposal i draw the thick rope to ask one who can cook to visit a land where he will be cooked is to seethe the offspring in its parents milk  so we gave him up and after some discussion fixed upon jerry a smart and plucky fellow who was quite willing to accompany us the rest of that day we spent in making our preparations which if simple required a good deal of thought to my annoyance at the time i wanted to find hans to help me he was not forthcoming when at length he appeared i asked him where he had been he answered to cut himself a stick in the forest as he understood we should have to walk a long way also he showed me the stick a long thick staff of a hard and beautiful kind of bamboo which grows in mazituland  what do you want that clumsy thing for i said when there are plenty of sticks about  new journey new stick baas also this kind of wood is full of air and might help me to float if we are upset into the water  what an idea i exclaimed and dismissed the matter from my mind  at dawn on the following day we started stephen and i riding on the two donkeys which were now fat and lusty and brother john upon his white ox a most docile beast that was quite attached to him all the hunters fully armed came with us to the borders of the mazitu country where they were to await our return in company with the mazitu regiment the king himself went with us to the west gate of the town where he bade us all and especially brother john an affectionate farewell moreover he sent for komba and his attendants and again swore to him that if any harm happened to us he would not rest till he had found a way to destroy the pongo root and branch  have no fear answered the cold komba in our holy town of rica we do not tie innocent guests to stakes to be shot to death with arrows  the repartee which was undoubtedly neat irritated bausi who was not fond of allusions to this subject  if the white men are so safe why do you not let them take their guns with them he asked somewhat illogically  if we meant evil king would their guns help them they being but few among so many for instance could we not steal them as you did when you plotted the murder of these white lords it is a law among the pongo that no such magic weapon shall be allowed to enter their land  why i asked to change the conversation for i saw that bausi was growing very wrath and feared complications  because my lord macumazana there is a prophecy among us that when a gun is fired in pongoland its gods will desert us and the motombo who is their priest will die that saying is very old but until a little while ago none knew what it meant since it spoke of a hollow spear that smoked and such a weapon was not known to us  indeed i said mourning within myself that we should not be in a position to bring about the fulfilment of that prophecy which as hans said shaking his head sadly was a great pity a very great pity  three days march over country that gradually sloped downwards from the high tableland on which stood beza town brought us to the lake called kirua a word which i believe means the place of the island of the lake itself we could see nothing because of the dense brake of tall reeds which grew out into the shallow water for quite a mile from the shore and was only pierced here and there with paths made by the hippopotami when they came to the mainland at night to feed from a high mound which looked exactly like a tumulus and for aught i know may have been one however the blue waters beyond were visible and in the far distance what looked at through glasses appeared to be a treeclad mountain top i asked komba what it might be and he answered that it was the home of the gods in pongoland  what gods i asked again whereon he replied like a black herodotus that of these it was not lawful to speak  i have rarely met anyone more difficult to pump than that frigid and unafrican komba  on the top of this mound we planted the union jack fixed to the tallest pole that we could find komba asked suspiciously why we did so and as i was determined to show this unsympathetic person that there were others as unpumpable as himself i replied that it was the god of our tribe which we set up there to be worshipped and that anyone who tried to insult or injure it would certainly die as the witchdoctor imbozwi and his children had found out for once komba seemed a little impressed and even bowed to the bunting as he passed by  what i did not inform him was that we had set the flag there to be a sign and a beacon to us in case we should ever be forced to find our way back to this place unguided and in a hurry as a matter of fact this piece of forethought which oddly enough originated with the most reckless of our party stephen proved our salvation as i shall tell later on at the foot of the mound we set our camp for the night the mazitu soldiers under babemba who did not mind mosquitoes making theirs nearer to the lake just opposite to where a wide hippopotamus lane pierced the reeds leaving a little canal of clear water  i asked komba when and how we were to cross the lake he said that we must start at dawn on the following morning when at this time of the year the wind generally blew off shore and that if the weather were favourable we should reach the pongo town of rica by nightfall as to how we were to do this he would show me if i cared to follow him i nodded and he led me four or five hundred yards along the edge of the reeds in a southerly direction  as we went two things happened the first of these was that a very large black rhinoceros which was sleeping in some bushes suddenly got our wind and after the fashion of these beasts charged down on us from about fifty yards away now i was carrying a heavy singlebarrelled rifle for as yet we and our weapons were not parted on came the rhinoceros and komba small blame to him for he only had a spear started to run i cocked the rifle and waited my chance  when it was not more than fifteen paces away the rhinoceros threw up its head at which of course it was useless to fire because of the horn and i let drive at the throat the bullet hit it fair and i suppose penetrated to the heart at any rate it rolled over and over like a shot rabbit and with a single stretch of its limbs expired almost at my feet  komba was much impressed he returned he stared at the dead rhinoceros and at the hole in its throat he stared at me he stared at the still smoking rifle  the great beast of the plains killed with a noise he muttered killed in an instant by this little monkey of a white man i thanked him for that and made a note of it and his magic oh the motombo was wise when he commanded and with an effort he stopped  well friend what is the matter i asked you see there was no need for you to run if you had stepped behind me you would have been as safe as you are nowafter running  it is so lord macumazana but the thing is strange to me forgive me if i do not understand  oh i forgive you my lord kalubithat isto be it is clear that you have a good deal to learn in pongoland  yes my lord macumazana and so perhaps have you he replied dryly having by this time recovered his nerve and sarcastic powers  then after telling mavovo who appeared mysteriously at the sound of the shoti think he was stalking us in case of accidentsto fetch men to cut up the rhinoceros komba and i proceeded on our walk  a little further on just by the edge of the reeds i caught sight of a narrow oblong trench dug in a patch of stony soil and of a rusted mustard tin halfhidden by some scanty vegetation  what is that i asked in seeming astonishment though i knew well what it must be  oh replied komba who evidently was not yet quite himself that is where the white lord dogeetah bausis bloodbrother set his little canvas house when he was here over twelve moons ago  really i exclaimed he never told me he was here this was a lie but somehow i was not afraid of lying to komba how do you know that he was here  one of our people who was fishing in the reeds saw him  oh that explains it komba but what an odd place for him to fish in so far from home and i wonder what he was fishing for when you have time komba you must explain to me what it is that you catch amidst the roots of thick reeds in such shallow water  komba replied that he would do so with pleasurewhen he had time then as though to avoid further conversation he ran forward and thrusting the reeds apart showed me a great canoe big enough to hold thirty or forty men which with infinite labour had been hollowed out of the trunk of a single huge tree this canoe differed from the majority of those that personally i have seen used on african lakes and rivers in that it was fitted for a mast now unshipped i looked at it and said it was a fine boat whereon komba replied that there were a hundred such at rica town though not all of them were so large  ah thought i to myself as we walked back to the camp then allowing an average of twenty to a canoe the pongo tribe number about two thousand males old enough to paddle an estimate which turned out to be singularly correct  next morning at dawn we started with some difficulty to begin with in the middle of the night old babemba came to the canvas shelter under which i was sleeping woke me up and in a long speech implored me not to go he said he was convinced that the pongo intended foul play of some sort and that all this talk of peace was a mere trick to entrap us white men into the country probably in order to sacrifice us to its gods for a religious reason  i answered that i quite agreed with him but that as my companions insisted upon making this journey i could not desert them all that i could do was to beg him to keep a sharp lookout so that he might be able to help us in case we got into trouble  here i will stay and watch for you lord macumazana he answered but if you fall into a snare am i able to swim through the water like a fish or to fly through the air like a bird to free you  after he had gone one of the zulu hunters arrived a man named ganza a sort of lieutenant to mavovo and sang the same song he said that it was not right that i should go without guns to die among devils and leave him and his companions wandering alone in a strange land  i answered that i was much of the same opinion but that dogeetah insisted upon going and that i had no choice  then let us kill dogeetah or at any rate tie him up so that he can do no more mischief in his madness ganza suggested blandly whereon i turned him out  lastly sammy arrived and said  mr quatermain before you plunge into this deep well of foolishness i beg that you will consider your responsibilities to god and man and especially to us your household who are now but lost sheep far from home and further that you will remember that if anything disagreeable should overtake you you are indebted to me to the extent of two months wages which will probably prove unrecoverable  i produced a little leather bag from a tin box and counted out to sammy the wages due to him also those for three months in advance  to my astonishment he began to weep sir he said i do not seek filthy lucre what i mean is that i am afraid you will be killed by these pongo and alas although i love you sir i am too great a coward to come and be killed with you for god made me like that i pray you not to go mr quatermain because i repeat i love you sir  i believe you do my good fellow i answered and i also am afraid of being killed who only seem to be brave because i must however i hope we shall come through all right meanwhile i am going to give this box and all the gold in it of which there is a great deal into your charge sammy trusting to you if anything happens to us to get it safe back to durban if you can  oh mr quatermain he exclaimed i am indeed honoured especially as you know that once i was in jail forembezzlementwith extenuating circumstances mr quatermain i tell you that although i am a coward i will die before anyone gets his fingers into that box  i am sure that you will sammy my boy i said but i hope although things look queer that none of us will be called upon to die just yet    the morning came at last and the six of us marched down to the canoe which had been brought round to the open waterway here we had to undergo a kind of customshouse examination at the hands of komba and his companions who seemed terrified lest we should be smuggling firearms  you know what rifles are like i said indignantly can you see any in our hands moreover i give you my word that we have none  komba bowed politely but suggested that perhaps some little guns by which he meant pistols remained in our baggageby accident komba was a most suspicious person  undo all the loads i said to hans who obeyed with an enthusiasm which i confess struck me as suspicious  knowing his secretive and tortuous nature this sudden zeal for openness seemed almost unnatural he began by unrolling his own blanket inside of which appeared a miscellaneous collection of articles i remember among them a spare pair of very dirty trousers a battered tin cup a wooden spoon such as kaffirs use to eat their scoff with a bottle full of some doubtful compound sundry roots and other native medicines an old pipe i had given him and last but not least a huge head of yellow tobacco in the leaf of a kind that the mazitu like the pongos cultivate to some extent  what on earth do you want so much tobacco for hans i asked  for us three black people to smoke baas or to take as snuff or to chew perhaps where we are going we may find little to eat and then tobacco is a food on which one can live for days also it brings sleep at nights  oh that will do i said fearing lest hans like a second walter raleigh was about to deliver a long lecture upon the virtue of tobacco  there is no need for the yellow man to take this weed to our land interrupted komba for there we have plenty why does he cumber himself with the stuff and he stretched out his hand idly as though to take hold of and examine it closely  at this moment however mavovo called attention to his bundle which he had undone whether on purpose or by accident i do not know and forgetting the tobacco komba turned to attend to him with a marvellous celerity hans rolled up his blanket again in less than a minute the lashings were fast and it was hanging on his back again suspicion took me but an argument which had sprung up between brother john and komba about the formers butterfly net which komba suspected of being a new kind of gun or at least a magical instrument of a dangerous sort attracted my notice after this dispute another arose over a common garden trowel that stephen had thought fit to bring with him komba asked what it was for stephen replied through brother john that it was to dig up flowers  flowers said komba one of our gods is a flower does the white lord wish to dig up our god  of course this was exactly what stephen did desire to do but not unnaturally he kept the fact to himself the squabble grew so hot that finally i announced that if our little belongings were treated with so much suspicion it might be better that we should give up the journey altogether  we have passed our word that we have no firearms i said in the most dignified manner that i could command and that should be enough for you o komba  then komba after consultation with his companions gave way evidently he was anxious that we should visit pongoland  so at last we started we three white men and our servants seated ourselves in the stern of the canoe on grass cushions that had been provided komba went to the bows and his people taking the broad paddles rowed and pushed the boat along the waterway made by the hippopotami through the tall and matted reeds from which ducks and other fowl rose in multitudes with a sound like thunder a quarter of an hour or so of paddling through these weedencumbered shallows brought us to the deep and open lake here on the edge of the reeds a tall pole that served as a mast was shipped and a square sail made of closelywoven mats run up it filled with the morning offland breeze and presently we were bowling along at a rate of quite eight miles the hour the shore grew dim behind us but for a long while above the clinging mists i could see the flag that we had planted on the mound by degrees it dwindled till it became a mere speck and vanished as it grew smaller my spirits sank and when it was quite gone i felt very low indeed  another of your fools errands allan my boy i said to myself i wonder how many more you are destined to survive  the others too did not seem in the best of spirits brother john stared at the horizon his lips moving as though he were engaged in prayer and even stephen was temporarily depressed jerry had fallen asleep as a native generally does when it is warm and he has nothing to do mavovo looked very thoughtful i wondered whether he had been consulting his snake again but did not ask him since the episode of our escape from execution by bow and arrow i had grown somewhat afraid of that unholy reptile next time it might foretell our immediate doom and if it did i knew that i should believe  as for hans he looked much disturbed and was engaged in wildly hunting for something in the flap pockets of an antique corduroy waistcoat which from its general appearance must i imagine years ago have adorned the person of a british gamekeeper  three i heard him mutter by my great grandfathers spirit only three left  three what i asked in dutch  three charms baas and there ought to have been quite twentyfour the rest have fallen out through a hole that the devil himself made in this rotten stuff now we shall not die of hunger and we shall not be shot and we shall not be drowned at least none of those things will happen to me but there are twentyone other things that may finish us as i have lost the charms to ward them off thus  oh stop your rubbish i said and fell again into the depths of my uncomfortable reflections after this i too went to sleep when i woke it was past midday and the wind was falling however it held while we ate some food we had brought with us after which it died away altogether and the pongo people took to their paddles at my suggestion we offered to help them for it occurred to me that we might just as well learn how to manage these paddles so six were given to us and komba who now i noted was beginning to speak in a somewhat imperious tone instructed us in their use at first we made but a poor hand at the business but three or four hours steady practice taught us a good deal indeed before our journeys end i felt that we should be quite capable of managing a canoe if ever it became necessary for us to do so  by three in the afternoon the shores of the island we were approachingif it really was an island a point that i never cleared upwere well in sight the mountain top that stood some miles inland having been visible for hours in fact through my glasses i had been able to make out its configuration almost from the beginning of the voyage about five we entered the mouth of a deep bay fringed on either side with forests in which were cultivated clearings with small villages of the ordinary african stamp i observed from the smaller size of the trees adjacent to these clearings that much more land had once been under cultivation here probably within the last century and asked komba why this was so  he answered in an enigmatic sentence which impressed me so much that i find i entered it verbatim in my notebook  when man dies corn dies man is corn and corn is man  under this entry i see that i wrote compare the saying bread is the staff of life  i could not get any more out of him evidently he referred however to a condition of shrinking in the population a circumstance which he did not care to discuss  after the first few miles the bay narrowed sharply and at its end came to a point where a stream of no great breadth fell into it on either side of this stream that was roughly bridged in many places stood the town of rica it consisted of a great number of large huts roofed with palm leaves and constructed apparently of whitewashed clay or rather as we discovered afterwards of lake mud mixed with chopped straw or grass  reaching a kind of wharf which was protected from erosion by piles formed of small trees driven into the mud to which were tied a fleet of canoes we landed just as the sun was beginning to sink our approach had doubtless been observed for as we drew near the wharf a horn was blown by someone on the shore whereon a considerable number of men appeared i suppose out of the huts and assisted to make the canoe fast i noted that these all resembled komba and his companions in build and features they were so like each other that except for the difference of their ages it was difficult to tell them apart they might all have been members of one family indeed this was practically the case owing to constant intermarriage carried on for generations  there was something in the appearance of these tall cold sharpfeatured whiterobed men that chilled my blood something unnatural and almost inhuman here was nothing of the usual african jollity no one shouted no one laughed or chattered no one crowded on us trying to handle our persons or clothes no one appeared afraid or even astonished except for a word or two they were silent merely contemplating us in a chilling and distant fashion as though the arrival of three white men in a country where before no white man had ever set foot were an everyday occurrence  moreover our personal appearance did not seem to impress them for they smiled faintly at brother johns long beard and at my stubbly hair pointing these out to each other with their slender fingers or with the handles of their big spears i remarked that they never used the blade of the spear for this purpose perhaps because they thought that we might take this for a hostile or even a warlike demonstration it is humiliating to have to add that the only one of our company who seemed to move them to wonder or interest was hans his extremely ugly and wrinkled countenance it was clear did appeal to them to some extent perhaps because they had never seen anything in the least like it before or perhaps for another reason which the reader may guess in due course  at any rate i heard one of them pointing to hans ask komba whether the apeman was our god or only our captain the compliment seemed to please hans who hitherto had never been looked on either as a god or a captain but the rest of us were not flattered indeed mavovo was indignant and told hans outright that if he heard any more such talk he would beat him before these people to show them that he was neither a captain nor a god  wait till i claim to be either o butcher of a zulu before you threaten to treat me thus ejaculated hans indignantly then he added with his peculiar hottentot snigger still it is true that before all the meat is eaten ie before all is done you may think me both a dark saying which at the time we did not understand  when we had landed and collected our belongings komba told us to follow him and led us up a wide street that was very tidily kept and bordered on either side by the large huts whereof i have spoken each of these huts stood in a fenced garden of its own a thing i have rarely seen elsewhere in africa the result of this arrangement was that although as a matter of fact it had but a comparatively small population the area covered by rica was very great the town by the way was not surrounded with any wall or other fortification which showed that the inhabitants feared no attack the waters of the lake were their defence  for the rest the chief characteristic of this place was the silence that brooded there apparently they kept no dogs for none barked and no poultry for i never heard a cock crow in pongoland cattle and native sheep they had in abundance but as they did not fear any enemy these were pastured outside the town their milk and meat being brought in as required a considerable number of people were gathered to observe us not in a crowd but in little family groups which collected separately at the gates of the gardens  for the most part these consisted of a man and one or more wives finely formed and handsome women sometimes they had children with them but these were very few the most i saw with any one family was three and many seemed to possess none at all both the women and the children like the men were decently clothed in long white garments another peculiarity which showed that these natives were no ordinary african savages  oh i can see rica town now after all these many years the wide street swept and garnished the brownroofed whitewalled huts in their fertile irrigated gardens the tall silent folk the smoke from the cooking fires rising straight as a line in the still air the graceful palms and other tropical trees and at the head of the street far away to the north the rounded towering shape of the forestclad mountain that was called house of the gods often that vision comes back to me in my sleep or at times in my waking hours when some heavy odour reminds me of the overpowering scent of the great trumpetlike blooms which hung in profusion upon broadleaved bushes that were planted in almost every garden  on we marched till at last we reached a tall live fence that was covered with brilliant scarlet flowers arriving at its gate just as the last red glow of day faded from the sky and night began to fall komba pushed open the gate revealing a scene that none of us are likely to forget the fence enclosed about an acre of ground of which the back part was occupied by two large huts standing in the usual gardens  in front of these not more than fifteen paces from the gate stood another building of a totally different character it was about fifty feet in length by thirty broad and consisted only of a roof supported upon carved pillars of wood the spaces between the pillars being filled with grass mats or blinds most of these blinds were pulled down but four exactly opposite the gate were open inside the shed forty or fifty men who wore white robes and peculiar caps and who were engaged in chanting a dreadful melancholy song were gathered on three sides of a huge fire that burned in a pit in the ground on the fourth side that facing the gate a man stood alone with his arms outstretched and his back towards us  of a sudden he heard our footsteps and turned round springing to the left so that the light might fall on us now we saw by the glow of the great fire that over it was an iron grid not unlike a small bedstead and that on this grid lay some fearful object stephen who was a little ahead stared then exclaimed in a horrified voice  my god it is a woman  in another second the blinds fell down hiding everything and the singing ceased     chapter xiv                            the kalubis oath  be silent i whispered and all understood my tone if they did not catch the words then steadying myself with an effort for this hideous vision which might have been a picture from hell made me feel faint i glanced at komba who was a pace or two in front of us evidently he was much disturbedthe motions of his back told me thisby the sense of some terrible mistake that he had made for a moment he stood still then wheeled round and asked me if we had seen anything  yes i answered indifferently we saw a number of men gathered round a fire nothing more  he tried to search our faces but luckily the great moon now almost at her full was hidden behind a thick cloud so that he could not read them well i heard him sigh in relief as he said  the kalubi and the head men are cooking a sheep it is their custom to feast together on those nights when the moon is about to change follow me white lords  then he led us round the end of the long shed at which we did not even look and through the garden on its farther side to the two fine huts i have mentioned here he clapped his hands and a woman appeared i know not whence to her he whispered something she went away and presently returned with four or five other women who carried clay lamps filled with oil in which floated a wick of palm fibre these lamps were set down in the huts that proved to be very clean and comfortable places furnished after a fashion with wooden stools and a kind of low table of which the legs were carved to the shape of antelopes feet also there was a wooden platform at the end of the hut whereon lay beds covered with mats and stuffed with some soft fibre  here you may rest safe he said for white lords are you not the honoured guests of the pongo people presently food i shuddered at the word will be brought to you and after you have eaten well if it is your pleasure the kalubi and his councillors will receive you in yonder feasthouse and you can talk with them before you sleep if you need aught strike upon that jar with a stick and he pointed to what looked like a copper cauldron that stood in the garden of the hut near the place where the women were already lighting a fire and some will wait on you look here are your goods none are missing and here comes water in which you may wash now i must go to make report to the kalubi and with a courteous bow he departed  so after a while did the silent handsome womento fetch our meal i understood one of them to say and at length we were alone  my aunt said stephen fanning himself with his pockethandkerchief did you see that lady toasting i have often heard of cannibals those slaves for instance but the actual business oh my aunt  it is no use addressing your absent auntif you have got one what did you expect if you would insist on coming to a hell like this i asked gloomily  cant say old fellow dont trouble myself much with expectations as a rule thats why i and my poor old father never could get on i always quoted the text sufficient to the day is the evil thereof to him until at length he sent for the family bible and ruled it out with red ink in a rage but i say do you think that we shall be called upon to understudy st lawrence on that grid  certainly i do i replied and as old babemba warned you you cant complain  oh but i will and i can and so will you wont you brother john  brother john woke up from a reverie and stroked his long beard  since you ask me mr somers he said reflectively if it were a case of martyrdom for the faith like that of the saint to whom you have alluded i should not objectat any rate in theory but i confess that speaking from a secular point of view i have the strongest dislike to being cooked and eaten by these very disagreeable savages still i see no reason to suppose that we shall fall victims to their domestic customs  i being in a depressed mood was about to argue to the contrary when hans poked his head into the hut and said  dinner coming baas very fine dinner  so we went out into the garden where the tall impassive ladies were arranging many wooden dishes on the ground now the moon was clear of clouds and by its brilliant light we examined their contents some were cooked meat covered with a kind of sauce that made its nature indistinguishable as a matter of fact i believe it was mutton butwho could say others were evidently of a vegetable nature for instance there was a whole platter full of roasted mealie cobs and a great boiled pumpkin to say nothing of some bowls of curdled milk regarding this feast i became aware of a sudden and complete conversion to those principles of vegetarianism which brother john was always preaching to me  i am sure you are quite right i said to him nervously in holding that vegetables are the best diet in a hot climate at any rate i have made up my mind to try the experiment for a few days and throwing manners to the winds i grabbed four of the upper mealie cobs and the top of the pumpkin which i cut off with a knife somehow i did not seem to fancy that portion of it which touched the platter for who knew what those dishes might have contained and how often they were washed  stephen also appeared to have found salvation on this point for he too patronized the mealie cobs and the pumpkin so did mavovo and so did even that inveterate meateater hans only the simple jerry tackled the fleshpots of egypt or rather of pongoland with appetite and declared that they were good i think that he being the last of us through the gateway had not realized what it was which lay upon the grid  at length we finished our simple mealwhen you are very hungry it takes a long time to fill oneself with squashy pumpkin which is why i suppose ruminants and other grazing animals always seem to be eatingand washed it down with water in preference to the stickylooking milk which we left to the natives  allan said brother john to me in a low voice as we lit our pipes that man who stood with his back to us in front of the gridiron was the kalubi against the firelight i saw the gap in his hand where i cut away the finger  well if we want to get any further you must cultivate him i answered but the question is shall we get further thanthat grid i believe we have been trapped here to be eaten  before brother john could reply komba arrived and after inquiring whether our appetites had been good intimated that the kalubi and head men were ready to receive us so off we went with the exception of jerry whom we left to watch our things taking with us the presents we had prepared  komba led us to the feasthouse where the fire in the pit was out or had been covered over and the grid and its horrible burden had disappeared also now all the mats were rolled up so that the clear moonlight flowed into and illuminated the place seated in a semicircle on wooden stools with their faces towards the gateway were the kalubi who occupied the centre and eight councillors all of them greyhaired men this kalubi was a tall thin individual of middle age with i think the most nervous countenance that i ever saw his features twitched continually and his hands were never still the eyes too as far as i could see them in that light were full of terrors  he rose and bowed but the councillors remained seated greeting us with a longcontinued and soft clapping of the hands which it seemed was the pongo method of salute  we bowed in answer then seated ourselves on three stools that had been placed for us brother john occupying the middle stool mavovo and hans stood behind us the latter supporting himself with his large bamboo stick as soon as these preliminaries were over the kalubi called upon komba whom he addressed in formal language as youwhohavepassedthegod and youthekalubitobe i thought i saw him wince as he said these words to give an account of his mission and of how it came about that they had the honour of seeing the white lords there  komba obeyed after addressing the kalubi with every possible title of honour such as absolute monarch master whose feet i kiss he whose eyes are fire and whose tongue is a sword he at whose nod people die lord of the sacrifice first taster of the sacred meat beloved of the gods here the kalubi shrank as though he had been pricked with a spear second to none on earth save the motombo the most holy the most ancient who comes from heaven and speaks with the voice of heaven etc etc he gave a clear but brief account of all that had happened in the course of his mission to beza town  especially did he narrate how in obedience to a message which he had received from the motombo he had invited the white lords to pongoland and even accepted them as envoys from the mazitu when none would respond to king bausis invitation to fill that office only he had stipulated that they should bring with them none of their magic weapons which vomited out smoke and death as the motombo had commanded at this information the expressive countenance of the kalubi once more betrayed mental disturbance that i think komba noted as much as we did however he said nothing and after a pause komba went on to explain that no such weapons had been brought since not satisfied with our word that this was so he and his companions had searched our baggage before we left mazituland  therefore he added there was no cause to fear that we should bring about the fulfilment of the old prophecy that when a gun was fired among the pongo the gods would desert the land and the people cease to be a people  having finished his speech he sat down in a humble place behind us then the kalubi after formally accepting us as ambassadors from bausi king of the mazitu discoursed at length upon the advantages which would result to both peoples from a lasting peace between them finally he propounded the articles of such a peace these it was clear had been carefully prepared but to set them out would be useless since they never came to anything and i doubt whether it was intended that they should suffice it to say that they provided for intermarriage free trade between the countries bloodbrotherhood and other things that i have forgotten all of which was to be ratified by bausi taking a daughter of the kalubi to wife and the kalubi taking a daughter of bausi  we listened in silence and when he had finished after a pretended consultation between us i spoke as the mouth of brother john who i explained was too grand a person to talk himself saying that the proposals seemed fair and reasonable and that we should be happy to submit them to bausi and his council on our return  the kalubi expressed great satisfaction at this statement but remarked incidentally that first of all the whole matter must be laid before the motombo for his opinion without which no state transaction had legal weight among the pongo he added that with our approval he proposed that we should visit his holiness on the morrow starting when the sun was three hours old as he lived at a distance of a days journey from rica after further consultation we replied that although we had little time to spare as we understood that the motombo was old and could not visit us we the white lords would stretch a point and call on him meanwhile we were tired and wished to go to bed then we presented our gifts which were gracefully accepted with an intimation that return presents would be made to us before we left pongoland  after this the kalubi took a little stick and broke it to intimate that the conference was at an end and having bade him and his councillors good night we retired to our huts  i should add because it has a bearing on subsequent events that on this occasion we were escorted not by komba but by two of the councillors komba as i noted for the first time when we rose to say goodbye was no longer present at the council when he left it i cannot say since it will be remembered that his seat was behind us in the shadow and none of us saw him go    what do you make of all that i asked the others when the door was shut  brother john merely shook his head and said nothing for in those days he seemed to be living in a kind of dreamland  stephen answered bosh tommy rot all my eye and my elbow those maneating johnnies have some game up their wide sleeves and whatever it may be it isnt peace with the mazitu  i agree i said if the real object were peace they would have haggled more stood out for better terms or hostages or something also they would have got the consent of this motombo beforehand clearly he is the master of the situation not the kalubi who is only his tool if business were meant he should have spoken first always supposing that he exists and isnt a myth however if we live we shall learn and if we dont it doesnt matter though personally i think we should be wise to leave motombo alone and to clear out to mazituland by the first canoe tomorrow morning  i intend to visit this motombo broke in brother john with decision  ditto ditto exclaimed stephen but its no use arguing that all over again  no i replied with irritation it is as you remark of no use arguing with lunatics so lets go to bed and as it will probably be our last have a good nights sleep  hear hear said stephen taking off his coat and placing it doubled up on the bed to serve as a pillow i say he added stand clear a minute while i shake this blanket its covered with bits of something and he suited the action to the word  bits of something i said suspiciously why didnt you wait a minute to let me see them i didnt notice any bits before  rats running about the roof i expect said stephen carelessly  not being satisfied i began to examine this roof and the clay walls which i forgot to mention were painted over in a kind of pattern with whorls in it by the feeble light of the primitive lamps while i was thus engaged there was a knock on the door forgetting all about the dust i opened it and hans appeared  one of these maneating devils wants to speak to you baas mavovo keeps him without  let him in i said since in this place fearlessness seemed our best game but watch well while he is with us  hans whispered a word over his shoulder and next moment a tall man wrapped from head to foot in white cloth so that he looked like a ghost came or rather shot into the hut and closed the door behind him  who are you i asked  by way of answer he lifted or unwrapped the cloth from about his face and i saw that the kalubi himself stood before us  i wish to speak alone with the white lord dogeetah he said in a hoarse voice and it must be now since afterwards it will be impossible  brother john rose and looked at him  how are you kalubi my friend he asked i see that your wound has healed well  yes yes but i would speak with you alone  not so replied brother john if you have anything to say you must say it to all of us or leave it unsaid since these lords and i are one and that which i hear they hear  can i trust them muttered the kalubi  as you can trust me therefore speak or go yet first can we be overheard in this hut  no dogeetah the walls are thick there is no one on the roof for i have looked all round and if any strove to climb there we should hear also your men who watch the door would see him none can hear us save perhaps the gods  then we will risk the gods kalubi go on my brothers know your story  my lords he began rolling his eyes about him like a hunted creature i am in a terrible pass once since i saw you dogeetah i should have visited the white god that dwells in the forest on the mountain yonder to scatter the sacred seed but i feigned to be sick and komba the kalubitobe who has passed the god went in my place and returned unharmed now tomorrow the night of the full moon as kalubi i must visit the god again and once more scatter the seed anddogeetah he will kill me whom he has once bitten he will certainly kill me unless i can kill him then komba will rule as kalubi in my stead and he will kill you in a way you can guess by the hot death as a sacrifice to the gods that the women of the pongo may once more become the mothers of many children yes yes unless we can kill the god who dwells in the forest we all must die and he paused trembling while the sweat dropped from him to the floor  thats pleasant said brother john but supposing that we kill the god how would that help us or you to escape from the motombo and these murdering people of yours surely they would slay us for the sacrilege  not so dogeetah if the god dies the motombo dies it is known from of old and therefore the motombo watches over the god as a mother over her child then until a new god is found the mother of the holy flower rules she who is merciful and will harm none and i rule under her and will certainly put my enemies to death especially that wizard komba  here i thought i heard a faint sound in the air like the hiss of a snake but as it was not repeated and i could see nothing concluded that i was mistaken  moreover he went on i will load you with gold dust and any gifts you may desire and set you safe across the water among your friends the mazitu  look here i broke in let us understand matters clearly and john do you translate to stephen now friend kalubi first of all who and what is this god you talk of  lord macumazana he is a huge ape white with age or born white i know not which he is twice as big as any man and stronger than twenty men whom he can break in his hands as i break a reed or whose heads he can bite off in his mouth as he bit off my finger for a warning for that is how he treats the kalubis when he wearies of them first he bites off a finger and lets them go and next he breaks them like a reed as also he breaks those who are doomed to sacrifice before the fire  ah i said a great ape i thought as much well and how long has this brute been a god among you  i do not know how long from the beginning he was always there as the motombo was always there for they are one  thats a lie any way i said in english then went on and who is this mother of the holy flower is she also always there and does she live in the same place as the ape god  not so lord macumazana she dies like other mortals and is succeeded by one who takes her place thus the present mother is a white woman of your race now of middle age when she dies she will be succeeded by her daughter who also is a white woman and very beautiful after she dies another who is white will be found perhaps one who is of black parents but born white  how old is this daughter interrupted brother john in a curiously intent voice and who is her father  the daughter was born over twenty years ago dogeetah after the mother of the flower was captured and brought here she says that the father was a white man to whom she was married but who is dead  brother johns head dropped upon his chest and his eyes shut as though he had gone to sleep  as for where the mother lives went on the kalubi it is on the island in the lake at the top of the mountain that is surrounded by water she has nothing to do with the white god but those women who serve her go across the lake at times to tend the fields where grows the seed that the kalubi sows of which the corn is the white gods food  good i said now we understandnot much but a little tell us next what is your plan how are we to come into the place where this great ape lives and if we come there how are we to kill the beast seeing that your successor komba was careful to prevent us from bringing our firearms to your land  aye lord macumazana may the teeth of the god meet in his brain for that trick yes may he die as i know how to make him die that prophecy of which he told you is no prophecy from of old it arose in the land within the last moon only though whether it came from komba or from the motombo i know not none save myself or at least very few here had heard of the iron tubes that throw out death so how should there be a prophecy concerning them  i am sure i dont know kalubi but answer the rest of the question  as to your coming into the forestfor the white god lives in a forest on the slopes of the mountain lordsthat will be easy since the motombo and the people will believe that i am trapping you there to be a sacrifice such as they desire for sundry reasons and he looked at the plump stephen in a very suggestive way as to how you are to kill the god without your tubes of iron that i do not know but you are very brave and great magicians surely you can find a way  here brother john seemed to wake up again  yes he said we shall find a way have no fear of that o kalubi we are not afraid of the big ape whom you call a god yet it must be at a price we will not kill this beast and try to save your life save at a price  what price asked the kalubi nervously there are wives and cattleno you do not want the wives and the cattle cannot be taken across the lake there are gold dust and ivory i have already promised these and there is nothing more that i can give  the price is o kalubi that you hand over to us to be taken away the white woman who is called mother of the holy flower with her daughter  and interrupted stephen to whom i had been interpreting the holy flower itself all of it dug up by the roots  when he heard these modest requests the poor kalubi became like one upon the verge of madness  do you understand he gasped do you understand that you are asking for the gods of my country  quite replied brother john with calmness for the gods of your countrynothing more nor less  the kalubi made as though he would fly from the hut but i caught him by the arm and said  see friend things are thus you ask us at great danger to ourselves to kill one of the gods of your country the highest of them in order to save your life well in payment we ask you to make a present of the remaining gods of your country and to see us and them safe across the lake do you accept or refuse  i refuse answered the kalubi sullenly to accept would mean the last curse upon my spirit that is too horrible to tell  and to refuse means the first curse upon your body namely that in a few hours it must be broken and chewed by a great monkey which you call a god yes broken and chewed and afterwards i think cooked and eaten as a sacrifice is it not so  the kalubi nodded his head and groaned  yet i went on for our part we are glad that you have refused since now we shall be rid of a troublesome and dangerous business and return in safety to mazitu land  how will you return in safety o lord macumazana you who are doomed to the hot death if you escape the fangs of the god  very easily o kalubi by telling komba the kalubitobe of your plots against this god of yours and how we have refused to listen to your wickedness in fact i think this may be done at once while you are here with us o kalubi where perhaps you do not expect to be found i will go strike upon the pot without the door doubtless though it is late some will hear nay man stand you still we have knives and our servants have spears and i made as though to pass him  lord he said i will give you the mother of the holy flower and her daughter aye and the holy flower itself dug up by the roots and i swear that if i can i will set you and them safe across the lake only asking that i may come with you since here i dare not stay yet the curse will come too but if so it is better to die of a curse in a day to be than tomorrow at the fangs of the god oh why was i born why was i born and he began to weep  that is a question many have asked and none have been able to answer o friend kalubi though mayhap there is an answer somewhere i replied in a kind voice  for my heart was stirred with pity of this poor wretch mazed and lost in his hell of superstition this potentate who could not escape from the trappings of a hateful power save by the door of a death too horrible to contemplate this priest whose doom it was to be slain by the very hands of his god as those who went before him had been slain and as those who came after him would be slain  yet i went on i think you have chosen wisely and we hold you to your word while you are faithful to us we will say nothing but of this be surethat if you attempt to betray us we who are not so helpless as we seem will betray you and it shall be you who die not us is it a bargain  it is a bargain white lord although blame me not if things go wrong since the gods know all and they are devils who delight in human woe and mock at bargains and torment those who would injure them yet come what will i swear to keep faith with you thus by the oath that may not be broken and drawing a knife from his girdle he thrust out the tip of his tongue and pricked it from the puncture a drop of blood fell to the floor  if i break my oath he said may my flesh grow cold as that blood grows cold and may it rot as that blood rots aye and may my spirit waste and be lost in the world of ghosts as that blood wastes into the air and is lost in the dust of the world  it was a horrible scene and one that impressed me very much especially as even then there fell upon me a conviction that this unfortunate man was doomed that a fate which he could not escape was upon him  we said nothing and in another moment he had thrown his white wrappings over his face and slipped through the door  i am afraid we are playing it rather low down on that jumpy old boy said stephen remorsefully  the white woman the white woman and her daughter muttered brother john  yes reflected stephen aloud one is justified in doing anything to get two white women out of this hell if they exist so one may as well have the orchid also for theyd be lonely without it poor things wouldnt they glad i thought of that its soothing to the conscience  i hope youll find it so when we are all on that iron grid which i noticed is wide enough for three i remarked sarcastically now be quiet i want to go to sleep  i am sorry to have to add that for the most of that night want remained my master but if i couldnt sleep i could or rather was obliged to think and i thought very hard indeed  first i reflected on the pongo and their gods what were these and why did they worship them soon i gave it up remembering that the problem was one which applied equally to dozens of the dark religions of this vast african continent to which none could give an answer and least of all their votaries that answer indeed must be sought in the horrible fears of the unenlightened human heart which sees death and terror and evil around it everywhere and in this grotesque form or in that personifies them in gods or rather in devils who must be propitiated for always the fetish or the beast or whatever it may be is not the real object of worship it is only the thing or creature which is inhabited by the spirit of the god or devil the temple as it were that furnishes it with a home which temple is therefore holy and these spirits are diverse representing sundry attributes or qualities  thus the great ape might be satan a prince of evil and blood the holy flower might symbolise fertility and the growth of the food of man from the bosom of the earth the mother of the flower might represent mercy and goodness for which reason it was necessary that she should be white in colour and dwell not in the shadowed forest but on a soaring mountain a figure of light in short as opposed to darkness or she might be a kind of african ceres a goddess of the corn and harvest which were symbolised in the beauteous bloom she tended who could tell not i either then or afterwards for i never found out  as for the pongo themselves their case was obvious they were a dying tribe the last descendants of some higher race grown barren from intermarriage probably too they were at first only cannibals occasionally and from religious reasons then in some time of dearth they became very religious in that respect and the habit overpowered them among cannibals at any rate in africa as i knew this dreadful food is much preferred to any other meat i had not the slightest doubt that although the kalubi himself had brought us here in the wild hope that we might save him from a terrible death at the hands of the beelzebub he served komba and the councillors inspired thereto by the prophet called motombo designed that we should be murdered and eaten as an offering to the gods how we were to escape this fate being unarmed i could not imagine unless some special protection were vouchsafed to us meanwhile we must go on to the end whatever it might be  brother john or to give him his right name the reverend john eversley was convinced that the white woman imprisoned in the mountain was none other than the lost wife for whom he had searched for twenty weary years and that the second white woman of whom we had heard that night was strange as it might seem her daughter and his own perhaps he was right and perhaps he was wrong but even in the latter case if two white persons were really languishing in this dreadful land our path was clear we must go on in faith until we saved them or until we died   our life is granted not in pleasures round     or even loves sweet dream to lapse content   duty and faith are words of solemn sound     and to their echoes must the soul be bent  as some one or other once wrote very nobly i think well there was but little of pleasures round about the present entertainment and any hope of loves sweet dream seemed to be limited to brother john here i was quite mistaken as i so often am probably the echoes would be my share indeed already i seemed to hear their ominous thunder  at last i did go to sleep and dreamed a very curious dream it seemed to me that i was disembodied although i retained all my powers of thought and observation in fact dead and yet alive in this state i hovered over the people of the pongo who were gathered together on a great plain under an inky sky they were going about their business as usual and very unpleasant business it often was some of them were worshipping a dim form that i knew was the devil some were committing murders some were feastingat that on which they feasted i would not look some were labouring or engaged in barter some were thinking but i who had the power of looking into them saw within the breast of each a tiny likeness of the man or woman or child as it might be humbly bent upon its knees with hands together in an attitude of prayer and with imploring tearstained face looking upwards to the black heaven  then in that heaven there appeared a single star of light and from this star flowed lines of gentle fire that spread and widened till all the immense arc was one flame of glory and now from the pulsing heart of the glory which somehow reminded me of moving lips fell countless flakes of snow each of which followed an appointed path till it lit upon the forehead of one of the tiny imploring figures hidden within those savage breasts and made it white and clean  then the glory shrank and faded till there remained of it only the similitude of two transparent hands stretched out as though in blessingand i woke up wondering how on earth i found the fancy to invent such a vision and whether it meant anything or nothing  afterwards i repeated it to brother john who was a very spiritually minded as well as a good manthe two things are often quite differentand asked him to be kind enough to explain at the time he shook his head but some days later he said to me  i think i have read your riddle allan the answer came to me quite of a sudden in all those sinstained hearts there is a seed of good and an aspiration towards the right for every one of them also there is at last mercy and forgiveness since how could they learn who never had a teacher your dream allan was one of the ultimate redemption of even the most evil of mankind by gift of the grace that shall one day glow through the blackness of the night in which they wander  that is what he said and i only hope that he was right since at present there is something very wrong with the world especially in africa  also we blame the blind savage for many things but on the balance are we so much better considering our lights and opportunities oh the truth is that the devila very convenient word thatis a good fisherman he has a large book full of flies of different sizes and colours and well he knows how to suit them to each particular fish but white or black every fish takes one fly or the other and then comes the questionis the fish that has swallowed the big gaudy lure so much worse or more foolish than that which has fallen to the delicate white moth with the same sharp barb in its tail  in short are we not all miserable sinners as the prayer book says and in the eye of any judge who can average up the elemental differences of those waters wherein we were bred and are called upon to swim is there so much to choose between us do we not all need those outstretched hands of mercy which i saw in my dream  but there there what right has a poor old hunter to discuss things that are too high for him     chapter xv                               the motombo  after my dream i went to sleep again till i was finally aroused by a strong ray of light hitting me straight in the eye  where the dickens does that come from thought i to myself for these huts had no windows  then i followed the ray to its source which i perceived was a small hole in the mud wall some five feet above the floor i rose and examined the said hole and noted that it appeared to have been freshly made for the clay at the sides of it was in no way discoloured i reflected that if anyone wanted to eavesdrop such an aperture would be convenient and went outside the hut to pursue my investigations its wall i found was situated about four feet from the eastern part of the encircling reed fence which showed no signs of disturbance although there in the outer face of the wall was the hole and beneath it on the lime flooring lay some broken fragments of plaster i called hans and asked him if he had kept watch round the hut when the wrappedup man visited us during the night he answered yes and that he could swear that no one had come near it since several times he had walked to the back and looked  somewhat comforted though not satisfied i went in to wake up the others to whom i said nothing of this matter since it seemed foolish to alarm them for no good purpose a few minutes later the tall silent women arrived with our hot water it seemed curious to have hot water brought to us in such a place by these very queer kind of housemaids but so it was the pongo i may add were like the zulus very clean in their persons though whether they all used hot water i cannot say at any rate it was provided for us  half an hour later they returned with breakfast consisting chiefly of a roasted kid of which as it was whole and therefore unmistakable we partook thankfully a little later the majestic komba appeared after many compliments and inquiries as to our general health he asked whether we were ready to start on our visit to the motombo who he added was expecting us with much eagerness i inquired how he knew that since we had only arranged to call on him late on the previous night and i understood that he lived a days journey away but komba put the matter by with a smile and a wave of his hand  so in due course off we went taking with us all our baggage which now that it had been lightened by the delivery of the presents was of no great weight  five minutes walk along the wide main street led us to the northern gate of rica town here we found the kalubi himself with an escort of thirty men armed with spears i noted that unlike the mazitu they had no bows and arrows he announced in a loud voice that he proposed to do us the special honour of conducting us to the sanctuary of the holy one by which we understood him to mean the motombo when we politely begged him not to trouble being in an irritable mood or assuming it he told us rudely to mind our own business indeed i think this irritability was real enough which in the circumstances known to the reader was not strange at any rate an hour or so later it declared itself in an act of great cruelty which showed us how absolute was this mans power in all temporal matters  passing through a little clump of bush we came to some gardens surrounded by a light fence through which a number of cattle of a small and delicate breedthey were not unlike jerseys in appearancehad broken to enjoy themselves by devouring the crops this garden it appeared belonged to the kalubi for the time being who was furious at the destruction of its produce by the cattle which also belonged to him  where is the herd he shouted  a hunt beganand presently the poor fellowhe was no more than a lad was discovered asleep behind a bush when he was dragged before him the kalubi pointed first to the cattle then to the broken fence and the devastated garden the lad began to mutter excuses and pray for mercy  kill him said the kalubi whereon the herd flung himself to the ground and clutching him by the ankles began to kiss his feet crying out that he was afraid to die the kalubi tried to kick himself free and failing in this lifted his big spear and made an end of the poor boys prayers and life at a single stroke  the escort clapped their hands in salute or approval after which four of them at a sign took up the body and started with it at a trot for rica town where probably that night it appeared upon the grid brother john saw and his big white beard bristled with indignation like the hair on the back of an angry cat while stephen spluttered something beginning with you brute and lifted his fist as though to knock the kalubi down this had i not caught hold of him i have no doubt he would have done  o kalubi gasped brother john do you not know that blood calls for blood in the hour of your own death remember this death  would you bewitch me white man said the kalubi glaring at him angrily if so and once more he lifted the spear but as john never stirred held it poised irresolutely komba thrust himself between them crying  back dogeetah who dare to meddle with our customs is not the kalubi lord of life and death  brother john was about to answer but i called to him in english  for heavens sake be silent unless you want to follow the boy we are in these mens power  then he remembered and walked away and presently we marched forward as though nothing had happened only from that moment i do not think that any of us worried ourselves about the kalubi and what might befall him still looking back on the thing i think that there was this excuse to be made for the man he was mad with the fear of death and knew not what he did  all that day we travelled on through a rich flat country that as we could tell from various indications had once been widely cultivated now the fields were few and far between and bush for the most part a kind of bamboo scrub was reoccupying the land about midday we halted by a waterpool to eat and rest for the sun was hot and here the four men who had carried off the boys body rejoined us and made some report then we went forward once more towards what seemed to be a curious and precipitous wall of black cliff beyond which the volcaniclooking mountain towered in stately grandeur by three oclock we were near enough to this cliff which ran east and west as far as the eye could reach to see a hole in it apparently where the road terminated that appeared to be the mouth of a cave  the kalubi came up to us and in a shy kind of way tried to make conversation i think that the sight of this mountain drawing ever nearer vividly recalled his terrors and caused him to desire to efface the bad impression he knew he had made on us to whom he looked for safety among other things he told us that the hole we saw was the door of the house of the motombo  i nodded my head but did not answer for the presence of this murderous king made me feel sick so he went away again looking at us in a humble and deprecatory manner  nothing further happened until we reached the remarkable wall of rock that i have mentioned which i suppose is composed of some very hard stone that remained when the softer rock in which it lay was disintegrated by millions of years of weather or washings by the water of the lake or perhaps its substance was thrown out of the bowels of the volcano when this was active i am no geologist and cannot say especially as i lacked time to examine the place at any rate there it was and there in it appeared the mouth of a great cave that i presume was natural having once formed a kind of drain through which the lake overflowed when pongoland was under water  we halted staring dubiously at this darksome hole which no doubt was the same that babemba had explored in his youth then the kalubi gave an order and some of the soldiers went to huts that were built near the mouth of the cave where i suppose guardians or attendants lived though of these we saw nothing presently they returned with a number of lighted torches that were distributed among us this done we plunged shivering at least i shivered into the gloomy recesses of that great cavern the kalubi going before us with half of our escort and komba following behind us with the remainder  the floor of the place was made quite smooth doubtless by the action of water as were the walls and roof so far as we could see them for it was very wide and lofty it did not run straight but curved about in the thickness of the cliff at the first turn the pongo soldiers set up a low and eerie chant which they continued during its whole length that according to my pacings was something over three hundred yards on we wound the torches making stars of light in the intense blackness till at length we rounded a last corner where a great curtain of woven grass now drawn was stretched across the cave here we saw a very strange sight  on either side of it near to the walls burned a large wood fire that gave light to the place also more light flowed into it from its further mouth that was not more than twenty paces from the fires beyond the mouth was water which seemed to be about two hundred yards wide and beyond the water rose the slopes of the mountain that was covered with huge trees moreover a little bay penetrated into the cavern the point of which bay ended between the two fires here the water which was not more than six or eight feet wide and shallow formed the berthing place of a goodsized canoe that lay there the walls of the cavern from the turn to the point of the tongue of water were pierced with four doorways two on either side which led i presume to chambers hewn in the rock at each of these doorways stood a tall woman clothed in white who held in her hand a burning torch i concluded that these were attendants set there to guide and welcome us for after we had passed they vanished into the chambers  but this was not all set across the little bay of water just above the canoe that floated there was a wooden platform eight feet or so square on either side of which stood an enormous elephants tusk bigger indeed than any i have seen in all my experience which tusks seemed to be black with age between the tusks squatted upon rugs of some kind of rich fur was what from its shape and attitude i at first took to be a huge toad in truth it had all the appearance of a very bloated toad there was the rough corrugated skin there the prominent backbone for its back was towards us and there were the thin splayedout legs  we stared at this strange object for quite a long while unable to make it out in that uncertain light for so long indeed that i grew nervous and was about to ask the kalubi what it might be as my lips opened however it stirred and with a slow groping circular movement turned itself towards us very slowly at length it was round and as the head came in view all the pongo from the kalubi down ceased their low weird chant and flung themselves upon their faces those who had torches still holding them up in their right hands  oh what a thing appeared it was not a toad but a man that moved upon all fours the large bald head was sunk deep between the shoulders either through deformity or from age for this creature was undoubtedly very old looking at it i wondered how old but could form no answer in my mind the great broad face was sunken and withered like to leather dried in the sun the lower lip hung pendulously upon the prominent and bony jaw two yellow tusklike teeth projected one at each corner of the great mouth all the rest were gone and from time to time it licked the white gums with a redpointed tongue as a snake might do but the chief wonder of the thing lay in its eyes that were large and round perhaps because the flesh had shrunk away from them which gave them the appearance of being set in the hollow orbits of a skull these eyes literally shone like fire indeed at times they seemed positively to blaze as i have seen a lions eyes do in the dark i confess that the aspect of the creature terrified and for a while paralysed me to think that it was human was awful  i glanced at the others and saw that they too were frightened stephen turned very white i thought that he was going to be sick again as he was after he drank the coffee out of the wrong bowl on the day we entered mazituland brother john stroked his white beard and muttered some invocation to heaven to protect him hans exclaimed in his abominable dutch  oh keek baas da is je lelicher oud deel oh look baas there is the ugly old devil himself  jerry went flat on his face among the pongo muttering that he saw death before him only mavovo stood firm perhaps because as a witchdoctor of repute he felt that it did not become him to show the white feather in the presence of an evil spirit  the toadlike creature on the platform swayed its great head slowly as a tortoise does and contemplated us with its flaming eyes at length it spoke in a thick guttural voice using the tongue that seemed to be common to this part of africa and indeed to that branch of the bantu people to which the zulus belong but as i thought with a foreign accent  so you are the white men come back it said slowly let me count and lifting one skinny hand from the ground it pointed with the forefinger and counted one tall with a white beard yes that is right two short nimble like a monkey with hair that wants no comb clever too like a father of monkeys yes that is right three smoothfaced young and stupid like a fat baby that laughs at the sky because he is full of milk and thinks that the sky is laughing at him yes that is right all three of you are just the same as you used to be do you remember white beard how while we killed you you said prayers to one who sits above the world and held up a cross of bone to which a man was tied who wore a cap of thorns do you remember how you kissed the man with the cap of thorns as the spear went into you you shake your headoh you are a clever liar but i will show you that you are a liar for i have the thing yet and snatching up a horn which lay on the kaross beneath him he blew  as the peculiar wailing note that the horn made died away a woman dashed out of one of the doorways that i have described and flung herself on her knees before him he muttered something to her and she dashed back again to reappear in an instant holding in her hand a yellow ivory crucifix  here it is here it is he said take it white beard and kiss it once more perhaps for the last time and he threw the crucifix to brother john who caught it and stared at it amazed and do you remember fat baby how we caught you you fought well very well but we killed you at last and you were good very good we got much strength from you  and do you remember father of monkeys how you escaped from us by your cleverness i wonder where you went to and how you died i shall not forget you for you gave me this and he pointed to a big white scar upon his shoulder you would have killed me but the stuff in that iron tube of yours burned slowly when you held the fire to it so that i had time to jump aside and the iron ball did not strike me in the heart as you meant that it should yet it is still here oh yes i carry it with me to this day and now that i have grown thin i can feel it with my finger  i listened astonished to this harangue which if it meant anything meant that we had all met before in africa at some time when men used matchlocks that were fired with a fusethat is to say about the year 1700 or earlier reflection however showed me the interpretation of this nonsense obviously this old priests forefather or if one put him at a hundred and twenty years of age and i am sure that he was not a day less perhaps his father as a young man was mixed up with some of the first europeans who penetrated to the interior of africa probably these were portuguese of whom one may have been a priest and the other two an elderly man and his son or young brother or companion the manner of the deaths of these people and of what happened to them generally would of course be remembered by the descendants of the chief or head medicineman of the tribe  where did we meet and when o motombo i asked  not in this land not in this land father of monkeys he replied in his low rumbling voice but far far away towards the west where the sun sinks in the water and not in this day but long long ago twenty kalubis have ruled the pongo since that day some have ruled for many years and some have ruled for a few yearsthat depends upon the will of my brother the god yonder and he chuckled horribly and jerked his thumb backwards over his shoulder towards the forest on the mountain yes twenty have ruled some for thirty years and none for less than four  well you are a large old liar i thought to myself for taking the average rule of the kalubis at ten years this would mean that we met him two centuries ago at least  you were clothed otherwise then he went on and two of you wore hats of iron on the head but that of white beard was shaven i caused a picture of you to be beaten by the mastersmith upon a plate of copper i have it yet  again he blew upon his horn again a woman darted out to whom he whispered again she went to one of the chambers and returned bearing an object which he cast to us  we looked at it it was a copper or bronze plaque black apparently with age which once had been nailed on something for there were the holes it represented a tall man with a long beard and a tonsured head who held a cross in his hand and two other men both short who wore round metal caps and were dressed in queerlooking garments and boots with square toes these man carried big and heavy matchlocks and in the hand of one of them was a smoking fuse that was all we could make out of the thing  why did you leave the far country and come to this land o motombo i asked  because we were afraid that other white men would follow on your steps and avenge you the kalubi of that day ordered it though i said no who knew that none can escape by flight from what must come when it must come so we travelled and travelled till we found this place and here we have dwelt from generation to generation the gods came with us also my brother that dwells in the forest came though we never saw him on the journey yet he was here before us the holy flower came too and the white mother of the flowershe was the wife of one of you i know not which  your brother the god i said if the god is an ape as we have heard how can he be the brother of a man  oh you white men do not understand but we black people understand in the beginning the ape killed my brother who was kalubi and his spirit entered into the ape making him as a god and so he kills every other kalubi and their spirits enter also into him is it not so o kalubi of today you without a finger and he laughed mockingly  the kalubi who was lying on his stomach groaned and trembled but made no other answer  so all has come about as i foresaw went on the toadlike creature you have returned as i knew you would and now we shall learn whether white beard yonder spoke true words when he said that his god would be avenged upon our god you shall go to be avenged on him if you can and then we shall learn but this time you have none of your iron tubes which alone we fear for did not the god declare to us through me that when the white men came back with an iron tube then he the god would die and i the motombo the gods mouth would die and the holy flower would be torn up and the mother of the flower would pass away and the people of the pongo would be dispersed and become wanderers and slaves and did he not declare that if the white men came again without their iron tubes then certain secret things would happenoh ask them not in time they shall be known to you and the people of the pongo who were dwindling would again become fruitful and very great and that is why we welcome you white men who arise again from the land of ghosts because through you we the pongo shall become fruitful and very great  of a sudden he ceased his rumbling talk his head sank back between his shoulders and he sat silent for a long while his fierce sparkling eyes playing on us as though he would read our very thoughts if he succeeded i hope that mine pleased him to tell the truth i was filled with mixed fear fury and loathing although of course i did not believe a word of all the rubbish he had been saying which was akin to much that is evolved by these blackhearted african wizards i hated the creature whom i felt to be only halfhuman my whole nature sickened at his aspect and talk and yet i was dreadfully afraid of him i felt as a man might who wakes up to find himself alone with some peculiarly disgusting christmasstory kind of ghost moreover i was quite sure that he meant us ill fearful and imminent ill suddenly he spoke again  who is that little yellow one he said that old one with a face like a skull and he pointed to hans who had kept as much out of sight as possible behind mavovo that wizened snubnosed one who might be a child of my brother the god if ever he had a child and why being so small does he need so large a staff here he pointed again to hanss big bamboo stick i think he is as full of guile as a newfilled gourd with water the big black one and he looked at mavovo i do not fear for his magic is less than my magic he seemed to recognise a brother doctor in mavovo but the little yellow one with the big stick and the pack upon his back i fear him i think he should be killed  he paused and we trembled for if he chose to kill the poor hottentot how could we prevent him but hans who saw the great danger called his cunning to his aid  o motombo he squeaked you must not kill me for i am the servant of an ambassador you know well that all the gods of every land hate and will be revenged upon those who touch ambassadors or their servants whom they the gods alone may harm if you kill me i shall haunt you yes i shall sit on your shoulder at night and jibber into your ear so that you cannot sleep until you die for though you are old you must die at last motombo  it is true said the motombo did i not tell you that he was full of cunning all the gods will be avenged upon those who kill ambassadors or their servants thathere he laughed again in his dreadful wayis the rights of the gods alone let the gods of the pongo settle it  i uttered a sigh of relief and he went on in a new voice a dull businesslike voice if i may so describe it  say o kalubi on what matter have you brought these white men to speak with me the mouth of the god did i dream that it was a matter of a treaty with the king of the mazitu rise and speak  so the kalubi rose and with a humble air set out briefly and clearly the reason of our visit to pongoland as the envoys of bausi and the heads of the treaty that had been arranged subject to the approval of the motombo and bausi we noted that the affair did not seem to interest the motombo at all indeed he appeared to go to sleep while the speech was being delivered perhaps because he was exhausted with the invention of his outrageous falsehoods or perhaps for other reasons when it was finished he opened his eyes and pointed to komba saying  arise kalubithatistobe  so komba rose and in his cold precise voice narrated his share in the transaction telling how he had visited bausi and all that had happened in connection with the embassy again the motombo appeared to go to sleep only opening his eyes once as komba described how we had been searched for firearms whereon he nodded his great head in approval and licked his lips with his thin red tongue when komba had done he said  the gods tell me that the plan is wise and good since without new blood the people of the pongo will die but of the end of the matter the god knows alone if even he can read the future  he paused then asked sharply  have you anything more to say o kalubithatistobe now of a sudden the god puts it into my mouth to ask if you have anything more to say  something o motombo many moons ago the god bit off the finger of our high lord the kalubi the kalubi having heard that a white man skilled in medicine who could cut off limbs with knives was in the country of the mazitu and camped on the borders of the great lake took a canoe and rowed to where the white man was camped he with the beard who is named dogeetah and who stands before you i followed him in another canoe because i wished to know what he was doing also to see a white man i hid my canoe and those who went with me in the reeds far from the kalubis canoe i waded through the shallow water and concealed myself in some thick reeds quite near to the white mans linen house i saw the white man cut off the kalubis finger and i heard the kalubi pray the white man to come to our country with the iron tubes that smoke and to kill the god of whom he was afraid  now from all the company went up a great gasp and the kalubi fell down upon his face again and lay still only the motombo seemed to show no surprise perhaps because he already knew the story  is that all he asked  no o mouth of the god last night after the council of which you have heard the kalubi wrapped himself up like a corpse and visited the white men in their hut i thought that he would do so and had made ready with a sharp spear i bored a hole in the wall of the hut working from outside the fence then i thrust a reed through from the fence across the passage between the fence and the wall and through the hole in the hut and setting my ear to the end of the reed i listened  oh clever clever muttered hans in involuntary admiration and to think that i looked and looked too low beneath the reed oh hans though you are old you have much to learn  among much else i heard this went on komba in sentences so clear and cold that they reminded me of the tinkle of falling ice which i think is enough though i can tell you the rest if you wish o mouth i heard he said in the midst of a silence that was positively awful our lord the kalubi whose name is child of the god agree with the white men that they should kill the godhow i do not know for it was not saidand that in return they should receive the persons of the mother of the holy flower and of her daughter the motherthatistobe and should dig up the holy flower itself by the roots and take it away across the water together with the mother and the motherthatistobe that is all o motombo  still in the midst of an intense silence the motombo glared at the prostrate figure of the kalubi for a long while he glared then the silence was broken for the wretched kalubi sprang from the floor seized a spear and tried to kill himself before the blade touched him it was snatched from his hand so that he remained standing but weaponless  again there was silence and again it was broken this time by the motombo who rose from his seat before which he stood a huge bloated object and roared aloud in his rage yes he roared like a wounded buffalo never would i have believed that such a vast volume of sound could have proceeded from the lungs of a single aged man for fully a minute his furious bellowings echoed down that great cave while all the pongo soldiers rising from their recumbent position pointed their hands in some of which torches still burned at the miserable kalubi on whom their wrath seemed to be concentrated rather than on us and hissed like snakes  really it might have been a scene in hell with the motombo playing the part of satan indeed his swollen diabolical figure supported on the thin toadlike legs the great fires burning on either side the lurid lights of evening reflected from the still water beyond and glowering among the tree tops of the mountain the whiterobed forms of the tall pongo bending every one of them towards the wretched culprit and hissing like so many fierce serpents all suggested some uttermost deep in the infernal regions as one might conceive them in a nightmare  it went on for some time i dont know how long till at length the motombo picked up his fantastically shaped horn and blew thereon the women darted from the various doorways but seeing that they were not wanted checked themselves in their stride and remained standing so in the very attitude of runners about to start upon a race as the blast of the horn died away the turmoil was suddenly succeeded by an utter stillness broken only by the crackling of the fires whose flames of all the living things in that place alone seemed heedless of the tragedy which was being played  all up now old fellow whispered stephen to me in a shaky voice  yes i answered all up high as heaven where i hope we are going now back to back and lets make the best fight we can weve got the spears  while we were closing in the motombo began to speak  so you plotted to kill the god kalubiwhowas he screamed with these white ones whom you would pay with the holy flower and her who guards it good you shall go all of you and talk with the god and i watching here will learn who diesyou or the god away with them     chapter xvi                                 the gods  with a roar the pongo soldiers leapt on us i think that mavovo managed to get his spear up and kill a man for i saw one of them fall backwards and lie still but they were too quick for the rest of us in half a minute we were seized the spears were wrenched from our hands and we were thrown headlong into the canoe all six of us or rather seven including the kalubi a number of the soldiers including komba who acted as steersman also sprang into the canoe that was instantly pushed out from beneath the bridge or platform on which the motombo sat and down the little creek into the still water of the canal or estuary or whatever it may be that separates the wall of rock which the cave pierces from the base of the mountain  as we floated out of the mouth of the cave the toadlike motombo who had wheeled round upon his stool shouted an order to komba  o kalubi he said set the kalubiwhowas and the three white men and their three servants on the borders of the forest that is named houseofthegod and leave them there then return and depart for here i would watch alone when all is finished i will summon you  komba bowed his handsome head and at a sign two of the men got out paddles for more were not needed and with slow and gentle strokes rowed us across the water the first thing i noted about this water at the time was that its blackness was inky owing i suppose to its depth and the shadows of the towering cliff on one side and of the tall trees on the other also i observedfor in this emergency or perhaps because of it i managed to keep my wits about methat its banks on either side were the home of great numbers of crocodiles which lay there like logs i saw further that a little lower down where the water seemed to narrow jagged boughs projected from its surface as though great trees had fallen or been thrown into it i recalled in a numb sort of way that old babemba had told us that when he was a boy he had escaped in a canoe down this estuary and reflected that it would not be possible for him to do so now because of those snags unless indeed he had floated over them in a time of great flood  a couple of minutes or so of paddling brought us to the further shore which as i think i have said was only about two hundred yards from the mouth of the cave the bow of the canoe grated on the bank disturbing a huge crocodile that vanished into the depths with an angry plunge  land white lords land said komba with the utmost politeness and go visit the god who doubtless is waiting for you and now as we shall meet no morefarewell you are wise and i am foolish yet hearken to my counsel if ever you should return to the earth again be advised by me cling to your own god if you have one and do not meddle with those of other peoples again farewell  the advice was excellent but at that moment i felt a hate for komba which was really superhuman to me even the motombo seemed an angel of light as compared with him if wishes could have killed our farewell would indeed have been complete  then admonished by the spear points of the pongo we landed in the slimy mud brother john went first with a smile upon his handsome countenance that i thought idiotic under the circumstances though doubtless he knew best when he ought to smile and the wretched kalubi came last indeed so great was his shrinking from that ominous shore that i believe he was ultimately propelled from the boat by his successor in power komba once he had trodden it however a spark of spirit returned to him for he wheeled round and said to komba  remember o kalubi that my fate today will be yours also in a day to come the god wearies of his priests this year next year or the year after he always wearies of his priests  then o kalubithatwas answered komba in a mocking voice as the canoe was pushed off pray to the god for me that it may be the year after pray it as your bones break in his embrace  while we watched that craft depart there came into my mind the memory of a picture in an old latin book of my fathers which represented the souls of the dead being paddled by a person named charon across a river called the styx the scene before us bore a great resemblance to that picture there was charons boat floating on the dreadful styx yonder glowed the lights of the world here was the gloomy unknown shore and we we were the souls of the dead awaiting the last destruction at the teeth and claws of some unknown monster such as that which haunts the recesses of the egyptian hell oh the parallel was painfully exact and yet what do you think was the remark of that irrepressible young man stephen  here we are at last allan my boy he said and after all without any trouble on our own part i call it downright providential oh isnt it jolly hip hip hooray  yes he danced about in that filthy mud threw up his cap and cheered  i withered or rather tried to wither him with a look muttering the single word lunatic  providential jolly well its fortunate that some peoples madness takes a cheerful turn then i asked the kalubi where the god was  everywhere he replied waving his trembling hand at the illimitable forest perhaps behind this tree perhaps behind that perhaps a long way off before morning we shall know  what are you going to do i inquired savagely  die he answered  look here fool i exclaimed shaking him you can die if you like but we dont mean to take us to some place where we shall be safe from this god  one is never safe from the god lord especially in his own house and he shook his silly head and went on how can we be safe when there is nowhere to go and even the trees are too big to climb  i looked at them it was true they were huge and ran up for fifty or sixty feet without a bough moreover it was probable that the god climbed better than we could the kalubi began to move inland in an indeterminate fashion and i asked him where he was going  to the buryingplace he answered there are spears yonder with the bones  i pricked up my ears at thisfor when one has nothing but some clasp knives spears are not to be despisedand ordered him to lead on in another minute we were walking uphill through the awful wood where the gloom at this hour of approaching night was that of an english fog  three or four hundred paces brought us to a kind of clearing where i suppose some of the monster trees had fallen down in past years and never been allowed to grow up again here placed upon the ground were a number of boxes made of imperishable ironwood and on the top of each box sat or rather lay a mouldering and broken skull  kalubithatwere murmured our guide in explanation look komba has made my box ready and he pointed to a new case with the lid off  how thoughtful of him i said but show us the spears before it gets quite dark he went to one of the newer coffins and intimated that we should lift off the lid as he was afraid to do so  i shoved it aside there within lay the bones each of them separate and wrapped up in something except of course the skull with these were some pots filled apparently with gold dust and alongside of the pots two good spears that being made of copper had not rusted much we went on to other coffins and extracted from them more of these weapons that were laid there for the dead man to use upon his journey through the shades until we had enough the shafts of most of them were somewhat rotten from the damp but luckily they were furnished with copper sockets from two and a half to three feet long into which the wood of the shaft fitted so that they were still serviceable  poor things these to fight a devil with i said  yes baas said hans in a cheerful voice very poor it is lucky that i have got a better  i stared at him we all stared at him  what do you mean spotted snake asked mavovo  what do you mean child of a hundred idiots is this a time to jest is not one joker enough among us i asked and looked at stephen  mean baas dont you know that i have the little rifle with me that which is called intombi that with which you shot the vultures at dingaans kraal i never told you because i was sure you knew also because if you didnt know it was better that you should not know for if you had known those pongo skellums that is vicious ones might have come to know also and if they had known  mad interrupted brother john tapping his forehead quite mad poor fellow well in these depressing circumstances it is not wonderful  i inspected hans again for i agreed with john yet he did not look mad only rather more cunning than usual  hans i said tell us where this rifle is or i will knock you down and mavovo shall flog you  where baas why cannot you see it when it is before your eyes  you are right john i said hes off it but stephen sprang at hans and began to shake him  leave go baas he said or you may hurt the rifle  stephen obeyed in sheer astonishment then oh then hans did something to the end of his great bamboo stick turned it gently upside down and out of it slid the barrel of a rifle neatly tied round with greased cloth and stoppered at the muzzle with a piece of tow  i could have kissed him yes such was my joy that i could have kissed that hideous smelly old hottentot  the stock i panted the barrel isnt any use without the stock hans  oh baas he answered grinning do you think that i have shot with you all these years without knowing that a rifle must have a stock to hold it by  then he slipped off the bundle from his back undid the lashings of the blanket revealing the great yellow head of tobacco that had excited my own and kombas interest on the shores of the lake this head he tore apart and produced the stock of the rifle nicely cleaned a cap set ready on the nipple on to which the hammer was let down with a little piece of wad between to prevent the cap from being fired by any sudden jar  hans i exclaimed hans you are a hero and worth your weight in gold  yes baas though you never told me so before oh i made up my mind that i wouldnt go to sleep in the face of the old man death oh which of you ought to sleep now upon that bed that bausi sent me he asked as he put the gun together you i think you great stupid mavovo you never brought a gun if you were a wizard worth the name you would have sent the rifles on and had them ready to meet us here oh will you laugh at me any more you thickhead of a zulu  no answered mavovo candidly i will give you sibonga yes i will make for you titles of praise o clever spotted snake  and yet went on hans i am not all a hero i am worth but half my weight in gold for baas although i have plenty of powder and bullets in my pocket i lost the caps out of a hole in my waistcoat you remember baas i told you it was charms i lost but three remain no four for there is one on the nipple there baas there is intombi all ready and loaded and now when the white devil comes you can shoot him in the eye as you how to do up to a hundred yards and send him to the other devils down in hell oh wont your holy father the predikant be glad to see him there  then with a selfsatisfied smirk he halfcocked the rifle and handed it to me ready for action  i thank god said brother john solemnly who has taught this poor hottentot how to save us  no baas john god never taught me i taught myself but see it grows dark had we not better light a fire and forgetting the rifle he began to look about for wood  hans called stephen after him if ever we get out of this i will give you £500 or at least my father will which is the same thing  thank you baas thank you though just now id rather have a drop of brandy andi dont see any wood  he was right outside of the graveyard clearing lay it is true some huge fallen boughs but these were too big for us to move or cut moreover they were so soaked with damp like everything in this forest that it would be impossible to fire them  the darkness closed in it was not absolute blackness because presently the moon rose but the sky was rainy and obscured it moreover the huge trees all about seemed to suck up whatever light there was we crouched ourselves upon the ground back to back as near as possible to the centre of the place unrolled such blankets as we had to protect us from the damp and cold and ate some biltong or dried game flesh and parched corn of which fortunately the boy jerry carried a bagful that had remained upon his shoulders when he was thrown into the canoe luckily i had thought of bringing this food with us also a flask of spirits  then it was that the first thing happened far away in the forest resounded a most awful roar followed by a drumming noise such a roar as none of us had ever heard before for it was quite unlike that of a lion or any other beast  what is that i asked  the god groaned the kalubi the god praying to the moon with which he always rises  i said nothing for i was reflecting that four shots which was all we had was not many and that nothing should tempt me to waste one of them oh why had hans put on that rotten old waistcoat instead of the new one i gave him in durban  since we heard no more roars brother john began to question the kalubi as to where the mother of the flower lived  lord answered the man in a distracted way there towards the east you walk for a quarter of the suns journey up the hill following a path that is marked by notches cut upon the trees till beyond the garden of the god at the top of the mountain more water is found surrounding an island there on the banks of the water a canoe is hidden in the bushes by which the water may be crossed to the island where dwells the mother of the holy flower  brother john did not seem to be quite satisfied with the information and remarked that he the kalubi would be able to show us the road on the morrow  i do not think that i shall ever show you the road groaned the shivering wretch  at that moment the god roared again much nearer now the kalubis nerve gave out altogether and quickened by some presentiment he began to question brother john whom he had learned was a priest of an unknown sort as to the possibility of another life after death  brother john who be it remembered was a very earnest missionary by calling proceeded to administer some compressed religious consolations when quite near to us the god began to beat upon some kind of very large and deep drum he didnt roar this time he only worked away at a massedband military drum at least that is what it sounded like and very unpleasant it was to hear in that awful forest with skulls arranged on boxes all round us i can assure you my reader  the drumming ceased and pulling himself together brother john continued his pious demonstrations also just at that time a thick raincloud quite obscured the moon so that the darkness grew dense i heard john explaining to the kalubi that he was not really a kalubi but an immortal soul i wonder whether he understood him then i became aware of a horrible shadowi cannot describe it in any other waythat was blacker than the blackness which advanced towards us at extraordinary speed from the edge of the clearing  next second there was a kind of scuffle a few feet from me followed by a stifled yell and i saw the shadow retreating in the direction from which it had come  whats the matter i asked  strike a match answered brother john i think something has happened  i struck a match which burnt up very well for the air was quite still in the light of it i saw first the anxious faces of our partyhow ghastly they lookedand next the kalubi who had risen and was waving his right arm in the air a right arm that was bloody and lacked the hand  the god has visited me and taken away my hand he moaned in a wailing voice  i dont think anybody spoke the thing was beyond words but we tried to bind the poor fellows arm up by the light of matches then we sat down again and watched  the darkness grew still denser as the thick of the cloud passed over the moon and for a while the silence that utter silence of the tropical forest at night was broken only by the sound of our breathing the buzz of a few mosquitoes the distant splash of a plunging crocodile and the stifled groans of the mutilated man  again i saw or thought i sawthis may have been half an hour laterthat black shadow dart towards us as a pike darts at a fish in a pond there was another scuffle just to my lefthans sat between me and the kalubifollowed by a single prolonged wail  the kingman has gone whispered hans i felt him go as though a wind had blown him away where he was there is nothing but a hole  of a sudden the moon shone out from behind the clouds in its sickly light about halfway between us and the edge of the clearing say thirty yards off i sawoh what did i see the devil destroying a lost soul at least that is what it looked like a huge greyblack creature grotesquely human in its shape had the thin kalubi in its grip the kalubis head had vanished in its maw and its vast black arms seemed to be employed in breaking him to pieces  apparently he was already dead though his feet that were lifted off the ground still moved feebly  i sprang up and covered the beast with the rifle which was cocked getting full on to its head which showed the clearest though this was rather guesswork since i could not see distinctly the foresight i pulled but either the cap or the powder had got a little damp on the journey and hung fire for the fraction of a second in that infinitesimal time the devilit is the best name i can give the thingsaw me or perhaps it only saw the light gleaming on the barrel at any rate it dropped the kalubi and as though some intelligence warned it what to expect threw up its massive right armi remember how extraordinarily long the limb seemed and that it looked thick as a mans thighin such a fashion as to cover its head  then the rifle exploded and i heard the bullet strike by the light of the flash i saw the great arm tumble down in a dead helpless kind of way and next instant the whole forest began to echo with peal upon peal of those awful roarings that i have described each of which ended with a doglike yowp of pain  you have hit him baas said hans and he isnt a ghost for he doesnt like it but hes still very lively  close up i answered and hold out the spears while i reload  my fear was that the brute would rush on us but it did not for all that dreadful night we saw or heard it no more indeed i began to hope that after all the bullet had reached some mortal part and that the great ape was dead  at length it seemed to be weeks afterwards the dawn broke and revealed us sitting white and shivering in the grey mist that is all except stephen who had gone comfortably to sleep with his head resting on mavovos shoulder he is a man so equably minded and so devoid of nerves that i feel sure he will be one of the last to be disturbed by the trump of the archangel at least so i told him indignantly when at length we roused him from his indecent slumbers  you should judge things by results allan he said with a yawn im as fresh as a pippin while you all look as though you had been to a ball with twelve extras have you retrieved the kalubi yet  shortly afterwards when the mist lifted a little we went out in a line to retrieve the kalubi and foundwell i wont describe what we found he was a cruel wretch as the incident of the herdboy had told us but i felt sorry for him still his terrors were over or at least i hope so  we deposited him in the box that komba had kindly provided in preparation for this inevitable event and brother john said a prayer over his miscellaneous remains then after consultation and in the very worst of spirits we set out to seek the way to the home of the mother of the flower the start was easy enough for a distinct though very faint path led from the clearing up the slope of the hill afterwards it became more difficult for the denser forest began fortunately very few creepers grew in this forest but the flat tops of the huge trees meeting high above entirely shut out the sky so that the gloom was great in places almost that of night  oh it was a melancholy journey as filled with fears we stole a pallid throng from trunk to trunk searching them for the notches that indicated our road and speaking only in whispers lest the sound of our voices should attract the notice of the dreadful god after a mile or two of this we became aware that its notice was attracted despite our precautions for at times we caught glimpses of some huge grey thing slipping along parallel to us between the boles of the trees hans wanted me to try a shot but i would not knowing that the chances of hitting it were small indeed with only three charges or rather three caps left it was necessary to be saving  we halted and held a consultation as a result of which we decided that there was no more danger in going on than in standing still or attempting to return so we went on keeping close together to me as i was the only one with a rifle was accorded what i did not at all appreciate the honour of heading the procession  another halfmile and again we heard that strange rolling sound which was produced i believe by the great brute beating upon its breast but noted that it was not so continuous as on the previous night  ha said hans he can only strike his drum with one stick now your bullet broke the other baas  a little farther and the god roared quite close so loudly that the air seemed to tremble  the drum is all right whatever may have happened to the sticks i said  a hundred yards or so more and the catastrophe occurred we had reached a spot in the forest where one of the great trees had fallen down letting in a little light i can see it to this hour there lay the enormous tree its bark covered with grey mosses and clumps of a giant species of maidenhair fern on our side of it was the open space which may have measured forty feet across where the light fell in a perpendicular ray as it does through the smokehole of a hut looking at this prostrate trunk i saw first two lurid and fiery eyes that glowed red in the shadow and then almost in the same instant made out what looked like the head of a fiend enclosed in a wreath of the delicate green ferns i cant describe it i can only repeat that it looked like the head of a very large fiend with a pallid face huge overhanging eyebrows and great yellow tushes on either side of the mouth  before i had even time to get the rifle up with one terrific roar the brute was on us i saw its enormous grey shape on the top of the trunk i saw it pass me like a flash running upright as a man does but with the head held forward and noted that the arm nearest to me was swinging as though broken then as i turned i heard a scream of terror and perceived that it had gripped the poor mazitu jerry who walked last but one of our line which was ended by mavovo yes it had gripped him and was carrying him off clasped to its breast with its sound arm when i say that jerry although a fullgrown man and rather inclined to stoutness looked like a child in that fell embrace it will give some idea of the creatures size  mavovo who had the courage of a buffalo charged at it and drove the copper spear he carried into its side they all charged like berserkers except myself for even then thank heaven i knew a trick worth two of that in three seconds there was a struggling mass in the centre of the clearing brother john stephen mavovo and hans were all stabbing at the enormous gorilla for it was a gorilla although their blows seemed to do it no more harm than pinpricks fortunately for them for its part the beast would not let go of jerry and having only one sound arm could but snap at its assailants for if it had lifted a foot to rend them its topheavy bulk would have caused it to tumble over  at length it seemed to realise this and hurled jerry away knocking down brother john and hans with his body then it leapt on mavovo who seeing it come placed the copper socket of the spear against his own breast with the result that when the gorilla tried to crush him the point of the spear was driven into its carcase feeling the pain it unwound its arm from about mavovo knocking stephen over with the backward sweep then it raised its great hand to crush mavovo with a blow as i believe gorillas are wont to do  this was the chance for which i was waiting up till that moment i had not dared to fire fearing lest i should kill one of my companions now for an instant it was clear of them all and steadying myself i aimed at the huge head and let drive the smoke thinned and through it i saw the gigantic ape standing quite still like a creature lost in meditation  then it threw up its sound arm turned its fierce eyes to the sky and uttering one pitiful and hideous howl sank down dead the bullet had entered just behind the ear and buried itself in the brain  the great silence of the forest flowed in over us as it were for quite a while no one did or said anything then from somewhere down amidst the mosses i heard a thin voice the sound of which reminded me of air being squeezed out of an indiarubber cushion  very good shot baas it piped up as good as that which killed the kingvulture at dingaans kraal and more difficult but if the baas could pull the god off me i should saythank you  the thank you was almost inaudible and no wonder for poor hans had fainted there he lay under the huge bulk of the gorilla just his nose and mouth appearing between the brutes body and its arm had it not been for the soft cushion of wet moss in which he reclined i think that he would have been crushed flat  we rolled the creature off him somehow and poured a little brandy down his throat which had a wonderful effect for in less than a minute he sat up grasping like a dying fish and asked for more  leaving brother john to examine hans to see if he was really injured i bethought me of poor jerry and went to look at him one glance was enough he was quite dead indeed he seemed to be crushed out of shape like a buck that has been enveloped in the coils of a boaconstrictor brother john told me afterwards that both his arms and nearly all his ribs had been broken in that terrible embrace even his spine was dislocated  i have often wondered why the gorilla ran down the line without touching me or the others to vent his rage upon jerry i can only suggest that it was because the unlucky mazitu had sat next to the kalubi on the previous night which may have caused the brute to identify him by smell with the priest whom he had learned to hate and killed it is true that hans had sat on the other side of the kalubi but perhaps the odour of the pongo had not clung to him so much or perhaps it meant to deal with him after it had done with jerry  when we knew that the mazitu was past human help and had discovered to our joy that save for a few bruises no one else was really hurt although stephens clothes were halftorn off him we made an examination of the dead god truly it was a fearful creature  what its exact weight or size may have been we had no means of ascertaining but i never saw or heard of such an enormous ape if a gorilla is really an ape it needed the united strength of the five of us to lift the carcase with a great effort off the fainting hans and even to roll it from side to side when subsequently we removed the skin i would never have believed that so ancient an animal of its stature which could not have been more than seven feet when it stood erect could have been so heavy for ancient undoubtedly it was the long yellow canine tusks were worn halfaway with use the eyes were sunken far into the skull the hair of the head which i am told is generally red or brown was quite white and even the bare breast which should be black was grey in hue of course it was impossible to say but one might easily have imagined that this creature was two hundred years or more old as the motombo had declared it to be  stephen suggested that it should be skinned and although i saw little prospect of our being able to carry away the hide i assented and helped in the operation on the mere chance of saving so great a curiosity also although brother john was restless and murmured something about wasting time i thought it necessary that we should have a rest after our fearful anxieties and still more fearful encounter with this consecrated monster so we set to work and as a result of more than an hours toil dragged off the hide which was so tough and thick that as we found the copper spears had scarcely penetrated to the flesh the bullet that i had put into it on the previous night struck we discovered upon the bone of the upper arm which it shattered sufficiently to render that limb useless if it did not break it altogether this indeed was fortunate for us for had the creature retained both its arms uninjured it would certainly have killed more of us in its attack we were saved only by the fact that when it was hugging jerry it had no limb left with which it could strike and luckily did not succeed in its attempts to get hold with its tremendous jaws that had nipped off the kalubis hand as easily as a pair of scissors severs the stalk of a flower  when the skin was removed except that of the hands which we did not attempt to touch we pegged it out raw side uppermost to dry in the centre of the open place where the sun struck then having buried poor jerry in the hollow trunk of the great fallen tree we washed ourselves with the wet mosses and ate some of the food that remained to us  after this we started forward again in much better spirits jerry it was true was dead but so was the god leaving us happily still alive and practically untouched never more would the kalubis of pongoland shiver out their lives at the feet of this dreadful divinity who soon or late must become their executioner for i believe with the exception of two who committed suicide through fear that no kalubi was ever known to have died except by the handor teethof the god  what would i not give to know that brutes history could it possibly as the motombo said have accompanied the pongo people from their home in western or central africa or perhaps have been brought here by them in a state of captivity i am unable to answer the question but it should be noted that none of the mazitu or other natives had ever heard of the existence of more true gorillas in this part of africa the creature if it had its origin in the locality must either have been solitary in its habits or driven away from its fellows as sometimes happens to old elephants which then like this gorilla become fearfully ferocious  that is all i can say about the brute though of course the pongo had their own story according to them it was an evil spirit in the shape of an ape which evil spirit had once inhabited the body of an early kalubi and had been annexed by the ape when it killed the said kalubi also they declared that the reason the creature put all the kalubis to death as well as a number of other people who were offered up to it was that it needed to refresh itself with the spirits of men by which means it was enabled to avoid the effects of age it will be remembered that the motombo referred to this belief of which afterwards i heard in more detail from babemba but if this god had anything supernatural about it at least its magic was no shield against a bullet from a purdey rifle  only a little way from the fallen tree we came suddenly upon a large clearing which we guessed at once must be that garden of the god where twice a year the unfortunate kalubis were doomed to scatter the sacred seed it was a large garden several acres of it lying on a shelf as it were of the mountain and watered by a stream maize grew in it also other sorts of corn while all round was a thick belt of plantain trees of course these crops had formed the food of the god who whenever it was hungry came to this place and helped itself as we could see by many signs the garden was well kept and comparatively free from weeds at first we wondered how this could be till i remembered that the kalubi or someone had told me that it was tended by the servants of the mother of the flower who were generally albinos or mutes  we crossed it and pushed on rapidly up the mountain once more following an easy and wellbeaten path for now we saw that we were approaching what we thought must be the edge of a crater indeed our excitement was so extreme that we did not speak only scrambled forward brother john notwithstanding his lame leg leading at a greater pace than we could equal he was the first to reach our goal closely followed by stephen watching i saw him sink down as though in a swoon stephen also appeared astonished for he threw up his hands  i rushed to them and this was what i saw beneath us was a steep slope quite bare of forest which ceased at its crest this slope stretched downwards for half a mile or more to the lip of a beautiful lake of which the area was perhaps two hundred acres set in the centre of the deep blue water of this lake which we discovered afterwards to be unfathomable was an island not more than five and twenty or thirty acres in extent that seemed to be cultivated for on it we could see fields palms and other fruitbearing trees in the middle of the island stood a small near house thatched after the fashion of the country but civilized in its appearance for it was oblong not round and encircled by a verandah and a reed fence at a distance from this house were a number of native huts and in front of it a small enclosure surrounded by a high wall on the top of which mats were fixed on poles as though to screen something from wind or sun  the holy flower lives there you bet gasped stephen excitedlyhe could think of nothing but that confounded orchid look the mats are up on the sunny side to prevent its scorching and those palms are planted round to give it shade  the mother of the flower lives there whispered brother john pointing to the house who is she who is she suppose i should be mistaken after all god let me not be mistaken for it would be more than i can bear  we had better try to find out i remarked practically though i am sure i sympathised with his suspense and started down the slope at a run  in five minutes or less we reached the foot of it and breathless and perspiring though we were began to search amongst the reeds and bushes growing at the edge of the lake for the canoe of which we had been told by the kalubi what if there were none how could we cross that wide stretch of deep water presently hans who following certain indications which caught his practised eye had cast away to the left held up his hand and whistled we ran to him  here it is baas he said and pointed to something in a tiny bushfringed inlet that at first sight looked like a heap of dead reeds we tore away at the reeds and there sure enough was a canoe of sufficient size to hold twelve or fourteen people and in it a number of paddles  another two minutes and we were rowing across that lake  we came safely to the other side where we found a little landingstage made of poles sunk into the lake we tied up the canoe or rather i did for nobody else remembered to take that precaution and presently were on a path which led through the cultivated fields to the house here i insisted upon going first with the rifle in case we should be suddenly attacked the silence and the absence of any human beings suggested to me that this might very well happen since it would be strange if we had not been seen crossing the lake  afterwards i discovered why the place seemed so deserted it was owing to two reasons first it was now noontime an hour at which these poor slaves retired to their huts to eat and sleep through the heat of the day secondly although the watcher as she was called had seen the canoe on the water she concluded that the kalubi was visiting the mother of the flower and according to practice on these occasions withdrew herself and everybody else since the rare meetings of the kalubi and the mother of the flower partook of the nature of a religious ceremony and must be held in private  first we came to the little enclosure that was planted about with palms and as i have described screened with mats stephen ran at it and scrambling up the wall peeped over the top  next instant he was sitting on the ground having descended from the wall with the rapidity of one shot through the head  oh by jingo he ejaculated oh by jingo and that was all i could get out of him though it is true i did not try very hard at the time  not five paces from this enclosure stood a tall reed fence that surrounded the house it had a gate also of reeds which was a little ajar creeping up to it very cautiously for i thought i heard a voice within i peeped through the halfopened gate four or five feet away was the verandah from which a doorway led into one of the rooms of the house where stood a table on which was food  kneeling on mats upon this verandah weretwo white womenclothed in garments of the purest white adorned with a purple fringe and wearing bracelets and other ornaments of red native gold one of these appeared to be about forty years of age she was rather stout fair in colouring with blue eyes and golden hair that hung down her back the other might have been about twenty she also was fair but her eyes were grey and her long hair was of a chestnut hue i saw at once that she was tall and very beautiful the elder woman was praying while the other who knelt by her side listened and looked up vacantly at the sky  o god prayed the woman for christs sake look in pity upon us two poor captives and if it be possible send us deliverance from this savage land we thank thee who hast protected us unharmed and in health for so many years and we put our trust in thy mercy for thou alone canst help us grant o god that our dear husband and father may still live and that in thy good time we may be reunited to him or if he be dead and there is no hope for us upon the earth grant that we too may die and find him in thy heaven  thus she prayed in a clear deliberate voice and i noticed that as she did so the tears ran down her cheeks amen she said at last and the girl by her side speaking with a strange little accent echoed the amen  i looked round at brother john he had heard something and was utterly overcome fortunately enough he could not move or even speak  hold him i whispered to stephen and mavovo while i go in and talk to these ladies  then handing the rifle to hans i took off my hat pushed the gate a little wider open slipped through it and called attention to my presence by coughing  the two women who had risen from their knees stared at me as though they saw a ghost  ladies i said bowing pray do not be alarmed you see god almighty sometimes answers prayers in short i am one ofa partyof white people who with some trouble have succeeded in getting to this place andandwould you allow us to call on you  still they stared at length the elder woman opened her lips  here i am called the mother of the holy flower and for a stranger to speak with the mother is death also if you are a man how did you reach us alive  thats a long story i answered cheerfully may we come in we will take the risks we are accustomed to them and hope to be able to do you a service i should explain that three of us are white men two english and oneamerican  american she gasped american what is he like and how is he named  oh i replied for my nerve was giving out and i grew confused he is oldish with a white beard rather like father christmas in short and his christian name i didnt dare to give it all at once iserjohn brother john we call him now i think of it i added he has some resemblance to your companion there  i thought that the lady was going to die and cursed myself for my awkwardness she flung her arm about the girl to save herself from fallinga poor prop for she too looked as though she were going to die having understood some if not all of my talk it must be remembered that this poor young thing had never even seen a white man before  madam madam i expostulated i pray you to bear up after living through so much sorrow it would be foolish to decease ofjoy may i call in brother john he is a clergyman and might be able to say something appropriate which i who am only a hunter cannot do  she gathered herself together opened her eyes and whispered  send him here  i pushed open the gate behind which the others were clustered catching brother john who by now had recovered somewhat by the arm i dragged him forward the two stood staring at each other and the young lady also looked with wide eyes and open mouth  elizabeth said john  she uttered a faint scream then with a cry of husband flung herself upon his breast  i slipped through the gate and shut it fast    i say allan said stephen when we had retreated to a little distance did you see her  her who which i asked  the young lady in the white clothes she is lovely  hold your tongue you donkey i answered is this a time to talk of female looks  then i went away behind the wall and literally wept for joy it was one of the happiest moments of my life for how seldom things happen as they should  also i wanted to put up a little prayer of my own a prayer of thankfulness and for strength and wit to overcome the many dangers that yet awaited us     chapter xvii                       the home of the holy flower  half an hour or so passed during which i was engaged alternately in thinking over our position and in listening to stephens rhapsodies first he dilated on the loveliness of the holy flower that he had caught a glimpse of when he climbed the wall and secondly on the beauty of the eyes of the young lady in white only by telling him that he might offend her did i persuade him not to attempt to break into the sacred enclosure where the orchid grew as we were discussing the point the gate opened and she appeared  sirs she said with a reverential bow speaking slowly and in the drollest halting english the mother and the fatheryes the fatherask will you feed  we intimated that we would feed with much pleasure and she led the way to the house saying  be not astonished at them for they are very happy too and please forgive our unleavened bread  then in the politest way possible she took me by the hand and followed by stephen we entered the house leaving mavovo and hans to watch outside  it consisted of but two rooms one for living and one for sleeping in the former we found brother john and his wife seated on a kind of couch gazing at each other in a rapt way i noted that they both looked as though they had been cryingwith happiness i suppose  elizabeth said john as we entered this is mr allan quatermain through whose resource and courage we have come together again and this young gentleman is his companion mr stephen somers  she bowed for she seemed unable to speak and held out her hand which we shook  what be resource and courage i heard her daughter whisper to stephen and why have you none o stephen somers  it would take a long time to explain he said with his jolly laugh after which i listened to no more of their nonsense  then we sat down to the meal which consisted of vegetables and a large bowl of hardboiled ducks eggs of which eatables an ample supply was carried out to hans and mavovo by stephen and hope this it seemed was the name that her mother had given to the girl when she was born in the hour of her black despair  it was an extraordinary story that mrs eversley had to tell and yet a short one  she had escaped from hassanbenmohammed and the slavetraders as the rescued slave told her husband at zanzibar before he died and after days of wandering been captured by some of the pongo who were scouring the country upon dark business of their own probably in search of captives they brought her across the lake to pongoland and the former mother of the flower an albino having died at a great age installed her in the office on this island which from that day she had never left hither she was led by the kalubi of the time and some others who had passed the god this brute however she had never seen although once she heard him roar for it did not molest them or even appear upon their journey  shortly after her arrival on the island her daughter was born on which occasion some of the women servants of the flower nursed her from that moment both she and the child were treated with the utmost care and veneration since the mother of the flower and the flower itself being in some strange way looked upon as embodiments of the natural forces of fertility this birth was held to be the best of omens for the dwindling pongo race also it was hoped that in due course the child of the flower would succeed the mother in her office so here they dwelt absolutely helpless and alone occupying themselves with superintending the agriculture of the island most fortunately also when she was captured mrs eversley had a small bible in her possession which she had never lost from this she was able to teach her child to read and all that is to be learned in the pages of holy writ  often i have thought that if i were doomed to solitary confinement for life and allowed but one book i would choose the bible since in addition to all its history and the splendour of its language it contains the record of the hope of man and therefore should be sufficient for him so at least it had proved to be in this case  oddly enough as she told us like her husband mrs eversley during all those endless years had never lost some kind of belief that she would one day be saved otherwise than by death  i always thought that you still lived and that we should meet again john i heard her say to him  also her own and her daughters spirits were mysteriously supported for after the first shock and disturbance of our arrival we found them cheerful people indeed miss hope was quite a merry soul but then she had never known any other life and human nature is very adaptable further if i may say so she had grown up a lady in the true sense of the word after all why should she not seeing that her mother the bible and nature had been her only associates and sources of information if we except the poor slaves who waited on them most of whom were mutes  when mrs eversleys story was done we told ours in a compressed form it was strange to see the wonder with which these two ladies listened to its outlines but on that i need not dwell when it was finished i heard miss hope say  so it would seem o stephen somers that it is you who are saviour to us  certainly answered stephen but why  because you see the dry holy flower far away in england and you say i must be holy father to that flower then you pay down shekels here her bible reading came in for the cost of journey and hire brave hunter to kill devilgod and bring my old whitehead parent with you oh yes you are saviour and she nodded her head at him very prettily  of course replied stephen with enthusiasm that is not exactly but it is all the same thing as i will explain later but miss hope meanwhile could you show us the flower  oh holy mother must do that if you look thereon without her you die  really said stephen without alluding to his little feat of wall climbing  well the end of it was that after a good deal of hesitation the holy mother obliged saying that as the god was dead she supposed nothing else mattered first however she went to the back of the house and clapped her hands whereon an old woman a mute and a very perfect specimen of an albino native appeared and stared at us wonderingly to her mrs eversley talked upon her fingers so rapidly that i could scarcely follow her movements the woman bowed till her forehead nearly touched the ground then rose and ran towards the water  i have sent her to fetch the paddles from the canoe said mrs eversley and to put my mark upon it now none will dare to use it to cross the lake  that is very wise i replied as we dont want news of our whereabouts to get to the motombo  next we went to the enclosure where mrs eversley with a native knife cut a string of palm fibres that was sealed with clay on to the door and one of its uprights in such a fashion that none could enter without breaking the string the impression was made with a rude seal that she wore round her neck as a badge of office it was a very curious object fashioned of gold and having deeply cut upon its face a rough image of an ape holding a flower in its right paw as it was also ancient this seemed to show that the monkey god and the orchid had been from the beginning jointly worshipped by the pongo  when she had opened the door there appeared growing in the centre of the enclosure the most lovely plant i should imagine that man ever saw it measured some eight feet across and the leaves were dark green long and narrow from its various crowns rose the scapes of bloom and oh those blooms of which there were about twelve expanded now in the flowering season the measurements made from the dried specimen i have given already so i need not repeat them i may say here however that the pongo augured the fertility or otherwise of each succeeding year from the number of the blooms on the holy flower if these were many the season would prove very fruitful if few less so while if as sometimes happened the plant failed to flower draught and famine were always said to follow truly those were glorious blossoms standing as high as a man with their back sheaths of vivid white barred with black their great pouches of burnished gold and their wide wings also of gold then in the centre of each pouch appeared the inkmark that did indeed exactly resemble the head of a monkey but if this orchid astonished me its effect upon stephen with whom this class of flower was a mania may be imagined really he went almost mad for a long while he glared at the plant and finally flung himself upon his knees causing miss hope to exclaim  what o stephen somers do you also make sacrifice to the holy flower  rather he answered ididdie for it  you are likely to before all is done i remarked with energy for i hate to see a grown man make a fool of himself theres only one thing in the world which justifies that and it isnt a flower  mavovo and hans had followed us into the enclosure and i overheard a conversation between them which amused me the gist of it was that hans explained to mavovo that the white people admired this weedhe called it a weedbecause it was like gold which was the god they really worshipped although that god was known among them by many names mavovo who was not at all interested in the affair replied with a shrug that it might be so though for his part he believed the true reason to be that the plant produced some medicine which gave courage or strength zulus i may say do not care for flowers unless they bear a fruit that is good to eat  when i had satisfied myself with the splendour of these magnificent blooms i asked mrs eversley what certain little mounds might be that were dotted about the enclosure beyond the circle of cultivated peaty soil which surrounded the orchids roots  they are the graves of the mothers of the holy flower she answered there are twelve of them and here is the spot chosen for the thirteenth which was to have been mine  to change the subject i asked another question namely if there were more such orchids growing in the country  no she replied or at least i never heard of any indeed i have always been told that this one was brought from far away generations ago also under an ancient law it is never allowed to increase any shoots it sends up beyond this ring must be cut off by me and destroyed with certain ceremonies you see that seedpod which has been left to grow on the stalk of one of last years blooms it is now ripe and on the night of the next new moon when the kalubi comes to visit me i must with much ritual burn it in his presence unless it has burst before he arrives in which case i must burn any seedlings that may spring up with almost the same ritual  i dont think the kalubi will come any more at least not while you are here indeed i am sure of it i said  as we were leaving the place acting on my general principle of making sure of anything of value when i get the chance i broke off that ripe seedpod which was of the size of an orange no one was looking at the time and as it went straight into my pocket no one missed it  then leaving stephen and the young lady to admire this cypripediumor each otherin the enclosure we three elders returned to the house to discuss matters  john and mrs eversley i said by heavens mercy you are reunited after a terrible separation of over twenty years but what is to be done now the god it is true is dead and therefore the passage of the forest will be easy but beyond it is the water which we have no means of crossing and beyond the water that old wizard the motombo sits in the mouth of his cave watching like a spider in its web and beyond the motombo and his cave are komba the new kalubi and his tribe of cannibals  cannibals interrupted mrs eversley i never knew that they were cannibals indeed i know little about the pongo whom i scarcely ever see  then madam you must take my word for it that they are also as i believe that they have every expectation of eating us now as i presume that you do not wish to spend the rest of your lives which would probably be short upon this island i want to ask how you propose to escape safely out of the pongo country  they shook their heads which were evidently empty of ideas only john stroked his white beard and inquired mildly  what have you arranged allan my dear wife and i are quite willing to leave the matter to you who are so resourceful  arranged i stuttered really john under any other circumstances then after a moments reflection i called to hans and mavovo who came and squatted down upon the verandah  now i said after i had put the case to them what have you arranged being devoid of any feasible suggestions i wished to pass on that intolerable responsibility  my father makes a mock of us said mavovo solemnly can a rat in a pit arrange how it is to get out with the dog that is waiting at the top so far we have come in safety as the rat does into the pit now i see nothing but death  thats cheerful i said your turn hans  oh baas replied the hottentot for a while i grew clever again when i thought of putting the gun intombi into the bamboo but now my head is like a rotten egg and when i try to shake wisdom out of it my brain melts and washes from side to side like the stuff in the rotten egg yet yet i have a thoughtlet us ask the missie her brain is young and not tired it may hit on something to ask the baas stephen is no good for already he is lost in other things and hans grinned feebly  more to give myself time than for any other reason i called to miss hope who had just emerged from the sacred enclosure with stephen and put the riddle to her speaking very slowly and clearly so that she might understand me to my surprise she answered at once  what is a god o mr allen is it not more than man can a god be bound in a pit for a thousand years like satan in bible if a god want to move see new country and so on who can say no  i dont quite understand i said to draw her out further although in fact i had more than a glimmering of what she meant  o allan holy flower there a god and my mother priestess if holy flower tired of this land and want to grow somewhere else why priestess not carry it and go too  capital idea i said but you see miss hope there are or were two gods one of which cannot travel  oh that very easy too put skin of god of the woods on to this man and she pointed to hans and who know difference they like as two brothers already only he smaller  shes got it by jingo shes got it exclaimed stephen in admiration  what missie say asked hans suspiciously  i told him  oh baas exclaimed hans think of the smell inside of that gods skin when the sun shines on it also the god was a very big god and i am small  then he turned and made a proposal to mavovo explaining that his stature was much better suited to the job  first will i die answered the great zulu am i who have high blood in my veins and who am a warrior to defile myself by wrapping the skin of a dead brute about me and appear as an ape before men propose it to me again spotted snake and we shall quarrel  see here hans i said mavovo is right he is a soldier and very strong in battle you also are very strong in your wits and by doing this you will make fools of all the pongo also hans it is better that you should wear the skin of a gorilla for a few hours than that i your master and all these should be killed  yes baas it is true baas though for myself i almost think that like mavovo i would rather die yet it would be sweet to deceive those pongo once again and baas i wont see you killed just to save myself another bad smell or two so if you wish it i will become a god  thus through the selfsacrifice of that good fellow hans who is the real hero of this history that matter was settled if anything could be looked on as settled in our circumstances then we arranged that we would start upon our desperate adventure at dawn on the following morning  meanwhile much remained to be done first mrs eversley summoned her attendants who to the number of twelve soon appeared in front of the verandah it was very sad to see these poor women all of whom were albinos and unpleasant to look on while quite half appeared to be deaf and dumb to these speaking as a priestess she explained that the god who dwelt in the woods was dead and that therefore she must take the holy flower which was called wife of the god and make report to the motombo of this dreadful catastrophe meanwhile they must remain on the island and continue to cultivate the fields  this order threw the poor creatures who were evidently much attached to their mistress and her daughter into a great state of consternation the eldest of them all a tall thin old lady with white wool and pink eyes who looked as stephen said like an angora rabbit prostrated herself and kissing the mothers foot asked when she would return since she and the daughter of the flower were all they had to love and without them they would die of grief  suppressing her evident emotion as best she could the mother replied that she did not know it depended on the will of heaven and the motombo then to prevent further argument she bade them bring their picks with which they worked the land also poles mats and palmstring and help to dig up the holy flower this was done under the superintendence of stephen who here was thoroughly in his element although the job proved far from easy also it was sad for all these women wept as they worked while some of them who were not dumb wailed aloud  even miss hope cried and i could see that her mother was affected with a kind of awe for twenty years she had been guardian of this plant which i think she had at last not unnaturally come to look upon with some of the same veneration that was felt for it by the whole pongo people  i fear she said lest this sacrilege should bring misfortune upon us  but brother john who held very definite views upon african superstitions quoted the second commandment to her and she became silent  we got the thing up at last or most of it with a sufficiency of earth to keep it alive injuring the roots as little as possible in the process underneath it at a depth of about three feet we found several things one of these was an ancient stone fetish that was rudely shaped to the likeness of a monkey and wore a gold crown this object which was small i still have another was a bed of charcoal and amongst the charcoal were some partially burnt bones including a skull that was very little injured this may have belonged to a woman of a low type perhaps the first mother of the flower but its general appearance reminded me of that of a gorilla i regret that there was neither time nor light to enable me to make a proper examination of these remains which we found it impossible to bring away  mrs eversley told me afterwards however that the kalubis had a tradition that the god once possessed a wife which died before the pongo migrated to their present home if so these may have been the bones of that wife when it was finally clear of the ground on which it had grown for so many generations the great plant was lifted on to a large mat and after it had been packed with wet moss by stephen in a most skilful way for he was a perfect artist at this kind of work the mat was bound round the roots in such a fashion that none of the contents could escape also each flower scape was lashed to a thin bamboo so as to prevent it from breaking on the journey then the whole bundle was lifted on to a kind of bamboo stretcher that we made and firmly secured to it with palmfibre ropes  by this time it was growing dark and all of us were tired  baas said hans to me as we were returning to the house would it not be well that mavovo and i should take some food and go sleep in the canoe these women will not hurt us there but if we do not i who have been watching them fear lest in the night they should make paddles of sticks and row across the lake to warn the pongo  although i did not like separating our small party i thought the idea so good that i consented to it and presently hans and mavovo armed with spears and carrying an ample supply of food departed to the lake side  one more incident has impressed itself upon my memory in connection with that night it was the formal baptism of hope by her father i never saw a more touching ceremony but it is one that i need not describe  stephen and i slept in the enclosure by the packed flower which he would not leave out of his sight it was as well that we did so since about twelve oclock by the light of the moon i saw the door in the wall open gently and the heads of some of the albino women appear through the aperture doubtless they had come to steal away the holy plant they worshipped i sat up coughed and lifted the rifle whereon they fled and returned no more  long before dawn brother john his wife and daughter were up and making preparations for the march packing a supply of food and so forth indeed we breakfasted by moonlight and at the first break of day after brother john had first offered up a prayer for protection departed on our journey  it was a strange outsetting and i noted that both mrs eversley and her daughter seemed sad at bidding goodbye to the spot where they had dwelt in utter solitude and peace for so many years where one of them indeed had been born and grown up to womanhood however i kept on talking to distract their thoughts and at last we were off  i arranged that although it was heavy for them the two ladies whose white robes were covered with curious cloaks made of soft prepared bark should carry the plant as far as the canoe thinking it was better that the holy flower should appear to depart in charge of its consecrated guardians i went ahead with the rifle then came the stretcher and the flower while brother john and stephen carrying the paddles brought up the rear we reached the canoe without accident and to our great relief found mavovo and hans awaiting us i learned however that it was fortunate they had slept in the boat since during the night the albino women arrived with the evident object of possessing themselves of it and only ran away when they saw that it was guarded as we were making ready the canoe those unhappy slaves appeared in a body and throwing themselves upon their faces with piteous words or those of them who could not speak by signs implored the mother not to desert them till both she and hope began to cry but there was no help for it so we pushed off as quickly as we could leaving the albinos weeping and wailing upon the bank  i confess that i too felt compunction at abandoning them thus but what could we do i only trust that no harm came to them but of course we never heard anything as to their fate  on the further side of the lake we hid away the canoe in the bushes where we had found it and began our march stephen and mavovo being the two strongest among us now carried the plant and although stephen never murmured at its weight how the zulu did swear after the first few hours i could fill a page with his objurgations at what he considered an act of insanity and if i had space should like to do so for really some of them were most amusing had it not been for his friendship for stephen i think that he would have thrown it down  we crossed the garden of the god where mrs eversley told me the kalubi must scatter the sacred seed twice a year thus confirming the story that we had heard it seems that it was then as he made his long journey through the forest that the treacherous and horrid brute which we had killed would attack the priest of whom it had grown weary but and this shows the animals cunning the onslaught always took place after he had sown the seed which would in due season produce the food it ate our kalubi it is true was killed before we had reached the garden which seems an exception to the rule perhaps however the gorilla knew that his object in visiting it was not to provide for its needs or perhaps our presence excited it to immediate action  who can analyse the motives of a gorilla  these attacks were generally spread over a year and a half on the first occasion the god which always accompanied the priest to the garden and back again would show animosity by roaring at him on the second he would seize his hand and bite off one of the fingers as happened to our kalubi a wound that generally caused death from blood poisoning if however the priest survived on the third visit it killed him for the most part by crushing his head in its mighty jaws when making these visits the kalubi was accompanied by certain dedicated youths some of whom the god always put to death those who had made the journey six times without molestation were selected for further special trials until at last only two remained who were declared to have passed or been accepted by the god these youths were treated with great honour as in the instance of komba and on the destruction of the kalubi one of them took his office which he generally filled without much accident for a minimum of ten years and perhaps much longer  mrs eversley knew nothing of the sacramental eating of the remains of the kalubi or of the final burial of his bones in the wooden coffins that we had seen for such things although they undoubtedly happened were kept from her she added that each of the three kalubis whom she had known ultimately went almost mad through terror at his approaching end especially after the preliminary roarings and the biting off of the finger in truth uneasy lay the head that wore a crown in pongoland a crown that mind you might not be refused upon pain of death by torture personally i can imagine nothing more terrible than the haunted existence of these poor kings whose pomp and power must terminate in such a fashion  i asked her whether the motombo ever visited the god she answered yes once in every five years then after many mystic ceremonies he spent a week in the forest at a time of full moon one of the kalubis had told her that on this occasion he had seen the motombo and the god sitting together under a tree each with his arm round the others neck and apparently talking like brothers with the exception of certain tales of its almost supernatural cunning this was all that i could learn about the god of the pongos which i have sometimes been tempted to believe was really a devil hid in the body of a huge and ancient ape  no there was one more thing which i quote because it bears out babembas story it seems that captives from other tribes were sometimes turned into the forest that the god might amuse itself by killing them this indeed was the fate to which we ourselves had been doomed in accordance with the hateful pongo custom  certainly thought i to myself when she had done i did a good deed in sending that monster to whatever dim region it was destined to inhabit where i sincerely trust it found all the dead kalubis and its other victims ready to give it an appropriate welcome    after crossing the gods garden we came to the clearing of the fallen tree and found the brutes skin pegged out as we had left it though shrunken in size only it had evidently been visited by a horde of the forest ants which fortunately for hans had eaten away every particle of flesh while leaving the hide itself absolutely untouched i suppose because it was too tough for them i never saw a neater job moreover these industrious little creatures had devoured the beast itself nothing remained of it except the clean white bones lying in the exact position in which we had left the carcase atom by atom that marching myriad army had eaten all and departed on its way into the depths of the forest leaving this sign of their passage  how i wished that we could carry off the huge skeleton to add to my collection of trophies but this was impossible as brother john said any museum would have been glad to purchase it for hundreds of pounds for i do not suppose that its like exists in the world but it was too heavy all i could do was to impress its peculiarities upon my mind by a close study of the mighty bones also i picked out of the upper right arm and kept the bullet i had fired when it carried off the kalubi this i found had sunk into and shattered the bone but without absolutely breaking it  on we went again bearing with us the gods skin having first stuffed the head hands and feet these i mean the hands and feet had been cleaned out by the ants with wet moss in order to preserve their shape it was no light burden at least so declared brother john and hans who bore it between them upon a dead bough from the fallen tree  of the rest of our journey to the waters edge there is nothing to tell except that notwithstanding our loads we found it easier to walk down that steep mountain side than it had been to ascend the same still our progress was but slow and when at length we reached the buryingplace only about an hour remained to sunset there we sat down to rest and eat also to discuss the situation  what was to be done the arm of stagnant water lay near to us but we had no boat with which to cross to the further shore and what was that shore a cave where a creature who seemed to be but halfhuman sat watching like a spider in its web do not let it be supposed that this question of escape had been absent from our minds on the contrary we had even thought of trying to drag the canoe in which we crossed to and from the island of the flower through the forest the idea was abandoned however because we found that being hollowed from a single log with a bottom four or five inches thick it was impossible for us to carry it so much as fifty yards what then could we do without a boat swimming seemed to be out of the question because of the crocodiles also on inquiry i discovered that of the whole party stephen and i alone could swim further there was no wood of which to make a raft  i called to hans and leaving the rest in the graveyard where we knew that they were safe we went down to the edge of the water to study the situation being careful to keep ourselves hidden behind the reeds and bushes of the mangrove tribe with which it was fringed not that there was much fear of our being seen for the day which had been very hot was closing in and a great storm heralded by black and bellying clouds was gathering fast conditions which must render us practically invisible at a distance  we looked at the dark slimy wateralso at the crocodiles which sat upon its edge in dozens waiting eternally waiting for what i wondered we looked at the sheer opposing cliff but save where a black hole marked the cave mouth far as the eye could see the water came up against it as that of a moat does against the wall of a castle obviously therefore the only line of escape ran through this cave for as i have explained the channel by which i presume babemba reached the open lake was now impracticable lastly we searched to see if there was any fallen log upon which we could possibly propel ourselves to the other side and foundnothing that could be made to serve no nor as i have said any dry reeds or brushwood out of which we might fashion a raft  unless we can get a boat here we must stay i remarked to hans who was seated with me behind a screen of rushes at the waters edge  he made no answer and as i thought in a sort of subconscious way i engaged myself in watching a certain tragedy of the insect world between two stout reeds a forest spider of the very largest sort had spun a web as big as a ladys open parasol there in the midst of this web of which the bottom strands almost touched the water sat the spider waiting for its prey as the crocodiles were waiting on the banks as the great ape had waited for the kalubis as death waits for life as the motombo was waiting for god knows what  it rather resembled the motombo in his cave did that huge black spider with just a little patch of white upon its head or so i thought fancifully enough then came the tragedy a great white moth of the hawk species began to dart to and fro between the reeds and presently struck the web on its lower side some three inches above the water like a flash that spider was upon it it embraced the victim with its long legs to still its tremendous battlings next descending below it began to make the body fast when something happened from the still surface of the water beneath poked up the mouth of a very large fish which quite quietly closed upon the spider and sank again into the depths taking with it a portion of the web and thereby setting the big moth free with a struggle it loosed itself fell on to a piece of wood and floated away apparently little the worse for the encounter  did you see that baas said hans pointing to the broken and empty web while you were thinking i was praying to your reverend father the predikant who taught me how to do it and he has sent us a sign from the place of fire  even then i could not help laughing to myself as i pictured what my dear fathers face would be like if he were able to hear his converts remarks an analysis of hanss religious views would be really interesting and i only regret that i never made one but sticking to business i merely asked  what sign  baas this sign that web is the motombos cave the big spider is the motombo the white moth is us baas who are caught in the web and going to be eaten  very pretty hans i said but what is the fish that came up and swallowed the spider so that the moth fell on the wood and floated away  baas you are the fish who come up softly softly out of the water in the dark and shoot the motombo with the little rifle and then the rest of us who are the moth fall into the canoe and float away there is a storm about to break baas and who will see you swim the stream in the storm and the night  the crocodiles i suggested  baas i didnt see a crocodile eat the fish i think the fish is laughing down there with the fat spider in its stomach also when there is a storm crocodiles go to bed because they are afraid lest the lightning should kill them for their sins  now i remembered that i had often heard and indeed to some extent noted that these great reptiles do vanish in disturbed weather probably because their food hides away however that might be in an instant i made up my mind  as soon as it was quite dark i would swim the water holding the little rifle intombi above my head and try to steal the canoe if the old wizard was watching which i hoped might not be the case well i must deal with him as best i could i knew the desperate nature of the expedient but there was no other way if we could not get a boat we must remain in that foodless forest until we starved or if we returned to the island of the flower there ere long we should certainly be attacked and destroyed by komba and the pongos when they came to look for our bodies  ill try it hans i said  yes baas i thought you would id come too only i cant swim and when i was drowning i might make a noise because one forgets oneself then baas but it will be all right for if it were otherwise i am sure that your reverend father would have shown us so in the sign the moth floated off quite comfortably on the wood and just now i saw it spread its wings and fly away and the fish ah how he laughs with that fat old spider in his stomach     chapter xviii                                fate stabs  we went back to the others whom we found crouched on the ground among the coffins looking distinctly depressed no wonder night was closing in the thunder was beginning to growl and echo through the forest and rain to fall in big drops in short although stephen remarked that every cloud has a silver lining a proverb which as i told him i seemed to have heard before in no sense could the outlook be considered bright  well allan what have you arranged asked brother john with a faint attempt at cheerfulness as he let go of his wifes hand in those days he always seemed to be holding his wifes hand  oh i answered i am going to get the canoe so that we can all row over comfortably  they stared at me and miss hope who was seated by stephen asked in her usual biblical language  have you the wings of a dove that you can fly o mr allan  no i answered but i have the fins of a fish or something like them and i can swim  now there arose a chorus of expostulation  you shant risk it said stephen i can swim as well as you and im younger ill go i want a bath  that you will have o stephen interrupted miss hope as i thought in some alarm the latter rain from heaven will make you clean by now it was pouring  yes stephen you can swim i said but you will forgive me for saying that you are not particularly deadly with a rifle and clean shooting may be the essence of this business now listen to me all of you i am going i hope that i shall succeed but if i fail it does not so very much matter for you will be no worse off than you were before there are three pairs of you john and his wife stephen and miss hope mavovo and hans if the odd man of the party comes to grief you will have to choose a new captain that is all but while i lead i mean to be obeyed  then mavovo to whom hans had been talking spoke  my father macumazana is a brave man if he lives he will have done his duty if he dies he will have done his duty still better and on the earth or in the underworld among the spirits of our fathers his name shall be great for ever yes his name shall be a song  when brother john had translated these words which i thought fine there was silence  now i said come with me to the waters edge all of you you will be in less danger from the lightning there where are no tall trees and while i am gone do you ladies dress up hans in that gorillaskin as best you can lacing it on to him with some of that palmfibre string which we brought with us and filling out the hollows and the head with leaves or reeds i want him to be ready when i come back with the canoe  hans groaned audibly but made no objection and we started with our impedimenta down to the edge of the estuary where we hid behind a clump of mangrove bushes and tall feathery reeds then i took off some of my clothes stripping in fact to my flannel shirt and the cotton pants i wore both of which were grey in colour and therefore almost invisible at night  now i was ready and hans handed me the little rifle  it is at full cock baas with the catch on he said and carefully loaded also i have wrapped the lining of my hat which is very full of grease for the hair makes grease especially in hot weather baas round the lock to keep away the wet from the cap and powder it is not tied baas only twisted give the rifle a shake and it will fall off  i understand i said and gripped the gun with my left hand by the tongue just forward of the hammer in such a fashion that the horrid greased rag from hanss hat was held tight over the lock and cap then i shook hands with the others and when i came to miss hope i am proud to add that she spontaneously and of her own accord imprinted a kiss upon my mediaeval brow i felt inclined to return it but did not  it is the kiss of peace o allan she said may you go and return in peace  thank you i said but get on with dressing hans in his new clothes  stephen muttered something about feeling ashamed of himself brother john put up a vigorous and welldirected prayer mavovo saluted with the copper assegai and began to give me sibonga or zulu titles of praise beneath his breath and mrs eversley said  oh i thank god that i have lived to see a brave english gentleman again which i thought a great compliment to my nation and myself though when i afterwards discovered that she herself was english by birth it took off some of the polish  next just after a vivid flash of lightning for the storm had broken in earnest now i ran swiftly to the waters edge accompanied by hans who was determined to see the last of me  get back hans before the lightning shows you i said as i slid gently from a mangroveroot into that filthy stream and tell them to keep my coat and trousers dry if they can  goodbye baas he murmured and i heard that he was sobbing keep a good heart o baas of baases after all this is nothing to the vultures of the hill of slaughter intombi pulled us through then and so she will again for she knows who can hold her straight  that was the last i heard of hans for if he said any more the hiss of the torrential rain smothered his words  oh i had tried to keep a good heart before the others but it is beyond my powers to describe the deadly fright i felt perhaps the worst of all my life which is saying a great deal here i was starting on one of the maddest ventures that was ever undertaken by man i neednt put its points again but that which appealed to me most at the moment was the crocodiles i have always hated crocodiles sincewell never mindand the place was as full of them as the ponds at ascension are of turtles  still i swam on the estuary was perhaps two hundred yards wide not more no great distance for a good swimmer as i was in those days but then i had to hold the rifle above the water with my left hand at all cost for if once it went beneath it would be useless also i was desperately afraid of being seen in the lightning flashes although to minimise this risk i had kept my darkcoloured cloth hat upon my head lastly there was the lightning itself to fear for it was fearful and continuous and seemed to be striking along the water it was a fact that a fireball or something of the sort hit the surface within a few yards of me as though it had aimed at the riflebarrel and just missed or so i thought though it may have been a crocodile rising at the moment  in one way or rather in two however i was lucky the first was the complete absence of wind which must have raised waves that might have swamped me and would at any rate have wetted the rifle the second was that there was no fear of my losing my path for in the mouth of the cave i could see the glow of the fires which burned on either side of the motombos seat they served the same purpose to me as did the lamp of the lady called hero to her lover leander when he swam the hellespont to pay her clandestine visits at night but he had something pleasant to look forward to whereas i still there was another point in common between us hero if i remember right was a priestess of the greek goddess of love whereas the party who waited me was also in a religious line of business only as i firmly believe he was a priest of the devil  i suppose that swim took me about a quarterofanhour for i went slowly to save my strength although the crocodiles suggested haste but thank heaven they never appeared to complicate matters now i was quite near the cave and now i was beneath the overhanging roof and in the shallow water of the little bay that formed a harbour for the canoe i stood upon my feet on the rock bottom the water coming up to my breast and peered about me while i rested and worked my left arm stiff with the upholding of the gun to and fro the fires had burnt somewhat low and until my eyes were freed from the raindrops and grew accustomed to the light of the place i could not see clearly  i took the rag from round the lock of the rifle wiped the wet off the barrel with it and let it fall then i loosed the catch and by touching a certain mechanism made the rifle hairtriggered now i looked again and began to make out things there was the platform and there alas on it sat the toadlike motombo but his back was to me he was gazing not towards the water but down the cave i hesitated for one fateful moment perhaps the priest was asleep perhaps i could get the canoe away without shooting i did not like the job moreover his head was held forward and invisible and how was i to make certain of killing him with a shot in the back lastly if possible i wished to avoid firing because of the report  at that instant the motombo wheeled round some instinct must have warned him of my presence for the silence was gravelike save for the soft splash of the rain without as he turned the lightning blazed and he saw me  it is the white man he muttered to himself in his hissing whisper while i waited through the following darkness with the rifle at my shoulder the white man who shot me long long ago and again he has a gun oh fate stabs doubtless the god is dead and i too must die  then as if some doubt struck him he lifted the horn to summon help  again the lightning flashed and was accompanied by a fearful crack of thunder with a prayer for skill i covered his head and fired by the glare of it just as the trumpet touched his lips it fell from his hand he seemed to shrink together and moved no more  oh thank god thank god in this supreme moment of trial the art of which i am a master had not failed me if my hand had shaken ever so little if my nerves strained to breaking point had played me false in the least degree if the rag from hanss hat had not sufficed to keep away the damp from the cap and powder well this history would never have been written and there would have been some more bones in the graveyard of the kalubis that is all  for a moment i waited expecting to see the women attendants dart from the doorways in the sides of the cave and to hear them sound a shrill alarm none appeared and i guessed that the rattle of the thunder had swallowed up the crack of the rifle a noise be it remembered that none of them had ever heard for an unknown number of years this ancient creature i suppose had squatted day and night upon that platform whence i daresay it was difficult for him to move so after they had wrapped his furs round him at sunset and made up the fires to keep him warm why should his women come to disturb him unless he called them with his horn probably it was not even lawful that they should do so  somewhat reassured i waded forward a few paces and loosed the canoe which was tied by the prow then i scrambled into it and laying down the rifle took one of the paddles and began to push out of the creek just then the lightning flared once more and by it i caught sight of the motombos face that was now within a few feet of my own it seemed to be resting almost on his knees and its appearance was dreadful in the centre of the forehead was a blue mark where the bullet had entered for i had made no mistake in that matter the deepset round eyes were open and all their fire gone seemed to stare at me from beneath the overhanging brows the massive jaw had fallen and the red tongue hung out upon the pendulous lip the leatherlike skin of the bloated cheeks had assumed an ashen hue still streaked and mottled with brown  oh the thing was horrible and sometimes when i am out of sorts it haunts me to this day yet that creatures blood does not lie heavy on my mind of it my conscience is not afraid his end was necessary to save the innocent and i am sure that it was well deserved for he was a devil akin to the great god ape i had slain in the forest to whom by the way he bore a most remarkable resemblance in death indeed if their heads had been laid side by side at a little distance it would not have been too easy to tell them apart with their projecting brows beardless retreating chins and yellow tushes at the corners of the mouth  presently i was clear of the cave still for a while i lay to at one side of it against the towering cliff both to listen in case what i had done should be discovered and for fear lest the lightning which was still bright although the storm centre was rapidly passing away should reveal me to any watchers  for quite ten minutes i hid thus and then determining to risk it paddled softly towards the opposite bank keeping however a little to the west of the cave and taking my line by a certain very tall tree which as i had noted towered up against the sky at the back of the graveyard  as it happened my calculations were accurate and in the end i directed the bow of the canoe into the rushes behind which i had left my companions just then the moon began to struggle out through the thinning rainclouds and by its light they saw me and i saw what for a moment i took to be the gorillagod himself waddling forward to seize the boat there was the dreadful brute exactly as he had appeared in the forest except that it seemed a little smaller  then i remembered and laughed and that laugh did me a world of good  is that you baas said a muffled voice speaking apparently from the middle of the gorilla are you safe baas  of course i answered or how should i be here adding cheerfully are you comfortable in that nice warm skin on this wet night hans  oh baas answered the voice tell me what happened even in this stink i burn to know  death happened to the motombo hans here stephen give me your hand and my clothes and mavovo hold the rifle and the canoe while i put them on  then i landed and stepping into the reeds pulled off my wet shirt and pants which i stuffed away into the big pockets of my shooting coat for i did not want to lose them and put on the dry things that although scratchy were quite good enough clothing in that warm climate after this i treated myself to a good sup of brandy from the flask and ate some food which i seemed to require then i told them the story and cutting short their demonstrations of wonder and admiration bade them place the holy flower in the canoe and get in themselves next with the help of hans who poked out his fingers through the skin of the gorillas arms i carefully reloaded the rifle setting the last cap on the nipple this done i joined them in the canoe taking my seat in the prow and bidding brother john and stephen paddle  making a circuit to avoid observation as before in a very short time we reached the mouth of the cave i leant forward and peeped round the western wall of rock nobody seemed to be stirring there the fires burned dimly there the huddled shape of the motombo still crouched upon the platform silently silently we disembarked and i formed our procession while the others looked askance at the horrible face of the dead motombo  i headed it then came the mother of the flower followed by hans playing his part of the god of the forest then brother john and stephen carrying the holy flower after it walked hope while mavovo brought up the rear near to one of the fires as i had noted on our first passage of the cave lay a pile of the torches which i have already mentioned we lit some of them and at a sign from me mavovo dragged the canoe back into its little dock and tied the cord to its post its appearance there apparently undisturbed might i thought make our crossing of the water seem even more mysterious all this while i watched the doors in the sides of the cave expecting every moment to see the women rush out but none came perhaps they slept or perhaps they were absent i do not know to this day  we started and in solemn silence threaded our way down the windings of the cave extinguishing our torches as soon as we saw light at its inland outlet at a few paces from its mouth stood a sentry his back was towards the cave and in the uncertain gleams of the moon struggling with the clouds for a thin rain still fell he never noted us till we were right on to him then he turned and saw and at the awful sight of this procession of the gods of his land threw up his arms and without a word fell senseless although i never asked i think that mavovo took measures to prevent his awakening at any rate when i looked back later on i observed that he was carrying a big pongo spear with a long shaft instead of the copper weapon which he had taken from one of the coffins  on we marched towards rica town following the easy path by which we had come as i have said the country was very deserted and the inhabitants of such huts as we passed were evidently fast asleep also there were no dogs in this land to awake them with their barking between the cave and rica we were not i think seen by a single soul  through that long night we pushed on as fast was we could travel only stopping now and again for a few minutes to rest the bearers of the holy flower indeed at times mrs eversley relieved her husband at this task but stephen being very strong carried his end of the stretcher throughout the whole journey  hans of course was much oppressed by the great weight of the gorilla skin which although it had shrunk a good deal remained as heavy as ever but he was a tough old fellow and on the whole got on better than might have been expected though by the time we reached the town he was sometimes obliged to follow the example of the god itself and help himself forward with his hands going on all fours as a gorilla generally does  we reached the broad long street of rica about half an hour before dawn and proceeded down it till we were past the feasthouse still quite unobserved for as yet none were stirring on that wet morning indeed it was not until we were within a hundred yards of the harbour that a woman possessed of the virtue or vice of early rising who had come from a hut to work in her garden saw us and raised an awful piercing scream  the gods she screamed the gods are leaving the land and taking the white men with them  instantly there arose a hubbub in the houses heads were thrust out of the doors and people ran into the gardens every one of whom began to yell till one might have thought that a massacre was in progress but as yet no one came near us for they were afraid  push on i cried or all is lost  they answered nobly hans struggled forward on all fours for he was nearly done and his hideous garment was choking him while stephen and brother john exhausted though they were with the weight of the great plant actually broke into a feeble trot we came to the harbour and there tied to the wharf was the same canoe in which we had crossed to pongoland we sprang into it and cut the fastenings with my knife having no time to untie them and pushed off from the wharf  by now hundreds of people among them many soldiers were hard upon and indeed around us but still they seemed too frightened to do anything so far the inspiration of hans disguise had saved us in the midst of them by the light of the rising sun i recognised komba who ran up a great spear in his hand and for a moment halted amazed  then it was that the catastrophe happened which nearly cost us all our lives  hans who was in the stern of the canoe began to faint from exhaustion and in his efforts to obtain air for the heat and stench of the skin were overpowering him thrust his head out through the lacings of the hide beneath the reedstuffed mask of the gorilla which fell over languidly upon his shoulder komba saw his ugly little face and knew it again  it is a trick he roared these white devils have killed the god and stolen the holy flower and its priestess the yellow man is wrapped in the skin of the god to the boats to the boats  paddle i shouted to brother john and stephen paddle for your lives mavovo help me get up the sail  as it chanced on that stormy morning the wind was blowing strongly towards the mainland  we laboured at the mast shipped it and hauled up the mat sail but slowly for we were awkward at the business by the time that it began to draw the paddles had propelled us about four hundred yards from the wharf whence many canoes with their sails already set were starting in pursuit standing in the prow of the first of these and roaring curses and vengeance at us was komba the new kalubi who shook a great spear above his head  an idea occurred to me who knew that unless something were done we must be overtaken and killed by these skilled boatmen leaving mavovo to attend to the sail i scrambled aft and thrusting aside the fainting hans knelt down in the stern of the canoe there was still one charge or rather one cap left and i meant to use it i put up the largest flapsight lifted the little rifle and covered komba aiming at the point of his chin intombi was not sighted for or meant to use at this great distance and only by this means of allowing for the drop of the bullet could i hope to hit the man in the body  the sail was drawing well now and steadied the boat also being still under the shelter of the land the water was smooth as that of a pond so really i had a very good firing platform moreover weary though i was my vital forces rose to the emergency and i felt myself grow rigid as a statue lastly the light was good for the sun rose behind me its level rays shining full on to my mark i held my breath and touched the trigger the charge exploded sweetly and almost at the instant as the smoke drifted to one side i saw komba throw up his arms and fall backwards into the canoe then quite a long while afterwards or so it seemed the breeze brought the faint sound of the thud of that fateful bullet to our ears  though perhaps i ought not to say so it was really a wonderful shot in all the circumstances for as i learned afterwards the ball struck just where i hoped that it might in the centre of the breast piercing the heart indeed taking everything into consideration i think that those four shots which i fired in pongoland are the real record of my career as a marksman the first at night broke the arm of the gorilla god and would have killed him had not the charge hung fire and given him time to protect his head the second did kill him in the midst of a great scrimmage when everything was moving the third fired by the glare of lightning after a long swim slew the motombo and the fourth loosed at this great distance from a moving boat was the bane of that coldblooded and treacherous man komba who thought that he had trapped us to pongoland to be murdered and eaten as a sacrifice lastly there was always the consciousness that no mistake must be made since with but four percussion caps it could not be retrieved  i am sure that i could not have done so well with any other rifle however modern and accurate it might be but to this little purdey weapon i had been accustomed from my youth and that as any marksman will know means a great deal i seemed to know it and it seemed to know me it hangs on my wall to this day although of course i never use it now in our breechloading era unfortunately however a local gunsmith to whom i sent it to have the lock cleaned rebrowned it and scraped and varnished the stock etc without authority making it look almost new again i preferred it in its worn and scratched condition  to return the sound of the shot like that of john peels horn aroused hans from his sleep he thrust his head between my legs and saw komba fall  oh beautiful baas beautiful he said faintly i am sure that the ghost of your reverend father cannot kill his enemies more nicely down there among the fires beautiful and the silly old fellow fell to kissing my boots or what remained of them after which i gave him the last of the brandy  this quite brought him to himself again especially when he was free from that filthy skin and had washed his head and hands  the effect of the death of komba upon the pongos was very strange all the other canoes clustered round that in which he lay then after a hurried consultation they hauled down their sails and paddled back to the wharf why they did this i cannot tell perhaps they thought that he was bewitched or only wounded and required the attentions of a medicineman perhaps it was not lawful for them to proceed except under the guidance of some reserve kalubi who had passed the god and who was on shore perhaps it was necessary according to their rites that the body of their chief should be landed with certain ceremonies i do not know it is impossible to be sure as to the mysterious motives that actuate many of these remote african tribes  at any rate the result was that it gave us a great start and a chance of life who must otherwise have died upon the spot outside the bay the breeze blew merrily taking us across the lake at a spanking pace until about midday when it began to fall fortunately however it did not altogether drop till three oclock by which time the coast of mazituland was comparatively near we could even distinguish a speck against the skyline which we knew was the union jack that stephen had set upon the crest of a little hill  during those hours of peace we ate the food that remained to us washed ourselves as thoroughly as we could and rested well was it in view of what followed that we had this time of repose for just as the breeze was failing i looked aft and there coming up behind us still holding the wind was the whole fleet of pongo canoes thirty or forty of them perhaps each carrying an average of about twenty men we sailed on for as long as we could for though our progress was but slow it was quicker than what we could have made by paddling also it was necessary that we should save our strength for the last trial  i remember that hour very well for in the nervous excitement of it every little thing impressed itself upon my mind i remember even the shape of the clouds that floated over us remnants of the storm of the previous night one was like a castle with a brokendown turret showing a staircase within another had a fantastic resemblance to a wrecked ship with a hole in her starboard bow two of her masts broken and one standing with some fragments of sails flapping from it and so forth  then there was the general aspect of the great lake especially at a spot where two currents met causing little waves which seemed to fight with each other and fall backwards in curious curves also there were shoals of small fish something like chub in shape with round mouths and very white stomachs which suddenly appeared upon the surface jumping at invisible flies these attracted a number of birds that resembled gulls of a light build they had coalblack heads white backs greyish wings and slightly webbed feet pink as coral with which they seized the small fish uttering as they did so a peculiar and plaintive cry that ended in a longdrawn eeé the father of the flock whose head seemed to be white like his back perhaps from age hung above them not troubling to fish himself but from time to time forcing one of the company to drop what he had caught which he retrieved before it reached the water such are some of the small things that come back to me though there were others too numerous and trivial to mention  when the breeze failed us at last we were perhaps something over three miles from the shore or rather from the great bed of reeds which at this spot grow in the shallows off the mazitu coast to a breadth of seven or eight hundred yards where the water becomes too deep for them the pongos were then about a mile and a half behind but as the wind favoured them for a few minutes more and having plenty of hands they could help themselves on by paddling when at last it died to a complete calm the distance between us was not more than one mile this meant that they must cover four miles of water while we covered three  letting down our now useless sail and throwing it and the mast overboard to lighten the canoe since the sky showed us that there was no more hope of wind we began to paddle as hard as we could fortunately the two ladies were able to take their share in this exercise since they had learned it upon the lake of the flower where it seemed they kept a private canoe upon the other side of the island which was used for fishing hans who was still weak we set to steer with a paddle aft which he did in a somewhat erratic fashion  a stern chase is proverbially a long chase but still the enemy with their skilled rowers came up fast when we were a mile from the reeds they were within half a mile of us and as we tired the proportion of distance lessened when we were two hundred yards from the reeds they were not more than fifty or sixty yards behind and then the real struggle began  it was short but terrible we threw everything we could overboard including the ballast stones at the bottom of the canoe and the heavy hide of the gorilla this as it proved was fortunate since the thing sank but slowly and the foremost pongo boats halted a minute to recover so precious a relic checking the others behind them a circumstance that helped us by twenty or thirty yards  over with the plant i said  but stephen looking quite old from exhaustion and with the sweat streaming from him as he laboured at his unaccustomed paddle gasped  for heavens sake no after all we have gone through to get it  so i didnt insist indeed there was neither time nor breath for argument  now we were in the reeds for thanks to the flag which guided us we had struck the big hippopotamus lane exactly and the pongos paddling like demons were about thirty yards behind thankful was i that those interesting people had never learned the use of bows and arrows and that their spears were too heavy to throw by now or rather some time before old babemba and the mazitu had seen us as had our zulu hunters crowds of them were wading through the shallows towards us yelling encouragements as they came the zulus too opened a rather wild fire with the result that one of the bullets struck our canoe and another touched the brim of my hat a third however killed a pongo which caused some confusion in the ranks of tusculum  but we were done and they came on remorselessly when their leading boat was not more than ten yards from us and we were perhaps two hundred from the shore i drove my paddle downwards and finding that the water was less than four feet deep shouted  overboard all and wade its our last chance  we scrambled out of that canoe the prow of which as i left it the last i pushed round across the waterlane to obstruct those of the pongo now i think all would have gone well had it not been for stephen who after he had floundered forward a few paces in the mud bethought him of his beloved orchid not only did he return to try to rescue it he also actually persuaded his friend mavovo to accompany him they got back to the boat and began to lift the plant out when the pongo fell upon them striking at them with their spears over the width of our canoe mavovo struck back with the weapon he had taken from the pongo sentry at the cave mouth and killed or wounded one of them then some one hurled a ballast stone at him which caught him on the side of the head and knocked him down into the water whence he rose and reeled back almost senseless till some of our people got hold of him and dragged him to the shore  so stephen was left alone dragging at the great orchid till a pongo reaching over the canoe drove a spear through his shoulder he let go of the orchid because he must and tried to retreat too late half a dozen or more of the pongo pushed themselves between the stern or bow of our canoe and the reeds and waded forward to kill him i could not help for to tell the truth at the moment i was stuck in a mudhole made by the hoof of a hippopotamus while the zulu hunters and the mazitu were as yet too far off surely he must have died had it not been for the courage of the girl hope who while wading shorewards a little in front of me had turned and seen his plight back she came literally bounding through the water like a leopard whose cubs are in danger  reaching stephen before the pongo she thrust herself between him and them and proceeded to address them with the utmost vigour in their own language which of course she had learned from those of the albinos who were not mutes  what she said i could not exactly catch because of the shouts of the advancing mazitu i gathered however that she was anathematizing them in the words of some old and potent curse that was only used by the guardians of the holy flower which consigned them body and spirit to a dreadful doom the effect of this malediction which by the way neither the young lady nor her mother would repeat to me afterwards was certainly remarkable those men who heard it among them the wouldbe slayers of stephen stayed their hands and even inclined their heads towards the young priestess as though in reverence or deprecation and thus remained for sufficient time for her to lead the wounded stephen out of danger this she did wading backwards by his side and keeping her eyes fixed full upon the pongo it was perhaps the most curious rescue that i ever saw  the holy flower i should add they recaptured and carried off for i saw it departing in one of their canoes that was the end of my orchid hunt and of the money which i hoped to make by the sale of this floral treasure i wonder what became of it i have good reason to believe that it was never replanted on the island of the flower so perhaps it was borne back to the dim and unknown land in the depths of africa whence the pongo are supposed to have brought it when they migrated  after this incident of the wounding and the rescue of stephen by the intrepid miss hope whose interest in him was already strong enough to induce her to risk her life upon his behalf all we fugitives were dragged ashore somehow by our friends here hans i and the ladies collapsed exhausted though brother john still found sufficient strength to do what he could for the injured stephen and mavovo  then the battle of the reeds began and a fierce fray it was the pongos who were about equal in numbers to our people came on furiously for they were mad at the death of their god with his priest the motombo of which i think news had reached them and at the carrying off of the mother of the flower springing from their canoes because the waterway was too narrow for more than one of these to travel at a time they plunged into the reeds with the intention of wading ashore here their hereditary enemies the mazitu attacked them under the command of old babemba the struggle that ensued partook more of the nature of a series of handtohand fights than of a set battle it was extraordinary to see the heads of the combatants moving among the reeds as they stabbed at each other with the great spears till one went down there were few wounded in that fray for those who fell sank in the mud and water and were drowned  on the whole the pongo who were operating in what was almost their native element were getting the best of it and driving the mazitu back but what decided the day against them were the guns of our zulu hunters although i could not lift a rifle myself i managed to collect these men round me and to direct their fire which proved so terrifying to the pongos that after ten or a dozen of them had been knocked over they began to give back sullenly and were helped into their canoes by those men who were left in charge of them  then at length at a signal they got out their paddles and still shouting curses and defiance at us rowed away till they became but specks upon the bosom of the great lake and vanished  two of the canoes we captured however and with them six or seven pongos these the mazitu wished to put to death but at the bidding of brother john whose orders it will be remembered had the same authority in mazituland as those of the king they bound their arms and made them prisoners instead  in about half an hour it was all over but of the rest of that day i cannot write as i think i fainted from utter exhaustion which was not perhaps wonderful considering all that we had undergone in the four and a half days that had elapsed since we first embarked upon the great lake for constant strain physical and mental i recall no such four days during the whole of my adventurous life it was indeed wonderful that we came through them alive  the last thing i remember was the appearance of sammy looking very smart in his blue cotton smock who now that the fighting was over emerged like a butterfly when the sun shines after rain  oh mr quatermain he said i welcome you home again after arduous exertions and looking into the eyes of bloody war all the days of absence and a good part of the nights too while the mosquitoes hunted slumber i prayed for your safety like one oclock and perhaps mr quatermain that helped to do the trick for what says poet those who serve and wait are almost as good as those who cook dinner  such were the words which reached and oddly enough impressed themselves upon my darkening brain or rather they were part of the words excerpts from a long speech that there is no doubt sammy had carefully prepared during our absence     chapter xix                           the true holy flower  when i came to myself again it was to find that i had slept fifteen or sixteen hours for the sun of a new day was high in the heavens i was lying in a little shelter of boughs at the foot of that mound on which we flew the flag that guided us back over the waters of the lake kirua near by was hans consuming a gigantic meal of meat which he had cooked over a neighbouring fire with him to my delight i saw mavovo his head bound up though otherwise but little the worse the stone which probably would have killed a thinskulled white man had done no more than knock him stupid and break the skin of his scalp perhaps because the force of it was lessened by the gum mansring which like most zulus of a certain age or dignity he wore woven in his hair  the two tents we had brought with us to the lake were pitched not far away and looked quite pretty and peaceful there in the sunlight  hans who was watching me out of the corner of his eye ran to me with a large pannikin of hot coffee which sammy had made ready against my awakening for they knew that my sleep was or had become of a natural order i drank it to the last drop and in all my life never did i enjoy anything more then while i began upon some pieces of the toasted meat i asked him what had happened  not much baas he answered except that we are alive who should be dead the maam and the missie are still asleep in that tent or at least the maam is for the missie is helping dogeetah her father to nurse baas stephen who has an ugly wound the pongos have gone and i think will not return for they have had enough of the white mans guns the mazitu have buried those of their dead whom they could recover and have sent their wounded of whom there were only six back to beza town on litters that is all baas  then while i washed and never did i need a bath more and put on my underclothes in which i had swum on the night of the killing of the motombo that hans had wrung out and dried in the sun i asked that worthy how he was after his adventures  oh well enough baas he answered now that my stomach is full except that my hands and wrists are sore with crawling along the ground like a babyan baboon and that i cannot get the stink of that gods skin out of my nose oh you dont know what it was if i had been a white man it would have killed me but baas perhaps you did well to take drunken old hans with you on this journey after all for i was clever about the little gun wasnt i also about your swimming of the crocodile water though it is true that the sign of the spider and the moth which your reverend father sent taught me that and now we have got back safe except for the mazitu jerry who doesnt matter for there are plenty more like him and the wound in baas stephens shoulder and that heavy flower which he thought better than brandy  yes hans i said i did well to take you and you are clever for had it not been for you we should now be cooked and eaten in pongoland i thank you for your help old friend but hans another time please sew up the holes in your waistcoat pocket four caps wasnt much hans  no baas but it was enough as they were all good ones if there had been forty you could not have done much more oh your reverend father knew all that my departed parent had become a kind of patron saint to hans and did not wish this poor old hottentot to have more to carry than was needed he knew you wouldnt miss baas and that there were only one god one devil and one man waiting to be killed  i laughed for hanss way of putting things was certainly original and having got on my coat went to see stephen at the door of the tent i met brother john whose shoulder was dreadfully sore from the rubbing of the orchid stretcher as were his hands with paddling but who otherwise was well enough and of course supremely happy  he told me that he had cleansed and sewn up stephens wound which appeared to be doing well although the spear had pierced right through the shoulder luckily without cutting any artery so i went in to see the patient and found him cheerful enough though weak from weariness and loss of blood with miss hope feeding him with broth from a wooden native spoon i didnt stop very long especially after he got on to the subject of the lost orchid about which he began to show signs of excitement this i allayed as well as i could by telling him that i had preserved a pod of the seed news at which he was delighted  there he said to think that you allan should have remembered to take that precaution when i an orchidist forgot all about it  ah my boy i answered i have lived long enough to learn never to leave anything behind that i can possibly carry away also although not an orchidist it occurred to me that there are more ways of propagating a plant than from the original root which generally wont go into ones pocket  then he began to give me elaborate instructions as to the preservation of the seedpod in a perfectly dry and airtight tin box etc at which point miss hope unceremoniously bundled me out of the tent  that afternoon we held a conference at which it was agreed that we should begin our return journey to beza town at once as the place where we were camped was very malarious and there was always a risk of the pongo paying us another visit  so a litter was made with a mat stretched over it in which stephen could be carried since fortunately there were plenty of bearers and our other simple preparations were quickly completed mrs eversley and hope were mounted on the two donkeys brother john whose hurt leg showed signs of renewed weakness rode his white ox which was now quite fat again the wounded hero stephen as i have said was carried and i walked comparing notes with old babemba on the pongo their manners which i am bound to say were good and their customs that as the saying goes were simply beastly  how delighted that ancient warrior was to hear again about the sacred cave the crocodile water the mountain forest and its terrible god of the death of which and of the motombo he made me tell him the story three times over at the conclusion of the third recital he said quietly  my lord macumazana you are a great man and i am glad to have lived if only to know you no one else could have done these deeds  of course i was complimented but felt bound to point out hanss share in our joint achievement  yes yes he answered the spotted snake inhlatu has the cunning to scheme but you have the power to do and what is the use of a brain to plot without the arm to strike the two do not go together because the plotter is not a striker his mind is different if the snake had the strength and brain of the elephant and the fierce courage of the buffalo soon there would be but one creature left in the world but the maker of all things knew this and kept them separate my lord macumazana  i thought and still think that there was a great deal of wisdom in this remark simple as it seems oh surely many of these savages whom we white men despise are no fools  after about an hours march we camped till the moon rose which it did at ten oclock when we went on again till near dawn as it was thought better that stephen should travel in the cool of the night i remember that our cavalcade escorted before behind and on either flank by the mazitu troops with their tall spears looked picturesque and even imposing as it wound over those wide downs in the lovely and peaceful light of the moon  there is no need for me to set out the details of the rest of our journey which was not marked by any incident of importance  stephen bore it very well and brother john who was one of the best doctors i ever met gave good reports of him but i noted that he did not seem to get any stronger although he ate plenty of food also miss hope who nursed him for her mother seemed to have no taste that way informed me that he slept but little as indeed i found out for myself  o allan she said just before we reached beza town stephen your son she used to call him my son i dont know why is sick the father says it is only the spearhurt but i tell you it is more than the spearhurt he is sick in himself and the tears that filled her grey eyes showed me that she spoke what she believed as a matter of fact she was right for on the night after we reached the town stephen was seized with an attack of some bad form of african fever which in his weak state nearly cost him his life contracted no doubt at that unhealthy crocodile water  our reception at beza was most imposing for the whole population headed by old bausi himself came out to meet us with loud shouts of welcome from which we had to ask them to desist for stephens sake  so in the end we got back to our huts with gratitude of heart indeed we should have been very happy there for a while had it not been for our anxiety about stephen but it is always thus in the world who was ever allowed to eat his pot of honey without finding a fly or perhaps a cockroach in his mouth  in all stephen was really ill for about a month on the tenth day after our arrival at beza according to my diary which having little else to do i entered up fully at this time we thought that he would surely die even brother john who attended him with the most constant skill and who had ample quinine and other drugs at his command for these we had brought with us from durban in plenty gave up the case day and night the poor fellow raved and always about that confounded orchid the loss of which seemed to weigh upon his mind as though it were a whole sackful of unrepented crimes  i really think that he owed his life to a subterfuge or rather to a bold invention of hopes one evening when he was at his very worst and going on like a mad creature about the lost planti was present in the hut at the time alone with him and hershe took his hand and pointing to a perfectly open space on the floor said  look o stephen the flower has been brought back  he stared and stared and then to my amazement answered  by jove so it has but those beggars have broken off all the blooms except one  yes she echoed but one remains and it is the finest of them all  after this he went quietly to sleep and slept for twelve hours then took some food and slept again and what is more his temperature went down to or a little below normal when he finally woke up as it chanced i was again present in the hut with hope who was standing on the spot which she had persuaded him was occupied by the orchid he stared at this spot and he stared at herme he could not see for i was behind himthen said in a weak voice  didnt you tell me miss hope that the plant was where you are and that the most beautiful of the flowers was left  i wondered what on earth her answer would be however she rose to the occasion  o stephen she replied in her soft voice and speaking in a way so natural that it freed her words from any boldness it is here for am i not its childher native appellation it will be remembered was child of the flower and the fairest of the flowers is here too for i am that flower which you found in the island of the lake o stephen i pray you to trouble no more about a lost plant of which you have seed in plenty but make thanks that you still live and that through you my mother and i still live who if you had died would weep our eyes away  through me he answered you mean through allan and hans also it was you who saved my life there in the water oh i remember it all now you are right hope although i didnt know it you are the true holy flower that i saw  she ran to him and kneeling by his side gave him her hand which he pressed to his pale lips  then i sneaked out of that hut and left them to discuss the lost flower that was found again it was a pretty scene and one that to my mind gave a sort of spiritual meaning to the whole of an otherwise rather insane quest he sought an ideal flower he foundthe love of his life  after this stephen recovered rapidly for such love is the best of medicinesif it be returned  i dont know what passed between the pair and brother john and his wife for i never asked but i noted that from this day forward they began to treat him as a son the new relationship between stephen and hope seemed to be tacitly accepted without discussion even the natives accepted it for old mavovo asked me when they were going to be married and how many cows stephen had promised to pay brother john for such a beautiful wife it ought to be a large herd he said and of a big breed of cattle  sammy too alluded to the young lady in conversation with me as mr somerss affianced spouse only hans said nothing such a trivial matter as marrying and giving in marriage did not interest him or perhaps he looked upon the affair as a foregone conclusion and therefore unworthy of comment  we stayed at bausis kraal for a full month longer whilst stephen recovered his strength i grew thoroughly bored with the place and so did mavovo and the zulus but brother john and his wife did not seem to mind mrs eversley was a passive creature quite content to take things as they came and after so long an absence from civilization to bide a little longer among savages also she had her beloved john at whom she would sit and gaze by the hour like a cat sometimes does at a person to whom it is attached indeed when she spoke to him her voice seemed to me to resemble a kind of blissful purr i think it made the old boy rather fidgety sometimes for after an hour or two of it he would rise and go to hunt for butterflies  to tell the truth the situation got a little on my nerves at last for wherever i looked i seemed to see there stephen and hope making love to each other or brother john and his wife admiring each other which didnt leave me much spare conversation evidently they thought that mavovo hans sammy bausi babemba and co were enough for methat is if they reflected on the matter at all so they were in a sense for the zulu hunters began to get out of hand in the midst of this idleness and plenty eating too much drinking too much native beer smoking too much of the intoxicating dakka a mischievous kind of help and making too much love to the mazitu women which of course resulted in the usual rows that i had to settle  at last i struck and said that we must move on as stephen was now fit to travel  quite so said brother john mildly what have you arranged allan  with some irritation for i hated that sentence of brother johns i replied that i had arranged nothing but that as none of them seemed to have any suggestions to make i would go out and talk the matter over with hans and mavovo which i did  i need not chronicle the results of our conference since other arrangements were being made for us at which i little guessed  it all came very suddenly as great things in the lives of men and nations sometimes do although the mazitu were of the zulu family their military organization had none of the zulu thoroughness for instance when i remonstrated with bausi and old babemba as to their not keeping up a proper system of outposts and intelligence they laughed at me and answered that they never had been attacked and now that the pongo had learnt a lesson were never likely to be  by the way i see that i have not yet mentioned that at brother johns request those pongos who had been taken prisoners at the battle of the reeds were conducted to the shores of the lake given one of the captured canoes and told that they might return to their own happy land to our astonishment about three weeks later they reappeared at beza town with this story  they said that they had crossed the lake and found rica still standing but utterly deserted they then wandered through the country and even explored the motombos cave there they discovered the remains of the motombo still crouched upon his platform but nothing more in one hut of a distant village however they came across an old and dying woman who informed them with her last breath that the pongos frightened by the iron tubes that vomited death and in obedience to some prophecy had all gone back whence they came in the beginning taking with them the recaptured holy flower she had been left with a supply of food because she was too weak to travel so perhaps that flower grows again in some unknown place in africa but its worshippers will have to provide themselves with another god of the forest another mother of the flower and another highpriest to fill the office of the late motombo  these pongo prisoners having now no home and not knowing where their people had gone except that it was towards the north asked for leave to settle among the mazitu which was granted them their story confirmed me in my opinion that pongoland is not really an island but is connected on the further side with the continent by some ridge or swamp if we had been obliged to stop much longer among the mazitu i would have satisfied myself as to this matter by going to look but that chance never came to me until some years later when under curious circumstances i was again destined to visit this part of africa  to return to my story on the day following this discussion as to our departure we all breakfasted very early as there was a great deal to be done there was a dense mist that morning such as in these mazitu uplands often precedes high hot wind from the north at this season of the year so dense indeed that it was impossible to see for more than a few yards i suppose that this mist comes up from the great lake in certain conditions of the weather we had just finished our breakfast and rather languidly for the thick sultry air left me unenergetic i told one of the zulus to see that the two donkeys and the white ox which i had caused to be brought into the town in view of our near departure and tied up by our huts were properly fed then i went to inspect all the rifles and ammunition which hans had got out to be checked and overhauled it was at this moment that i heard a faraway and unaccustomed sound and asked hans what he thought it was  a gun baas he answered anxiously  well might he be anxious for as we both knew no one in the neighbourhood had guns except ourselves and all ours were accounted for it is true that we had promised to give the majority of those we had taken from the slavers to bausi when we went away and that i had been instructing some of his best soldiers in the use of them but not one of these had as yet been left in their possession  i stepped to a gate in the fence and ordered the sentry there to run to bausi and babemba and make report and inquiries also to pray them to summon all the soldiers of whom as it happened there were at the time not more than three hundred in the town as perfect peace prevailed the rest according to their custom had been allowed to go to their villages and attend to their crops then possessed by a rather undefined nervousness at which the others were inclined to laugh i caused the zulus to arm and generally make a few arrangements to meet any unforeseen crisis this done i sat down to reflect what would be the best course to take if we should happen to be attacked by a large force in that straggling native town of which i had often studied all the strategic possibilities when i had come to my own conclusion i asked hans and mavovo what they thought and found that they agreed with me that the only defensible place was outside the town where the road to the south gate ran down to a rocky wooded ridge with somewhat steep flanks it may be remembered that it was by this road and over this ridge that brother john had appeared on his white ox when we were about to be shot to death with arrows at the posts in the marketplace  whilst we were still talking two of the mazitu captains appeared running hard and dragging between them a wounded herdsman who had evidently been hit in the arm by a bullet  this was his story that he and two other boys were out herding the kings cattle about half a mile to the north of the town when suddenly there appeared a great number of men dressed in white robes all of whom were armed with guns these men of whom he thought there must be three or four hundred began to take the cattle and seeing the three herds fired on them wounding him and killing his two companions he then ran for his life and brought the news he added that one of the men had called after him to tell the white people that they had come to kill them and the mazitu who were their friends and to take away the white women  hassanbenmohammed and his slavers i said as babemba appeared at the head of a number of soldiers crying out  the slavedealing arabs are here lord macumazana they have crept on us through the mist a herald of theirs has come to the north gate demanding that we should give up you white people and your servants and with you a hundred young men and a hundred young women to be sold as slaves if we do not do this they say that they will kill all of us save the unmarried boys and girls and that you white people they will take and put to death by burning keeping only the two women alive one hassan sends this message  indeed i answered quietly for in this fix i grew quite cool as was usual with me and does bausi mean to give us up  how can bausi give up dogeetah who is his blood brother and you his friend exclaimed the old general indignantly bausi sends me to his brother dogeetah that he may receive the orders of the white mans wisdom spoken through your mouth lord macumazana  then theres a good spirit in bausi i replied and these are dogeetahs orders spoken through my mouth go to hassans messengers and ask him whether he remembers a certain letter which two white men left for him outside their camp in a cleft stick tell him that the time has now come for those white men to fulfil the promise they made in that letter and that before tomorrow he will be hanging on a tree then babemba gather your soldiers and hold the north gate of the town for as long as you can defending it with bows and arrows afterwards retreat through the town joining us among the trees on the rocky slope that is opposite the south gate bid some of your men clear the town of all the aged and women and children and let them pass though the south gate and take refuge in the wooded country beyond the slope let them not tarry let them go at once do you understand  i understand everything lord macumazana the words of dogeetah shall be obeyed oh would that we had listened to you and kept a better watch  he rushed off running like a young man and shouting orders as he went  now i said we must be moving  we collected all the rifles and ammunition with some other things i am sure i forget what they were and with the help of a few guards whom babemba had left outside our gate started through the town leading with us the two donkeys and the white ox i remember by an afterthought telling sammy who was looking very uncomfortable to return to the huts and fetch some blankets and a couple of iron cookingpots which might become necessities to us  oh mr quatermain he answered i will obey you though with fear and trembling  he went and when a few hours afterwards i noted that he had never reappeared i came to the conclusion with a sigh for i was very fond of sammy in a way that he had fallen into trouble and been killed probably i thought his fear and trembling had overcome his reason and caused him to run in the wrong direction with the cookingpots  the first part of our march through the town was easy enough but after we had crossed the marketplace and emerged into the narrow way that ran between many lines of huts to the south gate it became more difficult since this path was already crowded with hundreds of terrified fugitives old people sick being carried little boys girls and women with infants at the breast it was impossible to control these poor folk all we could do was to fight our way through them however we got out at last and climbing the slope took up the best position we could on and just beneath its crest where the trees and scattered boulders gave us very fair cover which we improved upon in every way feasible in the time at our disposal by building little breastworks of stone and so forth the fugitives who had accompanied us and those who followed a multitude in all did not stop here but flowed on along the road and vanished into the wooded country behind  i suggested to brother john that he should take his wife and daughter and the three beasts and go with them he seemed inclined to accept the idea needless to say for their sakes not for his own for he was a very fearless old fellow but the two ladies utterly refused to budge hope said that she would stop with stephen and her mother declared that she had every confidence in me and preferred to remain where she was then i suggested that stephen should go too but at this he grew so angry that i dropped the subject  so in the end we established them in a pleasant little hollow by a spring just over the crest of the rise where unless our flank were turned or we were rushed they would be out of the reach of bullets moreover without saying anything more we gave to each of them a doublebarrelled and loaded pistol     chapter xx                          the battle of the gate  by now heavy firing had begun at the north gate of the town accompanied by much shouting the mist was still too thick to enable us to see anything at first but shortly after the commencement of the firing a strong hot wind which always followed these mists got up and gradually gathered to a gale blowing away the vapours then from the top of the crest hans who had climbed a tree there reported that the arabs were advancing on the north gate firing as they came and that the mazitu were replying with their bows and arrows from behind the palisade that surrounded the town this palisade i should state consisted of an earthen bank on the top of which tree trunks were set close together many of these had struck in that fertile soil so that in general appearance this protective work resembled a huge live fence on the outer and inner side of which grew great masses of prickly pear and tall fingerlike cacti a while afterwards hans reported that the mazitu were retreating and a few minutes later they began to arrive through the south gate bringing several wounded with them their captain said that they could not stand against the fire of the guns and had determined to abandon the town and make the best fight they could upon the ridge  a little later the rest of the mazitu came driving before them all the noncombatants who remained in the town with these was king bausi in a terrible state of excitement  was i not wise macumazana he shouted to fear the slavetraders and their guns now they have come to kill those who are old and to take the young away in their gangs to sell them  yes king i could not help answering you were wise but if you had done what i said and kept a better lookout hassan could not have crept on you like a leopard on a goat  it is true he groaned but who knows the taste of a fruit till he has bitten it  then he went to see to the disposal of his soldiers along the ridge placing by my advice the most of them at each end of the line to frustrate any attempt to outflank us we for our part busied ourselves in serving out those guns which we had taken in the first fight with the slavers to the thirty or forty picked men whom i had been instructing in the use of firearms if they did not do much damage at least i thought they could make a noise and impress the enemy with the idea that we were well armed  ten minutes or so later babemba arrived with about fifty men all the mazitu soldiers who were left in the town he reported that he had held the north gate as long as he could in order to gain time and that the arabs were breaking it in i begged him to order the soldiers to pile up stones as a defence against the bullets and to lie down behind them this he went to do  then after a pause we saw a large body of the arabs who had effected an entry advancing down the central street towards us some of them had spears as well as guns on which they carried a dozen or so of human heads cut from the mazitus who had been killed waving them aloft and shouting in triumph it was a sickening sight and one that made me grind my teeth with rage also i could not help reflecting that ere long our heads might be upon those spears well if the worst came to the worst i was determined that i would not be taken alive to be burned in a slow fire or pinned over an antheap a point upon which the others agreed with me though poor brother john had scruples as to suicide even in despair  it was just then that i missed hans and asked where he had gone somebody said that he thought he had seen him running away whereon mavovo who was growing excited called out  ah spotted snake has sought his hole snakes hiss but they do not charge  no but sometimes they bite i answered for i could not believe that hans had showed the white feather however he was gone and clearly we were in no state to send to look for him  now our hope was that the slavers flushed with victory would advance across the open ground of the marketplace which we could sweep with our fire from our position on the ridge this indeed they began to do whereon without orders the mazitu to whom we had given the guns to my fury and dismay commenced to blaze away at a range of about four hundred yards and after a good deal of firing managed to kill or wound two or three men then the arabs seeing their danger retreated and after a pause renewed their advance in two bodies this time however they followed the streets of huts that were built thickly between the outer palisade of the town and the marketplace which as it had been designed to hold cattle in time of need was also surrounded with a wooden fence strong enough to resist the rush of horned beasts on that day i should add as the mazitu never dreamed of being attacked all their stock were grazing on some distant veldt in this space between the two fences were many hundreds of huts wattle and grass built but for the most part roofed with palm leaves for here in their separate quarters dwelt the great majority of the inhabitants of beza town of which the northern part was occupied by the king the nobles and the captains this ring of huts which entirely surrounded the marketplace except at the two gateways may have been about a hundred and twenty yards in width  down the paths between these huts both on the eastern and the western side advanced the arabs and halfbreeds of whom there appeared to be about four hundred all armed with guns and doubtless trained to fighting it was a terrible force for us to face seeing that although we may have had nearly as many men our guns did not total more than fifty and most of those who held them were quite unused to the management of firearms  soon the arabs began to open fire on us from behind the huts and a very accurate fire it was as our casualties quickly showed notwithstanding the stone schanzes we had constructed the worst feature of the thing also was that we could not reply with any effect as our assailants who gradually worked nearer were effectively screened by the huts and we had not enough guns to attempt organised volley firing although i tried to keep a cheerful countenance i confess that i began to fear the worst and even to wonder if we could possibly attempt to retreat this idea was abandoned however since the arabs would certainly overtake and shoot us down  one thing i did i persuaded babemba to send about fifty men to build up the southern gate which was made of trunks of trees and opened outwards with earth and the big stones that lay about in plenty while this was being done quickly for the mazitu soldiers worked at the task like demons and being sheltered by the palisade could not be shot all of a sudden i caught sight of four or five wisps of smoke that arose in quick succession at the north end of the town and were instantly followed by as many bursts of flame which leapt towards us in the strong wind  someone was firing beza town in less than an hour the flames driven by the gale through hundreds of huts made dry as tinder by the heat would reduce beza to a heap of ashes it was inevitable nothing could save the place for an instant i thought that the arabs must have done this thing then seeing that new fires continually arose in different places i understood that no arabs but a friend or friends were at work who had conceived the idea of destroying the arabs with fire  my mind flew to sammy without doubt sammy had stayed behind to carry out this terrible and masterly scheme of which i am sure none of the mazitu would have thought since it involved the absolute destruction of their homes and property sammy at whom we had always mocked was after all a great man prepared to perish in the flames in order to save his friends  babemba rushed up pointing with a spear to the rising fire now my inspiration came  take all your men i said except those who are armed with guns divide them encircle the town guard the north gate though i think none can win back through the flames and if any of the arabs succeed in breaking through the palisade kill them  it shall be done shouted babemba but oh for the town of beza where i was born oh for the town of beza  drat the town of beza i holloaed after him or rather its native equivalent it is of all our lives that im thinking  three minutes later the mazitu divided into two bodies were running like hares to encircle the town and though a few were shot as they descended the slope the most of them gained the shelter of the palisade in safety and there at intervals halted by sections for babemba managed the matter very well  now only we white people with the zulu hunters under mavovo of whom there were twelve in all and the mazitu armed with guns numbering about thirty were left upon the slope  for a little while the arabs did not seem to realise what had happened but engaged themselves in peppering at the mazitu who i think they concluded were in full flight presently however they either heard or saw  oh what a hubbub ensued all the four hundred of them began to shout at once some of them ran to the palisade and began to climb it but as they reached the top of the fence were pinned by the mazitu arrows and fell backwards while a few who got over became entangled in the prickly pears on the further side and were promptly speared giving up this attempt they rushed back along the lane with the intention of escaping at the northgate but before ever they reached the head of the marketplace the roaring windswept flames leaping from hut to hut had barred their path they could not face that awful furnace  now they took another counsel and in a great confused body charged down the marketplace to break out at the south gate and our turn came how we raked them as they sped across the open an easy mark i know that i fired as fast as i could using two rifles swearing the while at hans because he was not there to load for me stephen was better off in this respect for looking round to my astonishment i saw hope who had left her mother on the other side of the hill in the act of capping his second gun i should explain that during our stay in beza town we had taught her how to use a rifle  i called to him to send her away but again she would not go even after a bullet had pierced her dress  still all our shooting could not stop that rush of men made desperate by the fear of a fiery death leaving many stretched out behind them the first of the arabs drew near to the south gate  my father said mavovo in my ear now the real fighting is going to begin the gate will soon be down we must be the gate  i nodded for if the arabs once got through there were enough of them left to wipe us out five times over indeed i do not suppose that up to this time they had actually lost more than forty men a few words explained the situation to stephen and brother john whom i told to take his daughter to her mother and wait there with them the mazitu i ordered to throw down their guns for if they kept these i was sure they would shoot some of us and to accompany us bringing their spears only  then we rushed down the slope and took up our position in a little open space in front of the gate that now was tottering to its fall beneath the blows and draggings of the arabs at this time the sight was terrible and magnificent for the flames had got hold of the two halfcircles of huts that embraced the marketplace and fanned by the blast were rushing towards us like a thing alive above us swept a great pall of smoke in which floated flakes of fire so thick that it hid the sky though fortunately the wind did not suffer it to sink and choke us the sounds also were almost inconceivable for to the crackling roar of the conflagration as it devoured hut after hut were added the coarse yelling voices of the halfbred arabs as in mingled rage and terror they tore at the gateway or each other and the reports of the guns which many of them were still firing half at hazard  we formed up before the gate the zulus with stephen and myself in front and the thirty picked mazitu commanded by no less a person than bausi the king behind we had not long to wait for presently down the thing came and over it and the mound of earth and stones we had built beyond began to pour a mob of whiterobed and turbaned men whose mixed and tumultuous exit somehow reminded me of the pips and pulp being squeezed out of a grenadilla fruit  i gave the word and we fired into that packed mass with terrible effect really i think that each bullet must have brought down two or three of them then at a command from mavovo the zulus threw down their guns and charged with their broad spears stephen who had got hold of an assegai somehow went with them firing a colts revolver as he ran while at their backs came bausi and his thirty tall mazitu  i will confess at once that i did not join in this terrific onslaught i felt that i had not weight enough for a scrimmage of the sort also that i should perhaps be better employed using my wits outside and watching for a chance to be of service like a halfback in a football field than in getting my brains knocked out in a general row or mayhap my heart failed me and i was afraid i dare say for i have never pretended to great courage at any rate i stopped outside and shot whenever i got the chance not without effect filling a humble but perhaps a useful part  it was really magnificent that fray how those zulus did go in for quite a long while they held the narrow gateway and the mound against all the howling thrusting mob much as the roman called horatius and his two friends held the entrance to some bridge or other long ago at rome against a great force of i forget whom they shouted their zulu battlecry of laba laba that of their regiment i suppose for most of them were men of about the same age and stabbed and fought and struggled and went down one by one  back the rest of them were swept then led by mavovo stephen and bausi charged again reinforced with the thirty mazitu now the tongues of flame met almost over them the growing fence of prickly pear and cacti withered and crackled and still they fought on beneath that arch of fire  back they were driven again by the mere weight of numbers i saw mavovo stab a man and go down he rose and stabbed another then fell again for he was hard hit  two arabs rushed to kill him i shot them both with a right and left for fortunately my rifle was just reloaded he rose once more and killed a third man stephen came to his support and grappling with an arab dashed his head against the gatepost so that he fell old bausi panting like a grampus plunged in with his remaining mazitu and the combatants became so confused in the dark gloom of the overhanging smoke that i could scarcely tell one from the other yet the maddened arabs were winning as they must for how could our small and everlessening company stand against their rush  we were in a little circle now of which somehow i found myself the centre and they were attacking us on all sides stephen got a knock on the head from the butt end of a gun and tumbled against me nearly upsetting me as i recovered myself i looked round in despair  now it was that i saw a very welcome sight namely hans yes the lost hans himself with his filthy hat whereof i noticed even then the frayed ostrich feathers were smouldering hanging by a leather strap at the back of his head he was shambling along in a sly and silent sort of way but at a great rate with his mouth open beckoning over his shoulder and behind him came about one hundred and fifty mazitu  those mazitu soon put another complexion upon the affair for charging with a roar they drove back the arabs who had no space to develop their line straight into the jaws of that burning hell a little later the rest of the mazitu returned with babemba and finished the job only quite a few of the arabs got out and were captured after they had thrown down their guns the rest retreated into the centre of the marketplace whither our people followed them in this crisis the blood of these mazitu told and they stuck to the enemy as zulus themselves would certainly have done  it was over great heaven it was over and we began to count our losses four of the zulus were dead and two others were badly woundedno three including mavovo they brought him to me leaning on the shoulder of babemba and another mazitu captain he was a shocking sight for he was shot in three places and badly cut and battered as well he looked at me a little while breathing heavily then spoke  it was a very good fight my father he said of all that i have fought i can remember none better although i have been in far greater battles which is well as it is my last i foreknew it my father for though i never told it you the first death lot that i drew down yonder in durban was my own take back the gun you gave me my father you did but lend it me for a little while as i said to you now i go to the underworld to join the spirits of my ancestors and of those who have fallen at my side in many wars and of those women who bore my children i shall have a tale to tell them there my father and together we will wait for youtill you too die in war  then he lifted up his arm from the neck of babemba and saluted me with a loud cry of baba inkosi giving me certain great titles which i will not set down and having done so sank to the earth  i sent one of the mazitu to fetch brother john who arrived presently with his wife and daughter he examined mavovo and told him straight out that nothing could help him except prayer  make no prayers for me dogeetah said the old heathen i have followed my star ie lived according to my lights and am ready to eat the fruit that i have planted or if the tree prove barren then to drink of its sap and sleep  waving brother john aside he beckoned to stephen  o wazela he said you fought very well in that fight if you go on as you have begun in time you will make a warrior of whom the daughter of the flower and her children will sing songs after you have come to join me your friend meanwhile farewell take this assegai of mine and clean it not that the red rust thereon may put you in mind of mavovo the old zulu doctor and captain with whom you stood side by side in the battle of the gate when as though they were winter grass the fire burnt up the whiterobed thieves of men who could not pass our spears  then he waved his hand again and stephen stepped aside muttering something for he and mavovo had been very intimate and his voice choked in his throat with grief now the old zulus glazing eye fell upon hans who was sneaking about i think with a view of finding an opportunity of bidding him a last goodbye  ah spotted snake he cried so you have come out of your hole now that the fire has passed it to eat the burnt frogs in the cinders it is a pity that you who are so clever should be a coward since our lord macumazana needed one to load for him on the hill and would have killed more of the hyenas had you been there  yes spotted snake it is so echoed an indignant chorus of the other zulus while stephen and i and even the mild brother john looked at him reproachfully  now hans who generally was as patient under affront as a jew for once lost his temper he dashed his hat upon the ground and danced on it he spat towards the surviving zulu hunters he even vituperated the dying mavovo  o son of a fool he said you pretend that you can see what is hid from other men but i tell you that there is a lying spirit in your lips you called me a coward because i am not big and strong as you were and cannot hold an ox by the horns but at least there is more brain in my stomach than in all your head where would all of you be now had it not been for poor spotted snake the coward who twice this day has saved every one of you except those whom the baass father the reverend predikant has marked upon the forehead to come and join him in a place that is even hotter and brighter than that burning town  now we looked at hans wondering what he meant about saving us twice and mavovo said  speak on quickly o spotted snake for i would hear the end of your story how did you help us in your hole  hans began to grub about in his pockets from which finally he produced a matchbox wherein there remained but one match  with this he said oh could none of you see that the men of hassan had all walked into a trap did none of you know that fire burns thatched houses and that a strong wind drives it fast and far while you sat there upon the hill with your heads together like sheep waiting to be killed i crept away among the bushes and went about my business i said nothing to any of you not even to the baas lest he should answer me no hans there may be an old woman sick in one of those huts and therefore you must not fire them in such matters who does not know that white people are fools even the best of them and in fact there were several old women for i saw them running for the gateway well i crept up by the green fence which i knew would not burn and i came to the north gate there was an arab sentry left there to watch  he fired at me look well for hans his mother bore him short and he pointed to a hole in the filthy hat then before that arab could load again poor coward hans got his knife into him from behind look and he produced a big blade which was such as butchers use from his belt and showed it to us after that it was easy since fire is a wonderful thing you make it small and it grows big of itself like a child and never gets tired and is always hungry and runs fast as a horse i lit six of them where they would burn quickest then i saved the last match since we have few left and came through the gate before the fire ate me up me its father me the sower of the red seed  we stared at the old hottentot in admiration even mavovo lifted his dying head and stared but hans whose annoyance had now evaporated went on in a jogtrot mechanical voice  as i was returning to find the baas if he still lived the heat of the fire forced me to the high ground to the west of the fence so that i saw what was happening at the south gate and that the arab men must break through there because you who held it were so few so i ran down to babemba and the other captains very quickly telling them there was no need to guard the fence any more and that they must get to the south gate and help you since otherwise you would all be killed and they too would be killed afterwards babemba listened to me and started sending out messengers to collect the others and we got here just in time such is the hole i hid in during the battle of the gate o mavovo that is all the story which i pray that you will tell to the baass reverend father the predikant presently for i am sure that it will please him to learn that he did not teach me to be wise and help all men and always to look after the baas allan to no purpose still i am sorry that i wasted so many matches for where shall we get any more now that the camp is burnt and he gazed ruefully at the all but empty box  mavovo spoke once more in a slow gasping voice  never again he said addressing hans shall you be called spotted snake o little yellow man who are so great and white of heart behold i give you a new name by which you shall be known with honour from generation to generation it is light in darkness it is lord of the fire  then he closed his eyes and fell back insensible within a few minutes he was dead but those high names with which he christened hans with his dying breath clung to the old hottentot for all his days indeed from that day forward no native would ever have ventured to call him by any other among them far and wide they became his titles of honour  the roar of the flames grew less and the tumult within their fiery circle died away for now the mazitu were returning from the last fight in the marketplace if fight it could be called bearing in their arms great bundles of the guns which they had collected from the dead arabs most of whom had thrown down their weapons in a last wild effort to escape but between the spears of the infuriated savages on the one hand and the devouring fire on the other what escape was there for them the bloodstained wretches who remained in the camps and towns of the slavetraders along the eastern coast of africa or in the isle of madagascar alone could tell how many were lost since of those who went out from them to make war upon the mazitu and their white friends none returned again with the long lines of expected captives they had gone to their own place of which sometimes that flaming african city has seemed to me a symbol they were wicked men indeed devils stalking the earth in human form without pity without shame yet i could not help feeling sorry for them at the last for truly their end was awful  they brought the prisoners up to us and among them his white robe halfburnt off him i recognised the hideous pockmarked hassanbenmohammed  i received your letter written a while ago in which you promised to make us die by fire and this morning i received your message hassan i said brought by the wounded lad who escaped from you when you murdered his companions and to both i sent you an answer if none reached you look around for there is one written large in a tongue that all can read  the monster for he was no less flung himself upon the ground praying for mercy indeed seeing mrs eversley he crawled to her and catching hold of her white robe begged her to intercede for him  you made a slave of me after i had nursed you in the spotted sickness she answered and tried to kill my husband for no fault through you hassan i have spent all the best years of my life among savages alone and in despair still for my part i forgive you but oh may i never see your face again  then she wrenched herself free from his grasp and went away with her daughter  i too forgive you although you murdered my people and for twenty years made my time a torment said brother john who was one of the truest christians i have ever known may god forgive you also and he followed his wife and daughter  then the old king bausi who had come through that battle with a slight wound spoke saying  i am glad red thief that these white people have granted you what you askednamely their forgivenesssince the deed is greatly to their honour and causes me and my people to think them even nobler than we did before but o murderer of men and woman and trafficker in children i am judge here not the white people look on your work and he pointed first to the lines of zulu and mazitu dead and then to his burning town look and remember the fate you promised to us who have never harmed you look look look o hyena of a man  at this point i too went away nor did i ever ask what became of hassan and his fellowcaptives moreover whenever any of the natives or hans tried to inform me i bade them hold their tongues                                   epilogue  i have little more to add to this record which i fear has grown into quite a long book or at any rate although the setting of it down has amused me during the afternoons and evenings of this endless english winter now that the spring is come again i seem to have grown weary of writing therefore i shall leave what remains untold to the imagination of anyone who chances to read these pages    we were victorious and had indeed much cause for gratitude who still lived to look upon the sun yet the night that followed the battle of the gate was a sad one at least for me who felt the death of my friend the foresighted hero mavovo of the bombastic but faithful sammy and of my brave hunters more than i can say also the old zulus prophecy concerning me that i too should die in battle weighed upon me who seemed to have seen enough of such ends in recent days and to desire one more tranquil  living here in peaceful england as i do now with no present prospect of leaving it it does not appear likely that it will be fulfilled yet after my experience of the divining powers of mavovos snakewell those words of his make me feel uncomfortable for when all is said and done who can know the future moreover it is the improbable that generally happens   as the readers of allan quatermain will be aware this prophecy of the dying zulu was fulfilled mr quatermain died at zuvendis as a result of the wound he received in the battle between the armies of the rival queenseditor  further the climatic conditions were not conducive to cheerfulness for shortly after sunset it began to rain and poured for most of the night which as we had little shelter was inconvenient both to us and to all the hundreds of the homeless mazitu  however the rain ceased in due time and on the following morning the welcome sun shone out of a clear sky when we had dried and warmed ourselves a little in its rays someone suggested that we should visit the burnedout town where except for some smouldering heaps that had been huts the fire was extinguished by the heavy rain more from curiosity than for any other reason i consented and accompanied by bausi babemba and many of the mazitu all of us except brother john who remained behind to attend to the wounded climbed over the debris of the south gate and walked through the black ruins of the huts across the marketplace that was strewn with dead to what had been our own quarters  these were a melancholy sight a mere heap of sodden and still smoking ashes i could have wept when i looked at them thinking of all the trade goods and stores that were consumed beneath necessities for the most part the destruction of which must make our return journey one of great hardship  well there was nothing to be said or done so after a few minutes of contemplation we turned to continue our walk through what had been the royal quarters to the north gate hans who i noted had been ferreting about in his furtive way as though he were looking for something and i were the last to leave suddenly he laid his hand upon my arm and said  baas listen i hear a ghost i think it is the ghost of sammy asking us to bury him  bosh i answered and then listened as hard as i could  now i also seemed to hear something coming from i knew not where words which were frequently repeated and which seemed to be  o mr quatermain i beg you to be so good as to open the door of this oven  for a while i thought i must be cracked however i called back the others and we all listened of a sudden hans made a pounce like a terrier does at the run of a mole that he hears working underground and began to drag or rather to shovel at a heap of ashes in front of us using a bit of wood as they were still too hot for his hands then we listened again and this time heard the voice quite clearly coming from the ground  baas said hans it is sammy in the cornpit  now i remembered that such a pit existed in front of the huts which although empty at the time was as is common among the bantu natives used to preserve corn that would not immediately be needed once i myself went through a very tragic experience in one of these pits as any who may read the history of my first wife that i have called marie can see for themselves  soon we cleared the place and had lifted the stone with ventilating holes in itwell was it for sammy that those ventilating holes existed also that the stone did not fit tight beneath was a bottleshaped and cemented structure about ten feet deep by say eight wide instantly through the mouth of this structure appeared the head of sammy with his mouth wide open like that of a fish gasping for air we pulled him out a process that caused him to howl for the heat had made his skin very tender and gave him water which one of the mazitu fetched from a spring then i asked him indignantly what he was doing in that hole while we wasted our tears thinking that he was dead  oh mr quatermain he said i am a victim of too faithful service to abandon all these valuable possessions of yours to a rapacious enemy was more than i could bear so i put every one of them in the pit and then as i thought i heard someone coming got in myself and pulled down the stone but mr quatermain soon afterwards the enemy added arson to murder and pillage and the whole place began to blaze i could hear the fire roaring above and a little later the ashes covered the exit so that i could no longer lift the stone which indeed grew too hot to touch here then i sat all night in the most suffocating heat very much afraid mr quatermain lest the two kegs of gunpowder that were with me should explode till at last just as i had abandoned hope and prepared to die like a tortoise baked alive by a bushman i heard your welcome voice and mr quatermain if there is any soothing ointment to spare i shall be much obliged for i am scorched all over  ah sammy sammy i said you see what comes of cowardice on the hill with us you would not have been scorched and it is only by the merest chance of owing to hanss quick hearing that you were not left to perish miserably in that hole  that is so mr quatermain i plead guilty to the hot impeachment but on the hill i might have been shot which is worse than being scorched also you gave me charge of your goods and i determined to preserve them even at the risk of personal comfort lastly the angel who watches me brought you here in time before i was quite cooked through so alls well that ends well mr quatermain though it is true that for my part i have had enough of bloody war and if i live to regain civilized regions i propose henceforth to follow the art of fooddressing in the safe kitchen of an hotel that is if i cannot obtain a berth as an instructor in the english tongue  yes i answered alls well that ends well sammy my boy and at any rate you have saved the stores for which we should be thankful to you so go along with mr stephen and get doctored while we haul them out of that grainpit  three days later we bid farewell to old bausi who almost wept at parting with us and the mazitu who were already engaged in the rebuilding of their town mavovo and the other zulus who died in the battle of the gate we buried on the ridge opposite to it raising a mound of earth over them that thereby they might be remembered in generations to come and laying around them the mazitu who had fallen in the fight as we passed that mound on our homeward journey the zulus who remained alive including two wounded men who were carried in litters stopped and saluted solemnly praising the dead with loud songs we white people too saluted but in silence by raising our hats  by the way i should add that in this matter also mavovos snake did not lie he had said that six of his company would be killed upon our expedition and six were killed neither more nor less  after much consulting we determined to take the overland route back to natal first because it was always possible that the slavetrading fraternity hearing of their terrible losses might try to attack us again on the coast and secondly for the reason that even if they did not months or perhaps years might pass before we found a ship at kilwa then a port of ill repute to carry us to any civilized place moreover brother john who had travelled it knew the inland road well and had established friendly relations with the tribes through whose country we must pass till we reached the brothers of zululand where i was always welcome so as the mazitu furnished us with an escort and plenty of bearers for the first part of the road and thanks to sammys stewardship in the cornpit we had ample trade goods left to hire others later on we made up our minds to risk the longer journey  as it turned out this was a wise conclusion since although it took four weary months in the end we accomplished it without any accident whatsoever if i except a slight attack of fever from which both miss hope and i suffered for a while also we got some good shooting on the road my only regret was that this change of plan obliged us to abandon the tusks of ivory we had captured from the slavers and buried where we alone could find them  still it was a dull time for me who for obvious reasons of which i have already spoken was literally a fifth wheel to the coach hans was an excellent fellow and as the reader knows quite a genius in his own way but night after night in hanss society began to pall on me at last while even his conversation about my reverend father who seemed positively to haunt him acquired a certain sameness of course we had other subjects in common especially those connected with retiefs massacre whereof we were the only two survivors but of these i seldom cared to speak they were and still remain too painful  therefore for my part i was thankful when at last in zululand we fell in with some traders whom i knew who hired us one of their wagons in this vehicle abandoning the wornout donkeys and the white ox which we presented to a chief of my acquaintance brother john and the ladies proceeded to durban stephen attending them on a horse that we had bought while i with hans attached myself to the traders  at durban a surprise awaited us since as we trekked into the town which at that time was still a small place whom should we meet but sir alexander somers who hearing that wagons were coming from zululand had ridden out in the hope of obtaining news of us it seemed that the choleric old gentlemans anxiety concerning his son had so weighed on his mind that at length he made up his mind to proceed to africa to hunt for him so there he was the meeting between the two was affectionate but peculiar  hullo dad said stephen whoever would have thought of seeing you here  hullo stephen said his father whoever would have expected to find you alive and looking wellyes very well it is more than you deserve you young ass and i hope you wont do it again  having delivered himself thus the old boy seized stephen by the hair and solemnly kissed him on the brow  no dad answered his son i dont mean to do it again but thanks to allan there weve come through all right and by the way let me introduce you to the lady i am going to marry also to her father and mother  well all the rest may be imagined they were married a fortnight later in durban and a very pleasant affair it was since sir alexander who by the way treated me most handsomely from a business point of view literally entertained the whole town on that festive occasion immediately afterwards stephen accompanied by mr and mrs eversley and his father took his wife home to be educated though what that process consisted of i never heard hans and i saw them off at the point and our parting was rather sad although hans went back the richer by the £500 which stephen had promised him he bought a farm with the money and on the strength of his exploits established himself as a kind of little chief of whom more lateras they say in the pedigree books  sammy too was set up as the proprietor of a small hotel where he spent most of his time in the bar dilating to the customers in magnificent sentences that reminded me of the style of a poem called the essay on man which i once tried to read and couldnt about his feats as a warrior among the wild mazitu and the maneating devilworshipping pongo tribes  two years or less afterwards i received a letter from which i must quote a passage    as i told you my father has given a living which he owns to mr   eversley a pretty little place where there isnt much for a   parson to do i think it rather bores my respected parentsinlaw   at any rate dogeetah spends a lot of his time wandering about   the new forest which is near by with a butterflynet and trying   to imagine that he is back in africa the mother of the flower   who after a long course of bootkissing mutes doesnt get on   with english servants has another amusement there is a small   lake in the rectory grounds in which is a little island here she   has put up a reed fence round a laurustinus bush which flowers at   the same time of year as did the holy flower and within this reed   fence she sits whenever the weather will allow as i believe going   through the rites of the flower at least when i called upon her   there one day in a boat i found her wearing a white robe and   singing some mystical native song   many years have gone by since then both brother john and his wife have departed to their rest and their strange story the strangest almost of all stories is practically forgotten stephen whose father has also departed is a prosperous baronet and rather heavy member of parliament and magistrate the father of many fine children for the miss hope of old days has proved as fruitful as a daughter of the goddess of fertility for that was the mothers real office ought to be  sometimes she said to me one day with a laugh as she surveyed a large and noisy selection of her numerous offspring sometimes o allanshe still retains that trick of speechi wish that i were back in the peace of the home of the flower ah she added with something of a thrill in her voice never can i forget the blue of the sacred lake or the sight of those skies at dawn do you think that i shall see them again when i die o allan  at the time i thought it rather ungrateful of her to speak thus but after all human nature is a queer thing and we are all of us attached to the scenes of our childhood and long at times again to breathe our natal air  i went to see sir stephen the other day and in his splendid greenhouses the head gardener woodden an old man now showed me three noble longleaved plants which sprang from the seed of the holy flower that i had saved in my pocket  but they have not yet bloomed  somehow i wonder what will happen when they do it seems to me as though when once more the glory of that golden bloom is seen of the eyes of men the ghosts of the terrible god of the forest of the hellish and mysterious motombo and perhaps of the mother of the flower herself will be there to do it reverence if so what gifts will they bring to those who stole and reared the sacred seed    psi shall know ere long for just as i laid down my pen a triumphant epistle from stephen was handed to me in which he writes excitedly that at length two of the three plants are showing for flower
