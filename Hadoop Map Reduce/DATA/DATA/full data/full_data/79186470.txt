new york and san  francisco   monday  it was if i remember rightly five oclock when we were  all signalled to be present at the ferry depot of the railroad  an  emigrant ship had arrived at new york on the saturday night  another on the sunday morning our own on sunday afternoon a  fourth early on monday and as there is no emigrant train on sunday  a great part of the passengers from these four ships was  concentrated on the train by which i was to travel  there was a  babel of bewildered men women and children  the wretched little  bookingoffice and the baggageroom which was not much larger  were crowded thick with emigrants and were heavy and rank with the  atmosphere of dripping clothes  open carts full of bedding stood  by the halfhour in the rain  the officials loaded each other with  recriminations  a bearded mildewed little man whom i take to  have been an emigrant agent was all over the place his mouth full  of brimstone blustering and interfering  it was plain that the  whole system if system there was had utterly broken down under  the strain of so many passengers  my own ticket was given me at once and an oldish man who  preserved his head in the midst of this turmoil got my baggage  registered and counselled me to stay quietly where i was till he  should give me the word to move  i had taken along with me a small  valise a knapsack which i carried on my shoulders and in the bag  of my railway rug the whole of bancrofts history of the united  states in six fat volumes  it was as much as i could carry with  convenience even for short distances but it insured me plenty of  clothing and the valise was at that moment and often after  useful for a stool  i am sure i sat for an hour in the baggage room and wretched enough it was yet when at last the word was  passed to me and i picked up my bundles and got under way it was  only to exchange discomfort for downright misery and danger  i followed the porters into a long shed reaching downhill from west  street to the river  it was dark the wind blew clean through it  from end to end and here i found a great block of passengers and  baggage hundreds of one and tons of the other  i feel i shall  have a difficulty to make myself believed and certainly the scene  must have been exceptional for it was too dangerous for daily  repetition  it was a tight jam there was no fair way through the  mingled mass of brute and living obstruction  into the upper  skirts of the crowd porters infuriated by hurry and overwork  clove their way with shouts  i may say that we stood like sheep  and that the porters charged among us like so many maddened sheep dogs and i believe these men were no longer answerable for their  acts  it mattered not what they were carrying they drove straight  into the press and when they could get no farther blindly  discharged their barrowful  with my own hand for instance i  saved the life of a child as it sat upon its mothers knee she  sitting on a box and since i heard of no accident i must suppose  that there were many similar interpositions in the course of the  evening  it will give some idea of the state of mind to which we  were reduced if i tell you that neither the porter nor the mother  of the child paid the least attention to my act  it was not till  some time after that i understood what i had done myself for to  ward off heavy boxes seemed at the moment a natural incident of  human life  cold wet clamour dead opposition to progress such  as one encounters in an evil dream had utterly daunted the  spirits  we had accepted this purgatory as a child accepts the  conditions of the world  for my part i shivered a little and my  back ached wearily but i believe i had neither a hope nor a fear  and all the activities of my nature had become tributary to one  massive sensation of discomfort  at length and after how long an interval i hesitate to guess the  crowd began to move heavily straining through itself  about the  same time some lamps were lighted and threw a sudden flare over  the shed  we were being filtered out into the river boat for  jersey city  you may imagine how slowly this filtering proceeded  through the dense choking crush every one overladen with packages  or children and yet under the necessity of fishing out his ticket  by the way but it ended at length for me and i found myself on  deck under a flimsy awning and with a trifle of elbowroom to  stretch and breathe in  this was on the starboard for the bulk of  the emigrants stuck hopelessly on the port side by which we had  entered  in vain the seamen shouted to them to move on and  threatened them with shipwreck  these poor people were under a  spell of stupor and did not stir a foot  it rained as heavily as  ever but the wind now came in sudden claps and capfuls not  without danger to a boat so badly ballasted as ours and we crept  over the river in the darkness trailing one paddle in the water  like a wounded duck and passed ever and again by huge illuminated  steamers running many knots and heralding their approach by  strains of music  the contrast between these pleasure embarkations  and our own grim vessel with her list to port and her freight of  wet and silent emigrants was of that glaring description which we  count too obvious for the purposes of art  the landing at jersey city was done in a stampede  i had a fixed  sense of calamity and to judge by conduct the same persuasion was  common to us all  a panic selfishness like that produced by fear  presided over the disorder of our landing  people pushed and  elbowed and ran their families following how they could   children fell and were picked up to be rewarded by a blow  one  child who had lost her parents screamed steadily and with  increasing shrillness as though verging towards a fit an official  kept her by him but no one else seemed so much as to remark her  distress and i am ashamed to say that i ran among the rest  i was  so weary that i had twice to make a halt and set down my bundles in  the hundred yards or so between the pier and the railway station  so that i was quite wet by the time that i got under cover  there  was no waitingroom no refreshment room the cars were locked and  for at least another hour or so it seemed we had to camp upon the  draughty gaslit platform  i sat on my valise too crushed to  observe my neighbours but as they were all cold and wet and  weary and driven stupidly crazy by the mismanagement to which we  had been subjected i believe they can have been no happier than  myself  i bought halfadozen oranges from a boy for oranges and  nuts were the only refection to be had  as only two of them had  even a pretence of juice i threw the other four under the cars  and beheld as in a dream grown people and children groping on the  track after my leavings  at last we were admitted into the cars utterly dejected and far  from dry  for my own part i got out a clothesbrush and brushed  my trousers as hard as i could till i had dried them and warmed my  blood into the bargain but no one else except my next neighbour  to whom i lent the brush appeared to take the least precaution   as they were they composed themselves to sleep  i had seen the  lights of philadelphia and been twice ordered to change carriages  and twice countermanded before i allowed myself to follow their  example  tuesday  when i awoke it was already day the train was standing  idle i was in the last carriage and seeing some others strolling  to and fro about the lines i opened the door and stepped forth as  from a caravan by the wayside  we were near no station nor even  as far as i could see within reach of any signal  a green open  undulating country stretched away upon all sides  locust trees and  a single field of indian corn gave it a foreign grace and interest  but the contours of the land were soft and english  it was not  quite england neither was it quite france yet like enough either  to seem natural in my eyes  and it was in the sky and not upon  the earth that i was surprised to find a change  explain it how  you may and for my part i cannot explain it at all the sun rises  with a different splendour in america and europe  there is more  clear gold and scarlet in our old country mornings more purple  brown and smoky orange in those of the new  it may be from habit  but to me the coming of day is less fresh and inspiriting in the  latter it has a duskier glory and more nearly resembles sunset  it seems to fit some subsequential evening epoch of the world as  though america were in fact and not merely in fancy farther from  the orient of aurora and the springs of day  i thought so then by  the railroad side in pennsylvania and i have thought so a dozen  times since in far distant parts of the continent  if it be an  illusion it is one very deeply rooted and in which my eyesight is  accomplice  soon after a train whisked by announcing and accompanying its  passage by the swift beating of a sort of chapel bell upon the  engine and as it was for this we had been waiting we were  summoned by the cry of all aboard and went on again upon our  way  the whole line it appeared was topsyturvy an accident at  midnight having thrown all the traffic hours into arrear  we paid  for this in the flesh for we had no meals all that day  fruit we  could buy upon the cars and now and then we had a few minutes at  some station with a meagre show of rolls and sandwiches for sale  but we were so many and so ravenous that though i tried at every  opportunity the coffee was always exhausted before i could elbow  my way to the counter  our american sunrise had ushered in a noble summers day  there  was not a cloud the sunshine was baking yet in the woody river  valleys among which we wound our way the atmosphere preserved a  sparkling freshness till late in the afternoon  it had an inland  sweetness and variety to one newly from the sea it smelt of woods  rivers and the delved earth  these though in so far a country  were airs from home  i stood on the platform by the hour and as i  saw one after another pleasant villages carts upon the highway  and fishers by the stream and heard cockcrows and cheery voices in  the distance and beheld the sun no longer shining blankly on the  plains of ocean but striking among shapely hills and his light  dispersed and coloured by a thousand accidents of form and surface  i began to exult with myself upon this rise in life like a man who  had come into a rich estate  and when i had asked the name of a  river from the brakesman and heard that it was called the  susquehanna the beauty of the name seemed to be part and parcel of  the beauty of the land  as when adam with divine fitness named the  creatures so this word susquehanna was at once accepted by the  fancy  that was the name as no other could be for that shining  river and desirable valley  none can care for literature in itself who do not take a special  pleasure in the sound of names and there is no part of the world  where nomenclature is so rich poetical humorous and picturesque  as the united states of america  all times races and languages  have brought their contribution  pekin is in the same state with  euclid with bellefontaine and with sandusky  chelsea with its  london associations of red brick sloane square and the kings  road is own suburb to stately and primeval memphis there they  have their seat translated names of cities where the mississippi  runs by tennessee and arkansas and both while i was crossing the  continent lay watched by armed men in the horror and isolation  of a plague  old red manhattan lies like an indian arrowhead  under a steam factory below anglified new york  the names of the  states and territories themselves form a chorus of sweet and most  romantic vocables  delaware ohio indiana florida dakota iowa  wyoming minnesota and the carolinas there are few poems with a  nobler music for the ear  a songful tuneful land and if the new  homer shall arise from the western continent his verse will be  enriched his pages sing spontaneously with the names of states  and cities that would strike the fancy in a business circular  late in the evening we were landed in a waitingroom at pittsburg   i had now under my charge a young and sprightly dutch widow with  her children these i was to watch over providentially for a  certain distance farther on the way but as i found she was  furnished with a basket of eatables i left her in the waitingroom  to seek a dinner for myself  i mention this meal not only because  it was the first of which i had partaken for about thirty hours  but because it was the means of my first introduction to a coloured  gentleman  he did me the honour to wait upon me after a fashion  while i was eating and with every word look and gesture marched  me farther into the country of surprise  he was indeed strikingly  unlike the negroes of mrs beecher stowe or the christy minstrels  of my youth  imagine a gentleman certainly somewhat dark but of  a pleasant warm hue speaking english with a slight and rather odd  foreign accent every inch a man of the world and armed with  manners so patronisingly superior that i am at a loss to name their  parallel in england  a butler perhaps rides as high over the  unbutlered but then he sets you right with a reserve and a sort of  sighing patience which one is often moved to admire  and again  the abstract butler never stoops to familiarity  but the coloured  gentleman will pass you a wink at a time he is familiar like an  upper form boy to a fag he unbends to you like prince hal with  poins and falstaff  he makes himself at home and welcome  indeed  i may say this waiter behaved himself to me throughout that supper  much as with us a young free and not very selfrespecting  master might behave to a goodlooking chambermaid  i had come  prepared to pity the poor negro to put him at his ease to prove  in a thousand condescensions that i was no sharer in the prejudice  of race but i assure you i put my patronage away for another  occasion and had the grace to be pleased with that result  seeing he was a very honest fellow i consulted him upon a point of  etiquette  if one should offer to tip the american waiter   certainly not he told me  never  it would not do  they  considered themselves too highly to accept  they would even resent  the offer  as for him and me we had enjoyed a very pleasant  conversation he in particular had found much pleasure in my  society i was a stranger this was exactly one of those rare  conjunctures  without being very clear seeing i can still  perceive the sun at noonday and the coloured gentleman deftly  pocketed a quarter  wednesday  a little after midnight i convoyed my widow and  orphans on board the train and morning found us far into ohio   this had early been a favourite home of my imagination i have  played at being in ohio by the week and enjoyed some capital sport  there with a dummy gun my person being still unbreeched  my  preference was founded on a work which appeared in cassells family  paper and was read aloud to me by my nurse  it narrated the  doings of one custaloga an indian brave who in the last chapter  very obligingly washed the paint off his face and became sir  reginald somebodyorother a trick i never forgave him  the idea  of a man being an indian brave and then giving that up to be a  baronet was one which my mind rejected  it offended  verisimilitude like the pretended anxiety of robinson crusoe and  others to escape from uninhabited islands  but ohio was not at all as i had pictured it  we were now on those  great plains which stretch unbroken to the rocky mountains  the  country was flat like holland but far from being dull  all  through ohio indiana illinois and iowa or for as much as i saw  of them from the train and in my waking moments it was rich and  various and breathed an elegance peculiar to itself  the tall  corn pleased the eye the trees were graceful in themselves and  framed the plain into long aerial vistas and the clean bright  gardened townships spoke of country fare and pleasant summer  evenings on the stoop  it was a sort of flat paradise but i am  afraid not unfrequented by the devil  that morning dawned with  such a freezing chill as i have rarely felt a chill that was not  perhaps so measurable by instrument as it struck home upon the  heart and seemed to travel with the blood  day came in with a  shudder  white mists lay thinly over the surface of the plain as  we see them more often on a lake and though the sun had soon  dispersed and drunk them up leaving an atmosphere of fever heat  and crystal pureness from horizon to horizon the mists had still  been there and we knew that this paradise was haunted by killing  damps and foul malaria  the fences along the line bore but two  descriptions of advertisement one to recommend tobaccos and the  other to vaunt remedies against the ague  at the point of day and  while we were all in the grasp of that first chill a native of the  state who had got in at some way station pronounced it with a  doctoral air a fever and ague morning  the dutch widow was a person of some character  she had conceived  at first sight a great aversion for the present writer which she  was at no pains to conceal  but being a woman of a practical  spirit she made no difficulty about accepting my attentions and  encouraged me to buy her children fruits and candies to carry all  her parcels and even to sleep upon the floor that she might profit  by my empty seat  nay she was such a rattle by nature and so  powerfully moved to autobiographical talk that she was forced for  want of a better to take me into confidence and tell me the story  of her life  i heard about her late husband who seemed to have  made his chief impression by taking her out pleasuring on sundays   i could tell you her prospects her hopes the amount of her  fortune the cost of her housekeeping by the week and a variety of  particular matters that are not usually disclosed except to  friends  at one station she shook up her children to look at a  man on the platform and say if he were not like mr z while to me  she explained how she had been keeping company with this mr z  how far matters had proceeded and how it was because of his  desistance that she was now travelling to the west  then when i  was thus put in possession of the facts she asked my judgment on  that type of manly beauty  i admired it to her hearts content   she was not i think remarkably veracious in talk but broidered  as fancy prompted and built castles in the air out of her past  yet she had that sort of candour to keep me in spite of all these  confidences steadily aware of her aversion  her parting words  were ingeniously honest  i am sure said she we all ought to  be very much obliged to you  i cannot pretend that she put me at  my ease but i had a certain respect for such a genuine dislike  a  poor nature would have slipped in the course of these  familiarities into a sort of worthless toleration for me  we reached chicago in the evening  i was turned out of the cars  bundled into an omnibus and driven off through the streets to the  station of a different railroad  chicago seemed a great and gloomy  city  i remember having subscribed let us say sixpence towards  its restoration at the period of the fire and now when i beheld  street after street of ponderous houses and crowds of comfortable  burghers i thought it would be a graceful act for the corporation  to refund that sixpence or at the least to entertain me to a  cheerful dinner  but there was no word of restitution  i was that  citys benefactor yet i was received in a thirdclass waiting room and the best dinner i could get was a dish of ham and eggs at  my own expense  i can safely say i have never been so dogtired as that night in  chicago  when it was time to start i descended the platform like  a man in a dream  it was a long train lighted from end to end  and car after car as i came up with it was not only filled but  overflowing  my valise my knapsack my rug with those six  ponderous tomes of bancroft weighed me double i was hot  feverish painfully athirst and there was a great darkness over  me an internal darkness not to be dispelled by gas  when at last  i found an empty bench i sank into it like a bundle of rags the  world seemed to swim away into the distance and my consciousness  dwindled within me to a mere pins head like a taper on a foggy  night  when i came a little more to myself i found that there had sat  down beside me a very cheerful rosy little german gentleman  somewhat gone in drink who was talking away to me nineteen to the  dozen as they say  i did my best to keep up the conversation for  it seemed to me dimly as if something depended upon that  i heard  him relate among many other things that there were pickpockets on  the train who had already robbed a man of forty dollars and a  return ticket but though i caught the words i do not think i  properly understood the sense until next morning and i believe i  replied at the time that i was very glad to hear it  what else he  talked about i have no guess i remember a gabbling sound of words  his profuse gesticulation and his smile which was highly  explanatory  but no more  and i suppose i must have shown my  confusion very plainly for first i saw him knit his brows at me  like one who has conceived a doubt next he tried me in german  supposing perhaps that i was unfamiliar with the english tongue  and finally in despair he rose and left me  i felt chagrined  but my fatigue was too crushing for delay and stretching myself  as far as that was possible upon the bench i was received at once  into a dreamless stupor  the little german gentleman was only going a little way into the  suburbs after a diner fin and was bent on entertainment while the  journey lasted  having failed with me he pitched next upon  another emigrant who had come through from canada and was not one  jot less weary than myself  nay even in a natural state as i  found next morning when we scraped acquaintance he was a heavy  uncommunicative man  after trying him on different topics it  appears that the little german gentleman flounced into a temper  swore an oath or two and departed from that car in quest of  livelier society  poor little gentleman  i suppose he thought an  emigrant should be a rollicking freehearted blade with a flask  of foreign brandy and a long comical story to beguile the moments  of digestion  thursday  i suppose there must be a cycle in the fatigue of  travelling for when i awoke next morning i was entirely renewed  in spirits and ate a hearty breakfast of porridge with sweet milk  and coffee and hot cakes at burlington upon the mississippi   another long days ride followed with but one feature worthy of  remark  at a place called creston a drunken man got in  he was  aggressively friendly but according to english notions not at  all unpresentable upon a train  for one stage he eluded the notice  of the officials but just as we were beginning to move out of the  next station cromwell by name by came the conductor  there was a  word or two of talk and then the official had the man by the  shoulders twitched him from his seat marched him through the car  and sent him flying on to the track  it was done in three motions  as exact as a piece of drill  the train was still moving slowly  although beginning to mend her pace and the drunkard got his feet  without a fall  he carried a red bundle though not so red as his  cheeks and he shook this menacingly in the air with one hand  while the other stole behind him to the region of the kidneys  it  was the first indication that i had come among revolvers and i  observed it with some emotion  the conductor stood on the steps  with one hand on his hip looking back at him and perhaps this  attitude imposed upon the creature for he turned without further  ado and went off staggering along the track towards cromwell  followed by a peal of laughter from the cars  they were speaking  english all about me but i knew i was in a foreign land  twenty minutes before nine that night we were deposited at the  pacific transfer station near council bluffs on the eastern bank  of the missouri river  here we were to stay the night at a kind of  caravanserai set apart for emigrants  but i gave way to a thirst  for luxury separated myself from my companions and marched with  my effects into the union pacific hotel  a white clerk and a  coloured gentleman whom in my plain european way i should call  the boots were installed behind a counter like bank tellers  they  took my name assigned me a number and proceeded to deal with my  packages  and here came the tug of war  i wished to give up my  packages into safe keeping but i did not wish to go to bed  and  this it appeared was impossible in an american hotel  it was of course some inane misunderstanding and sprang from my  unfamiliarity with the language  for although two nations use the  same words and read the same books intercourse is not conducted by  the dictionary  the business of life is not carried on by words  but in set phrases each with a special and almost a slang  signification  some international obscurity prevailed between me  and the coloured gentleman at council bluffs so that what i was  asking which seemed very natural to me appeared to him a  monstrous exigency  he refused and that with the plainness of the  west  this american manner of conducting matters of business is  at first highly unpalatable to the european  when we approach a  man in the way of his calling and for those services by which he  earns his bread we consider him for the time being our hired  servant  but in the american opinion two gentlemen meet and have  a friendly talk with a view to exchanging favours if they shall  agree to please  i know not which is the more convenient nor even  which is the more truly courteous  the english stiffness  unfortunately tends to be continued after the particular  transaction is at an end and thus favours class separations  but  on the other hand these equalitarian plainnesses leave an open  field for the insolence of jackinoffice  i was nettled by the coloured gentlemans refusal and unbuttoned  my wrath under the similitude of ironical submission  i knew  nothing i said of the ways of american hotels but i had no  desire to give trouble  if there was nothing for it but to get to  bed immediately let him say the word and though it was not my  habit i should cheerfully obey  he burst into a shout of laughter  ah said he you do not know  about america  they are fine people in america  oh you will like  them very well  but you mustnt get mad  i know what you want   you come along with me  and issuing from behind the counter and taking me by the arm like  an old acquaintance he led me to the bar of the hotel  there said he pushing me from him by the shoulder go and have  a drink   the emigrant train   all this while i had been travelling by mixed trains where i might  meet with dutch widows and little german gentry fresh from table   i had been but a latent emigrant now i was to be branded once  more and put apart with my fellows  it was about two in the  afternoon of friday that i found myself in front of the emigrant  house with more than a hundred others to be sorted and boxed for  the journey  a whitehaired official with a stick under one arm  and a list in the other hand stood apart in front of us and  called name after name in the tone of a command  at each name you  would see a family gather up its brats and bundles and run for the  hindmost of the three cars that stood awaiting us and i soon  concluded that this was to be set apart for the women and children   the second or central car it turned out was devoted to men  travelling alone and the third to the chinese  the official was  easily moved to anger at the least delay but the emigrants were  both quick at answering their names and speedy in getting  themselves and their effects on board  the families once housed we men carried the second car without  ceremony by simultaneous assault  i suppose the reader has some  notion of an american railroadcar that long narrow wooden box  like a flatroofed noahs ark with a stove and a convenience one  at either end a passage down the middle and transverse benches  upon either hand  those destined for emigrants on the union  pacific are only remarkable for their extreme plainness nothing  but wood entering in any part into their constitution and for the  usual inefficacy of the lamps which often went out and shed but a  dying glimmer even while they burned  the benches are too short  for anything but a young child  where there is scarce elbowroom  for two to sit there will not be space enough for one to lie   hence the company or rather as it appears from certain bills  about the transfer station the companys servants have conceived  a plan for the better accommodation of travellers  they prevail on  every two to chum together  to each of the chums they sell a board  and three square cushions stuffed with straw and covered with thin  cotton  the benches can be made to face each other in pairs for  the backs are reversible  on the approach of night the boards are  laid from bench to bench making a couch wide enough for two and  long enough for a man of the middle height and the chums lie down  side by side upon the cushions with the head to the conductors van  and the feet to the engine  when the train is full of course this  plan is impossible for there must not be more than one to every  bench neither can it be carried out unless the chums agree  it  was to bring about this last condition that our whitehaired  official now bestirred himself  he made a most active master of  ceremonies introducing likely couples and even guaranteeing the  amiability and honesty of each  the greater the number of happy  couples the better for his pocket for it was he who sold the raw  material of the beds  his price for one board and three straw  cushions began with two dollars and a half but before the train  left and i am sorry to say long after i had purchased mine it  had fallen to one dollar and a half  the matchmaker had a difficulty with me perhaps like some  ladies i showed myself too eager for union at any price but  certainly the first who was picked out to be my bedfellow declined  the honour without thanks  he was an old heavy slowspoken man  i think from yankeeland looked me all over with great timidity  and then began to excuse himself in broken phrases  he didnt know  the young man he said  the young man might be very honest but  how was he to know that  there was another young man whom he had  met already in the train he guessed he was honest and would  prefer to chum with him upon the whole  all this without any sort  of excuse as though i had been inanimate or absent  i began to  tremble lest every one should refuse my company and i be left  rejected  but the next in turn was a tall strapping longlimbed  smallheaded curlyhaired pennsylvania dutchman with a soldierly  smartness in his manner  to be exact he had acquired it in the  navy  but that was all one he had at least been trained to  desperate resolves so he accepted the match and the whitehaired  swindler pronounced the connubial benediction and pocketed his  fees  the rest of the afternoon was spent in making up the train  i am  afraid to say how many baggagewaggons followed the engine  certainly a score then came the chinese then we then the  families and the rear was brought up by the conductor in what if  i have it rightly is called his caboose  the class to which i  belonged was of course far the largest and we ran over so to  speak to both sides so that there were some caucasians among the  chinamen and some bachelors among the families  but our own car  was pure from admixture save for one little boy of eight or nine  who had the whoopingcough  at last about six the long train  crawled out of the transfer station and across the wide missouri  river to omaha westward bound  it was a troubled uncomfortable evening in the cars  there was  thunder in the air which helped to keep us restless  a man played  many airs upon the cornet and none of them were much attended to  until he came to home sweet home  it was truly strange to note  how the talk ceased at that and the faces began to lengthen  i  have no idea whether musically this air is to be considered good or  bad but it belongs to that class of art which may be best  described as a brutal assault upon the feelings  pathos must be  relieved by dignity of treatment  if you wallow naked in the  pathetic like the author of home sweet home you make your  hearers weep in an unmanly fashion and even while yet they are  moved they despise themselves and hate the occasion of their  weakness  it did not come to tears that night for the experiment  was interrupted  an elderly hardlooking man with a goatee beard  and about as much appearance of sentiment an you would expect from  a retired slaver turned with a start and bade the performer stop  that damned thing  ive heard about enough of that he added  give us something about the good country were going to  a  murmur of adhesion ran round the car the performer took the  instrument from his lips laughed and nodded and then struck into  a dancing measure and like a new timotheus stilled immediately  the emotion he had raised  the day faded the lamps were lit a party of wild young men who  got off next evening at north platte stood together on the stern  platform singing the sweet byandbye with very tuneful voices  the chums began to put up their beds and it seemed as if the  business of the day were at an end  but it was not so for the  train stopping at some station the cars were instantly thronged  with the natives wives and fathers young men and maidens some of  them in little more than nightgear some with stable lanterns and  all offering beds for sale  their charge began with twentyfive  cents a cushion but fell before the train went on again to  fifteen with the bedboard gratis or less than onefifth of what  i had paid for mine at the transfer  this is my contribution to  the economy of future emigrants  a great personage on an american train is the newsboy  he sells  books such books papers fruit lollipops and cigars and on  emigrant journeys soap towels tin washing dishes tin coffee  pitchers coffee tea sugar and tinned eatables mostly hash or  beans and bacon  early next morning the newsboy went around the  cars and chumming on a more extended principle became the order of  the hour  it requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds but  washing and eating can be carried on most economically by a  syndicate of three  i myself entered a little after sunrise into  articles of agreement and became one of the firm of pennsylvania  shakespeare and dubuque  shakespeare was my own nickname on the  cars pennsylvania that of my bedfellow and dubuque the name of a  place in the state of iowa that of an amiable young fellow going  west to cure an asthma and retarding his recovery by incessantly  chewing or smoking and sometimes chewing and smoking together  i  have never seen tobacco so sillily abused  shakespeare bought a  tin washingdish dubuque a towel and pennsylvania a brick of  soap  the partners used these instruments one after another  according to the order of their first awaking and when the firm  had finished there was no want of borrowers  each filled the tin  dish at the water filter opposite the stove and retired with the  whole stock in trade to the platform of the car  there he knelt  down supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one  elbow crooked about the railing and made a shift to wash his face  and neck and hands a cold an insufficient and if the train is  moving rapidly a somewhat dangerous toilet  on a similar division of expense the firm of pennsylvania  shakespeare and dubuque supplied themselves with coffee sugar  and necessary vessels and their operations are a type of what went  on through all the cars  before the sun was up the stove would be  brightly burning at the first station the natives would come on  board with milk and eggs and coffee cakes and soon from end to end  the car would be filled with little parties breakfasting upon the  bedboards  it was the pleasantest hour of the day  there were meals to be had however by the wayside  a breakfast  in the morning a dinner somewhere between eleven and two and  supper from five to eight or nine at night  we had rarely less  than twenty minutes for each and if we had not spent many another  twenty minutes waiting for some express upon a side track among  miles of desert we might have taken an hour to each repast and  arrived at san francisco up to time  for haste is not the foible  of an emigrant train  it gets through on sufferance running the  gauntlet among its more considerable brethren should there be a  block it is unhesitatingly sacrificed and they cannot in  consequence predict the length of the passage within a day or so   civility is the main comfort that you miss  equality though  conceived very largely in america does not extend so low down as  to an emigrant  thus in all other trains a warning cry of  all  aboard recalls the passengers to take their seats but as soon as  i was alone with emigrants and from the transfer all the way to  san francisco i found this ceremony was pretermitted the train  stole from the station without note of warning and you had to keep  an eye upon it even while you ate  the annoyance is considerable  and the disrespect both wanton and petty  many conductors again will hold no communication with an  emigrant  i asked a conductor one day at what time the train would  stop for dinner as he made no answer i repeated the question with  a like result a third time i returned to the charge and then  jackinoffice looked me coolly in the face for several seconds and  turned ostentatiously away  i believe he was half ashamed of his  brutality for when another person made the same inquiry although  he still refused the information he condescended to answer and  even to justify his reticence in a voice loud enough for me to  hear  it was he said his principle not to tell people where they  were to dine for one answer led to many other questions as what  oclock it was or how soon should we be there and he could not  afford to be eternally worried  as you are thus cut off from the superior authorities a great deal  of your comfort depends on the character of the newsboy  he has it  in his power indefinitely to better and brighten the emigrants  lot  the newsboy with whom we started from the transfer was a  dark bullying contemptuous insolent scoundrel who treated us  like dogs  indeed in his case matters came nearly to a fight   it happened thus  he was going his rounds through the cars with  some commodities for sale and coming to a party who were at seven up or cascino our two games upon a bedboard slung down a  cigarbox in the middle of the cards knocking one mans hand to  the floor  it was the last straw  in a moment the whole party  were upon their feet the cigars were upset and he was ordered to  get out of that directly or he would get more than he reckoned  for the fellow grumbled and muttered but ended by making off  and was less openly insulting in the future  on the other hand  the lad who rode with us in this capacity from ogden to sacramento  made himself the friend of all and helped us with information  attention assistance and a kind countenance  he told us where  and when we should have our meals and how long the train would  stop kept seats at table for those who were delayed and watched  that we should neither be left behind nor yet unnecessarily  hurried  you who live at home at ease can hardly realise the  greatness of this service even had it stood alone  when i think  of that lad coming and going train after train with his bright  face and civil words i see how easily a good man may become the  benefactor of his kind  perhaps he is discontented with himself  perhaps troubled with ambitions why if he but knew it he is a  hero of the old greek stamp and while he thinks he is only earning  a profit of a few cents and that perhaps exorbitant he is doing a  mans work and bettering the world  i must tell here an experience of mine with another newsboy  i  tell it because it gives so good an example of that uncivil  kindness of the american which is perhaps their most bewildering  character to one newly landed  it was immediately after i had left  the emigrant train and i am told i looked like a man at deaths  door so much had this long journey shaken me  i sat at the end of  a car and the catch being broken and myself feverish and sick i  had to hold the door open with my foot for the sake of air  in  this attitude my leg debarred the newsboy from his box of  merchandise  i made haste to let him pass when i observed that he  was coming but i was busy with a book and so once or twice he  came upon me unawares  on these occasions he most rudely struck my  foot aside and though i myself apologised as if to show him the  way he answered me never a word  i chafed furiously and i fear  the next time it would have come to words  but suddenly i felt a  touch upon my shoulder and a large juicy pear was put into my  hand  it was the newsboy who had observed that i was looking ill  and so made me this present out of a tender heart  for the rest of  the journey i was petted like a sick child he lent me newspapers  thus depriving himself of his legitimate profit on their sale and  came repeatedly to sit by me and cheer me up   the plains of nebraska   it had thundered on the friday night but the sun rose on saturday  without a cloud  we were at sea  there is no other adequate  expression  on the plains of nebraska  i made my observatory on  the top of a fruitwaggon and sat by the hour upon that perch to  spy about me and to spy in vain for something new  it was a world  almost without a feature an empty sky an empty earth front and  back the line of railway stretched from horizon to horizon like a  cue across a billiardboard on either hand the green plain ran  till it touched the skirts of heaven  along the track innumerable  wild sunflowers no bigger than a crownpiece bloomed in a  continuous flowerbed grazing beasts were seen upon the prairie at  all degrees of distance and diminution and now and again we might  perceive a few dots beside the railroad which grew more and more  distinct as we drew nearer till they turned into wooden cabins and  then dwindled and dwindled in our wake until they melted into their  surroundings and we were once more alone upon the billiardboard   the train toiled over this infinity like a snail and being the one  thing moving it was wonderful what huge proportions it began to  assume in our regard  it seemed miles in length and either end of  it within but a step of the horizon  even my own body or my own  head seemed a great thing in that emptiness  i note the feeling  the more readily as it is the contrary of what i have read of in  the experience of others  day and night above the roar of the  train our ears were kept busy with the incessant chirp of  grasshoppers  a noise like the winding up of countless clocks and  watches which began after a while to seem proper to that land  to one hurrying through by steam there was a certain exhilaration  in this spacious vacancy this greatness of the air this discovery  of the whole arch of heaven this straight unbroken prisonline  of the horizon  yet one could not but reflect upon the weariness  of those who passed by there in old days at the foots pace of  oxen painfully urging their teams and with no landmark but that  unattainable evening sun for which they steered and which daily  fled them by an equal stride  they had nothing it would seem to  overtake nothing by which to reckon their advance no sight for  repose or for encouragement but stage after stage only the dead  green waste under foot and the mocking fugitive horizon  but the  eye as i have been told found differences even here and at the  worst the emigrant came by perseverance to the end of his toil   it is the settlers after all at whom we have a right to marvel   our consciousness by which we live is itself but the creature of  variety  upon what food does it subsist in such a land  what  livelihood can repay a human creature for a life spent in this huge  sameness  he is cut off from books from news from company from  all that can relieve existence but the prosecution of his affairs   a sky full of stars is the most varied spectacle that he can hope   he may walk five miles and see nothing ten and it is as though he  had not moved twenty and still he is in the midst of the same  great level and has approached no nearer to the one object within  view the flat horizon which keeps pace with his advance  we are  full at home of the question of agreeable wallpapers and wise  people are of opinion that the temper may be quieted by sedative  surroundings  but what is to be said of the nebraskan settler   his is a wallpaper with a vengeance  one quarter of the universe  laid bare in all its gauntness  his eye must embrace at every glance the whole seeming concave of  the visible world it quails before so vast an outlook it is  tortured by distance yet there is no rest or shelter till the man  runs into his cabin and can repose his sight upon things near at  hand  hence i am told a sickness of the vision peculiar to these  empty plains  yet perhaps with sunflowers and cicadae summer and winter cattle  wife and family the settler may create a full and various  existence  one person at least i saw upon the plains who seemed in  every way superior to her lot  this was a woman who boarded us at  a way station selling milk  she was largely formed her features  were more than comely she had that great rarity  a fine  complexion which became her and her eyes were kind dark and  steady  she sold milk with patriarchal grace  there was not a  line in her countenance not a note in her soft and sleepy voice  but spoke of an entire contentment with her life  it would have  been fatuous arrogance to pity such a woman  yet the place where  she lived was to me almost ghastly  less than a dozen wooden  houses all of a shape and all nearly of a size stood planted  along the railway lines  each stood apart in its own lot  each  opened direct off the billiardboard as if it were a billiard board indeed and these only models that had been set down upon it  ready made  her own into which i looked was clean but very  empty and showed nothing homelike but the burning fire  this  extreme newness above all in so naked and flat a country gives a  strong impression of artificiality  with none of the litter and  discoloration of human life with the paths unworn and the houses  still sweating from the axe such a settlement as this seems purely  scenic  the mind is loth to accept it for a piece of reality and  it seems incredible that life can go on with so few properties or  the great child man find entertainment in so bare a playroom  and truly it is as yet an incomplete society in some points or at  least it contained as i passed through one person incompletely  civilised  at north platte where we supped that evening one man  asked another to pass the milkjug  this other was welldressed  and of what we should call a respectable appearance a darkish man  high spoken eating as though he had some usage of society but he  turned upon the first speaker with extraordinary vehemence of tone    theres a waiter here he cried  i only asked you to pass the milk explained the first  here is the retort verbatim   pass  hell  im not paid for that business the waiters paid  for it  you should use civility at table and by god ill show  you how  the other man very wisely made no answer and the bully went on  with his supper as though nothing had occurred  it pleases me to  think that some day soon he will meet with one of his own kidney  and that perhaps both may fall   the desert of wyoming   to cross such a plain is to grow homesick for the mountains  i  longed for the black hills of wyoming which i knew we were soon to  enter like an icebound whaler for the spring  alas and it was a  worse country than the other  all sunday and monday we travelled  through these sad mountains or over the main ridge of the rockies  which is a fair match to them for misery of aspect  hour after  hour it was the same unhomely and unkindly world about our onward  path tumbled boulders cliffs that drearily imitate the shape of  monuments and fortifications  how drearily how tamely none can  tell who has not seen them not a tree not a patch of sward not  one shapely or commanding mountain form sagebrush eternal sage brush over all the same weariful and gloomy colouring grays  warming into brown grays darkening towards black and for sole  sign of life here and there a few fleeing antelopes here and  there but at incredible intervals a creek running in a canon   the plains have a grandeur of their own but here there is nothing  but a contorted smallness  except for the air which was light and  stimulating there was not one good circumstance in that god forsaken land  i had been suffering in my health a good deal all the way and at  last whether i was exhausted by my complaint or poisoned in some  wayside eatinghouse the evening we left laramie i fell sick  outright  that was a night which i shall not readily forget  the  lamps did not go out each made a faint shining in its own  neighbourhood and the shadows were confounded together in the  long hollow box of the car  the sleepers lay in uneasy attitudes  here two chums alongside flat upon their backs like dead folk  there a man sprawling on the floor with his face upon his arm  there another half seated with his head and shoulders on the bench   the most passive were continually and roughly shaken by the  movement of the train others stirred turned or stretched out  their arms like children it was surprising how many groaned and  murmured in their sleep and as i passed to and fro stepping  across the prostrate and caught now a snore now a gasp now a  halfformed word it gave me a measure of the worthlessness of rest  in that unresting vehicle  although it was chill i was obliged to  open my window for the degradation of the air soon became  intolerable to one who was awake and using the full supply of life   outside in a glimmering night i saw the black amorphous hills  shoot by unweariedly into our wake  they that long for morning  have never longed for it more earnestly than i  and yet when day came it was to shine upon the same broken and  unsightly quarter of the world  mile upon mile and not a tree a  bird or a river  only down the long sterile canons the train  shot hooting and awoke the resting echo  that train was the one  piece of life in all the deadly land it was the one actor the one  spectacle fit to be observed in this paralysis of man and nature   and when i think how the railroad has been pushed through this  unwatered wilderness and haunt of savage tribes and now will bear  an emigrant for some 12 pounds from the atlantic to the golden  gates how at each stage of the construction roaring impromptu  cities full of gold and lust and death sprang up and then died  away again and are now but wayside stations in the desert how in  these uncouth places pigtailed chinese pirates worked side by side  with border ruffians and broken men from europe talking together  in a mixed dialect mostly oaths gambling drinking quarrelling  and murdering like wolves how the plumed hereditary lord of all  america heard in this last fastness the scream of the bad  medicine waggon charioting his foes and then when i go on to  remember that all this epical turmoil was conducted by gentlemen in  frock coats and with a view to nothing more extraordinary than a  fortune and a subsequent visit to paris it seems to me i own as  if this railway were the one typical achievement of the age in  which we live as if it brought together into one plot all the ends  of the world and all the degrees of social rank and offered to  some great writer the busiest the most extended and the most  varied subject for an enduring literary work  if it be romance if  it be contrast if it be heroism that we require what was troy  town to this  but alas it is not these things that are necessary   it is only homer  here also we are grateful to the train as to some god who conducts  us swiftly through these shades and by so many hidden perils   thirst hunger the sleight and ferocity of indians are all no more  feared so lightly do we skim these horrible lands as the gull  who wings safely through the hurricane and past the shark  yet we  should not be forgetful of these hardships of the past and to keep  the balance true since i have complained of the trifling  discomforts of my journey perhaps more than was enough let me add  an original document  it was not written by homer but by a boy of  eleven long since dead and is dated only twenty years ago  i  shall punctuate to make things clearer but not change the  spelling  my dear sister mary  i am afraid you will go nearly crazy when  you read my letter  if jerry the writers eldest brother has  not written to you before now you will be surprised to heare that  we are in california and that poor thomas another brother of  fifteen is dead  we started from  in july with plenly of  provisions and too yoke oxen  we went along very well till we got  within six or seven hundred miles of california when the indians  attacked us  we found places where they had killed the emigrants   we had one passenger with us too guns and one revolver so we ran  all the lead we had into bullets and hung the guns up in the  wagon so that we could get at them in a minit  it was about two  oclock in the afternoon droave the cattel a little way when a  prairie chicken alited a little way from the wagon  jerry took out one of the guns to shoot it and told tom drive the  oxen  tom and i drove the oxen and jerry and the passenger went  on  then after a little i left tom and caught up with jerry and  the other man  jerry stopped tom to come up me and the man went  on and sit down by a little stream  in a few minutes we heard  some noise then three shots they all struck poor tom i suppose  then they gave the war hoop and as many as twenty of the redskins  came down upon us  the three that shot tom was hid by the side of  the road in the bushes  i thought the tom and jerry were shot so i told the other man  that tom and jerry were dead and that we had better try to escape  if possible  i had no shoes on having a sore foot i thought i  would not put them on  the man and me run down the road but we  was soon stopped by an indian on a pony  we then turend the other  way and run up the side of the mountain and hid behind some cedar  trees and stayed there till dark  the indians hunted all over  after us and verry close to us so close that we could here there  tomyhawks jingle  at dark the man and me started on i stubing my  toes against sticks and stones  we traveld on all night and next  morning just as it was getting gray we saw something in the shape  of a man  it layed down in the grass  we went up to it and it  was jerry  he thought we ware indians  you can imagine how glad  he was to see me  he thought we was all dead but him and we  thought him and tom was dead  he had the gun that he took out of  the wagon to shoot the prairie chicken all he had was the load  that was in it  we traveld on till about eight oclock we caught up with one  wagon with too men with it  we had traveld with them before one  day we stopt and they drove on we knew that they was ahead of us  unless they had been killed to  my feet was so sore when we caught  up with them that i had to ride i could not step  we traveld on  for too days when the men that owned the cattle said they would  could not drive them another inch  we unyoked the oxen we had  about seventy pounds of flour we took it out and divided it into  four packs  each of the men took about 18 pounds apiece and a  blanket  i carried a little bacon dried meat and little quilt i  had in all about twelve pounds  we had one pint of flour a day for  our alloyance  sometimes we made soup of it sometimes we made  pancakes and sometimes mixed it up with cold water and eat it that  way  we traveld twelve or fourteen days  the time came at last  when we should have to reach some place or starve  we saw fresh  horse and cattle tracks  the morning come we scraped all the  flour out of the sack mixed it up and baked it into bread and  made some soup and eat everything we had  we traveld on all day  without anything to eat and that evening we caught up with a sheep  train of eight wagons  we traveld with them till we arrived at the  settlements and know i am safe in california and got to good  home and going to school  jerry is working in    it is a good country  you can get from  50 to 60 and 75 dollars for cooking  tell me all about the affairs  in the states and how all the folks get along  and so ends this artless narrative  the little man was at school  again god bless him while his brother lay scalped upon the  deserts   fellowpassengers   at ogden we changed cars from the union pacific to the central  pacific line of railroad  the change was doubly welcome for  first we had better cars on the new line and second those in  which we had been cooped for more than ninety hours had begun to  stink abominably  several yards away as we returned let us say  from dinner our nostrils were assailed by rancid air  i have  stood on a platform while the whole train was shunting and as the  dwellingcars drew near there would come a whiff of pure  menagerie only a little sourer as from men instead of monkeys  i  think we are human only in virtue of open windows  without fresh  air you only require a bad heart and a remarkable command of the  queens english to become such another as dean swift a kind of  leering human goat leaping and wagging your scut on mountains of  offence  i do my best to keep my head the other way and look for  the human rather than the bestial in this yahoolike business of  the emigrant train  but one thing i must say the car of the  chinese was notably the least offensive  the cars on the central pacific were nearly twice as high and so  proportionally airier they were freshly varnished which gave us  all a sense of cleanliness an though we had bathed the seats drew  out and joined in the centre so that there was no more need for  bed boards and there was an upper tier of berths which could be  closed by day and opened at night  i had by this time some opportunity of seeing the people whom i was  among  they were in rather marked contrast to the emigrants i had  met on board ship while crossing the atlantic  they were mostly  lumpish fellows silent and noisy a common combination somewhat  sad i should say with an extraordinary poor taste in humour and  little interest in their fellowcreatures beyond that of a cheap  and merely external curiosity  if they heard a mans name and  business they seemed to think they had the heart of that mystery  but they were as eager to know that much as they were indifferent  to the rest  some of them were on nettles till they learned your  name was dickson and you a journeyman baker but beyond that  whether you were catholic or mormon dull or clever fierce or  friendly was all one to them  others who were not so stupid  gossiped a little and i am bound to say unkindly  a favourite  witticism was for some lout to raise the alarm of  all aboard  while the rest of us were dining thus contributing his mite to the  general discomfort  such a one was always much applauded for his  high spirits  when i was ill coming through wyoming i was  astonished  fresh from the eager humanity on board ship  to meet  with little but laughter  one of the young men even amused himself  by incommoding me as was then very easy and that not from ill nature but mere clodlike incapacity to think for he expected me  to join the laugh  i did so but it was phantom merriment  later  on a man from kansas had three violent epileptic fits and though  of course there were not wanting some to help him it was rather  superstitious terror than sympathy that his case evoked among his  fellowpassengers  oh i hope hes not going to die cried a  woman it would be terrible to have a dead body  and there was a  very general movement to leave the man behind at the next station   this by good fortune the conductor negatived  there was a good deal of storytelling in some quarters in others  little but silence  in this society more than any other that ever  i was in it was the narrator alone who seemed to enjoy the  narrative  it was rarely that any one listened for the listening   if he lent an ear to another mans story it was because he was in  immediate want of a hearer for one of his own  food and the  progress of the train were the subjects most generally treated  many joined to discuss these who otherwise would hold their  tongues  one small knot had no better occupation than to worm out  of me my name and the more they tried the more obstinately fixed  i grew to baffle them  they assailed me with artful questions and  insidious offers of correspondence in the future but i was  perpetually on my guard and parried their assaults with inward  laughter  i am sure dubuque would have given me ten dollars for  the secret  he owed me far more had he understood life for thus  preserving him a lively interest throughout the journey  i met one  of my fellowpassengers months after driving a street tramway car  in san francisco and as the joke was now out of season told him  my name without subterfuge  you never saw a man more chapfallen   but had my name been demogorgon after so prolonged a mystery he  had still been disappointed  there were no emigrants direct from europe  save one german family  and a knot of cornish miners who kept grimly by themselves one  reading the new testament all day long through steel spectacles  the rest discussing privately the secrets of their oldworld  mysterious race  lady hester stanhope believed she could make  something great of the cornish for my part i can make nothing of  them at all  a division of races older and more original than  that of babel keeps this close esoteric family apart from  neighbouring englishmen  not even a red indian seems more foreign  in my eyes  this is one of the lessons of travel  that some of  the strangest races dwell next door to you at home  the rest were all american born but they came from almost every  quarter of that continent  all the states of the north had sent  out a fugitive to cross the plains with me  from virginia from  pennsylvania from new york from far western iowa and kansas from  maime that borders on the canadas and from the canadas themselves   some one or two were fleeing in quest of a better land and better  wages  the talk in the train like the talk i heard on the  steamer ran upon hard times short commons and hope that moves  ever westward  i thought of my shipful from great britain with a  feeling of despair  they had come 3000 miles and yet not far  enough  hard times bowed them out of the clyde and stood to  welcome them at sandy hook  where were they to go  pennsylvania  maine iowa kansas  these were not places for immigration but  for emigration it appeared not one of them but i knew a man who  had lifted up his heel and left it for an ungrateful country  and  it was still westward that they ran  hunger you would have  thought came out of the east like the sun and the evening was  made of edible gold  and meantime in the car in front of me  were there not half a hundred emigrants from the opposite quarter   hungry europe and hungry china each pouring from their gates in  search of provender had here come face to face  the two waves had  met east and west had alike failed the whole round world had been  prospected and condemned there was no el dorado anywhere and till  one could emigrate to the moon it seemed as well to stay patiently  at home  nor was there wanting another sign at once more  picturesque and more disheartening for as we continued to steam  westward toward the land of gold we were continually passing other  emigrant trains upon the journey east and these were as crowded as  our own  had all these return voyagers made a fortune in the  mines  were they all bound for paris and to be in rome by easter   it would seem not for whenever we met them the passengers ran on  the platform and cried to us through the windows in a kind of  wailing chorus to come back  on the plains of nebraska in the  mountains of wyoming it was still the same cry and dismal to my  heart come back  that was what we heard by the way about the  good country we were going to  and at that very hour the sandlot  of san francisco was crowded with the unemployed and the echo from  the other side of market street was repeating the rant of  demagogues  if in truth it were only for the sake of wages that men emigrate  how many thousands would regret the bargain  but wages indeed  are only one consideration out of many for we are a race of  gipsies and love change and travel for themselves   despised races   of all stupid illfeelings the sentiment of my fellow caucasians  towards our companions in the chinese car was the most stupid and  the worst  they seemed never to have looked at them listened to  them or thought of them but hated them a priori  the mongols  were their enemies in that cruel and treacherous battlefield of  money  they could work better and cheaper in half a hundred  industries and hence there was no calumny too idle for the  caucasians to repeat and even to believe  they declared them  hideous vermin and affected a kind of choking in the throat when  they beheld them  now as a matter of fact the young chinese man  is so like a large class of european women that on raising my head  and suddenly catching sight of one at a considerable distance i  have for an instant been deceived by the resemblance  i do not say  it is the most attractive class of our women but for all that many  a mans wife is less pleasantly favoured  again my emigrants  declared that the chinese were dirty  i cannot say they were  clean for that was impossible upon the journey but in their  efforts after cleanliness they put the rest of us to shame  we all  pigged and stewed in one infamy wet our hands and faces for half a  minute daily on the platform and were unashamed  but the chinese  never lost an opportunity and you would see them washing their  feet  an act not dreamed of among ourselves  and going as far as  decency permitted to wash their whole bodies  i may remark by the  way that the dirtier people are in their persons the more delicate  is their sense of modesty  a clean man strips in a crowded  boathouse but he who is unwashed slinks in and out of bed without  uncovering an inch of skin  lastly these very foul and malodorous  caucasians entertained the surprising illusion that it was the  chinese waggon and that alone which stank  i have said already  that it was the exceptions and notably the freshest of the three  these judgments are typical of the feeling in all western america   the chinese are considered stupid because they are imperfectly  acquainted with english  they are held to be base because their  dexterity and frugality enable them to underbid the lazy luxurious  caucasian  they are said to be thieves i am sure they have no  monopoly of that  they are called cruel the anglosaxon and the  cheerful irishman may each reflect before he bears the accusation   i am told again that they are of the race of river pirates and  belong to the most despised and dangerous class in the celestial  empire  but if this be so what remarkable pirates have we here  and what must be the virtues the industry the education and the  intelligence of their superiors at home  awhile ago it was the irish now it is the chinese that must go   such is the cry  it seems after all that no country is bound to  submit to immigration any more than to invasion each is war to the  knife and resistance to either but legitimate defence  yet we may  regret the free tradition of the republic which loved to depict  herself with open arms welcoming all unfortunates  and certainly  as a man who believes that he loves freedom i may be excused some  bitterness when i find her sacred name misused in the contention   it was but the other day that i heard a vulgar fellow in the sand lot the popular tribune of san francisco roaring for arms and  butchery  at the call of abraham lincoln said the orator ye  rose in the name of freedom to set free the negroes can ye not  rise and liberate yourselves from a few dirty mongolians  for my own part i could not look but with wonder and respect on  the chinese  their forefathers watched the stars before mine had  begun to keep pigs  gunpowder and printing which the other day  we imitated and a school of manners which we never had the  delicacy so much as to desire to imitate were theirs in a long past antiquity  they walk the earth with us but it seems they  must be of different clay  they hear the clock strike the same  hour yet surely of a different epoch  they travel by steam  conveyance yet with such a baggage of old asiatic thoughts and  superstitions as might check the locomotive in its course   whatever is thought within the circuit of the great wall what the  wryeyed spectacled schoolmaster teaches in the hamlets round  pekin religions so old that our language looks a halfing boy  alongside philosophy so wise that our best philosophers find  things therein to wonder at all this travelled alongside of me for  thousands of miles over plain and mountain  heaven knows if we had  one common thought or fancy all that way or whether our eyes  which yet were formed upon the same design beheld the same world  out of the railway windows  and when either of us turned his  thoughts to home and childhood what a strange dissimilarity must  there not have been in these pictures of the mind  when i beheld  that old gray castled city high throned above the firth with  the flag of britain flying and the redcoat sentry pacing over  all and the man in the next car to me would conjure up some junks  and a pagoda and a fort of porcelain and call it with the same  affection home  another race shared among my fellowpassengers in the disfavour of  the chinese and that it is hardly necessary to say was the noble  red man of old story  over whose own hereditary continent we had  been steaming all these days  i saw no wild or independent indian  indeed i hear that such avoid the neighbourhood of the train but  now and again at way stations a husband and wife and a few  children disgracefully dressed out with the sweepings of  civilisation came forth and stared upon the emigrants  the silent  stoicism of their conduct and the pathetic degradation of their  appearance would have touched any thinking creature but my  fellowpassengers danced and jested round them with a truly cockney  baseness  i was ashamed for the thing we call civilisation  we  should carry upon our consciences so much at least of our  forefathers misconduct as we continue to profit by ourselves  if oppression drives a wise man mad what should be raging in the  hearts of these poor tribes who have been driven back and back  step after step their promised reservations torn from them one  after another as the states extended westward until at length they  are shut up into these hideous mountain deserts of the centre  and  even there find themselves invaded insulted and hunted out by  ruffianly diggers  the eviction of the cherokees to name but an  instance the extortion of indian agents the outrages of the  wicked the illfaith of all nay down to the ridicule of such  poor beings as were here with me upon the train make up a chapter  of injustice and indignity such as a man must be in some ways base  if his heart will suffer him to pardon or forget  these old well founded historical hatreds have a savour of nobility for the  independent  that the jew should not love the christian nor the  irishman love the english nor the indian brave tolerate the  thought of the american is not disgraceful to the nature of man  rather indeed honourable since it depends on wrongs ancient like  the race and not personal to him who cherishes the indignation   to the golden gates   a little corner of utah is soon traversed and leaves no particular  impressions on the mind  by an early hour on wednesday morning we  stopped to breakfast at toano a little station on a bleak high lying plateau in nevada  the man who kept the station eatinghouse  was a scot and learning that i was the same he grew very  friendly and gave me some advice on the country i was now  entering  you see said he i tell you this because i come  from your country  hail brither scots  his most important hint was on the moneys of this part of the  world  there is something in the simplicity of a decimal coinage  which is revolting to the human mind thus the french in small  affairs reckon strictly by halfpence and you have to solve by a  spasm of mental arithmetic such posers as thirtytwo fortyfive  or even a hundred halfpence  in the pacific states they have made  a bolder push for complexity and settle their affairs by a coin  that no longer that no longer exists  the bit or old mexican  real  the supposed value of the bit is twelve and a half cents  eight to the dollar  when it comes to two bits the quarterdollar  stands for the required amount  but how about an odd bit  the  nearest coin to it is a dime which is short by a fifth  that  then is called a short bit  if you have one you lay it  triumphantly down and save two and a half cents  but if you have  not and lay down a quarter the barkeeper or shopman calmly  tenders you a dime by way of change and thus you have paid what is  called a long bit and lost two and a half cents or even by  comparison with a short bit five cents  in country places all  over the pacific coast nothing lower than a bit is ever asked or  taken which vastly increases the cost of life as even for a glass  of beer you must pay fivepence or sevenpencehalfpenny as the case  may be  you would say that this system of mutual robbery was as  broad as it was long but i have discovered a plan to make it  broader with which i here endow the public  it is brief and  simple  radiantly simple  there is one place where five cents are  recognised and that is the postoffice  a quarter is only worth  two bits a short and a long  whenever you have a quarter go to  the postoffice and buy five cents worth of postagestamps you  will receive in change two dimes that is two short bits  the  purchasing power of your money is undiminished  you can go and  have your two glasses of beer all the same and you have made  yourself a present of five cents worth of postagestamps into the  bargain  benjamin franklin would have patted me on the head for  this discovery  from toano we travelled all day through deserts of alkali and sand  horrible to man and bare sagebrush country that seemed little  kindlier and came by suppertime to elko  as we were standing  after our manner outside the station i saw two men whip suddenly  from underneath the cars and take to their heels across country   they were tramps it appeared who had been riding on the beams  since eleven of the night before and several of my fellow passengers had already seen and conversed with them while we broke  our fast at toano  these land stowaways play a great part over  here in america and i should have liked dearly to become  acquainted with them  at elko an odd circumstance befell me  i was coming out from  supper when i was stopped by a small stout ruddy man followed  by two others taller and ruddier than himself  excuse me sir he said but do you happen to be going on  i said i was whereupon he said he hoped to persuade me to desist  from that intention  he had a situation to offer me and if we  could come to terms why good and well  you see he continued  im running a theatre here and were a little short in the  orchestra  youre a musician i guess  i assured him that beyond a rudimentary acquaintance with auld  lang syne and the wearing of the green i had no pretension  whatever to that style  he seemed much put out of countenance and  one of his taller companions asked him on the nail for five  dollars  you see sir added the latter to me he bet you were a  musician i bet you werent  no offence i hope  none whatever i said and the two withdrew to the bar where i  presume the debt was liquidated  this little adventure woke bright hopes in my fellowtravellers  who thought they had now come to a country where situations went a begging  but i am not so sure that the offer was in good faith   indeed i am more than half persuaded it was but a feeler to decide  the bet  of all the next day i will tell you nothing for the best of all  reasons that i remember no more than that we continued through  desolate and desert scenes fiery hot and deadly weary  but some  time after i had fallen asleep that night i was awakened by one of  my companions  it was in vain that i resisted  a fire of  enthusiasm and whisky burned in his eyes and he declared we were  in a new country and i must come forth upon the platform and see  with my own eyes  the train was then in its patient way standing  halted in a bytrack  it was a clear moonlit night but the  valley was too narrow to admit the moonshine direct and only a  diffused glimmer whitened the tall rocks and relieved the blackness  of the pines  a hoarse clamour filled the air it was the  continuous plunge of a cascade somewhere near at hand among the  mountains  the air struck chill but tasted good and vigorous in  the nostrils  a fine dry old mountain atmosphere  i was dead  sleepy but i returned to roost with a grateful mountain feeling at  my heart  when i awoke next morning i was puzzled for a while to know if it  were day or night for the illumination was unusual  i sat up at  last and found we were grading slowly downward through a long  snowshed and suddenly we shot into an open and before we were  swallowed into the next length of wooden tunnel i had one glimpse  of a huge pineforested ravine upon my left a foaming river and a  sky already coloured with the fires of dawn  i am usually very  calm over the displays of nature but you will scarce believe how  my heart leaped at this  it was like meeting ones wife  i had  come home again  home from unsightly deserts to the green and  habitable corners of the earth  every spire of pine along the  hilltop every trouty pool along that mountain river was more  dear to me than a blood relation  few people have praised god more  happily than i did  and thenceforward down by blue canon alta  dutch flat and all the old mining camps through a sea of mountain  forests dropping thousands of feet toward the far sealevel as we  went not i only but all the passengers on board threw off their  sense of dirt and heat and weariness and bawled like schoolboys  and thronged with shining eyes upon the platform and became new  creatures within and without  the sun no longer oppressed us with  heat it only shone laughingly along the mountainside until we  were fain to laugh ourselves for glee  at every turn we could see  farther into the land and our own happy futures  at every town the  cocks were tossing their clear notes into the golden air and  crowing for the new day and the new country  for this was indeed  our destination this was the good country we had been going to  so long  by afternoon we were at sacramento the city of gardens in a plain  of corn and the next day before the dawn we were lying to upon the  oakland side of san francisco bay  the day was breaking as we  crossed the ferry the fog was rising over the citied hills of san  francisco the bay was perfect  not a ripple scarce a stain upon  its blue expanse everything was waiting breathless for the sun   a spot of cloudy gold lit first upon the head of tamalpais and  then widened downward on its shapely shoulder the air seemed to  awaken and began to sparkle and suddenly  the tall hills titan discovered  and the city of san francisco and the bay of gold and corn were  lit from end to end with summer daylight  1879    chapter ii  the old pacific capital    the woods and the pacific   the bay of monterey has been compared by no less a person than  general sherman to a bent fishinghook and the comparison if less  important than the march through georgia still shows the eye of a  soldier for topography  santa cruz sits exposed at the shank the  mouth of the salinas river is at the middle of the bend and  monterey itself is cosily ensconced beside the barb  thus the  ancient capital of california faces across the bay while the  pacific ocean though hidden by low hills and forest bombards her  left flank and rear with neverdying surf  in front of the town  the long line of seabeach trends north and northwest and then  westward to enclose the bay  the waves which lap so quietly about  the jetties of monterey grow louder and larger in the distance you  can see the breakers leaping high and white by day at night the  outline of the shore is traced in transparent silver by the  moonlight and the flying foam and from all round even in quiet  weather the distant thrilling roar of the pacific hangs over the  coast and the adjacent country like smoke above a battle  these long beaches are enticing to the idle man  it would be hard  to find a walk more solitary and at the same time more exciting to  the mind  crowds of ducks and seagulls hover over the sea   sandpipers trot in and out by troops after the retiring waves  trilling together in a chorus of infinitesimal song  strange sea tangles new to the european eye the bones of whales or sometimes  a whole whales carcase white with carriongulls and poisoning the  wind lie scattered here and there along the sands  the waves come  in slowly vast and green curve their translucent necks and burst  with a surprising uproar that runs waxing and waning up and down  the long keyboard of the beach  the foam of these great ruins  mounts in an instant to the ridge of the sand glacis swiftly  fleets back again and is met and buried by the next breaker  the  interest is perpetually fresh  on no other coast that i know shall  you enjoy in calm sunny weather such a spectacle of oceans  greatness such beauty of changing colour or such degrees of  thunder in the sound  the very air is more than usually salt by  this homeric deep  inshore a tract of sandhills borders on the beach  here and  there a lagoon more or less brackish attracts the birds and  hunters  a rough undergrowth partially conceals the sand  the  crouching hardy liveoaks flourish singly or in thickets  the  kind of wood for murderers to crawl among  and here and there the  skirts of the forest extend downward from the hills with a floor of  turf and long aisles of pinetrees hung with spaniards beard   through this quaint desert the railway cars drew near to monterey  from the junction at salinas city  though that and so many other  things are now for ever altered  and it was from here that you had  the first view of the old township lying in the sands its white  windmills bickering in the chill perpetual wind and the first  fogs of the evening drawing drearily around it from the sea  the one common note of all this country is the haunting presence of  the ocean  a great faint sound of breakers follows you high up  into the inland canons the roar of water dwells in the clean  empty rooms of monterey as in a shell upon the chimney go where  you will you have but to pause and listen to hear the voice of the  pacific  you pass out of the town to the southwest and mount the  hill among pinewoods  glade thicket and grove surround you   you follow winding sandy tracks that lead nowhither  you see a  deer a multitude of quail arises  but the sound of the sea still  follows you as you advance like that of wind among the trees only  harsher and stranger to the ear and when at length you gain the  summit out breaks on every hand and with freshened vigour that  same unending distant whispering rumble of the ocean for now you  are on the top of monterey peninsula and the noise no longer only  mounts to you from behind along the beach towards santa cruz but  from your right also round by chinatown and pinos lighthouse and  from down before you to the mouth of the carmello river  the whole  woodland is begirt with thundering surges  the silence that  immediately surrounds you where you stand is not so much broken as  it is haunted by this distant circling rumour  it sets your  senses upon edge you strain your attention you are clearly and  unusually conscious of small sounds near at hand you walk  listening like an indian hunter and that voice of the pacific is a  sort of disquieting company to you in your walk  when once i was in these woods i found it difficult to turn  homeward  all woods lure a rambler onward but in those of  monterey it was the surf that particularly invited me to prolong my  walks  i would push straight for the shore where i thought it to  be nearest  indeed there was scarce a direction that would not  sooner or later have brought me forth on the pacific  the  emptiness of the woods gave me a sense of freedom and discovery in  these excursions  i never in all my visits met but one man  he  was a mexican very dark of hue but smiling and fat and he  carried an axe though his true business at that moment was to seek  for straying cattle  i asked him what oclock it was but he  seemed neither to know nor care and when he in his turn asked me  for news of his cattle i showed myself equally indifferent  we  stood and smiled upon each other for a few seconds and then turned  without a word and took our several ways across the forest  one day  i shall never forget it  i had taken a trail that was  new to me  after a while the woods began to open the sea to sound  nearer hand  i came upon a road and to my surprise a stile  a  step or two farther and without leaving the woods i found myself  among trim houses  i walked through street after street parallel  and at right angles paved with sward and dotted with trees but  still undeniable streets and each with its name posted at the  corner as in a real town  facing down the main thoroughfare   central avenue as it was ticketed  i saw an openair temple  with benches and soundingboard as though for an orchestra  the  houses were all tightly shuttered there was no smoke no sound but  of the waves no moving thing  i have never been in any place that  seemed so dreamlike  pompeii is all in a bustle with visitors and  its antiquity and strangeness deceive the imagination but this  town had plainly not been built above a year or two and perhaps  had been deserted overnight  indeed it was not so much like a  deserted town as like a scene upon the stage by daylight and with  no one on the boards  the barking of a dog led me at last to the  only house still occupied where a scotch pastor and his wife pass  the winter alone in this empty theatre  the place was the pacific  camp grounds the christian seaside resort  thither in the warm  season crowds come to enjoy a life of teetotalism religion and  flirtation which i am willing to think blameless and agreeable   the neighbourhood at least is well selected  the pacific booms in  front  westward is point pinos with the lighthouse in a  wilderness of sand where you will find the lightkeeper playing the  piano making models and bows and arrows studying dawn and sunrise  in amateur oilpainting and with a dozen other elegant pursuits  and interests to surprise his brave oldcountry rivals  to the  east and still nearer you will come upon a space of open down a  hamlet a haven among rocks a world of surge and screaming sea gulls  such scenes are very similar in different climates they  appear homely to the eyes of all to me this was like a dozen spots  in scotland  and yet the boats that ride in the haven are of  strange outlandish design and if you walk into the hamlet you  will behold costumes and faces and hear a tongue that are  unfamiliar to the memory  the jossstick burns the opium pipe is  smoked the floors are strewn with slips of coloured paper   prayers you would say that had somehow missed their destination   and a man guiding his upright pencil from right to left across the  sheet writes home the news of monterey to the celestial empire  the woods and the pacific rule between them the climate of this  seaboard region  on the streets of monterey when the air does not  smell salt from the one it will be blowing perfumed from the  resinous treetops of the other  for days together a hot dry air  will overhang the town close as from an oven yet healthful and  aromatic in the nostrils  the cause is not far to seek for the  woods are afire and the hot wind is blowing from the hills  these  fires are one of the great dangers of california  i have seen from  monterey as many as three at the same time by day a cloud of  smoke by night a red coal of conflagration in the distance  a  little thing will start them and if the wind be favourable they  gallop over miles of country faster than a horse  the inhabitants  must turn out and work like demons for it is not only the pleasant  groves that are destroyed the climate and the soil are equally at  stake and these fires prevent the rains of the next winter and dry  up perennial fountains  california has been a land of promise in  its time like palestine but if the woods continue so swiftly to  perish it may become like palestine a land of desolation  to visit the woods while they are languidly burning is a strange  piece of experience  the fire passes through the underbrush at a  run  every here and there a tree flares up instantaneously from  root to summit scattering tufts of flame and is quenched it  seems as quickly  but this last is only in semblance  for after  this first squiblike conflagration of the dry moss and twigs  there remains behind a deeprooted and consuming fire in the very  entrails of the tree  the resin of the pitchpine is principally  condensed at the base of the bole and in the spreading roots   thus after the light showy skirmishing flames which are only as  the match to the explosion have already scampered down the wind  into the distance the true harm is but beginning for this giant of  the woods  you may approach the tree from one side and see it  scorched indeed from top to bottom but apparently survivor of the  peril  make the circuit and there on the other side of the  column is a clear mass of living coal spreading like an ulcer  while underground to their most extended fibre the roots are  being eaten out by fire and the smoke is rising through the  fissures to the surface  a little while and without a nod of  warning the huge pinetree snaps off short across the ground and  falls prostrate with a crash  meanwhile the fire continues its  silent business the roots are reduced to a fine ash and long  afterwards if you pass by you will find the earth pierced with  radiating galleries and preserving the design of all these  subterranean spurs as though it were the mould for a new tree  instead of the print of an old one  these pitchpines of monterey  are with the single exception of the monterey cypress the most  fantastic of forest trees  no words can give an idea of the  contortion of their growth they might figure without change in a  circle of the nether hell as dante pictured it and at the rate at  which trees grow and at which forest fires spring up and gallop  through the hills of california we may look forward to a time when  there will not be one of them left standing in that land of their  nativity  at least they have not so much to fear from the axe but  perish by what may be called a natural although a violent death  while it is man in his shortsighted greed that robs the country of  the nobler redwood  yet a little while and perhaps all the hills  of seaboard california may be as bald as tamalpais  i have an interest of my own in these forest fires for i came so  near to lynching on one occasion that a braver man might have  retained a thrill from the experience  i wished to be certain  whether it was the moss that quaint funereal ornament of  californian forests which blazed up so rapidly when the flame  first touched the tree  i suppose i must have been under the  influence of satan for instead of plucking off a piece for my  experiment what should i do but walk up to a great pinetree in a  portion of the wood which had escaped so much as scorching strike  a match and apply the flame gingerly to one of the tassels  the  tree went off simply like a rocket in three seconds it was a  roaring pillar of fire  close by i could hear the shouts of those  who were at work combating the original conflagration  i could see  the waggon that had brought them tied to a live oak in a piece of  open i could even catch the flash of an axe as it swung up through  the underwood into the sunlight  had any one observed the result  of my experiment my neck was literally not worth a pinch of snuff  after a few minutes of passionate expostulation i should have been  run up to convenient bough  to die for faction is a common evil but to be hanged for nonsense is the devil  i have run repeatedly but never as i ran that day  at night i  went out of town and there was my own particular fire quite  distinct from the other and burning as i thought with even greater  vigour  but it is the pacific that exercises the most direct and obvious  power upon the climate  at sunset for months together vast wet  melancholy fogs arise and come shoreward from the ocean  from the  hilltop above monterey the scene is often noble although it is  always sad  the upper air is still bright with sunlight a glow  still rests upon the gabelano peak but the fogs are in possession  of the lower levels they crawl in scarves among the sandhills  they float a little higher in clouds of a gigantic size and often  of a wild configuration to the south where they have struck the  seaward shoulder of the mountains of santa lucia they double back  and spire up skyward like smoke  where their shadow touches  colour dies out of the world  the air grows chill and deadly as  they advance  the tradewind freshens the trees begin to sigh  and all the windmills in monterey are whirling and creaking and  filling their cisterns with the brackish water of the sands  it  takes but a little while till the invasion is complete  the sea  in its lighter order has submerged the earth  monterey is  curtained in for the night in thick wet salt and frigid clouds  so to remain till day returns and before the suns rays they  slowly disperse and retreat in broken squadrons to the bosom of the  sea  and yet often when the fog is thickest and most chill a few  steps out of the town and up the slope the night will be dry and  warm and full of inland perfume   mexicans americans and indians   the history of monterey has yet to be written  founded by catholic  missionaries a place of wise beneficence to indians a place of  arms a mexican capital continually wrested by one faction from  another an american capital when the first house of  representatives held its deliberations and then falling lower and  lower from the capital of the state to the capital of a county and  from that again by the loss of its charter and town lands to a  mere bankrupt village its rise and decline is typical of that of  all mexican institutions and even mexican families in california  nothing is stranger in that strange state than the rapidity with  which the soil has changedhands  the mexicans you may say are  all poor and landless like their former capital and yet both it  and they hold themselves apart and preserve their ancient customs  and something of their ancient air  the town when i was there was a place of two or three streets  economically paved with seasand and two or three lanes which  were watercourses in the rainy season and were at all times rent  up by fissures four or five feet deep  there were no street  lights  short sections of wooden sidewalk only added to the  dangers of the night for they were often high above the level of  the roadway and no one could tell where they would be likely to  begin or end  the houses were for the most part built of unbaked  adobe brick many of them old for so new a country some of very  elegant proportions with low spacious shapely rooms and walls  so thick that the heat of summer never dried them to the heart  at  the approach of the rainy season a deathly chill and a graveyard  smell began to hang about the lower floors and diseases of the  chest are common and fatal among housekeeping people of either  sex  there was no activity but in and around the saloons where people  sat almost all day long playing cards  the smallest excursion was  made on horseback  you would scarcely ever see the main street  without a horse or two tied to posts and making a fine figure with  their mexican housings  it struck me oddly to come across some of  the cornhill illustrations to mr blackmores erema and see all  the characters astride on english saddles  as a matter of fact an  english saddle is a rarity even in san francisco and you may say  a thing unknown in all the rest of california  in a place so  exclusively mexican as monterey you saw not only mexican saddles  but true vaquero riding  men always at the handgallop up hill and  down dale and round the sharpest corner urging their horses with  cries and gesticulations and cruel rotatory spurs checking them  dead with a touch or wheeling them rightaboutface in a square  yard  the type of face and character of bearing are surprisingly  unamerican  the first ranged from something like the pure  spanish to something in its sad fixity not unlike the pure  indian although i do not suppose there was one pure blood of  either race in all the country  as for the second it was a matter  of perpetual surprise to find in that world of absolutely  mannerless americans a people full of deportment solemnly  courteous and doing all things with grace and decorum  in dress  they ran to colour and bright sashes  not even the most  americanised could always resist the temptation to stick a red rose  into his hatband  not even the most americanised would descend to  wear the vile dress hat of civilisation  spanish was the language  of the streets  it was difficult to get along without a word or  two of that language for an occasion  the only communications in  which the population joined were with a view to amusement  a  weekly public ball took place with great etiquette in addition to  the numerous fandangoes in private houses  there was a really fair  amateur brass band  night after night serenaders would be going  about the street sometimes in a company and with several  instruments and voice together sometimes severally each guitar  before a different window  it was a strange thing to lie awake in  nineteenthcentury america and hear the guitar accompany and one  of these old heartbreaking spanish lovesongs mount into the  night air perhaps in a deep baritone perhaps in that high pitched pathetic womanish alto which is so common among mexican  men and which strikes on the unaccustomed ear as something not  entirely human but altogether sad  the town then was essentially and wholly mexican and yet almost  all the land in the neighbourhood was held by americans and it was  from the same class numerically so small that the principal  officials were selected  this mexican and that mexican would  describe to you his old family estates not one rood of which  remained to him  you would ask him how that came about and elicit  some tangled story backforemost from which you gathered that the  americans had been greedy like designing men and the mexicans  greedy like children but no other certain fact  their merits and  their faults contributed alike to the ruin of the former  landholders  it is true they were improvident and easily dazzled  with the sight of ready money but they were gentlefolk besides  and that in a way which curiously unfitted them to combat yankee  craft  suppose they have a paper to sign they would think it a  reflection on the other party to examine the terms with any great  minuteness nay suppose them to observe some doubtful clause it  is ten to one they would refuse from delicacy to object to it  i  know i am speaking within the mark for i have seen such a case  occur and the mexican in spite of the advice of his lawyer has  signed the imperfect paper like a lamb  to have spoken in the  matter he said above all to have let the other party guess that  he had seen a lawyer would have been like doubting his word   the scruple sounds oddly to one of ourselves who have been brought  up to understand all business as a competition in fraud and  honesty itself to be a virtue which regards the carrying out but  not the creation of agreements  this single unworldly trait will  account for much of that revolution of which we are speaking  the  mexicans have the name of being great swindlers but certainly the  accusation cuts both ways  in a contest of this sort the entire  booty would scarcely have passed into the hands of the more  scupulous race  physically the americans have triumphed but it is not entirely  seen how far they have themselves been morally conquered  this is  of course but a part of a part of an extraordinary problem now in  the course of being solved in the various states of the american  union  i am reminded of an anecdote  some years ago at a great  sale of wine all the odd lots were purchased by a grocer in a  small way in the old town of edinburgh  the agent had the  curiosity to visit him some time after and inquire what possible  use he could have for such material  he was shown by way of  answer a huge vat where all the liquors from humble gladstone to  imperial tokay were fermenting together  and what he asked  do you propose to call this  im no very sure replied the  grocer but i think its going to turn out port  in the older  eastern states i think we may say that this hotchpotch of races  in going to turn out english or thereabout  but the problem is  indefinitely varied in other zones  the elements are differently  mingled in the south in what we may call the territorial belt and  in the group of states on the pacific coast  above all in these  last we may look to see some monstrous hybrid  whether good or  evil who shall forecast but certainly original and all their own   in my little restaurant at monterey we have sat down to table day  after day a frenchman two portuguese an italian a mexican and  a scotchman  we had for common visitors an american from illinois  a nearly pure blood indian woman and a naturalised chinese and  from time to time a switzer and a german came down from country  ranches for the night  no wonder that the pacific coast is a  foreign land to visitors from the eastern states for each race  contributes something of its own  even the despised chinese have  taught the youth of california none indeed of their virtues but  the debasing use of opium  and chief among these influences is  that of the mexicans  the mexicans although in the state are out of it  they still  preserve a sort of international independence and keep their  affairs snug to themselves  only four or five years ago vasquez  the bandit his troops being dispersed and the hunt too hot for him  in other parts of california returned to his native monterey and  was seen publicly in her streets and saloons fearing no man  the  year that i was there there occurred two reputed murders  as the  montereyans are exceptionally vile speakers of each other and of  every one behind his back it is not possible for me to judge how  much truth there may have been in these reports but in the one  case every one believed and in the other some suspected that  there had been foul play and nobody dreamed for an instant of  taking the authorities into their counsel  now this is of course  characteristic enough of the mexicans but it is a noteworthy  feature that all the americans in monterey acquiesced without a  word in this inaction  even when i spoke to them upon the subject  they seemed not to understand my surprise they had forgotten the  traditions of their own race and upbringing and become in a word  wholly mexicanised  again the mexicans having no ready money to speak of rely almost  entirely in their business transactions upon each others worthless  paper  pedro the penniless pays you with an i o u from the equally  penniless miguel  it is a sort of local currency by courtesy   credit in these parts has passed into a superstition  i have seen  a strong violent man struggling for months to recover a debt and  getting nothing but an exchange of waste paper  the very  storekeepers are averse to asking for cash payments and are more  surprised than pleased when they are offered  they fear there must  be something under it and that you mean to withdraw your custom  from them  i have seen the enterprising chemist and stationer  begging me with fervour to let my account run on although i had my  purse open in my hand and partly from the commonness of the case  partly from some remains of that generous old mexican tradition  which made all men welcome to their tables a person may be  notoriously both unwilling and unable to pay and still find credit  for the necessaries of life in the stores of monterey  now this  villainous habit of living upon tick has grown into californian  nature  i do not mean that the american and european storekeepers  of monterey are as lax as mexicans i mean that american farmers in  many parts of the state expect unlimited credit and profit by it  in the meanwhile without a thought for consequences  jew  storekeepers have already learned the advantage to be gained from  this they lead on the farmer into irretrievable indebtedness and  keep him ever after as their bondslave hopelessly grinding in the  mill  so the whirligig of time brings in its revenges and except  that the jew knows better than to foreclose you may see americans  bound in the same chains with which they themselves had formerly  bound the mexican  it seems as if certain sorts of follies like  certain sorts of grain were natural to the soil rather than to the  race that holds and tills it for the moment  in the meantime however the americans rule in monterey county   the new county seat salinas city in the bald cornbearing plain  under the gabelano peak is a town of a purely american character   the land is held for the most part in those enormous tracts which  are another legacy of mexican days and form the present chief  danger and disgrace of california and the holders are mostly of  american or british birth  we have here in england no idea of the  troubles and inconveniences which flow from the existence of these  large landholders  landthieves landsharks or landgrabbers  they are more commonly and plainly called  thus the townlands of  monterey are all in the hands of a single man  how they came there  is an obscure vexatious question and rightly or wrongly the man  is hated with a great hatred  his life has been repeatedly in  danger  not very long ago i was told the stage was stopped and  examined three evenings in succession by disguised horsemen  thirsting for his blood  a certain house on the salinas road they  say he always passes in his buggy at full speed for the squatter  sent him warning long ago  but a year since he was publicly  pointed out for death by no less a man than mr dennis kearney   kearney is a man too well known in california but a word of  explanation is required for english readers  originally an irish  drayman he rose by his command of bad language to almost  dictatorial authority in the state throned it there for six months  or so his mouth full of oaths gallowses and conflagrations was  first snuffed out last winter by mr coleman backed by his san  francisco vigilantes and three gatling guns completed his own ruin  by throwing in his lot with the grotesque greenbacker party and  had at last to be rescued by his old enemies the police out of  the hands of his rebellious followers  it was while he was at the  top of his fortune that kearney visited monterey with his battle cry against chinese labour the railroad monopolists and the land thieves and his one articulate counsel to the montereyans was to  hang david jacks  had the town been american in my private  opinion this would have been done years ago  land is a subject on  which there is no jesting in the west and i have seen my friend  the lawyer drive out of monterey to adjust a competition of titles  with the face of a captain going into battle and his smithand wesson convenient to his hand  on the ranche of another of these landholders you may find our old  friend the truck system in full operation  men live there year  in year out to cut timber for a nominal wage which is all  consumed in supplies  the longer they remain in this desirable  service the deeper they will fall in debt  a burlesque injustice  in a new country where labour should be precious and one of those  typical instances which explains the prevailing discontent and the  success of the demagogue kearney  in a comparison between what was and what is in california the  praisers of times past will fix upon the indians of carmel  the  valley drained by the river so named is a true californian valley  bare dotted with chaparal overlooked by quaint unfinished hills   the carmel runs by many pleasant farms a clear and shallow river  loved by wading kine and at last as it is falling towards a  quicksand and the great pacific passes a ruined mission on a hill   from the mission church the eye embraces a great field of ocean  and the ear is filled with a continuous sound of distant breakers  on the shore  but the day of the jesuit has gone by the day of  the yankee has succeeded and there is no one left to care for the  converted savage  the church is roofless and ruinous seabreezes  and seafogs and the alternation of the rain and sunshine daily  widening the breaches and casting the crockets from the wall  as  an antiquity in this new land a quaint specimen of missionary  architecture and a memorial of good deeds it had a triple claim  to preservation from all thinking people but neglect and abuse  have been its portion  there is no sign of american interference  save where a headboard has been torn from a grave to be a mark for  pistol bullets  so it is with the indians for whom it was erected   their lands i was told are being yearly encroached upon by the  neighbouring american proprietor and with that exception no man  troubles his head for the indians of carmel  only one day in the  year the day before our guy fawkes the padre drives over the hill  from monterey the little sacristy which is the only covered  portion of the church is filled with seats and decorated for the  service the indians troop together their bright dresses  contrasting with their dark and melancholy faces and there among  a crowd of somewhat unsympathetic holidaymakers you may hear god  served with perhaps more touching circumstances than in any other  temple under heaven  an indian stoneblind and about eighty years  of age conducts the singing other indians compose the choir yet  they have the gregorian music at their finger ends and pronounce  the latin so correctly that i could follow the meaning as they  sang  the pronunciation was odd and nasal the singing hurried and  staccato  in saecula saeculohohorum they went with a vigorous  aspirate to every additional syllable  i have never seen faces  more vividly lit up with joy than the faces of these indian  singers  it was to them not only the worship of god nor an act by  which they recalled and commemorated better days but was besides  an exercise of culture where all they knew of art and letters was  united and expressed  and it made a mans heart sorry for the good  fathers of yore who had taught them to dig and to reap to read and  to sing who had given them european massbooks which they still  preserve and study in their cottages and who had now passed away  from all authority and influence in that land  to be succeeded by  greedy landthieves and sacrilegious pistolshots  so ugly a thing  may our anglosaxon protestantism appear beside the doings of the  society of jesus  but revolution in this world succeeds to revolution  all that i  say in this paper is in a paulopast tense  the monterey of last  year exists no longer  a huge hotel has sprung up in the desert by  the railway  three sets of diners sit down successively to table   invaluable toilettes figure along the beach and between the live  oaks and monterey is advertised in the newspapers and posted in  the waitingrooms at railway stations as a resort for wealth and  fashion  alas for the little town it is not strong enough to  resist the influence of the flaunting caravanserai and the poor  quaint penniless native gentlemen of monterey must perish like a  lower race before the millionaire vulgarians of the big bonanza  1880    chapter iii  fontainebleau  village communities of painters    i   the charm of fontainebleau is a thing apart  it is a place that  people love even more than they admire  the vigorous forest air  the silence the majestic avenues of highway the wilderness of  tumbled boulders the great age and dignity of certain groves   these are but ingredients they are not the secret of the philtre   the place is sanative the air the light the perfumes and the  shapes of things concord in happy harmony  the artist may be idle  and not fear the blues  he may dally with his life  mirth  lyric mirth and a vivacious classical contentment are of the very  essence of the better kind of art and these in that most smiling  forest he has the chance to learn or to remember  even on the  plain of biere where the angelus of millet still tolls upon the  ear of fancy a larger air a higher heaven something ancient and  healthy in the face of nature purify the mind alike from dulness  and hysteria  there is no place where the young are more gladly  conscious of their youth or the old better contented with their  age  the fact of its great and special beauty further recommends this  country to the artist  the field was chosen by men in whose blood  there still raced some of the gleeful or solemn exultation of great  art  millet who loved dignity like michelangelo rousseau whose  modern brush was dipped in the glamour of the ancients  it was  chosen before the day of that strange turn in the history of art  of which we now perceive the culmination in impressionistic tales  and pictures  that voluntary aversion of the eye from all  speciously strong and beautiful effects  that disinterested love  of dulness which has set so many peter bells to paint the river side primrose  it was then chosen for its proximity to paris  and  for the same cause and by the force of tradition the painter of  today continues to inhabit and to paint it  there is in france  scenery incomparable for romance and harmony  provence and the  valley of the rhone from vienne to tarascon are one succession of  masterpieces waiting for the brush  the beauty is not merely  beauty it tells besides a tale to the imagination and surprises  while it charms  here you shall see castellated towns that would  befit the scenery of dreamland streets that glow with colour like  cathedral windows hills of the most exquisite proportions flowers  of every precious colour growing thick like grass  all these by  the grace of railway travel are brought to the very door of the  modern painter yet he does not seek them he remains faithful to  fontainebleau to the eternal bridge of gretz to the wateringpot  cascade in cernay valley  even fontainebleau was chosen for him  even in fontainebleau he shrinks from what is sharply charactered   but one thing at least is certain whatever he may choose to  paint and in whatever manner it is good for the artist to dwell  among graceful shapes  fontainebleau if it be but quiet scenery  is classically graceful and though the student may look for  different qualities this quality silently present will educate  his hand and eye  but before all its other advantages  charm loveliness or  proximity to paris  comes the great fact that it is already  colonised  the institution of a painters colony is a work of time  and tact  the population must be conquered  the innkeeper has to  be taught and he soon learns the lesson of unlimited credit he  must be taught to welcome as a favoured guest a young gentleman in  a very greasy coat and with little baggage beyond a box of colours  and a canvas and he must learn to preserve his faith in customers  who will eat heartily and drink of the best borrow money to buy  tobacco and perhaps not pay a stiver for a year  a colour  merchant has next to be attracted  a certain vogue must be given  to the place lest the painter most gregarious of animals should  find himself alone  and no sooner are these first difficulties  overcome than fresh perils spring up upon the other side and the  bourgeois and the tourist are knocking at the gate  this is the  crucial moment for the colony  if these intruders gain a footing  they not only banish freedom and amenity pretty soon by means of  their long purses they will have undone the education of the  innkeeper prices will rise and credit shorten and the poor  painter must fare farther on and find another hamlet  not here o  apollo will become his song  thus trouville and the other day  st raphael were lost to the arts  curious and not always edifying  are the shifts that the french student uses to defend his lair  like the cuttlefish he must sometimes blacken the waters of his  chosen pool but at such a time and for so practical a purpose mrs  grundy must allow him licence  where his own purse and credit are  not threatened he will do the honours of his village generously   any artist is made welcome through whatever medium he may seek  expression science is respected even the idler if he prove as  he so rarely does a gentleman will soon begin to find himself at  home  and when that essentially modern creature the english or  american girlstudent began to walk calmly into his favourite inns  as if into a drawingroom at home the french painter owned himself  defenceless he submitted or he fled  his french respectability  quite as precise as ours though covering different provinces of  life recoiled aghast before the innovation  but the girls were  painters there was nothing to be done and barbizon when i last  saw it and for the time at least was practically ceded to the fair  invader  paterfamilias on the other hand the common tourist the  holiday shopman and the cheap young gentleman upon the spree he  hounded from his villages with every circumstance of contumely  this purely artistic society is excellent for the young artist   the lads are mostly fools they hold the latest orthodoxy in its  crudeness they are at that stage of education for the most part  when a man is too much occupied with style to be aware of the  necessity for any matter and this above all for the englishman  is excellent  to work grossly at the trade to forget sentiment  to think of his material and nothing else is for awhile at least  the kings highway of progress  here in england too many  painters and writers dwell dispersed unshielded among the  intelligent bourgeois  these when they are not merely  indifferent prate to him about the lofty aims and moral influence  of art  and this is the lads ruin  for art is first of all and  last of all a trade  the love of words and not a desire to  publish new discoveries the love of form and not a novel reading  of historical events mark the vocation of the writer and the  painter  the arabesque properly speaking and even in literature  is the first fancy of the artist he first plays with his material  as a child plays with a kaleidoscope and he is already in a second  stage when he begins to use his pretty counters for the end of  representation  in that he must pause long and toil faithfully  that is his apprenticeship and it is only the few who will really  grow beyond it and go forward fully equipped to do the business  of real art  to give life to abstractions and significance and  charm to facts  in the meanwhile let him dwell much among his  fellowcraftsmen  they alone can take a serious interest in the  childish tasks and pitiful successes of these years  they alone  can behold with equanimity this fingering of the dumb keyboard  this polishing of empty sentences this dull and literal painting  of dull and insignificant subjects  outsiders will spur him on   they will say why do you not write a great book paint a great  picture  if his guardian angel fail him they may even persuade  him to the attempt and ten to one his hand is coarsened and his  style falsified for life  and this brings me to a warning  the life of the apprentice to any  art is both unstrained and pleasing it is strewn with small  successes in the midst of a career of failure patiently supported  the heaviest scholar is conscious of a certain progress and if he  come not appreciably nearer to the art of shakespeare grows  letterperfect in the domain of ab ab  but the time comes when a  man should cease prelusory gymnastic stand up put a violence upon  his will and for better or worse begin the business of creation   this evil day there is a tendency continually to postpone  above  all with painters  they have made so many studies that it has  become a habit they make more the walls of exhibitions blush with  them and death finds these aged students still busy with their  hornbook  this class of man finds a congenial home in artist  villages in the slang of the english colony at barbizon we used to  call them snoozers  continual returns to the city the society  of men farther advanced the study of great works a sense of  humour or if such a thing is to be had a little religion or  philosophy are the means of treatment  it will be time enough to  think of curing the malady after it has been caught for to catch  it is the very thing for which you seek that dreamland of the  painters village  snoozing is a part of the artistic education  and the rudiments must be learned stupidly all else being  forgotten as if they were an object in themselves  lastly there is something or there seems to be something in the  very air of france that communicates the love of style  precision  clarity the cleanly and crafty employment of material a grace in  the handling apart from any value in the thought seem to be  acquired by the mere residence or if not acquired become at least  the more appreciated  the air of paris is alive with this  technical inspiration  and to leave that airy city and awake next  day upon the borders of the forest is but to change externals  the  same spirit of dexterity and finish breathes from the long alleys  and the lofty groves from the wildernesses that are still pretty  in their confusion and the great plain that contrives to be  decorative in its emptiness   ii   in spite of its really considerable extent the forest of  fontainebleau is hardly anywhere tedious  i know the whole western  side of it with what i suppose i may call thoroughness well  enough at least to testify that there is no square mile without  some special character and charm  such quarters for instance as  the long rocher the basbreau and the reine blanche might be a  hundred miles apart they have scarce a point in common beyond the  silence of the birds  the two last are really conterminous and in  both are tall and ancient trees that have outlived a thousand  political vicissitudes  but in the one the great oaks prosper  placidly upon an even floor they beshadow a great field and the  air and the light are very free below their stretching boughs  in  the other the trees find difficult footing castles of white rock  lie tumbled one upon another the foot slips the crooked viper  slumbers the moss clings in the crevice and above it all the  great beech goes spiring and casting forth her arms and with a  grace beyond church architecture canopies this rugged chaos   meanwhile dividing the two cantons the broad white causeway of  the paris road runs in an avenue  a road conceived for pageantry  and for triumphal marches an avenue for an army but its days of  glory over it now lies grilling in the sun between cool groves  and only at intervals the vehicle of the cruising tourist is seen  far away and faintly audible along its ample sweep  a little upon  one side and you find a district of sand and birch and boulder a  little upon the other lies the valley of apremont all juniper and  heather and close beyond that you may walk into a zone of pine  trees  so artfully are the ingredients mingled  nor must it be  forgotten that in all this part you come continually forth upon a  hilltop and behold the plain northward and westward like an  unrefulgent sea nor that all day long the shadows keep changing  and at last to the red fires of sunset night succeeds and with  the night a new forest full of whisper gloom and fragrance   there are few things more renovating than to leave paris the  lamplit arches of the carrousel and the long alignment of the  glittering streets and to bathe the senses in this fragrant  darkness of the wood  in this continual variety the mind is kept vividly alive  it is a  changeful place to paint a stirring place to live in  as fast as  your foot carries you you pass from scene to scene each  vigorously painted in the colours of the sun each endeared by that  hereditary spell of forests on the mind of man who still remembers  and salutes the ancient refuge of his race  and yet the forest has been civilised throughout  the most savage  corners bear a name and have been cherished like antiquities in  the most remote nature has prepared and balanced her effects as if  with conscious art and man with his guiding arrows of blue paint  has countersigned the picture  after your farthest wandering you  are never surprised to come forth upon the vast avenue of highway  to strike the centre point of branching alleys or to find the  aqueduct trailing thousandfooted through the brush  it is not a  wilderness it is rather a preserve  and fitly enough the centre  of the maze is not a hermits cavern  in the midst a little  mirthful town lies sunlit humming with the business of pleasure  and the palace breathing distinction and peopled by historic  names stands smokeless among gardens  perhaps the last attempt at savage life was that of the harmless  humbug who called himself the hermit  in a great tree close by  the highroad he had built himself a little cabin after the manner  of the swiss family robinson thither he mounted at night by the  romantic aid of a rope ladder and if dirt be any proof of  sincerity the man was savage as a sioux  i had the pleasure of  his acquaintance he appeared grossly stupid not in his perfect  wits and interested in nothing but small change for that he had a  great avidity  in the course of time he proved to be a chicken stealer and vanished from his perch and perhaps from the first he  was no true votary of forest freedom but an ingenious  theatricallyminded beggar and his cabin in the tree was only  stockintrade to beg withal  the choice of his position would  seem to indicate so much for if in the forest there are no places  still to be discovered there are many that have been forgotten  and that lie unvisited  there to be sure are the blue arrows  waiting to reconduct you now blazed upon a tree now posted in the  corner of a rock  but your security from interruption is complete  you might camp for weeks if there were only water and not a soul  suspect your presence and if i may suppose the reader to have  committed some great crime and come to me for aid i think i could  still find my way to a small cavern fitted with a hearth and  chimney where he might lie perfectly concealed  a confederate  landscapepainter might daily supply him with food for water he  would have to make a nightly tramp as far as to the nearest pond  and at last when the hue and cry began to blow over he might get  gently on the train at some side station work round by a series of  junctions and be quietly captured at the frontier  thus fontainebleau although it is truly but a pleasureground and  although in favourable weather and in the more celebrated  quarters it literally buzzes with the tourist yet has some of the  immunities and offers some of the repose of natural forests  and  the solitary although he must return at night to his frequented  inn may yet pass the day with his own thoughts in the  companionable silence of the trees  the demands of the imagination  vary some can be alone in a back garden looked upon by windows  others like the ostrich are content with a solitude that meets  the eye and others again expand in fancy to the very borders of  their desert and are irritably conscious of a hunters camp in an  adjacent county  to these last of course fontainebleau will seem  but an extended teagarden  a rosherville on a byday  but to the  plain man it offers solitude  an excellent thing in itself and a  good whet for company   iii   i was for some time a consistent barbizonian et ego in arcadia  vixi it was a pleasant season and that noiseless hamlet lying  close among the borders of the wood is for me as for so many  others a green spot in memory  the great millet was just dead  the green shutters of his modest house were closed his daughters  were in mourning  the date of my first visit was thus an epoch in  the history of art  in a lesser way it was an epoch in the  history of the latin quarter  the petit cenacle was dead and  buried murger and his crew of sponging vagabonds were all at rest  from their expedients the tradition of their real life was nearly  lost and the petrified legend of the vie de boheme had become a  sort of gospel and still gave the cue to zealous imitators  but  if the book be written in rosewater the imitation was still  farther expurgated honesty was the rule the innkeepers gave as i  have said almost unlimited credit they suffered the seediest  painter to depart to take all his belongings and to leave his  bill unpaid and if they sometimes lost it was by english and  americans alone  at the same time the great influx of anglo saxons had begun to affect the life of the studious  there had  been disputes and in one instance at least the english and the  americans had made common cause to prevent a cruel pleasantry  it  would be well if nations and races could communicate their  qualities but in practice when they look upon each other they  have an eye to nothing but defects  the anglosaxon is essentially  dishonest the french is devoid by nature of the principle that we  call fair play  the frenchman marvelled at the scruples of his  guest and when that defender of innocence retired overseas and  left his bills unpaid he marvelled once again the good and evil  were in his eyes part and parcel of the same eccentricity a  shrug expressed his judgment upon both  at barbizon there was no master no pontiff in the arts  palizzi  bore rule at gretz  urbane superior rule  his memory rich in  anecdotes of the great men of yore his mind fertile in theories  sceptical composed and venerable to the eye and yet beneath  these outworks all twittering with italian superstition his eye  scouting for omens and the whole fabric of his manners giving way  on the appearance of a hunchback  cernay had pelouse the  admirable placid pelouse smilingly critical of youth who when a  fullblown commercial traveller suddenly threw down his samples  bought a colourbox and became the master whom we have all  admired  marlotte for a central figure boasted olivier de penne   only barbizon since the death of millet was a headless  commonwealth  even its secondary lights and those who in my day  made the stranger welcome have since deserted it  the good  lachevre has departed carrying his household gods and long before  that gaston lafenestre was taken from our midst by an untimely  death  he died before he had deserved success it may be he would  never have deserved it but his kind comely modest countenance  still haunts the memory of all who knew him  another  whom i will  not name  has moved farther on pursuing the strange odyssey of  his decadence  his days of royal favour had departed even then  but he still retained in his narrower life at barbizon a certain  stamp of conscious importance hearty friendly filling the room  the occupant of several chairs nor had he yet ceased his losing  battle still labouring upon great canvases that none would buy  still waiting the return of fortune  but these days also were too  good to last and the former favourite of two sovereigns fled if i  heard the truth by night  there was a time when he was counted a  great man and millet but a dauber behold how the whirligig of  time brings in his revenges  to pity millet is a piece of  arrogance if life be hard for such resolute and pious spirits it  is harder still for us had we the wit to understand it but we may  pity his unhappier rival who for no apparent merit was raised to  opulence and momentary fame and through no apparent fault was  suffered step by step to sink again to nothing  no misfortune can  exceed the bitterness of such backforemost progress even bravely  supported as it was but to those also who were taken early from  the easel a regret is due  from all the young men of this period  one stood out by the vigour of his promise he was in the age of  fermentation enamoured of eccentricities  il faut faire de la  peinture nouvelle was his watchword but if time and experience  had continued his education if he had been granted health to  return from these excursions to the steady and the central i must  believe that the name of hills had become famous  sirons inn that excellent artists barrack was managed upon easy  principles  at any hour of the night when you returned from  wandering in the forest you went to the billiardroom and helped  yourself to liquors or descended to the cellar and returned laden  with beer or wine  the sirons were all locked in slumber there  was none to check your inroads only at the weeks end a  computation was made the gross sum was divided and a varying  share set down to every lodgers name under the rubric  estrats   upon the more longsuffering the larger tax was levied and your  bill lengthened in a direct proportion to the easiness of your  disposition  at any hour of the morning again you could get your  coffee or cold milk and set forth into the forest  the doves had  perhaps wakened you fluttering into your chamber and on the  threshold of the inn you were met by the aroma of the forest   close by were the great aisles the mossy boulders the  interminable field of forest shadow  there you were free to dream  and wander  and at noon and again at six oclock a good meal  awaited you on sirons table  the whole of your accommodation set  aside that varying item of the estrals cost you five francs a day  your bill was never offered you until you asked it and if you were  out of lucks way you might depart for where you pleased and leave  it pending   iv   theoretically the house was open to all corners practically it  was a kind of club  the guests protected themselves and in so  doing they protected siron  formal manners being laid aside  essential courtesy was the more rigidly exacted the new arrival  had to feel the pulse of the society and a breach of its undefined  observances was promptly punished  a man might be as plain as  dull as slovenly as free of speech as he desired but to a touch  of presumption or a word of hectoring these free barbizonians were  as sensitive as a teaparty of maiden ladies  i have seen people  driven forth from barbizon it would be difficult to say in words  what they had done but they deserved their fate  they had shown  themselves unworthy to enjoy these corporate freedoms they had  pushed themselves they had made their head they wanted tact to  appreciate the fine shades of barbizonian etiquette  and once  they were condemned the process of extrusion was ruthless in its  cruelty after one evening with the formidable bodmer the baily of  our commonwealth the erring stranger was beheld no more he rose  exceeding early the next day and the first coach conveyed him from  the scene of his discomfiture  these sentences of banishment were  never in my knowledge delivered against an artist such would i  believe have been illegal but the odd and pleasant fact is this  that they were never needed  painters sculptors writers  singers i have seen all of these in barbizon and some were sulky  and some blatant and inane but one and all entered at once into  the spirit of the association  this singular society is purely  french a creature of french virtues and possibly of french  defects  it cannot be imitated by the english  the roughness the  impatience the more obvious selfishness and even the more ardent  friendships of the anglosaxon speedily dismember such a  commonwealth  but this random gathering of young french painters  with neither apparatus nor parade of government yet kept the life  of the place upon a certain footing insensibly imposed their  etiquette upon the docile and by caustic speech enforced their  edicts against the unwelcome  to think of it is to wonder the more  at the strange failure of their race upon the larger theatre  this  inbred civility  to use the word in its completest meaning  this  natural and facile adjustment of contending liberties seems all  that is required to make a governable nation and a just and  prosperous country  our society thus purged and guarded was full of high spirits of  laughter and of the initiative of youth  the few elder men who  joined us were still young at heart and took the key from their  companions  we returned from long stations in the fortifying air  our blood renewed by the sunshine our spirits refreshed by the  silence of the forest the babel of loud voices sounded good we  fell to eat and play like the natural man and in the high inn  chamber panelled with indifferent pictures and lit by candles  guttering in the night air the talk and laughter sounded far into  the night  it was a good place and a good life for any naturally minded youth better yet for the student of painting and perhaps  best of all for the student of letters  he too was saturated in  this atmosphere of style he was shut out from the disturbing  currents of the world he might forget that there existed other and  more pressing interests than that of art  but in such a place it  was hardly possible to write he could not drug his conscience  like the painter by the production of listless studies he saw  himself idle among many who were apparently and some who were  really employed and what with the impulse of increasing health  and the continual provocation of romantic scenes he became  tormented with the desire to work  he enjoyed a strenuous idleness  full of visions hearty meals long sweltering walks mirth among  companions and still floating like music through his brain  foresights of great works that shakespeare might be proud to have  conceived headless epics glorious torsos of dramas and words  that were alive with import  so in youth like moses from the  mountain we have sights of that house beautiful of art which we  shall never enter  they are dreams and unsubstantial visions of  style that repose upon no base of human meaning the last heart throbs of that excited amateur who has to die in all of us before  the artist can be born  but they come to us in such a rainbow of  glory that all subsequent achievement appears dull and earthly in  comparison  we were all artists almost all in the age of  illusion cultivating an imaginary genius and walking to the  strains of some deceiving ariel small wonder indeed if we were  happy  but art of whatever nature is a kind mistress and though  these dreams of youth fall by their own baselessness others  succeed graver and more substantial the symptoms change the  amiable malady endures and still at an equal distance the house  beautiful shines upon its hilltop   v   gretz lies out of the forest down by the bright river  it boasts  a mill an ancient church a castle and a bridge of many  sterlings  and the bridge is a piece of public property  anonymously famous beaming on the incurious dilettante from the  walls of a hundred exhibitions  i have seen it in the salon i  have seen it in the academy i have seen it in the last french  exposition excellently done by bloomer in a blackandwhite by  mr a henley it once adorned this essay in the pages of the  magazine of art  longsuffering bridge  and if you visit gretz  tomorrow you shall find another generation camped at the bottom  of chevillons garden under their white umbrellas and doggedly  painting it again  the bridge taken for granted gretz is a less inspiring place than  barbizon  i give it the palm over cernay  there is something  ghastly in the great empty village square of cernay with the inn  tables standing in one corner as though the stage were set for  rustic opera and in the early morning all the painters breaking  their fast upon white wine under the windows of the villagers  it  is vastly different to awake in gretz to go down the green inn garden to find the river streaming through the bridge and to see  the dawn begin across the poplared level  the meals are laid in  the cool arbour under fluttering leaves  the splash of oars and  bathers the bathing costumes out to dry the trim canoes beside  the jetty tell of a society that has an eye to pleasure  there is  something to do at gretz  perhaps for that very reason i can  recall no such enduring ardours no such glories of exhilaration  as among the solemn groves and uneventful hours of barbizon  this  something to do is a great enemy to joy it is a way out of it  you wreak your high spirits on some cutanddry employment and  behold them gone  but gretz is a merry place after its kind   pretty to see merry to inhabit  the course of its pellucid river  whether up or down is full of gentle attractions for the  navigator  islanded reedmazes where in autumn the red berries  cluster the mirrored and inverted images of trees lilies and  mills and the foam and thunder of weirs  and of all noble sweeps  of roadway none is nobler on a windy dusk than the highroad to  nemours between its lines of talking poplar  but even gretz is changed  the old inn long shored and trussed  and buttressed fell at length under the mere weight of years and  the place as it was is but a fading image in the memory of former  guests  they indeed recall the ancient wooden stair they recall  the rainy evening the wide hearth the blaze of the twig fire and  the company that gathered round the pillar in the kitchen  but the  material fabric is now dust soon with the last of its  inhabitants its very memory shall follow and they in their turn  shall suffer the same law and both in name and lineament vanish  from the world of men  for remembrance of the old house sake  as pepys once quaintly put it let me tell one story  when the  tide of invasion swept over france two foreign painters were left  stranded and penniless in gretz and there until the war was over  the chevillons ungrudgingly harboured them  it was difficult to  obtain supplies but the two waifs were still welcome to the best  sat down daily with the family to table and at the due intervals  were supplied with clean napkins which they scrupled to employ   madame chevillon observed the fact and reprimanded them  but they  stood firm eat they must but having no money they would soil no  napkins   vi   nemours and moret for all they are so picturesque have been  little visited by painters  they are indeed too populous they  have manners of their own and might resist the drastic process of  colonisation  montigny has been somewhat strangely neglected i  never knew it inhabited but once when will h low installed  himself there with a barrel of piquette and entertained his  friends in a leafy trellis above the weir in sight of the green  country and to the music of the falling water  it was a most airy  quaint and pleasant place of residence just too rustic to be  stagey and from my memories of the place in general and that  garden trellis in particular  at morning visited by birds or at  night when the dew fell and the stars were of the party  i am  inclined to think perhaps too favourably of the future of montigny   chaillyenbiere has outlived all things and lies dustily  slumbering in the plain  the cemetery of itself  the great road  remains to testify of its former bustle of postilions and carriage  bells and like memorial tablets there still hang in the inn room  the paintings of a former generation dead or decorated long ago   in my time one man only greatly daring dwelt there  from time  to time he would walk over to barbizon like a shade revisiting the  glimpses of the moon and after some communication with flesh and  blood return to his austere hermitage  but even he when i last  revisited the forest had come to barbizon for good and closed the  roll of chaillyites  it may revive  but i much doubt it  acheres  and recloses still wait a pioneer bourron is out of the question  being merely gretz over again without the river the bridge or  the beauty and of all the possible places on the western side  marlotte alone remains to be discussed  i scarcely know marlotte  and very likely for that reason am not much in love with it  it  seems a glaring and unsightly hamlet  the inn of mother antonie is  unattractive and its more reputable rival though comfortable  enough is commonplace  marlotte has a name it is famous if i  were the young painter i would leave it alone in its glory   vii   these are the words of an old stager and though time is a good  conservative in forest places much may be untrue today  many of  us have passed arcadian days there and moved on but yet left a  portion of our souls behind us buried in the woods  i would not  dig for these reliquiae they are incommunicable treasures that  will not enrich the finder and yet there may lie interred below  great oaks or scattered along forest paths stores of youths  dynamite and dear remembrances  and as one generation passes on  and renovates the field of tillage for the next i entertain a  fancy that when the young men of today go forth into the forest  they shall find the air still vitalised by the spirits of their  predecessors and like those unheard melodies that are the  sweetest of all the memory of our laughter shall still haunt the  field of trees  those merry voices that in woods call the wanderer  farther those thrilling silences and whispers of the groves  surely in fontainebleau they must be vocal of me and my companions   we are not content to pass away entirely from the scenes of our  delight we would leave if but in gratitude a pillar and a  legend  one generation after another fall like honeybees upon this  memorable forest rifle its sweets pack themselves with vital  memories and when the theft is consummated depart again into life  richer but poorer also  the forest indeed they have possessed  from that day forward it is theirs indissolubly and they will  return to walk in it at night in the fondest of their dreams and  use it for ever in their books and pictures  yet when they made  their packets and put up their notes and sketches something it  should seem had been forgotten  a projection of themselves shall  appear to haunt unfriended these scenes of happiness a natural  child of fancy begotten and forgotten unawares  over the whole  field of our wanderings such fetches are still travelling like  indefatigable bagmen but the imps of fontainebleau as of all  beloved spots are very long of life and memory is piously  unwilling to forget their orphanage  if anywhere about that wood  you meet my airy bantling greet him with tenderness  he was a  pleasant lad though now abandoned  and when it comes to your own  turn to quit the forest may you leave behind you such another no  antony or werther let us hope no tearful whipster but as  becomes this not uncheerful and most active age in which we figure  the child of happy hours  no art it may be said was ever perfect and not many noble that  has not been mirthfully conceived  and no man it may be added was ever anything but a wet blanket  and a cross to his companions who boasted not a copious spirit of  enjoyment  whether as man or artist let the youth make haste to  fontainebleau and once there let him address himself to the spirit  of the place he will learn more from exercise than from studies  although both are necessary and if he can get into his heart the  gaiety and inspiration of the woods he will have gone far to undo  the evil of his sketches  a spirit once well strung up to the  concertpitch of the primeval outofdoors will hardly dare to  finish a study and magniloquently ticket it a picture  the  incommunicable thrill of things that is the tuningfork by which  we test the flatness of our art  here it is that nature teaches  and condemns and still spurs up to further effort and new failure   thus it is that she sets us blushing at our ignorant and tepid  works and the more we find of these inspiring shocks the less  shall we be apt to love the literal in our productions  in all  sciences and senses the letter kills and today when cackling  human geese express their ignorant condemnation of all studio  pictures it is a lesson most useful to be learnt  let the young  painter go to fontainebleau and while he stupefies himself with  studies that teach him the mechanical side of his trade let him  walk in the great air and be a servant of mirth and not pick and  botanise but wait upon the moods of nature  so he will learn  or  learn not to forget  the poetry of life and earth which when he  has acquired his track will save him from joyless reproduction  1882    chapter iv  epilogue to an inland voyage    the country where they journeyed that green breezy valley of the  loing is one very attractive to cheerful and solitary people  the  weather was superb all night it thundered and lightened and the  rain fell in sheets by day the heavens were cloudless the sun  fervent the air vigorous and pure  they walked separate  the  cigarette plodding behind with some philosophy the lean arethusa  posting on ahead  thus each enjoyed his own reflections by the  way each had perhaps time to tire of them before he met his  comrade at the designated inn and the pleasures of society and  solitude combined to fill the day  the arethusa carried in his  knapsack the works of charles of orleans and employed some of the  hours of travel in the concoction of english roundels  in this  path he must thus have preceded mr lang mr dobson mr henley  and all contemporary roundeleers but for good reasons he will be  the last to publish the result  the cigarette walked burthened  with a volume of michelet  and both these books it will be seen  played a part in the subsequent adventure  the arethusa was unwisely dressed  he is no precisian in attire  but by all accounts he was never so illinspired as on that tramp  having set forth indeed upon a moments notice from the most  unfashionable spot in europe barbizon  on his head he wore a  smokingcap of indian work the gold lace pitifully frayed and  tarnished  a flannel shirt of an agreeable dark hue which the  satirical called black a light tweed coat made by a good english  tailor readymade cheap linen trousers and leathern gaiters  completed his array  in person he is exceptionally lean and his  face is not like those of happier mortals a certificate  for  years he could not pass a frontier or visit a bank without  suspicion the police everywhere but in his native city looked  askance upon him and though i am sure it will not be credited he  is actually denied admittance to the casino of monte carlo  if you  will imagine him dressed as above stooping under his knapsack  walking nearly five miles an hour with the folds of the readymade  trousers fluttering about his spindle shanks and still looking  eagerly round him as if in terror of pursuit  the figure when  realised is far from reassuring  when villon journeyed perhaps  by the same pleasant valley to his exile at roussillon i wonder  if he had not something of the same appearance  something of the  same preoccupation he had beyond a doubt for he too must have  tinkered verses as he walked with more success than his successor   and if he had anything like the same inspiring weather the same  nights of uproar men in armour rolling and resounding down the  stairs of heaven the rain hissing on the village streets the wild  bullseye of the storm flashing all night long into the bare inn chamber  the same sweet return of day the same unfathomable blue  of noon the same highcoloured halcyon eves  and above all if  he had anything like as good a comrade anything like as keen a  relish for what he saw and what he ate and the rivers that he  bathed in and the rubbish that he wrote i would exchange estates  today with the poor exile and count myself a gainer  but there was another point of similarity between the two journeys  for which the arethusa was to pay dear  both were gone upon in  days of incomplete security  it was not long after the franco prussian war  swiftly as men forget that countryside was still  alive with tales of uhlans and outlying sentries and hairbreadth  scapes from the ignominious cord and pleasant momentary  friendships between invader and invaded  a year at the most two  years later you might have tramped all that country over and not  heard one anecdote  and a year or two later you would  if you  were a rather illlooking young man in nondescript array  have  gone your rounds in greater safety for along with more interesting  matter the prussian spy would have somewhat faded from mens  imaginations  for all that our voyager had got beyond chateau renard before he  was conscious of arousing wonder  on the road between that place  and chatillonsurloing however he encountered a rural postman  they fell together in talk and spoke of a variety of subjects but  through one and all the postman was still visibly preoccupied and  his eyes were faithful to the arethusas knapsack  at last with  mysterious roguishness he inquired what it contained and on being  answered shook his head with kindly incredulity  non said he  non vous avez des portraits  and then with a languishing  appeal voyons show me the portraits  it was some little while  before the arethusa with a shout of laughter recognised his  drift  by portraits he meant indecent photographs and in the  arethusa an austere and rising author he thought to have  identified a pornographic colporteur  when countryfolk in france  have made up their minds as to a persons calling argument is  fruitless  along all the rest of the way the postman piped and  fluted meltingly to get a sight of the collection now he would  upbraid now he would reason  voyons i will tell nobody then  he tried corruption and insisted on paying for a glass of wine  and at last when their ways separated  non said he ce nest  pas bien de votre part  o non ce nest pas bien  and shaking  his head with quite a sentimental sense of injury he departed  unrefreshed  on certain little difficulties encountered by the arethusa at  chatillonsurloing i have not space to dwell another chatillon  of grislier memory looms too near at hand  but the next day in a  certain hamlet called la jussiere he stopped to drink a glass of  syrup in a very poor bare drinking shop  the hostess a comely  woman suckling a child examined the traveller with kindly and  pitying eyes  you are not of this department she asked  the  arethusa told her he was english  ah she said surprised  we  have no english  we have many italians however and they do very  well they do not complain of the people of hereabouts  an  englishman may do very well also it will be something new  here  was a dark saying over which the arethusa pondered as he drank his  grenadine but when he rose and asked what was to pay the light  came upon him in a flash  o pour vous replied the landlady   a halfpenny  pour vous  by heaven she took him for a beggar   he paid his halfpenny feeling that it were ungracious to correct  her  but when he was forth again upon the road he became vexed in  spirit  the conscience is no gentleman he is a rabbinical fellow  and his conscience told him he had stolen the syrup  that night the travellers slept in gien the next day they passed  the river and set forth severally as their custom was on a short  stage through the green plain upon the berry side to chatillon surloire  it was the first day of the shooting and the air rang  with the report of firearms and the admiring cries of sportsmen   overhead the birds were in consternation wheeling in clouds  settling and rearising  and yet with all this bustle on either  hand the road itself lay solitary  the arethusa smoked a pipe  beside a milestone and i remember he laid down very exactly all he  was to do at chatillon  how he was to enjoy a cold plunge to  change his shirt and to await the cigarettes arrival in sublime  inaction by the margin of the loire  fired by these ideas he  pushed the more rapidly forward and came early in the afternoon  and in a breathing heat to the enteringin of that illfated town   childe roland to the dark tower came  a polite gendarme threw his shadow on the path  monsieur est voyageur he asked  and the arethusa strong in his innocence forgetful of his vile  attire replied  i had almost said with gaiety  so it would  appear   his papers are in order said the gendarme  and when the  arethusa with a slight change of voice admitted he had none he  was informed politely enough that he must appear before the  commissary  the commissary sat at a table in his bedroom stripped to the shirt  and trousers but still copiously perspiring and when he turned  upon the prisoner a large meaningless countenance that was like  bardolphs all whelks and bubuckles the dullest might have been  prepared for grief  here was a stupid man sleepy with the heat  and fretful at the interruption whom neither appeal nor argument  could reach  the commissary  you have no papers  the arethusa  not here  the commissary  why  the arethusa  i have left them behind in my valise  the commissary  you know however that it is forbidden to  circulate without papers  the arethusa  pardon me  i am convinced of the contrary  i am  here on my rights as an english subject by international treaty  the commissary with scorn  you call yourself an englishman  the arethusa  i do  the commissary  humph  what is your trade  the arethusa  i am a scotch advocate  the commissary with singular annoyance  a scotch advocate  do  you then pretend to support yourself by that in this department  the arethusa modestly disclaimed the pretension  the commissary  had scored a point  the commissary  why then do you travel  the arethusa  i travel for pleasure  the commissary pointing to the knapsack and with sublime  incredulity  avec ca  voyezvous je suis un homme intelligent   with that  look here i am a person of intelligence  the culprit remaining silent under this home thrust the commissary  relished his triumph for a while and then demanded like the  postman but with what different expectations to see the contents  of the knapsack  and here the arethusa not yet sufficiently awake  to his position fell into a grave mistake  there was little or no  furniture in the room except the commissarys chair and table and  to facilitate matters the arethusa with all the innocence on  earth leant the knapsack on a corner of the bed  the commissary  fairly bounded from his seat his face and neck flushed past  purple almost into blue and he screamed to lay the desecrating  object on the floor  the knapsack proved to contain a change of shirts of shoes of  socks and of linen trousers a small dressingcase a piece of  soap in one of the shoes two volumes of the collection jannet  lettered poesies de charles dorleans a map and a version book  containing divers notes in prose and the remarkable english  roundels of the voyager still to this day unpublished  the  commissary of chatillon is the only living man who has clapped an  eye on these artistic trifles  he turned the assortment over with  a contumelious finger it was plain from his daintiness that he  regarded the arethusa and all his belongings as the very temple of  infection  still there was nothing suspicious about the map  nothing really criminal except the roundels as for charles of  orleans to the ignorant mind of the prisoner he seemed as good as  a certificate and it was supposed the farce was nearly over  the inquisitor resumed his seat  the commissary after a pause  eh bien je vais vous dire ce que  vous etes  vous etes allemand et vous venez chanter a la foire   well then i will tell you what you are  you are a german and  have come to sing at the fair  the arethusa  would you like to hear me sing  i believe i could  convince you of the contrary  the commissary  pas de plaisanterie monsieur  the arethusa  well sir oblige me at least by looking at this  book  here i open it with my eyes shut  read one of these songs   read this one  and tell me you who are a man of intelligence  if it would be possible to sing it at a fair  the commissary critically  mais oui  tres bien  the arethusa  comment monsieur  what  but do you not observe it  is antique  it is difficult to understand even for you and me  but for the audience at a fair it would be meaningless  the commissary taking a pen  enfin il faui en finir  what is  your name  the arethusa speaking with the swallowing vivacity of the  english  robertlouisstevnsn  the commissary aghast  he  quoi  the arethusa perceiving and improving his advantage  robrt lousstevnsn  the commissary after several conflicts with his pen  eh bien il  faut se passer du nom  ca ne secrit pas  well we must do  without the name  it is unspellable  the above is a rough summary of this momentous conversation in  which i have been chiefly careful to preserve the plums of the  commissary but the remainder of the scene perhaps because of his  rising anger has left but little definite in the memory of the  arethusa  the commissary was not i think a practised literary  man no sooner at least had he taken pen in hand and embarked on  the composition of the procesverbal than he became distinctly  more uncivil and began to show a predilection for that simplest of  all forms of repartee  you lie  several times the arethusa let  it pass and then suddenly flared up refused to accept more  insults or to answer further questions defied the commissary to do  his worst and promised him if he did that he should bitterly  repent it  perhaps if he had worn this proud front from the first  instead of beginning with a sense of entertainment and then going  on to argue the thing might have turned otherwise for even at  this eleventh hour the commissary was visibly staggered  but it  was too late he had been challenged the procesverbal was begun  and he again squared his elbows over his writing and the arethusa  was led forth a prisoner  a step or two down the hot road stood the gendarmerie  thither was  our unfortunate conducted and there he was bidden to empty forth  the contents of his pockets  a handkerchief a pen a pencil a  pipe and tobacco matches and some ten francs of change  that was  all  not a file not a cipher not a scrap of writing whether to  identify or to condemn  the very gendarme was appalled before such  destitution  i regret he said that i arrested you for i see that you are  no voyou  and he promised him every indulgence  the arethusa thus encouraged asked for his pipe  that he was  told was impossible but if he chewed he might have some tobacco   he did not chew however and asked instead to have his  handkerchief  non said the gendarme  nous avons eu des histoires de gens qui  se sont pendus  no we have had histories of people who hanged  themselves  what cried the arethusa  and is it for that you refuse me my  handkerchief  but see how much more easily i could hang myself in  my trousers  the man was struck by the novelty of the idea but he stuck to his  colours and only continued to repeat vague offers of service  at least said the arethusa be sure that you arrest my comrade  he will follow me ere long on the same road and you can tell him  by the sack upon his shoulders  this promised the prisoner was led round into the back court of  the building a cellar door was opened he was motioned down the  stair and bolts grated and chains clanged behind his descending  person  the philosophic and still more the imaginative mind is apt to  suppose itself prepared for any mortal accident  prison among  other ills was one that had been often faced by the undaunted  arethusa  even as he went down the stairs he was telling himself  that here was a famous occasion for a roundel and that like the  committed linnets of the tuneful cavalier he too would make his  prison musical  i will tell the truth at once  the roundel was  never written or it should be printed in this place to raise a  smile  two reasons interfered  the first moral the second  physical  it is one of the curiosities of human nature that although all men  are liars they can none of them bear to be told so of themselves   to get and take the lie with equanimity is a stretch beyond the  stoic and the arethusa who had been surfeited upon that insult  was blazing inwardly with a white heat of smothered wrath  but the  physical had also its part  the cellar in which he was confined  was some feet underground and it was only lighted by an unglazed  narrow aperture high up in the wall and smothered in the leaves of  a green vine  the walls were of naked masonry the floor of bare  earth by way of furniture there was an earthenware basin a water jug and a wooden bedstead with a bluegray cloak for bedding  to  be taken from the hot air of a summers afternoon the  reverberation of the road and the stir of rapid exercise and  plunged into the gloom and damp of this receptacle for vagabonds  struck an instant chill upon the arethusas blood  now see in how  small a matter a hardship may consist  the floor was exceedingly  uneven underfoot with the very spademarks i suppose of the  labourers who dug the foundations of the barrack and what with the  poor twilight and the irregular surface walking was impossible   the caged author resisted for a good while but the chill of the  place struck deeper and deeper and at length with such reluctance  as you may fancy he was driven to climb upon the bed and wrap  himself in the public covering  there then he lay upon the verge  of shivering plunged in semidarkness wound in a garment whose  touch he dreaded like the plague and in a spirit far removed from  resignation telling the roll of the insults he had just received   these are not circumstances favourable to the muse  meantime to look at the upper surface where the sun was still  shining and the guns of sportsmen were still noisy through the  tufted plain the cigarette was drawing near at his more  philosophic pace  in those days of liberty and health he was the  constant partner of the arethusa and had ample opportunity to  share in that gentlemans disfavour with the police  many a bitter  bowl had he partaken of with that disastrous comrade  he was  himself a man born to float easily through life his face and  manner artfully recommending him to all  there was but one  suspicious circumstance he could not carry off and that was his  companion  he will not readily forget the commissary in what is  ironically called the free town of frankfortonthemain  nor the  francobelgian frontier nor the inn at la fere last but not  least he is pretty certain to remember chatillonsurloire  at the town entry the gendarme culled him like a wayside flower  and a moment later two persons in a high state of surprise were  confronted in the commissarys office  for if the cigarette was  surprised to be arrested the commissary was no less taken aback by  the appearance and appointments of his captive  here was a man  about whom there could be no mistake  a man of an unquestionable  and unassailable manner in applepie order dressed not with  neatness merely but elegance ready with his passport at a word  and well supplied with money  a man the commissary would have  doffed his hat to on chance upon the highway and this beau  cavalier unblushingly claimed the arethusa for his comrade  the  conclusion of the interview was foregone of its humours i  remember only one  baronet demanded the magistrate glancing up  from the passport  alors monsieur vous etes le firs dun  baron  and when the cigarette his one mistake throughout the  interview denied the soft impeachment alors from the  commissary ce nest pas votre passeport  but these were  ineffectual thunders he never dreamed of laying hands upon the  cigarette presently he fell into a mood of unrestrained  admiration gloating over the contents of the knapsack commanding  our friends tailor  ah what an honoured guest was the commissary  entertaining what suitable clothes he wore for the warm weather  what beautiful maps what an attractive work of history he carried  in his knapsack  you are to understand there was now but one point  of difference between them  what was to be done with the arethusa  the cigarette demanding his release the commissary still claiming  him as the dungeons own  now it chanced that the cigarette had  passed some years of his life in egypt where he had made  acquaintance with two very bad things cholera morbus and pashas  and in the eye of the commissary as he fingered the volume of  michelet it seemed to our traveller there was something turkish   i pass over this lightly it is highly possible there was some  misunderstanding highly possible that the commissary charmed with  his visitor supposed the attraction to be mutual and took for an  act of growing friendship what the cigarette himself regarded as a  bribe  and at any rate was there ever a bribe more singular than  an odd volume of michelets history  the work was promised him for  the morrow before our departure and presently after either  because he had his price or to show that he was not the man to be  behind in friendly offices  eh bien he said je suppose quil  faut laher voire camarade  and he tore up that feast of humour  the unfinished procesverbal  ah if he had only torn up instead  the arethusas roundels  there were many works burnt at  alexandria there are many treasured in the british museum that i  could better spare than the procesverbal of chatillon  poor  bubuckled commissary  i begin to be sorry that he never had his  michelet  perceiving in him fine human traits a broadbased  stupidity a gusto in his magisterial functions a taste for  letters a ready admiration for the admirable  and if he did not  admire the arethusa he was not alone in that  to the imprisoned one shivering under the public covering there  came suddenly a noise of bolts and chains  he sprang to his feet  ready to welcome a companion in calamity and instead of that the  door was flung wide the friendly gendarme appeared above in the  strong daylight and with a magnificent gesture being probably a  student of the drama  vous etes libre he said  none too soon  for the arethusa  i doubt if he had been halfanhour imprisoned  but by the watch in a mans brain which was the only watch he  carried he should have been eight times longer and he passed  forth with ecstasy up the cellar stairs into the healing warmth of  the afternoon sun and the breath of the earth came as sweet as a  cows into his nostril and he heard again and could have laughed  for pleasure the concord of delicate noises that we call the hum  of life  and here it might be thought that my history ended but not so  this was an actdrop and not the curtain  upon what followed in  front of the barrack since there was a lady in the case i scruple  to expatiate  the wife of the marechaldeslogis was a handsome  woman and yet the arethusa was not sorry to be gone from her  society  something of her image cool as a peach on that hot  afternoon still lingers in his memory  yet more of her  conversation  you have there a very fine parlour said the poor  gentleman  ah said madame la marechale deslogis you are  very well acquainted with such parlours  and you should have seen  with what a hard and scornful eye she measured the vagabond before  her  i do not think he ever hated the commissary but before that  interview was at an end he hated madame la marechale  his passion  as i am led to understand by one who was present stood confessed  in a burning eye a pale cheek and a trembling utterance madame  meanwhile tasting the joys of the matador goading him with barbed  words and staring him coldly down  it was certainly good to be away from this lady and better still  to sit down to an excellent dinner in the inn  here too the  despised travellers scraped acquaintance with their next neighbour  a gentleman of these parts returned from the days sport who had  the good taste to find pleasure in their society  the dinner at an  end the gentleman proposed the acquaintance should be ripened in  the cafe  the cafe was crowded with sportsmen conclamantly explaining to each  other and the world the smallness of their bags  about the centre  of the room the cigarette and the arethusa sat with their new  acquaintance a trio very well pleased for the travellers after  their late experience were greedy of consideration and their  sportsman rejoiced in a pair of patient listeners  suddenly the  glass door flew open with a crash the marechaldeslogis appeared  in the interval gorgeously belted and befrogged entered without  salutation strode up the room with a clang of spurs and weapons  and disappeared through a door at the far end  close at his heels  followed the arethusas gendarme of the afternoon imitating with  a nice shade of difference the imperial bearing of his chief  only as he passed he struck lightly with his open hand on the  shoulder of his late captive and with that ringing dramatic  utterance of which he had the secret  suivez said he  the arrest of the members the oath of the tennis court the  signing of the declaration of independence mark antonys oration  all the brave scenes of history i conceive as having been not  unlike that evening in the cafe at chatillon  terror breathed upon  the assembly  a moment later when the arethusa had followed his  recaptors into the farther part of the house the cigarette found  himself alone with his coffee in a ring of empty chairs and tables  all the lusty sportsmen huddled into corners all their clamorous  voices hushed in whispering all their eyes shooting at him  furtively as at a leper  and the arethusa  well he had a long sometimes a trying  interview in the back kitchen  the marechaldeslogis who was a  very handsome man and i believe both intelligent and honest had  no clear opinion on the case  he thought the commissary had done  wrong but he did not wish to get his subordinates into trouble  and he proposed this that and the other to all of which the  arethusa with a growing sense of his position demurred  in short suggested the arethusa you want to wash your hands of  further responsibility  well then let me go to paris  the marechaldeslogis looked at his watch  you may leave said he by the ten oclock train for paris  and at noon the next day the travellers were telling their  misadventure in the diningroom at sirons    chapter v  random memories    i  the coast of fife   many writers have vigorously described the pains of the first day  or the first night at school to a boy of any enterprise i  believe they are more often agreeably exciting  misery  or at  least misery unrelieved  is confined to another period to the  days of suspense and the dreadful lookingfor of departure when  the old life is running to an end and the new life with its new  interests not yet begun  and to the pain of an imminent parting  there is added the unrest of a state of conscious preexistence   the area railings the beloved shopwindow the smell of semi suburban tanpits the song of the church bells upon a sunday the  thin high voices of compatriot children in a playingfield  what  a sudden what an overpowering pathos breathes to him from each  familiar circumstance  the assaults of sorrow come not from  within as it seems to him but from without  i was proud and glad  to go to school had i been let alone i could have borne up like  any hero but there was around me in all my native town a  conspiracy of lamentation  poor little boy he is going away   unkind little boy he is going to leave us so the unspoken  burthen followed me as i went with yearning and reproach  and at  length one melancholy afternoon in the early autumn and at a  place where it seems to me looking back it must be always autumn  and generally sunday there came suddenly upon the face of all i  saw  the long empty road the lines of the tall houses the church  upon the hill the woody hillside garden  a look of such a  piercing sadness that my heart died and seating myself on a door step i shed tears of miserable sympathy  a benevolent cat  cumbered me the while with consolations  we two were alone in all  that was visible of the london road  two poor waifs who had each  tasted sorrow  and she fawned upon the weeper and gambolled for  his entertainment watching the effect it seemed with motherly  eyes  for the sake of the cat god bless her  i confessed at home the  story of my weakness and so it comes about that i owed a certain  journey and the reader owes the present paper to a cat in the  london road  it was judged if i had thus brimmed over on the  public highway some change of scene was in the medical sense  indicated my father at the time was visiting the harbour lights of  scotland and it was decided he should take me along with him  around a portion of the shores of fife my first professional tour  my first journey in the complete character of man without the help  of petticoats  the kingdom of fife that royal province may be observed by the  curious on the map occupying a tongue of land between the firths  of forth and tay  it may be continually seen from many parts of  edinburgh among the rest from the windows of my fathers house  dying away into the distance and the easterly haar with one smoky  seaside town beyond another or in winter printing on the gray  heaven some glittering hilltops  it has no beauty to recommend  it being a low seasalted windvexed promontory trees very  rare except as common on the east coast along the dens of  rivers the fields well cultivated i understand but not lovely to  the eye  it is of the coast i speak  the interior may be the  garden of eden  history broods over that part of the world like  the easterly haar  even on the map its long row of gaelic place names bear testimony to an old and settled race  of these little  towns posted along the shore as close as sedges each with its bit  of harbour its old weatherbeaten church or public building its  flavour of decayed prosperity and decaying fish not one but has  its legend quaint or tragic  dunfermline in whose royal towers  the king may be still observed in the ballad drinking the blood red wine somnolent inverkeithing once

in the  telegraph office was perhaps already fingering his last despatch  and just a little beyond leven largo law and the smoke of largo  town mounting about its feet the town of alexander selkirk better  known under the name of robinson crusoe  so on the list might be  pursued only for private reasons which the reader will shortly  have an opportunity to guess by st monance and pittenweem and  the two anstruthers and cellardyke and crail where primate  sharpe was once a humble and innocent country minister  on to the  heel of the land to fife ness overlooked by a seawood of matted  elders and the quaint old mansion of balcomie itself overlooking  but the breach or the quiescence of the deep  the carr rock beacon  rising close in front and as night draws in the star of the  inchcape reef springing up on the one hand and the star of the may  island on the other and farther off yet a third and a greater on  the craggy foreland of st abbs  and but a little way round the  corner of the land imminent itself above the sea stands the gem  of the province and the light of mediaeval scotland st andrews  where the great cardinal beaton held garrison against the world  and the second of the name and title perished as you may read in  knoxs jeering narrative under the knives of trueblue  protestants and to this day after so many centuries the current  voice of the professor is not hushed  here it was that my first tour of inspection began early on a  bleak easterly morning  there was a crashing run of sea upon the  shore i recollect and my father and the man of the harbour light  must sometimes raise their voices to be audible  perhaps it is  from this circumstance that i always imagine st andrews to be an  ineffectual seat of learning and the sound of the east wind and  the bursting surf to linger in its drowsy classrooms and confound  the utterance of the professor until teacher and taught are alike  drowned in oblivion and only the seagull beats on the windows and  the draught of the seaair rustles in the pages of the open  lecture  but upon all this and the romance of st andrews in  general the reader must consult the works of mr andrew lang who  has written of it but the other day in his dainty prose and with  his incommunicable humour and long ago in one of his best poems  with grace and local truth and a note of unaffected pathos  mr  lang knows all about the romance i say and the educational  advantages but i doubt if he had turned his attention to the  harbour lights and it may be news even to him that in the year  1863 their case was pitiable  hanging about with the east wind  humming in my teeth and my hands i make no doubt in my pockets  i looked for the first time upon that tragicomedy of the visiting  engineer which i have seen so often reenacted on a more important  stage  eighty years ago i find my grandfather writing  it is  the most painful thing that can occur to me to have a  correspondence of this kind with any of the keepers and when i  come to the light house instead of having the satisfaction to meet  them with approbation and welcome their family it is distressing  when oneis obliged to put on a most angry countenance and  demeanour  this painful obligation has been hereditary in my  race  i have myself on a perfectly amateur and unauthorised  inspection of turnberry point bent my brows upon the keeper on the  question of stormpanes and felt a keen pang of selfreproach  when we went down stairs again and i found he was making a coffin  for his infant child and then regained my equanimity with the  thought that i had done the man a service and when the proper  inspector came he would be readier with his panes  the human race  is perhaps credited with more duplicity than it deserves  the  visitation of a lighthouse at least is a business of the most  transparent nature  as soon as the boat grates on the shore and  the keepers step forward in their uniformed coats the very slouch  of the fellows shoulders tells their story and the engineer may  begin at once to assume his angry countenance  certainly the  brass of the handrail will be clouded and if the brass be not  immaculate certainly all will be to match  the reflectors  scratched the spare lamp unready the stormpanes in the  storehouse  if a light is not rather more than middling good it  will be radically bad  mediocrity except in literature appears  to be unattainable by man  but of course the unfortunate of st  andrews was only an amateur he was not in the service he had no  uniform coat he was i believe a plumber by his trade and stood  in the mediaeval phrase quite out of the danger of my father but  he had a painful interview for all that and perspired extremely  from st andrews we drove over magus muir  my father had  announced we were to post and the phrase called up in my hopeful  mind visions of topboots and the pictures in rowlandsons dance of  death but it was only a jingling cab that came to the inn door  such as i had driven in a thousand times at the low price of one  shilling on the streets of edinburgh  beyond this disappointment  i remember nothing of that drive  it is a road i have often  travelled and of not one of these journeys do i remember any  single trait  the fact has not been suffered to encroach on the  truth of the imagination  i still see magus muir two hundred years  ago a desert place quite uninclosed in the midst the primates  carriage fleeing at the gallop the assassins loosereined in  pursuit burley balfour pistol in hand among the first  no scene  of history has ever written itself so deeply on my mind not  because balfour that questionable zealot was an ancestral cousin  of my own not because of the pleadings of the victim and his  daughter not even because of the live bumbee that flew out of  sharpes baccobox thus clearly indicating his complicity with  satan nor merely because as it was after all a crime of a fine  religious flavour it figured in sunday books and afforded a  grateful relief from ministering children or the memoirs of mrs  kathatine winslowe  the figure that always fixed my attention is  that of hackston of rathillet sitting in the saddle with his cloak  about his mouth and through all that long bungling vociferous  hurlyburly revolving privately a case of conscience  he would  take no hand in the deed because he had a private spite against  the victim and that action must be sullied with no suggestion of  a worldly motive on the other hand that action in itself was  highly justified he had cast in his lot with the actors and he  must stay there inactive but publicly sharing the responsibility   you are a gentleman  you will protect me cried the wounded old  man crawling towards him  i will never lay a hand on you said  hackston and put his cloak about his mouth  it is an old  temptation with me to pluck away that cloak and see the face  to  open that bosom and to read the heart  with incomplete romances  about hackston the drawers of my youth were lumbered  i read him  up in every printed book that i could lay my hands on  i even dug  among the wodrow manuscripts sitting shamefaced in the very room  where my hero had been tortured two centuries before and keenly  conscious of my youth in the midst of other and as i fondly  thought more gifted students  all was vain  that he had passed a  riotous nonage that he was a zealot that he twice displayed  compared with his grotesque companions some tincture of soldierly  resolution and even of military common sense and that he figured  memorably in the scene on magus muir so much and no more could i  make out  but whenever i cast my eyes backward it is to see him  like a landmark on the plains of history sitting with his cloak  about his mouth inscrutable  how small a thing creates an  immortality  i do not think he can have been a man entirely  commonplace but had he not thrown his cloak about his mouth or  had the witnesses forgot to chronicle the action he would not thus  have haunted the imagination of my boyhood and today he would  scarce delay me for a paragraph  an incident at once romantic and  dramatic which at once awakes the judgment and makes a picture for  the eye how little do we realise its perdurable power  perhaps no  one does so but the author just as none but he appreciates the  influence of jingling words so that he looks on upon life with  something of a covert smile seeing people led by what they fancy  to be thoughts and what are really the accustomed artifices of his  own trade or roused by what they take to be principles and are  really picturesque effects  in a pleasant book about a school class club colonel fergusson has recently told a little anecdote   a philosophical society was formed by some academy boys  among  them colonel fergusson himself fleeming jenkin and andrew  wilson the christian buddhist and author of the abode of snow   before these learned pundits one member laid the following  ingenious problem  what would be the result of putting a pound of  potassium in a pot of porter  i should think there would be a  number of interesting biproducts said a smatterer at my elbow  but for me the tale itself has a biproduct and stands as a type  of much that is most human  for this inquirer who conceived  himself to burn with a zeal entirely chemical was really immersed  in a design of a quite different nature unconsciously to his own  recently breeched intelligence he was engaged in literature   putting pound potassium pot porter initial p mediant t  that  was his idea poor little boy  so with politics and that which  excites men in the present so with history and that which rouses  them in the past  there lie at the root of what appears most  serious unsuspected elements  the triple town of anstruther wester anstruther easter and  cellardyke all three royal burghs  or two royal burghs and a less  distinguished suburb i forget which  lies continuously along the  seaside and boasts of either two or three separate parish  churches and either two or three separate harbours  these  ambiguities are painful but the fact is although it argue me  uncultured i am but poorly posted upon cellardyke  my business  lay in the two anstruthers  a tricklet of a stream divides them  spanned by a bridge and over the bridge at the time of my  knowledge the celebrated shell house stood outpost on the west   this had been the residence of an agreeable eccentric during his  fond tenancy he had illustrated the outer walls as high if i  remember rightly as the roof with elaborate patterns and  pictures and snatches of verse in the vein of exegi monumentum  shells and pebbles artfully contrasted and conjoined had been his  medium and i like to think of him standing back upon the bridge  when all was finished drinking in the general effect and like  gibbon already lamenting his employment  the same bridge saw another sight in the seventeenth century  mr  thomson the curat of anstruther easter was a man highly  obnoxious to the devout  in the first place because he was a  curat in the second place because he was a person of irregular  and scandalous life and in the third place because he was  generally suspected of dealings with the enemy of man  these three  disqualifications in the popular literature of the time go hand  in hand but the end of mr thomson was a thing quite by itself  and in the proper phrase a manifest judgment  he had been at a  friends house in anstruther wester where and elsewhere i  suspect he had partaken of the bottle indeed to put the thing in  our cold modern way the reverend gentleman was on the brink of  delirium tremens  it was a dark night it seems a little lassie  came carrying a lantern to fetch the curate home and away they  went down the street of anstruther wester the lantern swinging a  bit in the childs hand the barred lustre tossing up and down  along the front of slumbering houses and mr thomson not  altogether steady on his legs nor to all appearance easy in his  mind  the pair had reached the middle of the bridge when as i  conceive the scene the poor tippler started in some baseless fear  and looked behind him the child already shaken by the ministers  strange behaviour started also in so doing she would jerk the  lantern and for the space of a moment the lights and the shadows  would be all confounded  then it was that to the unhinged toper  and the twittering child a huge bulk of blackness seemed to sweep  down to pass them close by as they stood upon the bridge and to  vanish on the farther side in the general darkness of the night   plainly the devil come for mr thomson thought the child  what  mr thomson thought himself we have no ground of knowledge but he  fell upon his knees in the midst of the bridge like a man praying   on the rest of the journey to the manse history is silent but  when they came to the door the poor caitiff taking the lantern  from the child looked upon her with so lost a countenance that her  little courage died within her and she fled home screaming to her  parents  not a soul would venture out all that night the  minister dwelt alone with his terrors in the manse and when the  day dawned and men made bold to go about the streets they found  the devil had come indeed for mr thomson  this manse of anstruther easter has another and a more cheerful  association  it was early in the morning about a century before  the days of mr thomson that his predecessor was called out of bed  to welcome a grandee of spain the duke of medina sidonia just  landed in the harbour underneath  but sure there was never seen a  more decayed grandee sure there was never a duke welcomed from a  stranger place of exile  halfway between orkney and shetland  there lies a certain isle on the one hand the atlantic on the  other the north sea bombard its pillared cliffs soreeyed short living inbred fishers and their families herd in its few huts in  the graveyard pieces of wreckwood stand for monuments there is  nowhere a more inhospitable spot  belleisleenmer  fairisle atsea  that is a name that has always rung in my minds ear like  music but the only fair isle on which i ever set my foot was  this unhomely rugged turrettop of submarine sierras  here when  his ship was broken my lord duke joyfully got ashore here for  long months he and certain of his men were harboured and it was  from this durance that he landed at last to be welcomed as well as  such a papist deserved no doubt by the godly incumbent of  anstruther easter and after the fair isle what a fine city must  that have appeared and after the island diet what a hospitable  spot the ministers table  and yet he must have lived on friendly  terms with his outlandish hosts  for to this day there still  survives a relic of the long winter evenings when the sailors of  the great armada crouched about the hearths of the fairislanders  the planks of their own lost galleon perhaps lighting up the scene  and the gale and the surf that beat about the coast contributing  their melancholy voices  all the folk of the north isles are great  artificers of knitting  the fairislanders alone dye their fabrics  in the spanish manner  to this day gloves and nightcaps  innocently decorated may be seen for sale in the shetland  warehouse at edinburgh or on the fair isle itself in the  catechists house and to this day they tell the story of the duke  of medina sidonias adventure  it would seem as if the fair isle had some attraction for persons  of quality  when i landed there myself an elderly gentleman  unshaved poorly attired his shoulders wrapped in a plaid was  seen walking to and fro with a book in his hand upon the beach   he paid no heed to our arrival which we thought a strange thing in  itself but when one of the officers of the pharos passing  narrowly by him observed his book to be a greek testament our  wonder and interest took a higher flight  the catechist was cross examined he said the gentleman had been put across some time  before in mr bruce of sumburghs schooner the only link between  the fair isle and the rest of the world and that he held services  and was doing good  so much came glibly enough but when pressed  a little farther the catechist displayed embarrassment  a  singular diffidence appeared upon his face  they tell me said  he in low tones that hes a lord  and a lord he was a peer of  the realm pacing that inhospitable beach with his greek testament  and his plaid about his shoulders set upon doing good as he  understood it worthy man  and his grandson a goodlooking little  boy much better dressed than the lordly evangelist and speaking  with a silken english accent very foreign to the scene accompanied  me for a while in my exploration of the island  i suppose this  little fellow is now my lord and wonder how much he remembers of  the fair isle  perhaps not much for he seemed to accept very  quietly his savage situation and under such guidance it is like  that this was not his first nor yet his last adventure    chapter vi  random memories    ii  the education of an engineer   anstruther is a place sacred to the muse she inspired really to a  considerable extent tennants vernacular poem anster fair and i  have there waited upon her myself with much devotion  this was  when i came as a young man to glean engineering experience from the  building of the breakwater  what i gleaned i am sure i do not  know but indeed i had already my own private determination to be  an author i loved the art of words and the appearances of life  and travellers and headers and rubble and polished ashlar and  pierres perdues and even the thrilling question of the string course interested me only if they interested me at all as  properties for some possible romance or as words to add to my  vocabulary  to grow a little catholic is the compensation of  years youth is oneeyed and in those days though i haunted the  breakwater by day and even loved the place for the sake of the  sunshine the thrilling seaside air the wash of waves on the sea face the green glimmer of the divers helmets far below and the  musical chinking of the masons my one genuine preoccupation lay  elsewhere and my only industry was in the hours when i was not on  duty  i lodged with a certain bailie brown a carpenter by trade  and there as soon as dinner was despatched in a chamber scented  with dry roseleaves drew in my chair to the table and proceeded  to pour forth literature at such a speed and with such  intimations of early death and immortality as i now look back upon  with wonder  then it was that i wrote voces fidelium a series of  dramatic monologues in verse then that i indited the bulk of a  covenanting novel  like so many others never finished  late i  sat into the night toiling as i thought under the very dart of  death toiling to leave a memory behind me  i feel moved to thrust  aside the curtain of the years to hail that poor feverish idiot  to bid him go to bed and clap voces fidelium on the fire before he  goes so clear does he appear before me sitting there between his  candles in the rosescented room and the late night so ridiculous  a picture to my elderly wisdom does the fool present  but he was  driven to his bed at last without miraculous intervention and the  manner of his driving sets the last touch upon this eminently  youthful business  the weather was then so warm that i must keep  the windows open the night without was populous with moths  as  the late darkness deepened my literary tapers beaconed forth more  brightly thicker and thicker came the dusty nightfliers to  gyrate for one brilliant instant round the flame and fall in  agonies upon my paper  flesh and blood could not endure the  spectacle to capture immortality was doubtless a noble enterprise  but not to capture it at such a cost of suffering and out would go  the candles and off would i go to bed in the darkness raging to  think that the blow might fall on the morrow and there was voces  fidelium still incomplete  well the moths are  all gone and  voces fidelium along with them only the fool is still on hand and  practises new follies  only one thing in connection with the harbour tempted me and that  was the diving an experience i burned to taste of  but this was  not to be at least in anstruther and the subject involves a  change of scene to the subarctic town of wick  you can never have  dwelt in a country more unsightly than that part of caithness the  land faintly swelling faintly falling not a tree not a hedgerow  the fields divided by single slate stones set upon their edge the  wind always singing in your ears and down the long road that led  nowhere thrumming in the telegraph wires  only as you approached  the coast was there anything to stir the heart  the plateau broke  down to the north sea in formidable cliffs the tall outstacks  rose like pillars ringed about with surf the coves were over brimmed with clamorous froth the seabirds screamed the wind sang  in the thyme on the cliffs edge here and there small ancient  castles toppled on the brim here and there it was possible to dip  into a dell of shelter where you might lie and tell yourself you  were a little warm and hear near at hand the whinpods bursting  in the afternoon sun and farther off the rumour of the turbulent  sea  as for wick itself it is one of the meanest of mans towns  and situate certainly on the baldest of gods bays  it lives for  herring and a strange sight it is to see of an afternoon the  heights of pulteney blackened by seawardlooking fishers as when a  city crowds to a review  or as when bees have swarmed the ground  is horrible with lumps and clusters and a strange sight and a  beautiful to see the fleet put silently out against a rising moon  the sealine rough as a wood with sails and ever and again and one  after another a boat flitting swiftly by the silver disk  this  mass of fishers this great fleet of boats is out of all  proportion to the town itself and the oars are manned and the nets  hauled by immigrants from the long island as we call the outer  hebrides who come for that season only and depart again if the  take be poor leaving debts behind them  in a bad year the end  of the herring fishery is therefore an exciting time fights are  common riots often possible an apple knocked from a childs hand  was once the signal for something like a war and even when i was  there a gunboat lay in the bay to assist the authorities  to  contrary interests it should be observed the curse of babel is  here added the lews men are gaelic speakers  caithness has  adopted english an odd circumstance if you reflect that both must  be largely norsemen by descent  i remember seeing one of the  strongest instances of this division  a thing like a punchand judy box erected on the flat gravestones of the churchyard from  the hutch or proscenium  i know not what to call it  an eldritch looking preacher laying down the law in gaelic about some one of  the name of powl whom i at last divined to be the apostle to the  gentiles a large congregation of the lews men very devoutly  listening and on the outskirts of the crowd some of the towns  children to whom the whole affair was greek and hebrew profanely  playing tigg  the same descent the same country the same narrow  sect of the same religion and all these bonds made very largely  nugatory by an accidental difference of dialect  into the bay of wick stretched the dark length of the unfinished  breakwater in its cage of open staging the travellers like  frames of churches overplumbing all and away at the extreme end  the divers toiling unseen on the foundation  on a platform of  loose planks the assistants turned their airmills a stone might  be swinging between wind and water underneath the swell ran gaily  and from time to time a mailed dragon with a windowglass snout  came dripping up the ladder  youth is a blessed season after all  my stay at wick was in the year of voces fidelium and the roseleaf  room at bailie browns and already i did not care two straws for  literary glory  posthumous ambition perhaps requires an atmosphere  of roses and the more rugged excitant of wick east winds had made  another boy of me  to go down in the divingdress that was my  absorbing fancy and with the countenance of a certain handsome  scamp of a diver bob bain by name i gratified the whim  it was gray harsh easterly weather the swell ran pretty high  and out in the open there were skippers daughters when i found  myself at last on the divers platform twenty pounds of lead upon  each foot and my whole person swollen with ply and ply of woollen  underclothing  one moment the salt wind was whistling round my  nightcapped head the next i was crushed almost double under the  weight of the helmet  as that intolerable burthern was laid upon  me i could have found it in my heart only for shames sake to  cry off from the whole enterprise  but it was too late  the  attendants began to turn the hurdygurdy and the air to whistle  through the tube some one screwed in the barred window of the  vizor and i was cut off in a moment from my fellowmen standing  there in their midst but quite divorced from intercourse  a  creature deaf and dumb pathetically looking forth upon them from a  climate of his own  except that i could move and feel i was like  a man fallen in a catalepsy  but time was scarce given me to  realise my isolation the weights were hung upon my back and  breast the signal rope was thrust into my unresisting hand and  setting a twentypound foot upon the ladder i began ponderously to  descend  some twenty rounds below the platform twilight fell  looking up  i saw a low green heaven mottled with vanishing bells of white  looking around except for the weedy spokes and shafts of the  ladder nothing but a green gloaming somewhat opaque but very  restful and delicious  thirty rounds lower i stepped off on the  pierres perdues of the foundation a dumb helmeted figure took me  by the hand and made a gesture as i read it of encouragement  and looking in at the creatures window i beheld the face of bain   there we were hand to hand and when it pleased us eye to eye  and either might have burst himself with shouting and not a  whisper come to his companions hearing  each in his own little  world of air stood incommunicably separate  bob had told me ere this a little tale a five minutes drama at  the bottom of the sea which at that moment possibly shot across my  mind  he was down with another settling a stone of the seawall   they had it well adjusted bob gave the signal the scissors were  slipped the stone set home and it was time to turn to something  else  but still his companion remained bowed over the block like a  mourner on a tomb or only raised himself to make absurd  contortions and mysterious signs unknown to the vocabulary of the  diver  there then these two stood for awhile like the dead and  the living till there flashed a fortunate thought into bobs mind  and he stooped peered through the window of that other world and  beheld the face of its inhabitant wet with streaming tears  ah  the man was in pain  and bob glancing downward saw what was the  trouble  the block had been lowered on the foot of that  unfortunate  he was caught alive at the bottom of the sea under  fifteen tons of rock  that two men should handle a stone so heavy even swinging in the  scissors may appear strange to the inexpert  these must bear in  mind the great density of the water of the sea and the surprising  results of transplantation to that medium  to understand a little  what these are and how a mans weight so far from being an  encumbrance is the very ground of his agility was the chief  lesson of my submarine experience  the knowledge came upon me by  degrees  as i began to go forward with the hand of my estranged  companion a world of tumbled stones was visible pillared with the  weedy uprights of the staging  overhead a flat roof of green  a  little in front the seawall like an unfinished rampart  and  presently in our upward progress bob motioned me to leap upon a  stone i looked to see if he were possibly in earnest and he only  signed to me the more imperiously  now the block stood six feet  high it would have been quite a leap to me unencumbered with the  breast and back weights and the twenty pounds upon each foot and  the staggering load of the helmet the thing was out of reason  i  laughed aloud in my tomb and to prove to bob how far he was  astray i gave a little impulse from my toes  up i soared like a  bird my companion soaring at my side  as high as to the stone  and then higher i pursued my impotent and empty flight  even when  the strong arm of bob had checked my shoulders my heels continued  their ascent so that i blew out sideways like an autumn leaf and  must be hauled in hand over hand as sailors haul in the slack of  a sail and propped upon my feet again like an intoxicated sparrow   yet a little higher on the foundation and we began to be affected  by the bottom of the swell running there like a strong breeze of  wind  or so i must suppose for safe in my cushion of air i was  conscious of no impact only swayed idly like a weed and was now  borne helplessly abroad and now swiftly  and yet with dreamlike  gentleness  impelled against my guide  so does a childs balloon  divagate upon the currents of the air and touch and slide off  again from every obstacle  so must have ineffectually swung so  resented their inefficiency those light crowds that followed the  star of hades and uttered exiguous voices in the land beyond  cocytus  there was something strangely exasperating as well as strangely  wearying in these uncommanded evolutions  it is bitter to return  to infancy to be supported and directed and perpetually set upon  your feet by the hand of some one else  the air besides as it is  supplied to you by the busy millers on the platform closes the  eustachian tubes and keeps the neophyte perpetually swallowing  till his throat is grown so dry that he can swallow no longer  and  for all these reasonsalthough i had a fine dizzy muddleheaded  joy in my surroundings and longed and tried and always failed  to lay hands on the fish that darted here and there about me swift  as hummingbirds  yet i fancy i was rather relieved than otherwise  when bain brought me back to the ladder and signed to me to mount   and there was one more experience before me even then  of a  sudden my ascending head passed into the trough of a swell  out  of the green i shot at once into a glory of rosy almost of  sanguine light  the multitudinous seas incarnadined the heaven  above a vault of crimson  and then the glory faded into the hard  ugly daylight of a caithness autumn with a low sky a gray sea  and a whistling wind  bob bain had five shillings for his trouble and i had done what i  desired  it was one of the best things i got from my education as  an engineer  of which however as a way of life i wish to speak  with sympathy  it takes a man into the open air it keeps him  hanging about harboursides which is the richest form of idling  it carries him to wild islands it gives him a taste of the genial  dangers of the sea it supplies him with dexterities to exercise  it makes demands upon his ingenuity it will go far to cure him of  any taste if ever he had one for the miserable life of cities   and when it has done so it carries him back and shuts him in an  office  from the roaring skerry and the wet thwart of the tossing  boat he passes to the stool and desk and with a memory full of  ships and seas and perilous headlands and the shining pharos he  must apply his longsighted eyes to the petty niceties of drawing  or measure his inaccurate mind with several pages of consecutive  figures  he is a wise youth to be sure who can balance one part  of genuine life against two parts of drudgery

bob  bain among the roots of the staging to be all day in a boat  coiling a wet rope and shouting orders  not always very wise   than to be warm and dry and dull and deadalive in the most  comfortable office  and wick itself had in those days a note of  originality  it may have still but i misdoubt it much  the old  minister of keiss would not preach in these degenerate times for  an hour and a half upon the clock  the gipsies must be gone from  their cavern where you might see from the mouth the women  tending their fire like meg merrilies and the men sleeping off  their coarse potations and where in winter gales the surf would  beleaguer them closely bursting in their very door  a traveller  today upon the thurso coach would scarce observe a little cloud of  smoke among the moorlands and be told quite openly it marked a  private still  he would not indeed make that journey for there is  now no thurso coach  and even if he could one little thing that  happened to me could never happen to him or not with the same  trenchancy of contrast  we had been upon the road all evening the coachtop was crowded  with lews fishers going home scarce anything but gaelic had  sounded in my ears and our way had lain throughout over a moorish  country very northern to behold  latish at night though it was  still broad day in our subarctic latitude we came down upon the  shores of the roaring pentland firth that grave of mariners on  one hand the cliffs of dunnet head ran seaward in front was the  little bare white town of castleton its streets full of blowing  sand nothing beyond but the north islands the great deep and  the perennial icefields of the pole  and here in the last  imaginable place there sprang up young outlandish voices and a  chatter of some foreign speech and i saw pursuing the coach with  its load of hebridean fishers  as they had pursued vetturini up  the passes of the apennines or perhaps along the grotto under  virgils tomb  two little darkeyed whitetoothed italian  vagabonds of twelve to fourteen years of age one with a hurdy gurdy the other with a cage of white mice  the coach passed on  and their small italian chatter died in the distance and i was  left to marvel how they had wandered into that country and how  they fared in it and what they thought of it and when if ever  they should see again the silver windbreaks run among the olives  and the stonepine stand guard upon etruscan sepulchres  upon any american the strangeness of this incident is somewhat  lost  for as far back as he goes in his own land he will find  some alien camping there the cornish miner the french or mexican  halfblood the negro in the south these are deep in the woods and  far among the mountains  but in an old cold and rugged country  such as mine the days of immigration are long at an end and away  up there which was at that time far beyond the northernmost  extreme of railways hard upon the shore of that illomened strait  of whirlpools in a land of moors where no stranger came unless it  should be a sportsman to shoot grouse or an antiquary to decipher  runes the presence of these small pedestrians struck the mind as  though a birdofparadise had risen from the heather or an  albatross come fishing in the bay of wick  they were as strange to  their surroundings as my lordly evangelist or the old spanish  grandee on the fair isle    chapter vii  the lanternbearers    i   these boys congregated every autumn about a certain easterly  fishervillage where they tasted in a high degree the glory of  existence  the place was created seemingly on purpose for the  diversion of young gentlemen  a street or two of houses mostly  red and many of them tiled a number of fine trees clustered about  the manse and the kirkyard and turning the chief street into a  shady alley many little gardens more than usually bright with  flowers nets adrying and fisherwives scolding in the backward  parts a smell of fish a genial smell of seaweed whiffs of  blowing sand at the streetcorners shops with golfballs and  bottled lollipops another shop with penny pickwicks that  remarkable cigar and the london journal dear to me for its  startling pictures and a few novels dear for their suggestive  names  such as well as memory serves me were the ingredients of  the town  these you are to conceive posted on a spit between two  sandy bays and sparsely flanked with villas enough for the boys to  lodge in with their subsidiary parents not enough not yet enough  to cocknify the scene  a haven in the rocks in front  in front of  that a file of gray islets  to the left endless links and sand  wreaths a wilderness of hidingholes alive with popping rabbits  and soaring gulls  to the right a range of seaward crags one  rugged brow beyond another the ruins of a mighty and ancient  fortress on the brink of one coves between  now charmed into  sunshine quiet now whistling with wind and clamorous with bursting  surges the dens and sheltered hollows redolent of thyme and  southernwood the air at the cliffs edge brisk and clean and  pungent of the sea  in front of all the bass rock tilted seaward  like a doubtful bather the surf ringing it with white the solan geese hanging round its summit like a great and glittering smoke   this choice piece of seaboard was sacred besides to the wrecker  and the bass in the eye of fancy still flew the colours of king  james and in the ear of fancy the arches of tantallon still rang  with horseshoe iron and echoed to the commands of bellthecat  there was nothing to mar your days if you were a boy summering in  that part but the embarrassment of pleasure  you might golf if  you wanted but i seem to have been better employed  you might  secrete yourself in the ladys walk a certain sunless dingle of  elders all mossed over by the damp as green as grass and dotted  here and there by the streamside with roofless walls the cold  homes of anchorites  to fit themselves for life and with a  special eye to acquire the art of smoking it was even common for  the boys to harbour there and you might have seen a single penny  pickwick honestly shared in lengths with a blunt knife bestrew  the glen with these apprentices  again you might join our fishing  parties where we sat perched as thick as solangeese a covey of  little anglers boy and girl angling over each others heads to  the to the much entanglement of lines and loss of podleys and  consequent shrill recrimination  shrill as the geese themselves   indeed had that been all you might have done this often but  though fishing be a fine pastime the podley is scarce to be  regarded as a dainty for the table and it was a point of honour  that a boy should eat all that he had taken  or again you might  climb the law where the whales jawbone stood landmark in the  buzzing wind and behold the face of many counties and the smoke  and spires of many towns and the sails of distant ships  you  might bathe now in the flaws of fine weather that we pathetically  call our summer now in a gale of wind with the sand scourging  your bare hide your clothes thrashing abroad from underneath their  guardian stone the froth of the great breakers casting you  headlong ere it had drowned your knees  or you might explore the  tidal rocks above all in the ebb of springs when the very roots  of the hills were for the nonce discovered following my leader  from one group to another groping in slippery tangle for the wreck  of ships wading in pools after the abominable creatures of the  sea and ever with an eye cast backward on the march off the tide  and the menaced line of your retreat  and then you might go  crusoeing a word that covers all extempore eating in the open air   digging perhaps a house under the margin of the links kindling a  fire of the seaware and cooking apples there  if they were truly  apples for i sometimes suppose the merchant must have played us  off with some inferior and quite local fruit capable of resolving  in the neighbourhood of fire into mere sand and smoke and iodine  or perhaps pushing to tantallon you might lunch on sandwiches and  visions in the grassy court while the wind hummed in the crumbling  turrets or clambering along the coast eat geans the worst i  must suppose in christendom from an adventurous gean tree that  had taken root under a cliff where it was shaken with an ague of  east wind and silvered after gales with salt and grew so foreign  among its bleak surroundings that to eat of its produce was an  adventure in itself  there are mingled some dismal memories with so many that were  joyous  of the fisherwife for instance who had cut her throat  at canty bay and of how i ran with the other children to the top  of the quadrant and beheld a posse of silent people escorting a  cart and on the cart bound in a chair her throat bandaged and  the bandage all bloody  horror  the fisherwife herself who  continued thenceforth to hagride my thoughts and even today as  i recall the scene darkens daylight  she was lodged in the little  old jail in the chief street but whether or no she died there  with a wise terror of the worst i never inquired  she had been  tippling it was but a dingy tragedy and it seems strange and hard  that after all these years the poor crazy sinner should be still  pilloried on her cart in the scrapbook of my memory  nor shall i  readily forget a certain house in the quadrant where a visitor  died and a dark old woman continued to dwell alone with the dead  body nor how this old woman conceived a hatred to myself and one  of my cousins and in the dread hour of the dusk as we were  clambering on the gardenwalls opened a window in that house of  mortality and cursed us in a shrill voice and with a marrowy choice  of language  it was a pair of very colourless urchins that fled  down the lane from this remarkable experience  but i recall with a  more doubtful sentiment compounded out of fear and exultation the  coil of equinoctial tempests trumpeting squalls scouring flaws of  rain the boats with their reefed lugsails scudding for the harbour  mouth where danger lay for it was hard to make when the wind had  any east in it the wives clustered with blowing shawls at the  pierhead where if fate was against them they might see boat and  husband and sons  their whole wealth and their whole family   engulfed under their eyes and what i saw but once a troop of  neighbours forcing such an unfortunate homeward and she squalling  and battling in their midst a figure scarcely human a tragic  maenad  these are things that i recall with interest but what my memory  dwells upon the most i have been all this while withholding  it  was a sport peculiar to the place and indeed to a week or so of  our two months holiday there  maybe it still flourishes in its  native spot for boys and their pastimes are swayed by periodic  forces inscrutable to man so that tops and marbles reappear in  their due season regular like the sun and moon and the harmless  art of knucklebones has seen the fall of the roman empire and the  rise of the united states  it may still flourish in its native  spot but nowhere else i am persuaded for i tried myself to  introduce it on tweedside and was defeated lamentably its charm  being quite local like a country wine that cannot be exported  the idle manner of it was this  toward the end of september when schooltime was drawing near and  the nights were already black we would begin to sally from our respective villas each equipped with a tin bullseye lantern   the thing was so well known that it had worn a rut in the commerce  of great britain and the grocers about the due time began to  garnish their windows with our particular brand of luminary  we  wore them buckled to the waist upon a cricket belt and over them  such was the rigour of the game a buttoned topcoat  they smelled  noisomely of blistered tin they never burned aright though they  would always burn our fingers their use was naught the pleasure  of them merely fanciful and yet a boy with a bullseye under his  topcoat asked for nothing more  the fishermen used lanterns about  their boats and it was from them i suppose that we had got the  hint but theirs were not bullseyes nor did we ever play at  being fishermen  the police carried them at their belts and we  had plainly copied them in that yet we did not pretend to be  policemen  burglars indeed we may have had some haunting  thoughts of and we had certainly an eye to past ages when lanterns  were more common and to certain storybooks in which we had found  them to figure very largely  but take it for all in all the  pleasure of the thing was substantive and to be a boy with a  bullseye under his topcoat was good enough for us  when two of these asses met there would be an anxious have you  got your lantern and a gratified yes that was the shibboleth  and very needful too for as it was the rule to keep our glory  contained none could recognise a lanternbearer unless like the  polecat by the smell  four or five would sometimes climb into the  belly of a tenman lugger with nothing but the thwarts above them   for the cabin was usually locked or choose out some hollow of  the links where the wind might whistle overhead  there the coats  would be unbuttoned and the bullseyes discovered and in the  chequering glimmer under the huge windy hall of the night and  cheered by a rich steam of toasting tinware these fortunate young  gentlemen would crouch together in the cold sand of the links or on  the scaly bilges of the fishingboat and delight themselves with  inappropriate talk  woe is me that i may not give some specimens   some of their foresights of life or deep inquiries into the  rudiments of man and nature these were so fiery and so innocent  they were so richly silly so romantically young  but the talk at  any rate was but a condiment and these gatherings themselves only  accidents in the career of the lanternbearer  the essence of this  bliss was to walk by yourself in the black night the slide shut  the topcoat buttoned not a ray escaping whether to conduct your  footsteps or to make your glory public  a mere pillar of darkness  in the dark and all the while deep down in the privacy of your  fools heart to know you had a bullseye at your belt and to  exult and sing over the knowledge   ii   it is said that a poet has died young in the breast of the most  stolid  it may be contended rather that this somewhat minor  bard in almost every case survives and is the spice of life to his  possessor  justice is not done to the versatility and the  unplumbed childishness of mans imagination  his life from without  may seem but a rude mound of mud there will be some golden chamber  at the heart of it in which he dwells delighted and for as dark  as his pathway seems to the observer he will have some kind of a  bullseye at his belt  it would be hard to pick out a career more cheerless than that of  dancer the miser as he figures in the old bailey reports a  prey to the most sordid persecutions the butt of his  neighbourhood betrayed by his hired man his house beleaguered by  the impish schoolboy and he himself grinding and fuming and  impotently fleeing to the law against these pinpricks  you marvel  at first that any one should willingly prolong a life so destitute  of charm and dignity and then you call to memory that had he  chosen had he ceased to be a miser he could have been freed at  once from these trials and might have built himself a castle and  gone escorted by a squadron  for the love of more recondite joys  which we cannot estimate which it may be we should envy the man  had willingly forgone both comfort and consideration  his mind to  him a kingdom was and sure enough digging into that mind which  seems at first a dustheap we unearth some priceless jewels  for  dancer must have had the love of power and the disdain of using it  a noble character in itself disdain of many pleasures a chief  part of what is commonly called wisdom disdain of the inevitable  end that finest trait of mankind scorn of mens opinions another  element of virtue and at the back of all a conscience just like  yours and mine whining like a cur swindling like a thimble rigger but still pointing there or thereabout to some  conventional standard  here were a cabinet portrait to which  hawthorne perhaps had done justice and yet not hawthorne either  for he was mildly minded and it lay not in him to create for us  that throb of the misers pulse his fretful energy of gusto his  vast arms of ambition clutching in he knows not what  insatiable  insane a god with a muckrake  thus at least looking in the  bosom of the miser consideration detects the poet in the full tide  of life with more indeed of the poetic fire than usually goes to  epics and tracing that mean man about his cold hearth and to and  fro in his discomfortable house spies within him a blazing bonfire  of delight  and so with others who do not live by bread alone  but by some cherished and perhaps fantastic pleasure who are meat  salesmen to the external eye and possibly to themselves are  shakespeares napoleons or beethovens who have not one virtue to  rub against another in the field of active life and yet perhaps  in the life of contemplation sit with the saints  we see them on  the street and we can count their buttons but heaven knows in  what they pride themselves heaven knows where they have set their  treasure  there is one fable that touches very near the quick of life  the  fable of the monk who passed into the woods heard a bird break  into song hearkened for a trill or two and found himself on his  return a stranger at his convent gates for he had been absent  fifty years and of all his comrades there survived but one to  recognise him  it is not only in the woods that this enchanter  carols though perhaps he is native there  he sings in the most  doleful places  the miser hears him and chuckles and the days are  moments  with no more apparatus than an illsmelling lantern i  have evoked him on the naked links  all life that is not merely  mechanical is spun out of two strands  seeking for that bird and  hearing him  and it is just this that makes life so hard to value  and the delight of each so incommunicable  and just a knowledge of  this and a remembrance of those fortunate hours in which the bird  has sung to us that fills us with such wonder when we turn the  pages of the realist  there to be sure we find a picture of life  in so far as it consists of mud and of old iron cheap desires and  cheap fears that which we are ashamed to remember and that which  we are careless whether we forget but of the note of that time devouring nightingale we hear no news  the case of these writers of romance is most obscure  they have  been boys and youths they have lingered outside the window of the  beloved who was then most probably writing to some one else they  have sat before a sheet of paper and felt themselves mere  continents of congested poetry not one line of which would flow  they have walked alone in the woods they have walked in cities  under the countless lamps they have been to sea they have hated  they have feared they have longed to knife a man and maybe done  it the wild taste of life has stung their palate  or if you deny  them all the rest one pleasure at least they have tasted to the  full  their books are there to prove it  the keen pleasure of  successful literary composition  and yet they fill the globe with  volumes whose cleverness inspires me with despairing admiration  and whose consistent falsity to all i care to call existence with  despairing wrath  if i had no better hope than to continue to  revolve among the dreary and petty businesses and to be moved by  the paltry hopes and fears with which they surround and animate  their heroes i declare i would die now  but there has never an  hour of mine gone quite so dully yet if it were spent waiting at a  railway junction i would have some scattering thoughts i could  count some grains of memory compared to which the whole of one of  these romances seems but dross  these writers would retort if i take them properly that this was  very true that it was the same with themselves and other persons  of what they call the artistic temperament that in this we were  exceptional and should apparently be ashamed of ourselves but  that our works must deal exclusively with what they call the  average man who was a prodigious dull fellow and quite dead to  all but the paltriest considerations  i accept the issue  we can  only know others by ourselves  the artistic temperament a plague  on the expression does not make us different from our fellowmen  or it would make us incapable of writing novels and the average  man a murrain on the word is just like you and me or he would  not be average  it was whitman who stamped a kind of birmingham  sacredness upon the latter phrase but whitman knew very well and  showed very nobly that the average man was full of joys and full  of a poetry of his own  and this harping on lifes dulness and  mans meanness is a loud profession of incompetence it is one of  two things  the cry of the blind eye i cannot see or the  complaint of the dumb tongue i cannot utter  to draw a life  without delights is to prove i have not realised it  to picture a  man without some sort of poetry  well it goes near to prove my  case for it shows an author may have little enough  to see dancer  only as a dirty old smallminded impotently fuming man in a  dirty house besieged by harrow boys and probably beset by small  attorneys is to show myself as keen an observer as    the  harrow boys  but these young gentlemen with a more becoming  modesty were content to pluck dancer by the coattails they did  not suppose they had surprised his secret or could put him living  in a book  and it is there my error would have lain  or say that  in the same romance  i continue to call these books romances in  the hope of giving pain  say that in the same romance which now  begins really to take shape i should leave to speak of dancer and  follow instead the harrow boys and say that i came on some such  business as that of my lanternbearers on the links and described  the boys as very cold spat upon by flurries of rain and drearily  surrounded all of which they were and their talk as silly and  indecent which it certainly was  i might upon these lines and  had i zolas genius turn out in a page or so a gem of literary  art render the lanternlight with the touches of a master and lay  on the indecency with the ungrudging hand of love and when all was  done what a triumph would my picture be of shallowness and  dulness how it would have missed the point how it would have  belied the boys  to the ear of the stenographer the talk is  merely silly and indecent but ask the boys themselves and they  are discussing as it is highly proper they should the  possibilities of existence  to the eye of the observer they are  wet and cold and drearily surrounded but ask themselves and they  are in the heaven of a recondite pleasure the ground of which is  an illsmelling lantern   iii   for to repeat the ground of a mans joy is often hard to hit  it  may hinge at times upon a mere accessory like the lantern it may  reside like dancers in the mysterious inwards of psychology  it  may consist with perpetual failure and find exercise in the  continued chase  it has so little bond with externals such as the  observer scribbles in his notebook that it may even touch them  not and the mans true life for which he consents to live lie  altogether in the field of fancy  the clergyman in his spare  hours may be winning battles the farmer sailing ships the banker  reaping triumph in the arts  all leading another life plying  another trade from that they chose like the poets housebuilder  who after all is cased in stone  by his fireside as impotent fancy prompts rebuilds it to his liking  in such a case the poetry runs underground  the observer poor  soul with his documents is all abroad  for to look at the man  is but to court deception  we shall see the trunk from which he  draws his nourishment but he himself is above and abroad in the  green dome of foliage hummed through by winds and nested in by  nightingales  and the true realism were that of the poets to  climb up after him like a squirrel and catch some glimpse of the  heaven for which he lives  and the true realism always and everywhere is that of the poets   to find out where joy resides and give it a voice far beyond  singing  for to miss the joy is to miss all  in the joy of the actors lies  the sense of any action  that is the explanation that the excuse   to one who has not the secret of the lanterns the scene upon the  links is meaningless  and hence the haunting and truly spectral  unreality of realistic books  hence when we read the english  realists the incredulous wonder with which we observe the heros  constancy under the submerging tide of dulness and how he bears up  with his jibbing sweetheart and endures the chatter of idiot  girls and stands by his whole unfeatured wilderness of an  existence instead of seeking relief in drink or foreign travel   hence in the french in that meatmarket of middleaged sensuality  the disgusted surprise with which we see the hero drift sidelong  and practically quite untempted into every description of  misconduct and dishonour  in each we miss the personal poetry  the enchanted atmosphere that rainbow work of fancy that clothes  what is naked and seems to ennoble what is base in each life  falls dead like dough instead of soaring away like a balloon into  the colours of the sunset each is true each inconceivable for no  man lives in the external truth among salts and acids but in the  warm phantasmagoric chamber of his brain with the painted windows  and the storied walls  of this falsity we have had a recent example from a man who knows  far better  tolstois powers of darkness  here is a piece full of  force and truth yet quite untrue  for before mikita was led into  so dire a situation he was tempted and temptations are beautiful  at least in part and a work which dwells on the ugliness of crime  and gives no hint of any loveliness in the temptation sins against  the modesty of life and even when a tolstoi writes it sinks to  melodrama  the peasants are not understood they saw their life in  fairer colours even the deaf girl was clothed in poetry for  mikita or he had never fallen  and so once again even an old  bailey melodrama without some brightness of poetry and lustre of  existence falls into the inconceivable and ranks with fairy tales   iv   in nobler books we are moved with something like the emotions of  life and this emotion is very variously provoked  we are so moved  when levine labours in the field when andre sinks beyond emotion  when richard feverel and lucy desborough meet beside the river  when antony not cowardly puts off his helmet when kent has  infinite pity on the dying lear when in dostoieffkys despised  and rejected the uncomplaining hero drains his cup of suffering  and virtue  these are notes that please the great heart of man   not only love and the fields and the bright face of danger but  sacrifice and death and unmerited suffering humbly supported touch  in us the vein of the poetic  we love to think of them we long to  try them we are humbly hopeful that we may prove heroes also  we have heard perhaps too much of lesser matters  here is the  door here is the open air  itur in antiquam silvam    chapter viii  a chapter on dreams    the past is all of one texture  whether feigned or suffered   whether acted out in three dimensions or only witnessed in that  small theatre of the brain which we keep brightly lighted all night  long after the jets are down and darkness and sleep reign  undisturbed in the remainder of the body  there is no distinction  on the face of our experiences one is vivid indeed and one dull  and one pleasant and another agonising to remember but which of  them is what we call true and which a dream there is not one hair  to prove  the past stands on a precarious footing another straw  split in the field of metaphysic and behold us robbed of it   there is scarce a family that can count four generations but lays a  claim to some dormant title or some castle and estate  a claim not  prosecutable in any court of law but flattering to the fancy and a  great alleviation of idle hours  a mans claim to his own past is  yet less valid  a paper might turn up in proper storybook  fashion in the secret drawer of an old ebony secretary and  restore your family to its ancient honours and reinstate mine in a  certain west indian islet not far from st kitts as beloved  tradition hummed in my young ears which was once ours and is now  unjustly some one elses and for that matter in the state of the  sugar trade is not worth anything to anybody  i do not say that  these revolutions are likely only no man can deny that they are  possible and the past on the other baud is lost for ever  our  old days and deeds our old selves too and the very world in  which these scenes were acted all brought down to the same faint  residuum as a last nights dream to some incontinuous images and  an echo in the chambers of the brain  not an hour not a mood not  a glance of the eye can we revoke it is all gone past conjuring   and yet conceive us robbed of it conceive that little thread of  memory that we trail behind us broken at the pockets edge and in  what naked nullity should we be left for we only guide ourselves  and only know ourselves by these airpainted pictures of the past  upon these grounds there are some among us who claim to have lived  longer and more richly than their neighbours when they lay asleep  they claim they were still active and among the treasures of  memory that all men review for their amusement these count in no  second place the harvests of their dreams  there is one of this  kind whom i have in my eye and whose case is perhaps unusual  enough to be described  he was from a child an ardent and  uncomfortable dreamer  when he had a touch of fever at night and  the room swelled and shrank and his clothes hanging on a nail  now loomed up instant to the bigness of a church and now drew away  into a horror of infinite distance and infinite littleness the  poor soul was very well aware of what must follow and struggled  hard against the approaches of that slumber which was the beginning  of sorrows  but his struggles were in vain sooner or later the nighthag would  have him by the throat and pluck him strangling and screaming  from his sleep  his dreams were at times commonplace enough at  times very strange at times they were almost formless  he would  be haunted for instance by nothing more definite than a certain  hue of brown which he did not mind in the least while he was  awake but feared and loathed while he was dreaming at times  again they took on every detail of circumstance as when once he  supposed he must swallow the populous world and awoke screaming  with the horror of the thought  the two chief troubles of his very  narrow existence  the practical and everyday trouble of school  tasks and the ultimate and airy one of hell and judgment  were  often confounded together into one appalling nightmare  he seemed  to himself to stand before the great white throne he was called  on poor little devil to recite some form of words on which his  destiny depended his tongue stuck his memory was blank hell  gaped for him and he would awake clinging to the curtainrod with  his knees to his chin  these were extremely poor experiences on the whole and at that  time of life my dreamer would have very willingly parted with his  power of dreams  but presently in the course of his growth the  cries and physical contortions passed away seemingly for ever his  visions were still for the most part miserable but they were more  constantly supported and he would awake with no more extreme  symptom than a flying heart a freezing scalp cold sweats and the  speechless midnight fear  his dreams too as befitted a mind  better stocked with particulars became more circumstantial and  had more the air and continuity of life  the look of the world  beginning to take hold on his attention scenery came to play a  part in his sleeping as well as in his waking thoughts so that he  would take long uneventful journeys and see strange towns and  beautiful places as he lay in bed  and what is more significant  an odd taste that he had for the georgian costume and for stories  laid in that period of english history began to rule the features  of his dreams so that he masqueraded there in a threecornered hat  and was much engaged with jacobite conspiracy between the hour for  bed and that for breakfast  about the same time he began to read  in his dreams  tales for the most part and for the most part  after the manner of g p r james but so incredibly more vivid  and moving than any printed book that he has ever since been  malcontent with literature  and then while he was yet a student there came to him a dream adventure which he has no anxiety to repeat he began that is to  say to dream in sequence and thus to lead a double life  one of  the day one of the night  one that he had every reason to believe  was the true one another that he had no means of proving to be  false  i should have said he studied or was by way of studying  at edinburgh college which it may be supposed was how i came to  know him  well in his dreamlife he passed a long day in the  surgical theatre his heart in his mouth his teeth on edge seeing  monstrous malformations and the abhorred dexterity of surgeons  in  a heavy rainy foggy evening he came forth into the south bridge  turned up the high street and entered the door of a tall land at  the top of which he supposed himself to lodge  all night long in  his wet clothes he climbed the stairs stair after stair in  endless series and at every second flight a flaring lamp with a  reflector  all night long he brushed by single persons passing  downward  beggarly women of the street great weary muddy  labourers poor scarecrows of men pale parodies of women  but all  drowsy and weary like himself and all single and all brushing  against him as they passed  in the end out of a northern window  he would see day beginning to whiten over the firth give up the  ascent turn to descend and in a breath be back again upon the  streets in his wet clothes in the wet haggard dawn trudging to  another day of monstrosities and operations  time went quicker in  the life of dreams some seven hours as near as he can guess to  one and it went besides more intensely so that the gloom of  these fancied experiences clouded the day and he had not shaken  off their shadow ere it was time to lie down and to renew them  i  cannot tell how long it was that he endured this discipline but it  was long enough to leave a great black blot upon his memory long  enough to send him trembling for his reason to the doors of a  certain doctor whereupon with a simple draught he was restored to  the common lot of man  the poor gentleman has since been troubled by nothing of the sort  indeed his nights were for some while like other mens now blank  now chequered with dreams and these sometimes charming sometimes  appalling but except for an occasional vividness of no  extraordinary kind  i will just note one of these occasions ere i  pass on to what makes my dreamer truly interesting  it seemed to  him that he was in the first floor of a rough hillfarm  the room  showed some poor efforts at gentility a carpet on the floor a  piano i think against the wall but for all these refinements  there was no mistaking he was in a moorland place among hillside  people and set in miles of heather  he looked down from the  window upon a bare farmyard that seemed to have been long disused   a great uneasy stillness lay upon the world  there was no sign of  the farmfolk or of any live stock save for an old brown curly  dog of the retriever breed who sat close in against the wall of  the house and seemed to be dozing  something about this dog  disquieted the dreamer it was quite a nameless feeling for the  beast looked right enough  indeed he was so old and dull and  dusty and brokendown that he should rather have awakened pity  and yet the conviction came and grew upon the dreamer that this was  no proper dog at all but something hellish  a great many dozing  summer flies hummed about the yard and presently the dog thrust  forth his paw caught a fly in his open palm carried it to his  mouth like an ape and looking suddenly up at the dreamer in the  window winked to him with one eye  the dream went on it matters  not how it went it was a good dream as dreams go but there was  nothing in the sequel worthy of that devilish brown dog  and the  point of interest for me lies partly in that very fact  that  having found so singular an incident my imperfect dreamer should  prove unable to carry the tale to a fit end and fall back on  indescribable noises and indiscriminate horrors  it would be  different now he knows his business better  for to approach at last the point  this honest fellow had long  been in the custom of setting himself to sleep with tales and so  had his father before him but these were irresponsible inventions  told for the tellers pleasure with no eye to the crass public or  the thwart reviewer  tales where a thread might be dropped or one  adventure quitted for another on fancys least suggestion  so  that the little people who manage mans internal theatre had not as  yet received a very rigorous training and played upon their stage  like children who should have slipped into the house and found it  empty rather than like drilled actors performing a set piece to a  huge hall of faces  but presently my dreamer began to turn his  former amusement of storytelling to what is called account by  which i mean that he began to write and sell his tales  here was  he and here were the little people who did that part of his  business in quite new conditions  the stories must now be trimmed  and pared and set upon all fours they must run from a beginning to  an end and fit after a manner with the laws of life the  pleasure in one word had become a business and that not only for  the dreamer but for the little people of his theatre  these  understood the change as well as he  when he lay down to prepare  himself for sleep he no longer sought amusement but printable and  profitable tales and after he had dozed off in his boxseat his  little people continued their evolutions with the same mercantile  designs  all other forms of dream deserted him but two  he still  occasionally reads the most delightful books he still visits at  times the most delightful places and it is perhaps worthy of note  that to these same places and to one in particular he returns at  intervals of months and years finding new fieldpaths visiting  new neighbours beholding that happy valley under new effects of  noon and dawn and sunset  but all the rest of the family of  visions is quite lost to him  the common mangled version of  yesterdays affairs the rawheadandbloodybones nightmare  rumoured to be the child of toasted cheese  these and their like  are gone and for the most part whether awake or asleep he is  simply occupied  he or his little people  in consciously making  stories for the market  this dreamer like many other persons has  encountered some trifling vicissitudes of fortune  when the bank  begins to send letters and the butcher to linger at the back gate  he sets to belabouring his brains after a story for that is his  readiest moneywinner and behold at once the little people begin  to bestir themselves in the same quest and labour all night long  and all night long set before him truncheons of tales upon their  lighted theatre  no fear of his being frightened now the flying  heart and the frozen scalp are things bygone applause growing  applause growing interest growing exultation in his own  cleverness for he takes all the credit and at last a jubilant  leap to wakefulness with the cry i have it thatll do upon  his lips  with such and similar emotions he sits at these  nocturnal dramas with such outbreaks like claudius in the play  he scatters the performance in the midst  often enough the waking  is a disappointment  he has been too deep asleep as i explain the  thing drowsiness has gained his little people they have gone  stumbling and maundering through their parts and the play to the  awakened mind is seen to be a tissue of absurdities  and yet how  often have these sleepless brownies done him honest service and  given him as he sat idly taking his pleasure in the boxes better  tales than he could fashion for himself  here is one exactly as it came to him  it seemed he was the son  of a very rich and wicked man the owner of broad acres and a most  damnable temper  the dreamer and that was the son had lived much  abroad on purpose to avoid his parent and when at length he  returned to england it was to find him married again to a young  wife who was supposed to suffer cruelly and to loathe her yoke   because of this marriage as the dreamer indistinctly understood  it was desirable for father and son to have a meeting and yet both  being proud and both angry neither would condescend upon a visit   meet they did accordingly in a desolate sandy country by the sea  and there they quarrelled and the son stung by some intolerable  insult struck down the father dead  no suspicion was aroused the  dead man was found and buried and the dreamer succeeded to the  broad estates and found himself installed under the same roof with  his fathers widow for whom no provision had been made  these two  lived very much alone as people may after a bereavement sat down  to table together shared the long evenings and grew daily better  friends until it seemed to him of a sudden that she was prying  about dangerous matters that she had conceived a notion of his  guilt that she watched him and tried him with questions  he drew  back from her company as men draw back from a precipice suddenly  discovered and yet so strong was the attraction that he would  drift again and again into the old intimacy and again and again be  startled back by some suggestive question or some inexplicable  meaning in her eye  so they lived at cross purposes a life full  of broken dialogue challenging glances and suppressed passion  until one day he saw the woman slipping from the house in a veil  followed her to the station followed her in the train to the  seaside country and out over the sandhills to the very place where  the murder was done  there she began to grope among the bents he  watching her flat upon his face and presently she had something  in her hand  i cannot remember what it was but it was deadly  evidence against the dreamer  and as she held it up to look at it  perhaps from the shock of the discovery her foot slipped and she  hung at some peril on the brink of the tall sandwreaths  he had  no thought but to spring up and rescue her and there they stood  face to face she with that deadly matter openly in her hand  his  very presence on the spot another link of proof  it was plain she  was about to speak but this was more than he could bear  he could  bear to be lost but not to talk of it with his destroyer and he  cut her short with trivial conversation  arm in arm they returned  together to the train talking he knew not what made the journey  back in the same carriage sat down to dinner and passed the  evening in the drawingroom as in the past  but suspense and fear  drummed in the dreamers bosom  she has not denounced me yet   so his thoughts ran  when will she denounce me  will it be to morrow  and it was not tomorrow nor the next day nor the next  and their life settled back on the old terms only that she seemed  kinder than before and that as for him the burthen of his  suspense and wonder grew daily more unbearable so that he wasted  away like a man with a disease  once indeed he broke all bounds  of decency seized an occasion when she was abroad ransacked her  room and at last hidden away among her jewels found the damning  evidence  there he stood holding this thing which was his life  in the hollow of his hand and marvelling at her inconsequent  behaviour that she should seek and keep and yet not use it and  then the door opened and behold herself  so once more they  stood eye to eye with the evidence between them and once more  she raised to him a face brimming with some communication and once  more he shied away from speech and cut her off  but before he left  the room which he had turned upside down he laid back his death warrant where he had found it and at that her face lighted up   the next thing he heard she was explaining to her maid with some  ingenious falsehood the disorder of her things  flesh and blood  could bear the strain no longer and i think it was the next  morning though chronology is always hazy in the theatre of the  mind that he burst from his reserve  they had been breakfasting  together in one corner of a great parqueted sparelyfurnished  room of many windows all the time of the meal she had tortured him  with sly allusions and no sooner were the servants gone and these  two protagonists alone together than he leaped to his feet  she  too sprang up with a pale face with a pale face she heard him as  he raved out his complaint  why did she torture him so she knew  all she knew he was no enemy to her why did she not denounce him  at once what signified her whole behaviour why did she torture  him and yet again why did she torture him  and when he had done  she fell upon her knees and with outstretched hands   do you not  understand she cried  i love you  hereupon with a pang of wonder and mercantile delight the dreamer  awoke  his mercantile delight was not of long endurance for it  soon became plain that in this spirited tale there were  unmarketable elements which is just the reason why you have it  here so briefly told  but his wonder has still kept growing and i  think the readers will also if he consider it ripely  for now he  sees why i speak of the little people as of substantive inventors  and performers  to the end they had kept their secret  i will go  bail for the dreamer having excellent grounds for valuing his  candour that he had no guess whatever at the motive of the woman   the hinge of the whole wellinvented plot  until the instant of  that highly dramatic declaration  it was not his tale it was the  little peoples  and observe  not only was the secret kept the  story was told with really guileful craftsmanship  the conduct of  both actors is in the cant phrase psychologically correct and  the emotion aptly graduated up to the surprising climax  i am  awake now and i know this trade and yet i cannot better it  i am  awake and i live by this business and yet i could not outdo   could not perhaps equal  that crafty artifice as of some old  experienced carpenter of plays some dennery or sardou by which  the same situation is twice presented and the two actors twice  brought face to face over the evidence only once it is in her  hand once in his  and these in their due order the least  dramatic first  the more i think of it the more i am moved to  press upon the world my question  who are the little people  they  are near connections of the dreamers beyond doubt they share in  his financial worries and have an eye to the bankbook they share  plainly in his training they have plainly learned like him to  build the scheme of a considerate story and to arrange emotion in  progressive order only i think they have more talent and one  thing is beyond doubt they can tell him a story piece by piece  like a serial and keep him all the while in ignorance of where  they aim  who are they then and who is the dreamer  well as regards the dreamer i can answer that for he is no less  a person than myself  as i might have told you from the  beginning only that the critics murmur over my consistent egotism   and as i am positively forced to tell you now or i could advance  but little farther with my story  and for the little people what  shall i say they are but just my brownies god bless them who do  onehalf my work for me while i am fast asleep and in all human  likelihood do the rest for me as well when i am wide awake and  fondly suppose i do it for myself  that part which is done while i  am sleeping is the brownies part beyond contention but that which  is done when i am up and about is by no means necessarily mine  since all goes to show the brownies have a hand in it even then   here is a doubt that much concerns my conscience  for myself   what i call i my conscious ego the denizen of the pineal gland  unless he has changed his residence since descartes the man with  the conscience and the variable bankaccount the man with the hat  and the boots and the privilege of voting and not carrying his  candidate at the general elections  i am sometimes tempted to  suppose he is no storyteller at all but a creature as matter of  fact as any cheesemonger or any cheese and a realist bemired up to  the ears in actuality so that by that account the whole of my  published fiction should be the singlehanded product of some  brownie some familiar some unseen collaborator whom i keep  locked in a back garret while i get all the praise and he but a  share which i cannot prevent him getting of the pudding  i am an  excellent adviser something like molieres servant i pull back  and i cut down and i dress the whole in the best words and  sentences that i can find and make i hold the pen too and i do  the sitting at the table which is about the worst of it and when  all is done i make up the manuscript and pay for the registration  so that on the whole i have some claim to share though not so  largely as i do in the profits of our common enterprise  i can but give an instance or so of what part is done sleeping and  what part awake and leave the reader to share what laurels there  are at his own nod between myself and my collaborators and to do  this i will first take a book that a number of persons have been  polite enough to read the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde   i had long been trying to write a story on this subject to find a  body a vehicle for that strong sense of mans double being which  must at times come in upon and overwhelm the mind of every thinking  creature  i had even written one the travelling companion which  was returned by an editor on the plea that it was a work of genius  and indecent and which i burned the other day on the ground that  it was not a work of genius and that jekyll had supplanted it   then came one of those financial fluctuations to which with an  elegant modesty i have hitherto referred in the third person  for  two days i went about racking my brains for a plot of any sort and  on the second night i dreamed the scene at the window and a scene  afterward split in two in which hyde pursued for some crime took  the powder and underwent the change in the presence of his  pursuers  all the rest was made awake and consciously although i  think i can trace in much of it the manner of my brownies  the  meaning of the tale is therefore mine and had long preexisted in  my garden of adonis and tried one body after another in vain  indeed i do most of the morality worse luck and my brownies have  not a rudiment of what we call a conscience  mine too is the  setting mine the characters  all that was given me was the matter  of three scenes and the central idea of a voluntary change  becoming involuntary  will it be thought ungenerous after i have  been so liberally ladling out praise to my unseen collaborators if  i here toss them over bound hand and foot into the arena of the  critics  for the business of the powders which so many have  censured is i am relieved to say not mine at all but the  brownies  of another tale in case the reader should have glanced  at it i may say a word  the not very defensible story of olalla   here the court the mother the mothers niche olalla olallas  chamber the meetings on the stair the broken window the ugly  scene of the bite were all given me in bulk and detail as i have  tried to write them to this i added only the external scenery for  in my dream i never was beyond the court the portrait the  characters of felipe and the priest the moral such as it is and  the last pages such as alas they are  and i may even say that  in this case the moral itself was given me for it arose  immediately on a comparison of the mother and the daughter and  from the hideous trick of atavism in the first  sometimes a  parabolic sense is still more undeniably present in a dream  sometimes i cannot but suppose my brownies have been aping bunyan  and yet in no case with what would possibly be called a moral in a  tract never with the ethical narrowness conveying hints instead  of lifes larger limitations and that sort of sense which we seem  to perceive in the arabesque of time and space  for the most part it will be seen my brownies are somewhat  fantastic like their stories hot and hot full of passion and the  picturesque alive with animating incident and they have no  prejudice against the supernatural  but the other day they gave me  a surprise entertaining me with a lovestory a little april  comedy which i ought certainly to hand over to the author of a  chance acquaintance for he could write it as it should be written  and i am sure although i mean to try that i cannot  but who  would have supposed that a brownie of mine should invent a tale for  mr howells    chapter ix  beggars    in a pleasant airy uphill country it was my fortune when i was  young to make the acquaintance of a certain beggar  i call him  beggar though he usually allowed his coat and his shoes which  were openmouthed indeed to beg for him  he was the wreck of an  athletic man tall gaunt and bronzed far gone in consumption  with that disquieting smile of the mortally stricken on his face  but still active afoot still with the brisk military carriage the  ready military salute  three ways led through this piece of  country and as i was inconstant in my choice i believe he must  often have awaited me in vain  but often enough he caught me  often enough from some place of ambush by the roadside he would  spring suddenly forth in the regulation attitude and launching at  once into his inconsequential talk fall into step with me upon my  farther course  a fine morning sir though perhaps a trifle  inclining to rain  i hope i see you well sir  why no sir i  dont feel as hearty myself as i could wish but i am keeping about  my ordinary  i am pleased to meet you on the road sir  i assure  you i quite look forward to one of our little conversations  he  loved the sound of his own voice inordinately and though with  something too offhand to call servility he would always hasten to  agree with anything you said yet he could never suffer you to say  it to an end  by what transition he slid to his favourite subject  i have no memory but we had never been long together on the way  before he was dealing in a very military manner with the english  poets  shelley was a fine poet sir though a trifle atheistical  in his opinions  his queen mab sir is quite an atheistical work   scott sir is not so poetical a writer  with the works of  shakespeare i am not so well acquainted but he was a fine poet   keats  john keats sir  he was a very fine poet  with such  references such trivial criticism such loving parade of his own  knowledge he would beguile the road striding forward uphill his  staff now clapped to the ribs of his deep resonant chest now  swinging in the air with the remembered jauntiness of the private  soldier and all the while his toes looking out of his boots and  his shirt looking out of his elbows and death looking out of his  smile and his big crazy frame shaken by accesses of cough  he would often go the whole way home with me  often to borrow a  book and that book always a poet  off he would march to continue  his mendicant rounds with the volume slipped into the pocket of  his ragged coat and although he would sometimes keep it quite a  while yet it came always back again at last not much the worse  for its travels into beggardom  and in this way doubtless his  knowledge grew and his glib random criticism took a wider range   but my library was not the first he had drawn upon  at our first  encounter he was already brimful of shelley and the atheistical  queen mab and keats  john keats sir  and i have often  wondered how he came by these acquirements just as i often  wondered how he fell to be a beggar  he had served through the  mutiny  of which like so many people he could tell practically  nothing beyond the names of places and that it was difficult  work sir and very hot or that soandso was a very fine  commander sir  he was far too smart a man to have remained a  private in the nature of things he must have won his stripes   and yet here he was without a pension  when i touched on this  problem he would content himself with diffidently offering me  advice  a man should be very careful when he is young sir  if  youll excuse me saying so a spirited young gentleman like  yourself sir should be very careful  i was perhaps a trifle  inclined to atheistical opinions myself  for perhaps with a  deeper wisdom than we are inclined in these days to admit he  plainly bracketed agnosticism with beer and skittles  keats  john keats sir  and shelley were his favourite bards  i  cannot remember if i tried him with rossetti but i know his taste  to a hair and if ever i did he must have doted on that author   what took him was a richness in the speech he loved the exotic  the unexpected word the moving cadence of a phrase a vague sense  of emotion about nothing in the very letters of the alphabet   the romance of language  his honest head was very nearly empty  his intellect like a childs and when he read his favourite  authors he can almost never have understood what he was reading   yet the taste was not only genuine it was exclusive i tried in  vain to offer him novels he would none of them he cared for  nothing but romantic language that he could not understand  the  case may be commoner than we suppose  i am reminded of a lad who  was laid in the next cot to a friend of mine in a public hospital  and who was no sooner installed than he sent out perhaps with his  last pence for a cheap shakespeare  my friend pricked up his  ears fell at once in talk with his new neighbour and was ready  when the book arrived to make a singular discovery  for this  lover of great literature understood not one sentence out of  twelve and his favourite part was that of which he understood the  least  the inimitable mouthfilling rodomontade of the ghost in  hamlet  it was a bright day in hospital when my friend expounded  the sense of this beloved jargon  a task for which i am willing to  believe my friend was very fit though i can never regard it as an  easy one  i know indeed a point or two on which i would gladly  question mr shakespeare that lover of big words could he revisit  the glimpses of the moon or could i myself climb backward to the  spacious days of elizabeth  but in the second case i should most  likely pretermit these questionings and take my place instead in  the pit at the blackfriars to hear the actor in his favourite  part playing up to mr burbage and rolling out  as i seem to  hear him  with a ponderous gusto  unhouseld disappointed unaneld  what a pleasant chance if we could go there in a party i and what  a surprise for mr burbage when the ghost received the honours of  the evening  as for my old soldier like mr burbage and mr shakespeare he is  long since dead and now lies buried i suppose and nameless and  quite forgotten in some poor city graveyard  but not for me you  brave heart have you been buried  for me you are still afoot  tasting the sun and air and striding southward  by the groves of  comiston and beside the hermitage of braid by the hunters tryst  and where the curlews and plovers cry around fairmilehead i see  and hear you stalwartly carrying your deadly sickness cheerfully  discoursing of uncomprehended poets   ii   the thought of the old soldier recalls that of another tramp his  counterpart  this was a little lean and fiery man with the eyes  of a dog and the face of a gipsy whom i found one morning encamped  with his wife and children and his grinders wheel beside the burn  of kinnaird  to this beloved dell i went at that time daily and  daily the knifegrinder and i for as long as his tent continued  pleasantly to interrupt my little wilderness sat on two stones  and smoked and plucked grass and talked to the tune of the brown  water  his children were mere whelps they fought and bit among  the fern like vermin  his wife was a mere squaw i saw her gather  brush and tend the kettle but she never ventured to address her  lord while i was present  the tent was a mere gipsy hovel like a  sty for pigs  but the grinder himself had the fine self sufficiency and grave politeness of the hunter and the savage he  did me the honours of this dell which had been mine but the day  before took me far into the secrets of his life and used me i am  proud to remember as a friend  like my old soldier he was far gone in the national complaint   unlike him he had a vulgar taste in letters scarce flying higher  than the story papers probably finding no difference certainly  seeking none between tannahill and burns his noblest thoughts  whether of poetry or music adequately embodied in that somewhat  obvious ditty  will ye gang lassie gang to the braes o balquidder   which is indeed apt to echo in the ears of scottish children and  to him in view of his experience must have found a special  directness of address  but if he had no fine sense of poetry in  letters he felt with a deep joy the poetry of life  you should  have heard him speak of what he loved of the tent pitched beside  the talking water of the stars overhead at night of the blest  return of morning the peep of day over the moors the awaking  birds among the birches how he abhorred the long winter shut in  cities and with what delight at the return of the spring he once  more pitched his camp in the living outofdoors  but we were a  pair of tramps and to you who are doubtless sedentary and a  consistent firstclass passenger in life he would scarce have laid  himself so open  to you he might have been content to tell his  story of a ghost  that of a buccaneer with his pistols as he lived   whom he had once encountered in a seaside cave near buckie and  that would have been enough for that would have shown you the  mettle of the man  here was a piece of experience solidly and  livingly built up in words here was a story created teres atque  rotundus  and to think of the old soldier that lover of the literary bards   he had visited stranger spots than any seaside cave encountered  men more terrible than any spirit done and dared and suffered in  that incredible unsung epic of the mutiny war played his part  with the field force of delhi beleaguering and beleaguered shared  in that enduring savage anger and contempt of death and decency  that for long months together bedevild and inspired the army  was hurled to and fro in the battlesmoke of the assault was  there perhaps where nicholson fell was there when the attacking  column with hell upon every side found the soldiers enemy   strong drink and the lives of tens of thousands trembled in the  scale and the fate of the flag of england staggered  and of all  this he had no more to say than hot work sir or the army  suffered a great deal sir or i believe general wilson sir was  not very highly thought of in the papers  his life was naught to  him the vivid pages of experience quite blank  in words his  pleasure lay  melodious agitated words  printed words about  that which he had never seen and was connatally incapable of  comprehending  we have here two temperaments face to face both  untrained unsophisticated surprised we may say in the egg both  boldly charactered   that of the artist the lover and artificer  of words that of the maker the seeer the lover and forger of  experience  if the one had a daughter and the other had a son and  these married might not some illustrious writer count descent from  the beggarsoldier and the needy knifegrinder   iii   every one lives by selling something whatever be his right to it   the burglar sells at the same time his own skill and courage and my  silver plate the whole at the most moderate figure to a jew  receiver  the bandit sells the traveller an article of prime  necessity  that travellers life  and as for the old soldier who  stands for central mark to my capricious figures of eight he dealt  in a specially for he was the only beggar in the world who ever  gave me pleasure for my money  he had learned a school of manners  in the barracks and had the sense to cling to it accosting  strangers with a regimental freedom thanking patrons with a merely  regimental difference sparing you at once the tragedy of his  position and the embarrassment of yours  there was not one hint  about him of the beggars emphasis the outburst of revolting  gratitude the rant and cant the god bless you kind kind  gentleman which insults the smallness of your alms by  disproportionate vehemence which is so notably false which would  be so unbearable if it were true  i am sometimes tempted to  suppose this reading of the beggars part a survival of the old  days when shakespeare was intoned upon the stage and mourners  keened beside the deathbed to think that we cannot now accept  these strong emotions unless they be uttered in the just note of  life nor save in the pulpit endure these gross conventions   they wound us i am tempted to say like mockery the high voice of  keening as it yet lingers on strikes in the face of sorrow like a  buffet and the rant and cant of the staled beggar stirs in us a  shudder of disgust  but the fact disproves these amateur opinions   the beggar lives by his knowledge of the average man  he knows  what he is about when he bandages his head and hires and drugs a  babe and poisons life with poor mary ann or long long ago he  knows what he is about when he loads the critical ear and sickens  the nice conscience with intolerable thanks they know what they  are about he and his crew when they pervade the slums of cities  ghastly parodies of suffering hateful parodies of gratitude  this  trade can scarce be called an imposition it has been so blown upon  with exposures it flaunts its fraudulence so nakedly  we pay them  as we pay those who show us in huge exaggeration the monsters of  our drinkingwater or those who daily predict the fall of britain   we pay them for the pain they inflict pay them and wince and  hurry on  and truly there is nothing that can shake the conscience  like a beggars thanks and that polity in which such protestations  can be purchased for a shilling seems no scene for an honest man  are there then we may be asked no genuine beggars  and the  answer is not one  my old soldier was a humbug like the rest his  ragged boots were in the stage phrase properties whole boots  were given him again and again and always gladly accepted and the  next day there he was on the road as usual with toes exposed   his boots were his method they were the mans trade without his  boots he would have starved he did not live by charity but by  appealing to a gross taste in the public which loves the limelight  on the actors face and the toes out of the beggars boots  there  is a true poverty which no one sees  a false and merely mimetic  poverty which usurps its place and dress and lives and above all  drinks on the fruits of the usurpation  the true poverty does not  go into the streets the banker may rest assured he has never put  a penny in its hand  the selfrespecting poor beg from each other  never from the rich  to live in the frockcoated ranks of life to  hear canting scenes of gratitude rehearsed for twopence a man  might suppose that giving was a thing gone out of fashion yet it  goes forward on a scale so great as to fill me with surprise  in  the houses of the working class all day long there will be a foot  upon the stair all day long there will be a knocking at the doors  beggars come beggars go without stint hardly with intermission  from morning till night and meanwhile in the same city and but a  few streets off the castles of the rich stand unsummoned  get the  tale of any honest tramp you will find it was always the poor who  helped him get the truth from any workman who has met misfortunes  it was always next door that he would go for help or only with  such exceptions as are said to prove a rule look at the course of  the mimetic beggar it is through the poor quarters that he trails  his passage showing his bandages to every window piercing even to  the attics with his nasal song  here is a remarkable state of  things in our christian commonwealths that the poor only should be  asked to give   iv   there is a pleasant tale of some worthless phrasing frenchman who  was taxed with ingratitude  il faut savoir garder lindependance  du coeur cried he  i own i feel with him  gratitude without  familarity gratitude otherwise than as a nameless element in a  friendship is a thing so near to hatred that i do not care to  split the difference  until i find a man who is pleased to receive  obligations i shall continue to question the tact of those who are  eager to confer them  what an art it is to give even to our  nearest friends and what a test of manners to receive  how upon  either side we smuggle away the obligation blushing for each  other how bluff and dull we make the giver how hasty how falsely  cheerful the receiver  and yet an act of such difficulty and  distress between near friends it is supposed we can perform to a  total stranger and leave the man transfixed with grateful emotions   the last thing you can do to a man is to burthen him with an  obligation and it is what we propose to begin with  but let us  not be deceived  unless he is totally degraded to his trade anger  jars in his inside and he grates his teeth at our gratuity  we should wipe two words from our vocabulary  gratitude and  charity  in real life help is given out of friendship or it is  not valued it is received from the hand of friendship or it is  resented  we are all too proud to take a naked gift  we must seem  to pay it if in nothing else then with the delights of our  society  here then is the pitiful fix of the rich man here is  that needles eye in which he stuck already in the days of christ  and still sticks today firmer if possible than ever  that he  has the money and lacks the love which should make his money  acceptable  here and now just as of old in palestine he has the  rich to dinner it is with the rich that he takes his pleasure   and when his turn comes to be charitable he looks in vain for a  recipient  his friends are not poor they do not want the poor  are not his friends they will not take  to whom is he to give   where to find  note this phase  the deserving poor  charity is  what they call centralised offices are hired societies founded  with secretaries paid or unpaid  the hunt of the deserving poor  goes merrily forward  i think it will take more than a merely  human secretary to disinter that character  what a class that is  to be in want from no fault of its own and yet greedily eager to  receive from strangers and to be quite respectable and at the  same time quite devoid of selfrespect and play the most delicate  part of friendship and yet never be seen and wear the form of  man and yet fly in the face of all the laws of human nature    and all this in the hope of getting a bellygod burgess through a  needles eye  o let him stick by all means  and let his polity  tumble in the dust and let his epitaph and all his literature of  which my own works begin to form no inconsiderable part be  abolished even from the history of man  for a fool of this  monstrosity of dulness there can be no salvation  and the fool  who looked for the elixir of life was an angel of reason to the  fool who looks for the deserving poor   v   and yet there is one course which the unfortunate gentleman may  take  he may subscribe to pay the taxes  there were the true  charity impartial and impersonal cumbering none with obligation  helping all  there were a destination for loveless gifts there  were the way to reach the pocket of the deserving poor and yet  save the time of secretaries  but alas there is no colour of  romance in such a course and people nowhere demand the picturesque  so much as in their virtues    chapter x  letter to a young gentleman who proposes to embrace the  career of art    with the agreeable frankness of youth you address me on a point of  some practical importance to yourself and it is even conceivable  of some gravity to the world  should you or should you not become  an artist  it is one which you must decide entirely for yourself  all that i can do is to bring under your notice some of the  materials of that decision and i will begin as i shall probably  conclude also by assuring you that all depends on the vocation  to know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age   youth is wholly experimental  the essence and charm of that  unquiet and delightful epoch is ignorance of self as well as  ignorance of life  these two unknowns the young man brings  together again and again now in the airiest touch now with a  bitter hug now with exquisite pleasure now with cutting pain but  never with indifference to which he is a total stranger and never  with that near kinsman of indifference contentment  if he be a  youth of dainty senses or a brain easily heated the interest of  this series of experiments grows upon him out of all proportion to  the pleasure he receives  it is not beauty that he loves nor  pleasure that he seeks though he may think so his design and his  sufficient reward is to verify his own existence and taste the  variety of human fate  to him before the razoredge of curiosity  is dulled all that is not actual living and the hot chase of  experience wears a face of a disgusting dryness difficult to recall  in later days or if there be any exception  and here destiny  steps in  it is in those moments when wearied or surfeited of the  primary activity of the senses he calls up before memory the image  of transacted pains and pleasures  thus it is that such an one  shies from all cutanddry professions and inclines insensibly  toward that career of art which consists only in the tasting and  recording of experience  this which is not so much a vocation for art as an impatience of  all other honest trades frequently exists alone and so existing  it will pass gently away in the course of years  emphatically it  is not to be regarded it is not a vocation but a temptation and  when your father the other day so fiercely and in my view so  properly discouraged your ambition he was recalling not improbably  some similar passage in his own experience  for the temptation is  perhaps nearly as common as the vocation is rare  but again we  have vocations which are imperfect we have men whose minds are  bound up not so much in any art as in the general ars artium and  common base of all creative work who will now dip into painting  and now study counterpoint and anon will be inditing a sonnet   all these with equal interest all often with genuine knowledge   and of this temper when it stands alone i find it difficult to  speak but i should counsel such an one to take to letters for in  literature which drags with so wide a net all his information may  be found some day useful and if he should go on as he has begun  and turn at last into the critic he will have learned to use the  necessary tools  lastly we come to those vocations which are at  once decisive and precise to the men who are born with the love of  pigments the passion of drawing the gift of music or the impulse  to create with words just as other and perhaps the same men are  born with the love of hunting or the sea or horses or the  turninglathe  these are predestined if a man love the labour of  any trade apart from any question of success or fame the gods  have called him  he may have the general vocation too  he may  have a taste for all the arts and i think he often has but the  mark of his calling is this laborious partiality for one this  inextinguishable zest in its technical successes and perhaps  above all a certain candour of mind to take his very trifling  enterprise with a gravity that would befit the cares of empire and  to think the smallest improvement worth accomplishing at any  expense of time and industry  the book the statue the sonata  must be gone upon with the unreasoning good faith and the  unflagging spirit of children at their play  is it worth doing   when it shall have occurred to any artist to ask himself that  question it is implicitly answered in the negative  it does not  occur to the child as he plays at being a pirate on the diningroom  sofa nor to the hunter as he pursues his quarry and the candour  of the one and the ardour of the other should be united in the  bosom of the artist  if you recognise in yourself some such decisive taste there is no  room for hesitation  follow your bent  and observe lest i should  too much discourage you that the disposition does not usually burn  so brightly at the first or rather not so constantly  habit and  practice sharpen gifts the necessity of toil grows less  disgusting grows even welcome in the course of years a small  taste if it be only genuine waxes with indulgence into an  exclusive passion  enough just now if you can look back over a  fair interval and see that your chosen art has a little more than  held its own among the thronging interests of youth  time will do  the rest if devotion help it and soon your every thought will be  engrossed in that beloved occupation  but even with devotion you may remind me even with unfaltering  and delighted industry many thousand artists spend their lives if  the result be regarded utterly in vain  a thousand artists and  never one work of art  but the vast mass of mankind are incapable  of doing anything reasonably well art among the rest  the  worthless artist would not improbably have been a quite incompetent  baker  and the artist even if he does not amuse the public  amuses himself so that there will always be one man the happier  for his vigils  this is the practical side of art  its  inexpugnable fortress for the true practitioner  the direct  returns  the wages of the trade are small but the indirect  the  wages of the life  are incalculably great  no other business  offers a man his daily bread upon such joyful terms  the soldier  and the explorer have moments of a worthier excitement but they  are purchased by cruel hardships and periods of tedium that beggar  language  in the life of the artist there need be no hour without  its pleasure  i take the author with whose career i am best  acquainted and it is true he works in a rebellious material and  that the act of writing is cramped and trying both to the eyes and  the temper but remark him in his study when matter crowds upon  him and words are not wanting  in what a continual series of small  successes time flows by with what a sense of power as of one  moving mountains he marshals his petty characters with what  pleasures both of the ear and eye he sees his airy structure  growing on the page and how he labours in a craft to which the  whole material of his life is tributary and which opens a door to  all his tastes his loves his hatreds and his convictions so  that what he writes is only what he longed to utter  he may have  enjoyed many things in this big tragic playground of the world  but what shall he have enjoyed more fully than a morning of  successful work  suppose it ill paid  the wonder is it should be  paid at all  other men pay and pay dearly for pleasures less  desirable  nor will the practice of art afford you pleasure only it affords  besides an admirable training  for the artist works entirely upon  honour  the public knows little or nothing of those merits in the  quest of which you are condemned to spend the bulk of your  endeavours  merits of design the merit of firsthand energy the  merit of a certain cheap accomplishment which a man of the artistic  temper easily acquires  these they can recognise and these they  value  but to those more exquisite refinements of proficiency and  finish which the artist so ardently desires and so keenly feels  for which in the vigorous words of balzac he must toil like a  miner buried in a landslip for which day after day he recasts  and revises and rejects  the gross mass of the public must be ever  blind  to those lost pains suppose you attain the highest pitch  of merit posterity may possibly do justice suppose as is so  probable you fall by even a hairs breadth of the highest rest  certain they shall never be observed  under the shadow of this  cold thought alone in his studio the artist must preserve from  day to day his constancy to the ideal  it is this which makes his  life noble it is by this that the practice of his craft  strengthens and matures his character it is for this that even the  serious countenance of the great emperor was turned approvingly if  only for a moment on the followers of apollo and that sternly  gentle voice bade the artist cherish his art  and here there fall two warnings to be made  first if you are to  continue to be a law to yourself you must beware of the first  signs of laziness  this idealism in honesty can only be supported  by perpetual effort the standard is easily lowered the artist who  says it will do is on the downward path three or four pot boilers are enough at times above all at wrong times to falsify a  talent and by the practice of journalism a man runs the risk of  becoming wedded to cheap finish  this is the danger on the one  side there is not less upon the other  the consciousness of how  much the artist is and must be a law to himself debauches the  small heads  perceiving recondite merits very hard to attain  making or swallowing artistic formulae or perhaps falling in love  with some particular proficiency of his own many artists forget  the end of all art  to please  it is doubtless tempting to  exclaim against the ignorant bourgeois yet it should not be  forgotten it is he who is to pay us and that surely on the face  of it for services that he shall desire to have performed  here  also if properly considered there is a question of transcendental  honesty  to give the public what they do not want and yet expect  to be supported  we have there a strange pretension and yet not  uncommon above all with painters  the first duty in this world is  for a man to pay his way when that is quite accomplished he may  plunge into what eccentricity he likes but emphatically not till  then  till then he must pay assiduous court to the bourgeois who  carries the purse  and if in the course of these capitulations he  shall falsify his talent it can never have been a strong one and  he will have preserved a better thing than talent  character  or  if he be of a mind so independent that he cannot stoop to this  necessity one course is yet open  he can desist from art and  follow some more manly way of life  i speak of a more manly way of life it is a point on which i must  be frank  to live by a pleasure is not a high calling it involves  patronage however veiled it numbers the artist however  ambitious along with dancing girls and billiard markers  the  french have a romantic evasion for one employment and call its  practitioners the daughters of joy  the artist is of the same  family he is of the sons of joy chose his trade to please  himself gains his livelihood by pleasing others and has parted  with something of the sterner dignity of man  journals but a  little while ago declaimed against the tennyson peerage and this  son of joy was blamed for condescension when he followed the  example of lord lawrence and lord cairns and lord clyde  the poet  was more happily inspired with a better modesty he accepted the  honour and anonymous journalists have not yet if i am to believe  them recovered the vicarious disgrace to their profession  when  it comes to their turn these gentlemen can do themselves more  justice and i shall be glad to think of it for to my barbarian  eyesight even lord tennyson looks somewhat out of place in that  assembly  there should be no honours for the artist he has  already in the practice of his art more than his share of the  rewards of life the honours are preempted for other trades less  agreeable and perhaps more useful  but the devil in these trades of pleasing is to fail to please  in  ordinary occupations a man offers to do a certain thing or to  produce a certain article with a merely conventional  accomplishment a design in which we may almost say it is  difficult to fail  but the artist steps forth out of the crowd and  proposes to delight  an impudent design in which it is impossible  to fail without odious circumstances  the poor daughter of joy  carrying her smiles and finery quite unregarded through the crowd  makes a figure which it is impossible to recall without a wounding  pity  she is the type of the unsuccessful artist  the actor the  dancer and the singer must appear like her in person and drain  publicly the cup of failure  but though the rest of us escape this  crowning bitterness of the pillory we all court in essence the  same humiliation  we all profess to be able to delight  and how  few of us are  we all pledge ourselves to be able to continue to  delight  and the day will come to each and even to the most  admired when the ardour shall have declined and the cunning shall  be lost and he shall sit by his deserted booth ashamed  then  shall he see himself condemned to do work for which he blushes to  take payment  then as if his lot were not already cruel he must  lie exposed to the gibes of the wreckers of the press who earn a  little bitter bread by the condemnation of trash which they have  not read and the praise of excellence which they cannot  understand  and observe that this seems almost the necessary end at least of  writers  les blancs et les bleus for instance is of an order of  merit very different from le vicomte de braglonne and if any  gentleman can bear to spy upon the nakedness of castle dangerous  his name i think is ham  let it be enough for the rest of us to  read of it not without tears in the pages of lockhart  thus in  old age when occupation and comfort are most needful the writer  must lay aside at once his pastime and his breadwinner  the  painter indeed if he succeed at all in engaging the attention of  the public gains great sums and can stand to his easel until a  great age without dishonourable failure  the writer has the double  misfortune to be illpaid while he can work and to be incapable of  working when he is old  it is thus a way of life which conducts  directly to a false position  for the writer in spite of notorious examples to the contrary  must look to be illpaid  tennyson and montepin make handsome  livelihoods but we cannot all hope to be tennyson and we do not  all perhaps desire to be montepin  if you adopt an art to be your  trade weed your mind at the outset of all desire of money  what  you may decently expect if you have some talent and much industry  is such an income as a clerk will earn with a tenth or perhaps a  twentieth of your nervous output  nor have you the right to look  for more in the wages of the life not in the wages of the trade  lies your reward the work is here the wages  it will be seen i  have little sympathy with the common lamentations of the artist  class  perhaps they do not remember the hire of the field  labourer or do they think no parallel will lie  perhaps they have  never observed what is the retiring allowance of a field officer  or do they suppose their contributions to the arts of pleasing more  important than the services of a colonel  perhaps they forget on  how little millet was content to live or do they think because  they have less genius they stand excused from the display of equal  virtues  but upon one point there should be no dubiety  if a man  be not frugal he has no business in the arts  if he be not  frugal he steers directly for that last tragic scene of le vieux  saltimbanque if he be not frugal he will find it hard to continue  to be honest  some day when the butcher is knocking at the door  he may be tempted he may be obliged to turn out and sell a  slovenly piece of work  if the obligation shall have arisen  through no wantonness of his own he is even to be commanded for  words cannot describe how far more necessary it is that a man  should support his family than that he should attain to  or  preserve  distinction in the arts  but if the pressure comes  through his own fault he has stolen and stolen under trust and  stolen which is the worst of all in such a way that no law can  reach him  and now you may perhaps ask me if the debutant artist is to have  no thought of money and if as is implied he is to expect no  honours from the state he may not at least look forward to the  delights of popularity  praise you will tell me is a savoury  dish  and in so far as you may mean the countenance of other  artists you would put your finger on one of the most essential and  enduring pleasures of the career of art  but in so far as you  should have an eye to the commendations of the public or the notice  of the newspapers be sure you would but be cherishing a dream  it  is true that in certain esoteric journals the author for instance  is duly criticised and that he is often praised a great deal more  than he deserves sometimes for qualities which he prided himself  on eschewing and sometimes by ladies and gentlemen who have denied  themselves the privilege of reading his work  but if a man be  sensitive to this wild praise we must suppose him equally alive to  that which often accompanies and always follows it  wild ridicule   a man may have done well for years and then he may fail he will  hear of his failure  or he may have done well for years and still  do well but the critics may have tired of praising him or there  may have sprung up some new idol of the instant some dust a  little gilt to whom they now prefer to offer sacrifice  here is  the obverse and the reverse of that empty and ugly thing called  popularity  will any man suppose it worth the gaining    chapter xi  pulvis et umbra    we look for some reward of our endeavours and are disappointed not  success not happiness not even peace of conscience crowns our  ineffectual efforts to do well  our frailties are invincible our  virtues barren the battle goes sore against us to the going down  of the sun  the canting moralist tells us of right and wrong and  we look abroad even on the face of our small earth and find them  change with every climate and no country where some action is not  honoured for a virtue and none where it is not branded for a vice  and we look in our experience and find no vital congruity in the  wisest rules but at the best a municipal fitness  it is not  strange if we are tempted to despair of good  we ask too much   our religions and moralities have been trimmed to flatter us till  they are all emasculate and sentimentalised and only please and  weaken  truth is of a rougher strain  in the harsh face

symbols and ratios   symbols and ratios carry us and bring us forth and beat us down  gravity that swings the incommensurable suns and worlds through  space is but a figment varying inversely as the squares of  distances and the suns and worlds themselves imponderable figures  of abstraction nh3 and h2o  consideration dares not dwell upon  this view that way madness lies science carries us into zones of  speculation where there is no habitable city for the mind of man  but take the kosmos with a grosser faith as our senses give it us   we behold space sown with rotatory islands suns and worlds and the  shards and wrecks of systems  some like the sun still blazing  some rotting like the earth others like the moon stable in  desolation  all of these we take to be made of something we call  matter  a thing which no analysis can help us to conceive to  whose incredible properties no familiarity can reconcile our minds   this stuff when not purified by the lustration of fire rots  uncleanly into something we call life seized through all its atoms  with a pediculous malady swelling in tumours that become  independent sometimes even by an abhorrent prodigy locomotory  one splitting into millions millions cohering into one as the  malady proceeds through varying stages  this vital putrescence of  the dust used as we are to it yet strikes us with occasional  disgust and the profusion of worms in a piece of ancient turf or  the air of a marsh darkened with insects will sometimes check our  breathing so that we aspire for cleaner places  but none is clean   the moving

miles away   ii   what a monstrous spectre is this man the disease of the  agglutinated dust lifting alternate feet or lying drugged with  slumber killing feeding growing bringing forth small copies of  himself grown upon with hair like grass fitted with eyes that  move and glitter in his face a thing to set children screaming   and yet looked at nearlier known as his fellows know him how  surprising are his attributes  poor soul here for so little cast  among so many hardships filled with desires so incommensurate and  so inconsistent savagely surrounded savagely descended  irremediably condemned to prey upon his fellow lives  who should  have blamed him had he been of a piece with his destiny and a being  merely barbarous  and we look and behold him instead filled with  imperfect virtues  infinitely childish often admirably valiant  often touchingly kind sitting down amidst his momentary life to  debate of right and wrong and the attributes of the deity rising  up to do battle for an egg or die for an idea singling out his  friends and his mate with cordial affection bringing forth in  pain rearing with longsuffering solicitude his young  to touch  the heart of his mystery we find in him one thought strange to  the point of lunacy  the thought of duty the thought of something  owing to himself to his neighbour to his god  an ideal of  decency to which he would rise if it were possible a limit of  shame below which if it be possible he will not stoop  the  design in most men is one of conformity here and there in picked  natures it transcends itself and soars on the other side arming  martyrs with independence but in all in their degrees it is a  bosom thought   not in man alone for we trace it in dogs and  cats whom we know fairly well and doubtless some similar point of  honour sways the elephant the oyster and the louse of whom we  know so little   but in man at least it sways with so complete  an empire that merely selfish things come second even with the  selfish  that appetites are starved fears are conquered pains  supported that almost the dullest shrinks from the reproof of a  glance although it were a childs and all but

perverted  practice they think they are to be rewarded in some future life   stranger still if they are persuaded of the contrary and think  this blow which they solicit will strike them senseless for  eternity  i shall be reminded what a tragedy of misconception and  misconduct man at large presents  of organised injustice cowardly  violence and treacherous crime and of the damning imperfections of  the best  they cannot be too darkly drawn  man is indeed marked  for failure in his efforts to do right  but where the best  consistently miscarry how tenfold more remarkable that all should  continue to strive and surely we should find it both touching and  inspiriting that in a field from which success is banished our  race should not cease to labour  if the first view of this creature stalking in his rotatory isle  be a thing to shake the courage of the stoutest on this nearer  sight he startles us with an admiring wonder  it matters not  where we look under what climate we observe him in what stage of  society in what depth of ignorance burthened with what erroneous  morality by campfires in assiniboia the snow powdering his  shoulders the wind plucking his blanket as he sits passing the  ceremonial calumet and uttering his grave opinions like a roman  senator in ships at sea a man inured to hardship and vile  pleasures his brightest hope a fiddle in a tavern and a bedizened  trull who sells herself to rob him and he for all that simple  innocent cheerful kindly like a child constant to toil brave to  drown for others in the slums of cities moving among indifferent  millions to mechanical employments without hope of change in the  future with scarce a pleasure in the present and yet true to his  virtues honest up to his lights kind to his neighbours

her  child in the sacred river in the brothel the discard of society  living mainly on strong drink fed with affronts a fool a thief  the comrade of thieves and even here keeping the point of honour  and the touch of pity often repaying the worlds scorn with  service often standing firm upon a scruple and at a certain cost  rejecting riches   everywhere some virtue cherished or affected

stage of history under every abuse of error under every  circumstance of failure without hope without help without  thanks still obscurely fighting the lost fight of virtue still  clinging in the brothel or on the scaffold to some rag of honour  the poor jewel of their souls  they may seek to escape and yet  they cannot it is not alone their privilege and glory but their  doom they are condemned to some nobility all their lives long  the desire of good is at their heels the implacable hunter  of all earths meteors here at least is the most strange and  consoling  that this ennobled lemur this haircrowned bubble of  the dust this inheritor of a few years and sorrows should yet  deny himself his rare delights and add to his frequent pains and  live for an ideal however misconceived  nor can we stop with man   a new doctrine received with screams a little while ago by canting  moralists and still not properly worked into the body of our  thoughts lights us a step farther into the heart of this rough but  noble universe  for nowadays the pride of man denies in vain his  kinship with the original dust  he stands no longer like a thing  apart  close at his heels we see the dog prince of another genus   and in him too we see dumbly testified the same cultus of an  unattainable ideal the same constancy in failure  does it stop  with the dog  we look at our feet where the ground is blackened  with the swarming ant  a creature so small so far from us in the  hierarchy of brutes that we can scarce trace and scarce comprehend  his doings and here also in his ordered politics and rigorous  justice we see confessed the law of duty and the fact of  individual sin  does it stop then with the ant  rather this  desire of welldoing and this doom of frailty run through all the  grades of life  rather is this earth from the frosty top of  everest to the next margin of the internal fire one stage of  ineffectual virtues and one temple of pious tears and perseverance   the whole creation groaneth and travaileth together  it is the  common and the godlike law of life  the browsers the biters the  barkers the hairy coats of field and forest the squirrel in the  oak the thousandfooted creeper in the dust as they share with us  the gift of life share with us the love of an ideal  strive like  us  like us are tempted to grow weary of the struggle  to do  well like us receive at times unmerited refreshment visitings of  support returns of courage and are condemned like us to be  crucified between that double law of the members and the will  are  they like us i wonder in the timid hope of some reward some  sugar with the drug do they too stand aghast at unrewarded  virtues at the sufferings of those whom in our partiality we  take to be just and the prosperity of such as in our blindness  we call wicked  it may be and yet god knows what they should look  for  even while they look even while they repent the foot of man  treads them by thousands in the dust the yelping hounds burst upon  their trail the bullet speeds the knives are heating in the den  of the vivisectionist or the dew falls and the generation of a  day is blotted out

probable that nearly all who think of conduct at  all think of it too much it is certain we all think too much of  sin  we are not damned for doing wrong but for not doing right  christ would never hear of negative morality thou shalt was ever  his word with which he superseded thou shalt not  to make our  idea of morality centre on forbidden acts is to defile the  imagination and to introduce into our judgments of our fellowmen a  secret element of gusto  if a thing is wrong for us we should not  dwell upon the thought of it or we shall soon dwell upon it with  inverted pleasure  if we cannot drive it from our minds  one  thing of two  either our creed is in the wrong and we must more  indulgently remodel it or else if our morality be in the right  we are criminal lunatics and should place our persons in restraint   a mark of such unwholesomely divided minds is the passion for  interference with others  the fox without the tail was of this  breed but had if his biographer is to be trusted a certain  antique civility now out of date  a man may have a flaw a  weakness that unfits him for the duties of life that spoils his  temper that threatens his integrity or that betrays him into  cruelty  it has to be conquered but it must never he suffered to  engross his thoughts  the true duties lie all upon the farther  side and must be attended to with a whole mind so soon as this  preliminary clearing of the decks has been effected  in order that  he may be kind and honest it may be needful he should become a  total abstainer let him become so then and the next day let him  forget the circumstance  trying to be kind and honest will require  all his thoughts a mortified appetite is never a wise companion  in so far as he has had to mortify an appetite he will still be  the worse man and of such an one a great deal of cheerfulness will  be required in judging life and a great deal of humility in  judging others  it may be argued again that dissatisfaction with our lifes  endeavour springs in some degree from dulness  we require higher  tasks because we do not recognise the height of those we have   trying to be kind and honest seems an affair too simple and too  inconsequential for gentlemen of our heroic mould we had rather  set ourselves to something bold arduous and conclusive we had  rather found a schism or suppress a heresy cut off a hand or  mortify an appetite  but the task before us which is to coendure  with our existence is rather one of microscopic fineness and the  heroism required is that of patience  there is no cutting of the  gordian knots of life each must be smilingly unravelled  to be honest to be kind  to earn a little and to spend a little  less to make upon the whole a family happier for his presence to  renounce when that shall be necessary and not be embittered to  keep a few friends but these without capitulation  above all on  the same grim condition to keep friends with himself  here is a  task for all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy  he has an  ambitious soul who would ask more he has a hopeful spirit who  should look in such an enterprise to be successful  there is  indeed one element in human destiny that not blindness itself can  controvert  whatever else we are intended to do we are not  intended to succeed failure is the fate allotted  it is so in  every art and study it is so above all in the continent art of  living well  here is a pleasant thought for the years end or for  the end of life  only selfdeception will be satisfied and there  need be no despair for the despairer   ii   but christmas is not only the milemark of another year moving us  to thoughts of selfexamination  it is a season from all its  associations whether domestic or religious suggesting thoughts of  joy  a man dissatisfied with his endeavours is a man tempted to  sadness  and in the midst of the winter when his life runs lowest  and he is reminded of the empty chairs of his beloved it is well  he should be condemned to this fashion of the smiling face  noble  disappointment noble selfdenial are not to be admired not even  to be pardoned if they bring bitterness  it is one thing to enter  the kingdom of heaven maim another to maim yourself and stay  without  and the kingdom of heaven is of the childlike of those  who are easy to please who love and who give pleasure  mighty men  of their hands the smiters and the builders and the judges have  lived long and done sternly and yet preserved this lovely  character and among our carpet interests and twopenny concerns  the shame were indelible if we should lose it  gentleness and  cheerfulness these come before all morality they are the perfect  duties  and it is the trouble with moral men that they have  neither one nor other  it was the moral man the pharisee whom  christ could not away with  if your morals make you dreary depend  upon it they are wrong  i do not say give them up for they may  be all you have but conceal them like a vice lest they should  spoil the lives of better and simpler people  a strange temptation attends upon man  to keep his eye on  pleasures even when he will not share in them to aim all his  morals against them  this very year a lady singular iconoclast  proclaimed a crusade against dolls and the racy sermon against  lust is a feature of the age  i venture to call such moralists  insincere  at any excess or perversion of a natural appetite  their lyre sounds of itself with relishing denunciations but for  all displays of the truly diabolic  envy malice the mean lie  the mean silence the calumnious truth the backbiter the petty  tyrant the peevish poisoner of family life  their standard is  quite different  these are wrong they will admit yet somehow not  so wrong there is no zeal in their assault on them no secret  element of gusto warms up the sermon it is for things not wrong in  themselves that they reserve the choicest of their indignation  a  man may naturally disclaim all moral kinship with the reverend mr  zola or the hobgoblin old lady of the dolls for these are gross  and naked instances  and yet in each of us some similar element  resides  the sight of a pleasure in which we cannot or else will  not share moves us to a particular impatience  it may be because  we are envious or because we are sad or because we dislike noise  and romping  being so refined or because  being so philosophic   we have an overweighing sense of lifes gravity  at least as we  go on in years we are all tempted to frown upon our neighbours  pleasures  people are nowadays so fond of resisting temptations  here is one to be resisted  they are fond of selfdenial here is  a propensity that cannot be too peremptorily denied  there is an  idea abroad among moral people that they should make their  neighbours good  one person i have to make good  myself  but my  duty to my neighbour is much more nearly expressed by saying that i  have to make him happy  if i may   iii   happiness and goodness according to canting moralists stand in  the relation of effect and cause  there was never anything less  proved or less probable  our happiness is never in our own hands  we inherit our constitution we stand buffet among friends and  enemies we may be so built as to feel a sneer or an aspersion with  unusual keenness and so circumstanced as to be unusually exposed  to them we may have nerves very sensitive to pain and be  afflicted with a disease very painful  virtue will not help us  and it is not meant to help us  it is not even its own reward  except for the selfcentred and  i had almost said  the  unamiable  no man can pacify his conscience if quiet be what he  want he shall do better to let that organ perish from disuse  and  to avoid the penalties of the law and the minor capitis diminutio  of social ostracism is an affair of wisdom  of cunning if you  will  and not of virtue  in his own life then a man is not to expect happiness only to  profit by it gladly when it shall arise he is on duty here he  knows not how or why and does not need to know he knows not for  what hire and must not ask  somehow or other though he does not  know what goodness is he must try to be good somehow or other  though he cannot tell what will do it he must try to give  happiness to others  and no doubt there comes in here a frequent  clash of duties  how far is he to make his neighbour happy  how  far must he respect that smiling face so easy to cloud so hard to  brighten again  and how far on the other side is he bound to be  his brothers keeper and the prophet of his own morality  how far  must he resent evil  the difficulty is that we have little guidance christs sayings on  the point being hard to reconcile with each other and the most of  them hard to accept  but the truth of his teaching would seem to  be this  in our own person and fortune we should be ready to  accept and to pardon all it is our cheek we are to turn our coat  that we are to give away to the man who has taken our cloak  but  when anothers face is buffeted perhaps a little of the lion will  become us best  that we are to suffer others to be injured and  stand by is not conceivable and surely not desirable  revenge  says bacon is a kind of wild justice its judgments at least are  delivered by an insane judge and in our own quarrel we can see  nothing truly and do nothing wisely  but in the quarrel of our  neighbour let us be more bold  one persons happiness is as  sacred as anothers when we cannot defend both let us defend one  with a stout heart  it is only in so far as we are doing this  that we have any right to interfere  the defence of b is our only  ground of action against a  a has as good a right to go to the  devil as we to go to glory and neither knows what he does  the truth is that all these interventions and denunciations and  militant mongerings of moral halftruths though they be sometimes  needful though they are often enjoyable do yet belong to an  inferior grade of duties  illtemper and envy and revenge find  here an arsenal of pious disguises this is the playground of  inverted lusts  with a little more patience and a little less  temper a gentler and wiser method might be found in almost every  case and the knot that we cut by some fine heady quarrelscene in  private life or in public affairs by some denunciatory act  against what we are pleased to call our neighbours vices might  yet have been unwoven by the hand of sympathy   iv   to look back upon the past year and see how little we have striven  and to what small purpose and how often we have been cowardly and  hung back or temerarious and rushed unwisely in and how every day  and all day long we have transgressed the law of kindness  it may  seem a paradox but in the bitterness of these discoveries a  certain consolation resides  life is not designed to minister to a  mans vanity  he goes upon his long business most of the time with  a hanging head and all the time like a blind child  full of  rewards and pleasures as it is  so that to see the day break or  the moon rise or to meet a friend or to hear the dinnercall when  he is hungry fills him with surprising joys  this world is yet  for him no abiding city  friendships fall through health fails  weariness assails him year after year he must thumb the hardly  varying record of his own weakness and folly  it is a friendly  process of detachment  when the time comes that he should go  there need be few illusions left about himself  here lies one who  meant well tried a little failed much   surely that may be his  epitaph of which he need not be ashamed  nor will he complain at  the summons which calls a defeated soldier from the field   defeated ay if he were paul or marcus aurelius  but if there is  still one inch of fight in his old spirit undishonoured  the  faith which sustained him in his lifelong blindness and lifelong  disappointment will scarce even be required in this last formality  of laying down his arms  give him a march with his old bones  there out of the glorious suncoloured earth out of the day and  the dust and the ecstasy  there goes another faithful failure  from a recent book of verse where there is more than one such  beautiful and manly poem i take this memorial piece  it says  better than i can what i love to think let it be our parting  word   a late lark twitters from the quiet skies and from the west where the sun his days work ended lingers as in content there falls on the old gray city an influence luminous and serene a shining peace  the smoke ascends in a rosyandgolden haze  the spires shine and are changed  in the valley shadows rise  the lark sings on  the sun closing his benediction sinks and the darkening air thrills with a sense of the triumphing night  night with her train of stars and her great gift of sleep  so be my passing my task accomplished and the long day done my wages taken and in my heart some late lark singing let me be gathered to the quiet west the sundown splendid and serene death  1888
