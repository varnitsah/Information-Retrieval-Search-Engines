83957690	edinburgh   printed by ballantyne and company   pauls work      the poetical works   of john dryden    with life critical dissertation and   explanatory notes      by the   rev george gilfillan      vol i       m dccc lv     the life of john dryden   john dryden was born on the 9th of august 1631 at a place variously denominated aldwincle or oldwincle all saints or at oldwincle st peters in northamptonshire the name dryden or driden is from the north there are drydens still in the town of scotland where we now write and the poets ancestors lived in the county of cumberland one of them named john removed from a place called staffhill to northamptonshire where he succeeded to the estate of canonsashby by marriage with the daughter of sir john cope john dryden was a schoolmaster a puritan and honoured it is said with the friendship of the celebrated erasmus after whom he named his son who succeeded to the estate of canonsashby and besides becoming a sheriff of the county of northamptonshire was created a knight under james i sir erasmus had three sons the third of whom also an erasmus became the father of our poet his mother was mary the daughter of the rev henry pickering whose father a zealous puritan had been one of the marked victims in the gunpowder plot dryden thus had connexions both on his fathers and mothers side with that party by deriding defaming and opposing which he afterwards gained much of his poetical glory  the poet was the eldest of fourteen childrenfour sons and ten daughters the honour of his birth is claimed as already stated by two parishes that of oldwincle all saints and that of oldwincle st peters as homers was of old by seven cities his brothers and sisters have been followed by eager biographers into their diverging and deepening paths of obscuritypaths in which we do not choose to attend them dryden received the rudiments of his education at tichmarsh or at oundlefor here too we have conflicting statements it is certain however that he was admitted a kings scholar at westminster under the tuition of dr busby whom he always respected and who discovered in him poetical power he encouraged him to write as a thursdays nights task a translation of the third satire of persius a writer precisely of that vigorously rhetorical rapidly satirical and semipoetical school which dryden was qualified to appreciate and to mirror besides other pieces of a similar kind which are lost during the last year of his residence at westminster and when only eighteen years of age he wrote one among the ninetyeight elegies which were called forth by the sudden death of henry lord hastings and published under the title of lachrymæ musarum hastings seems to have been an amiable person but he was besides a lord and hinc illoe lachrymæ we know not of what quality the other tears were but assuredly drydens is one of very suspicious sincerity and of very little poetical merit but even the crocodile tears of a great genius if they fall into a fanciful shape must be preserved and we have preserved his accordingly notwithstanding the false taste as well as doubtful truth and honesty of this his earliest poem  shortly after dryden obtained a westminster scholarship and on the 11th of may 1650 entered on trinity college cambridge his tutor was one john templer famous then as one of the many who had attempted to put a hook in the jaws of old hobbes the leviathan of his time but whose reply as well as hobbes own book like a whale disappearing from a shetland voe into the deep with all the hooks and harpoons of his enemies along with him has been almost entirely forgotten at cambridge dryden was noted for regularity and diligence and took the degree of ba in january 16534 and in 1657 was made am by a dispensation from the archbishop of canterbury once indeed he was rusticated for a fortnight on account of some disobedience to the vicemaster he resided however at his university three years after the usual term and although he did not become a fellow and made no secret in after days of preferring oxford to cambridge yet the reason of this seems to have lain not in any personal disgust but in some other cause which says scott we may now search for in vain  up till june 1654 his father had continued to reside at his estate at blakesley in northamptonshire when he died leaving dryden twothirds of a property which was worth in all only £60 ayear the other third was bequeathed to his mother during her lifetime with this miserable modicum of £40 ayear the poet returned to cambridge and continued there doing little and little known as one who could do anything till the year 1657 the only records of the diligence of his college years are the lines on the death of lord hastings and one or two other inconsiderable copies of verses he probably however employed much time in private study  while at cambridge he met with a young lady a cousin of his ownhonor driden daughter of sir john driden of chestertonof whom he became deeply enamoured his suit was however rejected although he continued all his life on intimate terms with the family miss driden died unmarried many years after her poet lover and like the lass of ballochmyle with burns homage learned to value it more after he became celebrated and carefully preserved the solitary letter which dryden wrote her  but now the university was to lose and the world of london to receive the poet in the year 1657 when about sixandtwenty years of age dryden repaired to london clad in homely drugget and with more projects in his head than pence in his pocket he was first employed by his relative sir gilbert pickeringcalled the fiery pickering from his roundhead zealas a clerk or secretary here he came in contact with cromwell and saw very clearly those great qualities of sagacity determination courage statesmanship insight and genuine godliness which made him next to alfred the great the first monarch who ever sat on the english throne two years after dryden came to london cromwell expired and the poet wrote and published his heroic stanzas on the heros death which we consider really his earliest poem when richard resigned dryden in common with the majority of the nation saw that the roundhead cause was lost and hastened to carry over his talents to the gaining side for this we do not blame him very severely although it certainly had been nobler if like milton he had clung to his party sir walter scott remarks that dryden never retracted the praise he gave to cromwell in absalom and achitophel he sneers at richard as ishbosheth but says nothing against the deceased giant saul it is clear too that at first his desertion of the cromwell party was a loss to the poet he lost the chance of their favour in case a reaction should come his situation as secretary and the shelter of pickerings princely mansion as might have been expected his ancient friends were indignant at the change and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his namefrom driden to dryden  he went to reside in the obscure house of one herringman a bookseller in the new exchange and became for life a professional author his enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life and asserted that he was a mere drudge to herringman he at all events did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years a poem on the coronation of charles well fitted to wipe away the stain of cromwellism and to attract upon the poet the eye of that risingsun whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth a panegyric on the lord chancellor and a satire on the dutch were all and are all short and all savour of a vein somewhat hidebound he planned indeed too and partly wrote one or more plays and was considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the royal society in 1662 previous to this he had been introduced through herringman to sir robert howard son of the first earl of berkshire and a relation of edward howard the author of british princes and the object of the witty wrath of butler sir robert too had a poetical propensity and dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years the poet assisting the knight in his literary compositions particularly in a play entitled the indian queen and the latter inviting the former to the family seat at charlton where dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the 1st of december 1663 in st swithins london and with the consent of the earl who settled about £60 ayear on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husbands respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of drydens satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness  otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about £100 ayeara sum equal to £300 nowand which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by £20 more or £60 at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread  to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his ladys rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to translate or write prefaces for the booksellers he might pay his bill for salt if diligent enough for satires as yet there was little demand the follies of the more fanatical of the puritans were too recent although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of butler and the far grosser absurdities of the cavaliers were yet in blossom there remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage which during the previous regime had been abolished while the french revolution was in progress ay even in the depths of the reign of terror the theatres were all open and all crowded but when cromwell was enacting his solemn and solitary part before god angels and men the petty potentatesthe gods and goddesses of the stagevanished into thin air at his tremendous stamp their cue had been exeunt omnes and if the spirit of shakspeare himself had witnessed the departure he would have added his amen and had he watched in their stead the gigantic actor treading his trembling stage alone with all the world looking on he might have remembered and reapplied his own magnificent words    o for a muse of fire that would ascend   the brightest heaven of invention   a kingdom for a stage princes to act   and monarchs to behold the swelling scene   then should the warlike cromwell like himself   assume the port of mars and at his heels   leashd in like hounds should famine sword and fire   crouch for employment  no sooner had this great man passed away and an earnest age with him and charles mounted the throne than from the darkest recesses of the stews and the taverns from the depths within depths of alsatia or paris the whole tribe of dancers fiddlers drabs mimes stageplayers and playwrights knowing that their enemy was dead and their hour of harvest had come emerged in swarming multitudesmultitudes swelled by the vast tribe of playgoers who had been counting the hours since a falstaff had made them laugh an ophelia made them weep and a lear made them tremble and had this only issued in the revival of the drama of shakspeare and johnson few could have had much to say in objection for that in general was as pure as it was powerful but alas besides them there had been a beaumont a fletcher and a massinger with their unutterable abominations nay the king and courtiers had imported from france a taste which required for its gratification a licentiousness still more abandoned and to be cast besides into forms and shapes as stiff stately and elaborate as the material was vile and were not contented with pollution unless served up in a new piquant and unnatural manner our poet understood this movement of his time right well and determined to conform to it he knew that he could better than any man living pander to the popular appetite for the melodramatic for the grandiloquent and for the obscene he knew the taste of charles and that he above all cooks could dress up a ragout of that putrid perfection which his king relished and he set himself with his whole might so to do and for thirty years and more continued his degradation of geniusa degradation unexampled whether we consider the powers of the writer the coarseness quantity and elaboration of the pollutions he perpetrated or the length of time in which he was employed in thus profaning the godgiven strength and marring the lofty line  his other biographersdr johnson alone with brevity and seeming reluctancehave enumerated and characterised all drydens plays we have decided only to speak of them very generally and that for the following reasons1st we are reprinting none of them 2dly from what we have read of them we are certain that even as works of art they are utterly unworthy of their author and that in morals they are as a whole a disgrace to human nature we are not the least lenient or indulgent of critics we have every wish to pity the errors and to bear with the frequent escapades and aberrations of genius but when we see as in drydens case what we are forced to consider either a deliberate and systematic attempt to poison the sources of virtue or at least an elaborate and incessant habit of conformity to the bad tastes of a bad age we can think of no plea fully available for his defence vain to say he wrote for bread he did nothe wrote only for the luxuries not the staff of life vain to say he consulted the taste of his audience and suited their atmosphere but why did he select that atmosphere as his and why so much gratuitous and superfluous iniquity in his works but he wrote to gratify his monarch this would form a good enough excuse for a sporus a white curd of ass milk but not for a strong man like dryden but he was no worse than others of his age pitiful apology since being the ablest man of his day and therefore bound to be before it he was in reality behind it his plays excelling all contemporary productions in wickedness as well as in wit but his own conduct was latterly irreproachable this we doubt and scott doubts so too but even though it were true it were damaging because it would deprive him of the plea of passion and reduce him from the warm human painter to the cold demonlike sculptor of unclean and abominable ideas it never can be forgotten that whenever dryden translated a filthy play he made it filthier than in the original and that he has once and again scattered his satyrlike fancies in spots such as the paradise of milton and the enchanted isle of shakspeare which every imagination and every heart previously had regarded as holy ground the only extenuating circumstance we can mention is that his pruriency was latterly in part relinquished and much deplored by himself and that his poetry is on the whole free from it in our critical paper prefixed to the second volume we intend to examine the question how far an authors faults are or are not to be charged upon his age  his next poem was annus mirabilis published in 1667 and counted justly one of his most vigorous though also one of the faultiest of his poems it includes glowing although somewhat quaint and fantastic descriptions of the dutch war and the great fire in london in 1668 by the death of sir william davenant the post of poetlaureate became vacant and dryden was appointed to it he was also appointed historiographerroyal the salary of these two offices amounted to £200 a year besides the famous annual butt of canary while his profits from the theatre were equivalent to £300 his whole income was thus at the very least equal to a thousand pounds of our moneya great sum for a poet in that or in any age he published the same year an essay on dramatic poetry vindicating his own practice of rhymed heroic verse in playsa stupid french innovation which all the ingenuity of a dryden defended in vain it was cast into the shape of a dialoguethe duke of dorset being one of the respondentsand formed the first specimen of drydens easy rambling but most vivid vigorous and entertaining prose no one was ever more ready than he to render reasons for his writingsfor their faults as well as meritsand to show by more ingenious arguments that if they failed they ought to have succeeded  at this time we may consider drydens prosperity although not his powers to have culminated he had a handsome income a run of unparalleled popularity as a playwright he was poetlaureate a favourite at court and on terms of intimacy with many of the nobility and many of the eminent men of letters the public would have at that time bid high for his very snuffpapers and were thankful for whatever garbage he chose to throw at them from the stage how different his position from that of the great blind old man at this time residing in bunhillfields in obscurity and sorrow and preparing to put off his tabernacle and take his flight to the heavens of god the one heard every night the claps of multitudesthe other the whispers of angels saying to his soul sisterspirit come away the one was revelling in reputationthe other was listening to the faroff echoes of a coming fame as wide as the world and as permanent as the existence of man to do dryden justice he admired milton and although he did and that too immediately after milton departed venture to travestie the paradise lost into a rhymed play as dull as it is disgusting and although he knew that milton had called him somewhat harshly a good rhymer but no poet yet he praised his genius at a time when it was as little appreciated as was the grandeur of his character  but now the slave in the chariot of drydens triumph was about to appear first came in 1671 the rehearsal a play concocted among various wits of the time including sprat clifford poor butler of hudibras and chiefly the duke of buckingham the object of this play was to turn rhymed heroic tragedy and especially the great playwright of the day under the name of bayes his person manners conversation and habits into unmitigated ridicule the plan has often since been followed with various success minor wits have delighted in clubbing their small but poisoned missiles and in aiming flights of minnikin arrows at the gullivers of their different periods thus pope was assailed by the dunces whom he afterwards preserved in amberthat terrible old lion bentley by boyle and his associates and wordsworth by the critics or criticasters of his day dryden acted with greater prudence than any of those we have named except indeed bentley who being assailed upon points involving the integrity of his scholarship and on which demonstrative contradiction was possible felt himself compelled to leave his lair and to rend his enemies in pieces but drydenfeeling on this occasion at least that a squib however personal and severe cannot harm any man worthy of the name and that the very force of the laughter it produces drives out the stingdetermined to answer it by silence and to bide his time zimri in absalom and achitophel shows how deep had been his secret oath of vengeance and how carefully the sweltered venom had been kept in which at last he baptizes buckingham and embalms him at the same time for the wonder and contempt of posterity here is the danger of the smaller wits in a controversy of this kind their squibs excite a sensation at the moment and sometimes annoy the assaulted giant much and his friends and publishers more but he continues to live and grow while their spiteful effusions perish or worse are preserved to the everlasting shame of their authors on the lowest shelf of the records of their enemys fame  two years after occurred the famous controversy between dryden and settle poor elkanah settle seemed raised up like another mordecai to poison the peace and disturb the false selfsatisfaction of drydenraised up rathershall we sayto wean the poet from a sphere where his true place and power were not and to prepare him for other stages where he was yet destined far more powerfully to play his part at all events this should have been his inference from the success of settle it should have taught him that a scene where a pitiful poetaster backed by mobfavour and the word of a rochester could eclipse his glory was no scene for him and he ought instantly with proud humility to have left the theatre for ever instead of this he fell into a violent passion with one who like himself had levelled his desires to the claps of multitudes and had ravished the larger share of the coveted prize and so there commenced a long and ludicrous controversydishonourable to settle much to rochester and dryden morebetween a mere insolent twaddler and a man of real and transcendent genius the particulars of the struggle are too humiliating and contemptible to deserve a minute record suffice it that dryden assisted by his future foe shadwell wrote a scurrilous attack on settle and his successful play the empress of morocco to which settle nothing daunted replied in terms of equal coarseness and that rochester the patron of settle became mixed up in the fray till having been severely handled by dryden in his essay on satirea production generally and we think justly attributed to mulgrave and dryden in conjunctionhe took a mean and characteristic revenge he hired bravoes who waiting for dryden as he was returning on the 18th december 1679 from wills coffeehouse to his own house in gerard street rushed out and severely beat and wounded him that dryden was the author of the lines on rochester has been doubted although we think they very much resemble a rough and hurried sketch from his pen that rochester deserved the truculent treatment he received in them this anecdote sufficiently proves it was partly indeed the manner of the age had this nobleman existed now and been pilloried by a true and powerful pen he would in addition to his own anonymous assaults have stirred up a posse of his creatures to assist him in seeking by falsehoods hypercriticisms and abuse to diminish the influence and take away the good name of his opponent the satanic spirit is always the sameits weapons and instruments are continually changing  soon after this dryden translated the epistles of ovid thus breathing himself for the far greater efforts which were before him his mind seems for a season to have balanced between various poetic plans on the one hand the finger of his good genius showed him the fair heights of epic song waiting to be crowned by the coming of a new virgil on the other side the fierce fires of his passions pointed him downwards to his many rivals and foesthe cliffords leighs ravenscrofts rochesters and settleswho seemed lying as a mark for his satiric vengeance he meditated we know an epic on arthur the hero of the round table and had besides many arrears of wrath lying past for discharge but circumstances arose which turned his thoughts away for a season in a different direction from either arthur or his personal foes  the political aspects of the times were now portentous in the extreme charles ii had partly by crime partly by carelessness and partly by illfortune become a most unpopular monarch and the more so because the nation had no hope even from his death since it was sure to hand them over to the tender mercies of his brother who had all his faults and some in addition of his own without any of his merits there was but one hope and that turned out a mere aurora borealis connected with the duke of monmouth who through his extraction by a bend sinister from charles as well as through his popular manners protestant principles and gracious exterior had become such a favourite with the people that strong efforts were made to exclude the duke of york and to exalt him to the succession these however were unsuccessful and shaftesbury their leading spirit was accused of treason and confined to the tower it was at this crisis when the nobility of the land were divided when its clergy were divided when its literary men were dividednot in a silent feud but in a raging rupture that dryden partly at the instigation of the court partly from his own impulse lifted up his powerful penthe sceptre of the pressand with wonderful facility and felicity wrote and on the 17th november 1681 published the satire of absalom and achitophel its poetical meritsthe choice of the names and period although this is borrowed from a previous writerthe appearance of the poem at the most critical hour of the crisisand above all the portraitures of character so easy and so graphic so free and so fearless distinguished equally by their animus and their animation and with dashes of generous painting relieving and diversifying the general caricature of the stylerendered it instantly and irresistibly popular it excited one universal cryfrom its friends of admiration and from its enemies of rage imitations and replies multiplies around it and sounded like assenting or like angry echoes it did not indeed move the grand jury to condemn shaftesbury but when on his acquittal a medal was struck by his friends bearing on one side the head and name of shaftesbury and on the other the sun obscured by a cloud rising over the tower and city of london drydens aid was again solicited by the court and the king in person to make this the subject of a second satire and with great rapidity he produced the medala satire against sedition which completing and colouring the photograph of shaftesbury formed the real second part of absalom and achitophel what bore that name came a year afterwards when the times were changed was written partly by a feebler handnahum tate and flew at inferior gamedrydens own personal rivals and detractors  the principal of these was shadwell who had been an early friend of drydens and who certainly possessed a great deal of wit and talent if he did not attain to the measure of poetic genius his principal power lay in low comedyhis chief fault lay in his systematic and avowed imitation of the rough and drunken manners of ben jonson in the eye of drydenwhose own habits were convivial although not to the same extentthe real faults of his opponent were his popularity as a comic writer and his politics shadwell was a zealous protestant and the bitterest of the many who replied to the medal for this he became the hero of macflecknoea masterly satire holding him up to infamy and contemptbesides sitting afterwards for the portrait of og in the second part of absalom and achitophel shadwell had by and by his revenge by obtaining the laureateship after the revolution in room of dryden and no doubt used the opportunity of drowning the memory of defeat in the butt of generous canary which had now for ever passed the door of his formidable rival  drydens circumstances at this time were considerably straitened his pension as laureate was not regularly paid the profits from the theatre had somewhat fallen off he tried in various ways by prefacing a translation of plutarchs lives by publishing a miscellany of versions from greek and latin authors and by writing prologues to plays and prefaces to books to supply his exhausted exchequer his goodhumoured but heartless monarch set him on another task for which he was never paid writing a translation of maimbourgs history of the league the object of which was to damage shaftesbury and his party by branding them as enemies to monarchy in 1682 he wrote his religio laici  not long after in february 1684 charles ii became for the first time in his life serious as he felt deaththe proverbial terror of kingsrapidly rushing upon him he tried to hide the great and terrible fact from his eyes under the shield of a wafer he died suddenlya member of the holy roman catholic churchand much regretted by all his mistresses and apparently by dryden who had been preparing the opera of albion and albanius to commemorate the kings triumph over the whigs when this event turned his harp into mourning and his organ into the voice of them that weep he set himself to write a poem which should at once express regret for the set and homage to the rising sun this was his threnodia augustalis a very unequal poem but full of inimitable passages and discovering all that careless greatness which characterised the genius of the poet  charles ii had at drydens request to whom arrears for four years had been due raised his laureate salary to £300 the additional hundred dropped at the kings death and james was mean enough even to curtail the annual butt of sack he probably had little hope of converting the author of religio laici to his faith else he would not have withheld what charles had so recently granted afterwards when he ascertained that an interesting process was going on in drydens mind tending to popery he perhaps thought that a little money cast into the crucible might materially determine the projection in the proper way or perhaps the prospect produced or at least accelerated the process we admire much in scotts elaborate and ingenious defence of drydens change of faith and are ready to grant that it was only a pyrrhonist not a protestant who became a papist after allbut there was as dr johnson also thinks an ugly coincidence between the pension and the conversion grant that it was not bestowed for the first time by james it had been withheld by him and its restoration immediately followed the change of his faith dr johnson was pleased when andrew miller said that he thanked god he was done with him to know that miller thanked god for anything and so when we consider the blasphemy profanity and filth of drydens plays and the unsettled and veering state of his religious and political opinions we are almost glad to find him becoming anything although it was only the votary of a dead and corrupted form of christianity you like to see the fierce capricious and destructive torrent fixed although it be fixed in ice  that he found comfort in his new religion and proved his sincerity by rearing up his children in the faith which his wife had also embraced and by remaining a roman catholic after the revolution and to his own pecuniary loss has often been asserted but surely there is a point where the most inconsistent man is obliged to stop if he would escape the character of an absolute weathercock and that there are charms and comforts in the popish creed for one who felt with dryden that he had partly in his practice and far more in his writings sinned against the laws of morality and common decency we readily grant whether these charms he legitimate and these comforts sound is a very different question had dryden besides turned protestant again we question if it would have saved him his laureate pensions and it would certainly have blasted him for ever under the charge of ingratitude to his benefactor james on the whole this passage of the poets life is not very creditable to his memory and his indiscriminate admirers had better let it alone it would have strained the ingenuity and the enthusiasm of claud halcro himself to have extracted matter for a panegyrical ode on this conversion of glorious john  admitted into the bosom of the church he soon found that he must prove his faith by his works he was employed by james to defend the reasons of conversion to the catholic faith alleged by anne duchess of york and the two other papers on the same subject which found in charles strong box james had imprudently given to the world this led him to a contest with stillingfleet in which dryden came off only second best he next in an embowered walk in a country retirement at rushton near his birthplace composed his strange unequal but brilliant and ingenious poem the hind and the panther the object of which was to advocate king james repeal of the test act and to prove the immeasurable superiority of the church of rome to that of england as well as to all the dissenting sects this piece produced a prodigious clamour against the author its plan was pronounced ridiculousits argument onesidedits zeal assumedand montague and prior two young men then rising into eminence wrote a clever parody on it entitled the town and country mouse in addition to this he wrote a translation of varillas history of heresies and a life of francis xavier the famous apostle of the indies whose singular story a tale of heroic endurance and unexampled labours but bedropt with the most flagrant falsehoods whether it be read in drydens easy and fascinating narrative or in the more gorgeous and coloured account of sir james stephen in the edinburgh review forms one of the most impressive displays of human strength and folly of the greatness of devoted enthusiasm and of the weakness and credulity of abject superstition  in spite of all these attempts to bolster up a tottering throne and an effete faith the revolution came and drydens hopes and prospects sank like a vision of the night and now came the hour of his enemies revenge how the settles the shadwells and the ravenscrofts rejoiced at the downfall of their great foe and what ironical condolence or bitter satirical exultation they poured over his humiliation and worst of all he durst not reply his powers of satire says scott at this period were of no more use to dryden than a sword to a man who cannot draw it the fate of milton in miniature had now befallen him and it says much for the strength of his mind that as in miltons case drydens purest and best titles to fame date from his discomfiture and degradation antæuslike he had now reached the ground and the touch of the ground to him as to all giants was inspiration  his history from this date becomes still more than in the former portions of it a history of his publications he was forced back by necessity to the stage in 1690 and in the next two years he produced four dramasone of them indeed adapted from the french but the other three original and one don sebastian deemed to rank among the best of his dramatic works in 1693 another volume of miscellanies with more translations appeared he also published about this time a new version of juvenal and persius portions of which were contributed by his sons john and charles his last play love triumphant was enactedas his first the wild gallant had beenwithout success and it is remarkable that while the curtain dropped heavily and slowly upon dryden it was opening upon congreve whose first comedy was enacted the same year with drydens last and who became the lawful heir of much of drydens licentiousness and of more than his elegance and wit  he next commenced the translation of virgil which in the course of three years he completed and gave to the world it was published in july 1697 he had dashed it off with the utmost freedom and fire and no work was ever more thoroughly identified with its translator it is drydens virgil every line of it a great and almost national interest was felt in the undertaking such as would be felt now were it announced that tennyson was engaged in a translation of goethe addison supplied arguments and an essay on the georgics a dedication to the new king was expected by the court but inexorably declined by the poet it came forth notwithstanding amidst universal applause nor was the remuneration for the times small amounting to at least £1200 or £1400  so soon as this great work was off his hands by way we suppose as scott was used to say of refreshing the machiner dryden wrote his famous ode alexanders feast for a meeting of the musical society on st cecilias daywrote it according to bolingbroke at one sitting although he spent it is said a fortnight in polishing it into its present rounded and perfect form it took the public by storm and excited a greater sensation than any of the poets productions except absalom and achitophel dryden himself when complimented on it as the finest ode in the language owned the soft impeachment and said a nobler ode never was produced and never will and in a manner if not absolutely he was right  dryden was now again at sea for a subject sometimes he revolved once more his favourite plan of an epic poem and edward the black prince loomed for a season before him as its hero sometimes he looked up with an ambitious eye to homer and we see his hand pawing like the hoof of the warhorse in job as he smelled his battle afar off and panted to do for achilles and hector what he had done for turnus and Æneas he meant to have turned the iliad into blank verse but after all translated the only book of it which he published into rhyme but in fine he determined to modernise some of the fine old tales of boccacio and chaucer and in march 16991700 appeared his brilliant fables with some other poems from his pen for which he received £300 at jonsons hands  this was his last publication of size although he was labouring on when death surprised him and within the last three weeks of his life had written the secular margin and the prologue and the epilogue to fletchers pilgrimproductions remarkable as showing the ruling passion strong in deaththe squabbling litterateur and satirist combating and kicking his enemies to the lastjeremy collier for having accused him of licentiousness in his dramas milbourne for having attacked his georgics and poor blackmore for having doubted the orthodoxy of religio laici and the decency of amphitryon and limberham  he had now to go a pilgrimage himself to a far country he had long been troubled with gout and gravel but next came erysipelas in one of his legs and at last mortification superinduced by a neglected inflammation in his toe carried him off at three oclock on wednesday morning the 1st of may 1700 he died a roman catholic and in entire resignation to the divine will he died so poor that he was buried by subscription lords montague and jeffries delaying the interment till the necessary funds were raised the body after lying embalmed and in state for ten days in the college of physicians was buried with great pomp in westminster abbey where now between the graves of chaucer and cowley reposes the dust of dryden  his lady survived him fourteen years and died insane his eldest son charles was drowned in 1704 at datchett while seeking to swim across the thames john died at rome of a fever in 1701 erasmus who was supposed to inherit his mothers malady died in 1710 and the title which he had derived from sir robert passed to his uncle the brother

works as to his habits and manners little is known and that little is worn threadbare by his many biographers in appearance he became in his maturer years fat and florid and obtained the name of poet squab his portraits show a shrewd but rather sluggish face with long gray hair floating down his cheeks not unlike coleridge but without his dreamy eye like a nebulous star his conversation was less sprightly than solid sometimes men suspected that he had sold all his thoughts to his booksellers his manners are by his friends pronounced modest and the word modest has since been amiably confounded by his biographers with pure bashful he seems to have been to awkwardness but he was by no means a model of the virtues he loved to sit at wills coffeehouse and be the arbiter of criticism his favourite stimulus was snuff and his favourite amusement angling he had a bad address a down look and little of the air of a gentleman addison is reported to have taught him latterly the intemperate use of wine but this was said by dennis who admired dryden and who hated addison and his testimony is impotent against either party we admire the simplicity of the critics who can read his plays and then find himself a model of continence and virtue out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and a more polluted mouth than drydens never uttered its depravities on the stage we cannot in fine call him personally a very honest a very highminded or a very good man although we are willing to count him amiable ready to make very considerable allowance for his period and his circumstances not disposed to think him so much a renegado and deliberate knave as a fickle needy and childish changeling in the matter of his perversion to popery although we yield to none in admiration of the

bounds our eye   until the earth seems joind unto the sky   so in this hemisphere our utmost view   is only bounded by our king and you   our sight is limited where you are joind   and beyond that no

but when the heir of this vast treasure knew   how large a legacy was left to you   too great for any subject to retain   he wisely tied it to the crown again   yet passing through your hands it gathers more   as streams through mines bear tincture of their ore   while empiric politicians use deceit   hide what they give and cure but by a cheat   you boldly show that skill which they pretend   and work by means as noble as your end                             70   which should you veil we might unwind the clew   as men do nature till we came to you   and as the indies were not found before   those rich perfumes which from the happy shore   the winds upon their balmy wings conveyd   whose guilty sweetness first their world betrayd   so by your counsels we are brought to view   a rich and undiscoverd world in you   by you our monarch does that fame assure   which kings must have or cannot live secure                       80   for prosperous princes gain their subjects heart   who love

sprouting leaves did suddenly enclose   and peaceful olives shaded as they rose      how strangely active are the arts of peace   whose restless motions less than wars do cease   peace is not freed from labour but from noise   and war more force but not more pains employs   such is the mighty swiftness of your mind   that like the earth it leaves our sense behind                  110   while you so smoothly turn and roll our sphere   that rapid motion does but rest appear   for as in natures swiftness with the throng   of flying orbs while ours is borne along   all seems at rest to the deluded eye   moved by the soul of the same harmony   so carried on by your unwearied care   we rest in peace and yet in motion share   let envy then those crimes within you see   from which the happy never must be free                           120   envy that does with misery reside   the joy and the revenge of ruind pride   think it not hard if at so cheap a rate   you can secure the constancy of fate   whose kindness sent what does their malice seem   by lesser ills the greater to redeem   nor can we this weak shower a tempest call   but drops of heat that in the sunshine fall    you have already wearied fortune so   she cannot further be your friend or foe                          130   but sits all breathless and admires to feel   a fate so weighty that it stops her wheel   in all things else above our humble fate   your equal mind yet swells not into state   but like some mountain in those happy isles   where in perpetual spring young nature smiles   your greatness shows no horror to affright   but trees for shade and flowers to court the sight   sometimes the hill submits itself a while   in small descents which do its height beguile                    140   and sometimes mounts but so as billows play   whose rise not hinders but makes short our way   your brow which does no fear of thunder know   sees rolling tempests vainly beat below   and like olympus top the impression wears   of love and friendship writ in former years   yet unimpaird with labours or with time   your age but seems to a new youth to climb   thus heavenly bodies do our time beget   and measure change but share no part of it                       150   and still it shall without a weight increase   like this new year whose motions never cease   for since the glorious course you have begun   is led by charles as that is by the sun   it must both weightless and immortal prove   because the centre of it is above                                       footnotes  footnote 31 hyde the

could desire i have taken upon me to describe the motives the beginning progress and successes of a most just and necessary war in it the care management and prudence of our king the conduct and valour of a royal admiral and of two incomparable generals the invincible courage of our captains and seamen and three glorious victories the result of all after this i have in the fire the most

to the war is but a due expiation for my not having served my king and country in it all gentlemen are almost obliged to it and i know no reason we should give that advantage to the commonalty of england to be foremost in brave actions which the nobles of france would never suffer in their peasants i should not have written this but to a person who has been ever forward to appear in all employments whither his honour and generosity have called him the latter part of my poem which describes the fire i owe first to the piety and fatherly affection of our monarch to his suffering subjects and in the second place to the courage loyalty and magnanimity of the city both which were so conspicuous that i wanted words to celebrate them as they deserve i have called my poem historical not epic though both the actions and actors are as much heroic as any poem can contain but since the action is not properly one nor that accomplished in the last successes i have judged it too bold a title for a few stanzas which are little more in number than a single iliad or the longest of the Æneids for this reason i mean not of length but broken action tied too severely to the laws of history i am apt to agree with those who rank lucan rather among historians in verse than epic poets in whose room if i am not deceived silius italicus though a worse writer may more justly be admitted i have chosen to write my poem in quatrains or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme because i have ever judged them more noble and of greater dignity both for the sound and number than any other verse in use amongst us in which i am sure i have your approbation the learned languages have certainly a great advantage of us in not being tied to the slavery of any rhyme and were less constrained in the quantity of every syllable which they might vary with spondees or dactyls besides so many other helps of grammatical figures for the lengthening or abbreviation of them than the modern are in the close of that one syllable which often confines and more often corrupts the sense of all the rest but in this necessity of our rhymes i have always found the couplet verse most easy though not so proper for this occasion for there the work is sooner at an end every two lines concluding the labour of the poet but in quatrains he is to carry it further on and not only so but to bear along in his head the troublesome sense of four lines together for those who write correctly in this kind must needs acknowledge that the last line of the stanza is to be considered in the composition of the first neither can we give ourselves the liberty of making any part of a verse for the sake of rhyme or concluding with a word which is not current english or using the variety of female rhymes all which our fathers practised and for the female rhymes they are still in use among other nations with the italian in every line with the spaniard promiscuously with the french alternately as those who have read the alarique the pucelle or any of their later poems will agree with me and besides this they write in alexandrius or verses of six feet such as amongst us is the old translation of homer by chapman all which by lengthening of their chain makes the sphere of their activity the larger i have dwelt too long upon the choice of my stanza which you may remember is much better defended in the preface to gondibert and therefore i will hasten to acquaint you with my endeavours in the writing in general i will only say i have never yet seen the description of any naval fight in the proper terms which are used at sea and if there be any such in another language as that of lucan in the third of his pharsalia yet i could not avail myself of it in the english the terms of art in every tongue bearing more of the idiom of it than any other words we hear indeed among our poets of the thundering of guns the smoke the disorder and the slaughter but all these are common notions and certainly as those who in a logical dispute keep in general terms would hide a fallacy so those who do it in any poetical description would veil their ignorance    descriptas servare vices operumque colores   cur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta salutor  for my own part if i had little knowledge of the sea yet i have thought it no shame to learn and if i have made some few mistakes it is only as you can bear me witness because i have wanted opportunity to correct them the whole poem being first written and now sent you from a place where i have not so much as the converse of any seaman yet though the trouble i had in writing it was great it was more than recompensed by the pleasure i found myself so warm in celebrating the praises of military men two such especially as the prince36 and general that it is no wonder if they inspired me with thoughts above my ordinary level and i am well satisfied that as they are incomparably the best subject i ever had excepting only the royal family so also that this i have written of them is much better than what i have performed on any other i have been forced to help out other arguments but this has been bountiful to me they have been low and barren of praise and i have exalted them and made them fruitful but hereomnia sponte suâ reddit justissima tellus i have had a large a fair and a pleasant field so fertile that without my cultivating it has given me two harvests in a summer and in both oppressed the reaper all other greatness in subjects is only counterfeit it will not endure the test of danger the greatness of arms is only real other greatness burdens a nation with its weight this supports it with its strength and as it is the happiness of the age so it is the peculiar goodness of the best of kings that we may praise his subjects without offending him doubtless it proceeds from a just confidence of his own virtue which the lustre of no other can be so great as to darken in him for the good or the valiant are never safely praised under a bad or a degenerate prince but to return from this digression to a further account of my poem i must crave leave to tell you that as i have endeavoured to adorn it with noble thoughts so much more to express those thoughts with elocution the composition of all poems is or ought to be of wit and wit in the poet or witwriting if you will give me leave to use a schooldistinction is no other than the faculty of imagination in the writer which like a nimble spaniel beats over and ranges through the field of memory till it springs the quarry it hunted after or without metaphor which searches over all the memory for the species or ideas of those things which it designs to represent wit written is that which is well designed the happy result of thought or product of imagination but to proceed from wit in the general notion of it to the proper wit of an heroic or historical poem i judge it chiefly to consist in the delightful imaging of persons actions passions or things it is not the jerk or sting of an epigram nor the seeming contradiction of a poor antithesis the delight of an illjudging audience in a play of rhyme nor the jingle of a more poor paronomasia neither is it so much the morality of a grave sentence affected by lucan but more sparingly used by virgil but it is some lively and apt description dressed in such colours of speech that it sets before your eyes the absent object as perfectly and more delightfully than nature so then the first happiness of the poets imagination is properly invention or finding of the thought the second is fancy or the variation deriving or moulding of that thought as the judgment represents it proper to the subject the third is elocution or the art of clothing and adorning that thought so found and varied in apt significant and sounding words the quickness of the imagination is seen in the invention the fertility in the fancy and the accuracy in the expression for the two first of these ovid is famous among the poets for the latter virgil ovid images more often the movements and affections of the mind either combating between two contrary passions or extremely discomposed by one his words therefore are the least part of his care for he pictures nature in disorder with which the study and choice of words is inconsistent this is the proper wit of dialogue or discourse and consequently of the drama where all that is said is to be supposed the effect of sudden thought which though it excludes not the quickness of wit in repartees yet admits not a too curious election of words too frequent allusions or use of tropes or in fine anything that shows remoteness of thought or labour in the writer on the other side virgil speaks not so often to us in the person of another like ovid but in his own he relates almost all things as from himself and thereby gains more liberty than the other to express his thoughts with all the graces of elocution to write more figuratively and to confess as well the labour as the force of his imagination though he describes his dido well and naturally in the violence of her passions yet he must yield in that to the myrrha the biblis the althæa of ovid for as great an admirer of him as i am i must acknowledge that if i see not more of their souls than i see of didos at least i have a greater concernment for them and that convinces me that ovid has touched those tender strokes more delicately than virgil could but when action or persons are to be described when any such image is to be set before us how bold how masterly are the strokes of virgil we see the objects he presents us with in their native figures in their proper motions but so we see them as our own eyes could never have beheld them so beautiful in themselves we see the soul of the poet like that universal one of which he speaks informing and moving through all his pictures     totamque infusa per artus   mens agitat molem et magno so corpore miscet   we behold him embellishing his images as he makes venus breathing beauty upon her son Æneas      lumenque juventæ   purpureum et lætos oculis afflârat honores   quale manus addunt ebori decus aut ubi flavo   argentum pariusve lapis circundatur auro  see his tempest his funeral sports his combat of turnus and Æneas and in his georgics which i esteem the divinest part of all his writings the plague the country the battle of the bulls the labour of the bees and those many other excellent images of nature most of which are neither great in themselves nor have any natural ornament to bear them up but the words wherewith he describes them are so excellent that it might be well applied to him which was said by ovid materiam superabat opus the very sound of his words has often somewhat that is connatural to the subject and while we read him we sit as in a play beholding the scenes of what he represents to perform this he made frequent use of tropes which you know change the nature of a known word by applying it to some other signification and this is it which horace means in his epistle to the pisos    dixeris egregiè notum si callida verbum   reddiderit junctura novum  but i am sensible i have presumed too far to entertain you with a rude discourse of that art which you both know so well and put into practice with so much happiness yet before i leave virgil i must own the vanity to tell you and by you the world that he has been my master in this poem i have followed him everywhere i know not with what success but i am sure with diligence enough my images are many of them copied from him and the rest are imitations of him my expressions also are as near as the idioms of the two languages would admit of in translation and this sir i have done with that boldness for which i will stand accountable to any of our little critics who perhaps are no better acquainted with him than i am upon your first perusal of this poem you have taken notice of some words which i have innovated if it be too bold for me to say refined upon his latin which as i offer not to introduce into english prose so i hope they are neither improper nor altogether inelegant in verse and in this horace will again defend me    et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si   græco fonte cadunt parcè detorta  the inference is exceeding plain for if a roman poet might have liberty to coin a word supposing only that it was derived from the greek was put into a latin termination and that he used this liberty but seldom and with modesty how much more justly may i challenge that privilege to do it with the same prerequisites from the best and most judicious of latin writers in some places where either the fancy or the words were his or any others i have noted it in the margin that i might not seem a plagiary in others i have neglected it to avoid as well tediousness as the affectation of doing it too often such descriptions or images well wrought which i promise not for mine are as i have said the adequate delight of heroic poesy for they beget admiration which is its proper object as the images of the burlesque which is contrary to this by the same reason beget laughter for the one shows nature beautified as in the picture of a fair woman which we all admire the other shows her deformed as in that of a lazar or of a fool with distorted face and antique gestures at which we cannot forbear to laugh because it is a deviation from nature but though the same images serve equally for the epic poesy and for the historic and panegyric which are branches of it yet a several sort of sculpture is to be used in them if some of them are to be like those of juvenal stantes in curribus Æmiliani heroes drawn in their triumphal chariots and in their full proportion others are to be like that of virgil spirantia mollius oera there is somewhat more of softness and tenderness to be shown in them you will soon find i write not this without concern some who have seen a paper of verses which i wrote last year to her highness the duchess have accused them of that only thing i could defend in them they said i did humi serpere that i wanted not only height of fancy but dignity of words to set it off i might well answer with that of horace nunc non erat his locus i knew i addressed them to a lady and accordingly i affected the softness of expression and the smoothness of measure rather than the height of thought and in what i did endeavour it is no vanity to say i have succeeded i detest arrogance but there is some difference betwixt that and a just defence but i will not further bribe your candour or the readers i leave them to speak for me and if they can to make out that character not pretending to a greater which i have given them  and now sir it is time i should relieve you from the tedious length of this account you have better and more profitable employment for your hours and i wrong the public to detain you longer in conclusion i must leave my poem to you with all its faults which i hope to find fewer in the printing by your emendations i know you are not of the number of those of whom the younger pliny speaks nec sunt parum multi qui carpere amicos suos judicium vocant i am rather too secure of you on that side your candour in pardoning my errors may make you more remiss in correcting them if you will not withal consider that they come into the world with your approbation and through your hands i beg from you the greatest favour you can confer upon an absent person since i repose upon your management what is dearest to me my fame and reputation and therefore i hope it will stir you up to make my poem fairer by many of your blots if not you know the story of the gamester who married the rich mans daughter and when her father denied the portion christened all the children by his surname that if in conclusion they must beg they should do so by one name as well as by the other but since the reproach of my faults will light on you it is but reason i should do you that justice to the readers to let them know that if there be anything tolerable in this poem they owe the argument to your choice the writing to your encouragement the correction to your judgment and the care of it to your friendship to which he must ever acknowledge himself to owe all things who is sir the most obedient

could quell        we should at first have shunnd not met our foes      whose numerous sails the fearful only tell        courage from hearts and not from numbers grows    77 he said nor needed more to say with haste        to their known stations cheerfully they go      and all at once disdaining to be last        solicit every gale to meet the foe    78 nor did the encouraged belgians long delay        but bold in others not themselves they stood      so thick our navy scarce could steer their way        but seemd to wander in a moving wood    79 our little fleet was now engaged so far        that like the swordfish in the whale they fought      the combat only seemd a civil war        till through their bowels we our passage wrought    80 never had valour no not ours before        done aught like this upon the land or main      where not to be oercome was to do more        than all the conquests former kings did gain    81 the mighty ghosts of our great harries rose        and armed edwards lookd with anxious eyes      to see this fleet among unequal foes        by which fate promised them their charles should rise    82 meantime the belgians tack upon our rear        and raking chaseguns through our sterns they send      close by their fire ships like jackals appear        who on their lions for the prey attend    83 silent in smoke of cannon they come on        such vapours once did fiery cacus42 hide      in these the height of pleased revenge is shown        who burn contented by anothers side    84 sometimes from fighting squadrons of each fleet        deceived themselves or to preserve some friend      two grappling Ætnas on the ocean meet        and english fires with belgian flames contend    85 now at each tack our little fleet grows less        and like maimd fowl swim lagging on the main      their greater loss their numbers scarce confess        while they lose cheaper than the english gain    86 have you not seen when whistled from the fist        some falcon stoops at what her eye designd      and with her eagerness the quarry missd        straight flies at check and clips it down the wind    87 the dastard crow that to the wood made wing        and sees the groves no shelter can afford      with her loud caws her craven kind does bring        who safe in numbers cuff the noble bird    88 among the dutch thus albemarle43 did fare        he could not conquer and disdaind to fly      past hope of safety twas his latest care        like falling cæsar decently to die    89 yet pity did his manly spirit move        to see those perish who so well had fought      and generously with his despair he strove        resolved to live till he their safety wrought    90 let other muses write his prosperous fate        of conquerd nations tell and kings restored      but mine shall sing of his eclipsed estate        which like the suns more wonders does afford    91 he drew his mighty frigates all before        on which the foe his fruitless force employs      his weak ones deep into his rear he bore        remote from guns as sick men from the noise    92 his fiery cannon did their passage guide        and following smoke obscured them from the foe      thus israel safe from the egyptians pride        by flaming pillars and by clouds did go    93 elsewhere the belgian force we did defeat        but here our courages did theirs subdue      so xenophon once led that famed retreat        which first the asian empire overthrew    94 the foe approachd and one for his bold sin        was sunk as he that touchd the ark was slain      the wild waves masterd him and suckd him in        and smiling eddies dimpled on the main    95 this seen the rest at awful distance stood         as if they had been there as servants set      to stay or to go on as he thought good         and not pursue but wait on his retreat    96 so lybian huntsmen on some sandy plain        from shady coverts roused the lion chase      the kingly beast roars out with loud disdain        and slowly moves unknowing to give place    97 but if some one approach to dare his force        he swings his tail and swiftly turns him round      with one paw seizes on his trembling horse        and with the other tears him to the ground    98 amidst these toils succeeds the balmy night        now hissing waters the quenchd guns restore      and weary waves withdrawing from the fight        lie lulld and panting on the silent shore    99 the moon shone clear on the becalmed flood        where while her beams like glittering silver play      upon the deck our careful general stood        and deeply mused on the succeeding day   100 that happy sun said he will rise again        who twice victorious did our navy see      and i alone must view him rise in vain        without one ray of all his star for me   101 yet like an english general will i die        and all the ocean make my spacious grave      women and cowards on the land may lie        the seas a tomb thats proper for the brave   102 restless he passd the remnant of the night        till the fresh air proclaimed the morning nigh      and burning ships the martyrs of the fight        with paler fires beheld the eastern sky   103 but now his stores of ammunition spent        his naked valour is his only guard      rare thunders are from his dumb cannon sent        and solitary guns are scarcely heard   104 thus far had fortune power here forced to stay        nor longer durst with virtue be at strife      this as a ransom albemarle did pay        for all the glories of so great a life   105 for now brave rupert from afar appears        whose waving streamers the glad general knows      with full spread sails his eager navy steers        and every ship in swift proportion grows   106 the anxious prince had heard the cannon long        and from that length of time dire omens drew      of english overmatchd and dutch too strong        who never fought three days but to pursue   107 then as an eagle who with pious care        was beating widely on the wing for prey      to her now silent eyrie does repair        and finds her callow infants forced away   108 stung with her love she stoops upon the plain        the broken air loud whistling as she flies      she stops and listens and shoots forth again        and guides her pinions by her young ones cries   109 with such kind passion hastes the prince to fight        and spreads his flying canvas to the sound      him whom no danger were he there could fright        now absent every little noise can wound   110 as in a drought the thirsty creatures cry        and gape upon the gatherd clouds for rain      and first the martlet meets it in the sky        and with wet wings joys all the featherd train   111 with such glad hearts did our despairing men        salute the appearance of the princes fleet      and each ambitiously would claim the ken        that with first eyes did distant safety meet   112 the dutch who came like greedy hinds before        to reap the harvest their ripe ears did yield      now look like those when rolling thunders roar        and sheets of lightning blast the standing field   113 full in the princes passage hills of sand        and dangerous flats in secret ambush lay      where the false tides skim oer the coverd land        and seamen with dissembled depths betray   114 the wily dutch who like fallen angels feard        this new messiahs coming there did wait      and round the verge their braving vessels steerd        to tempt his courage with so fair a bait   115 but he unmoved contemns their idle threat        secure of fame wheneer he please to fight      his cold experience tempers all his heat        and inbred worth doth boasting valour slight   116 heroic virtue did his actions guide        and he the substance not the appearance chose      to rescue one such friend he took more pride        than to destroy whole thousands of such foes   117 but when approachd in strict embraces bound        rupert and albemarle together grow      he joys to have his friend in safety found        which he to none but to that friend would owe   118 the cheerful soldiers with new stores supplied        now long to execute their spleenful will      and in revenge for those three days they tried        wish one like joshuas when the sun stood still   119 thus reinforced against the adverse fleet        still doubling ours brave rupert leads the way      with the first blushes of the morn they meet        and bring night back upon the newborn day   120 his presence soon blows up the kindling fight        and his loud guns speak thick like angry men      it seemd as slaughter had been breathed all night        and death new pointed his dull dart again   121 the dutch too well his mighty conduct knew        and matchless courage since the former fight      whose navy like a stiffstretchd cord did show        till he bore in and bent them into flight   122 the wind he shares while half their fleet offends        his open side and high above him shows      upon the rest at pleasure he descends        and doubly harmd he double harms bestows   123 behind the general mends his weary pace        and sullenly to his revenge he sails      so glides some trodden serpent on the grass        and long behind his wounded volume trails   124 the increasing sound is borne to either shore        and for their stakes the throwing nations fear      their passions double with the cannons roar        and with warm wishes each man combats there   125 plied thick and close as when the fight begun        their huge unwieldy navy wastes away      so sicken waning moons too near the sun        and blunt their crescents on the edge of day   126 and now reduced on equal terms to fight        their ships like wasted patrimonies show      where the thin scattering trees admit the light        and shun each others shadows as they grow   127 the warlike prince had severd from the rest        two giant ships the pride of all the main      which with his one so vigorously he prest        and flew so home they could not rise again   128 already batterd by his lee they lay        in rain upon the passing winds they call      the passing winds through their torn canvas play        and flagging sails on heartless sailors fall   129 their opend sides receive a gloomy light        dreadful as day let into shades below      without grim death rides barefaced in their sight        and urges entering billows as they flow   130 when one dire shot the last they could supply        close by the board the princes mainmast bore      all three now helpless by each other lie        and this offends not and those fear no more   131 so have i seen some fearful hare maintain        a course till tired before the dog she lay      who stretchd behind her pants upon the plain        past power to kill as she to get away   132 with his lolld tongue he faintly licks his prey        his warm breath blows her flix44 up as she lies      she trembling creeps upon the ground away        and looks back to him with beseeching eyes   133 the prince unjustly does his stars accuse        which hinderd him to push his fortune on      for what they to his courage did refuse        by mortal valour never must be done   134 this lucky hour the wise batavian takes        and warns his tatterd fleet to follow home      proud to have so got off with equal stakes        where twas a triumph not to be oercome   135 the generals force as kept alive by fight        now not opposed no longer can pursue      lasting till heaven had done his courage right        when he had conquerd he his weakness knew   136 he casts a frown on the departing foe        and sighs to see him quit the watery field      his stern fixd eyes no satisfaction show        for all the glories which the fight did yield   137 though as when fiends did miracles avow        he stands confessd een by the boastful dutch      he only does his conquest disavow        and thinks too little what they found too much   138 returnd he with the fleet resolved to stay        no tender thoughts of home his heart divide      domestic joys and cares he puts away        for realms are households which the great must guide   139 as those who unripe veins in mines explore        on the rich bed again the warm turf lay      till time digests the yet imperfect ore        and know it will be gold another day   140 so looks our monarch on this early fight        th essay and rudiments of great success      which allmaturing time must bring to light        while he like heaven does each days labour bless   141 heaven ended not the first or

be chastised with ease   168 already were the belgians on our coast        whose fleet more mighty every day became      by late success which they did falsely boast        and now by first appearing seemd to claim   169 designing subtle diligent and close        they knew to manage war with wise delay      yet all those arts their vanity did cross        and by their pride their prudence did betray   170 nor stayd the english long but well supplied        appear as numerous as the insulting foe      the combat now by courage must be tried        and the success the braver nation show   171 there was the plymouth squadron now come in        which in the straits last winter was abroad      which twice on biscays working bay had been        and on the midland sea the french had awed

so shrill        that heaven and earth and the wide ocean rings      a breeze from westward waits their sails to fill        and rests in those high beds his downy wings   179 the wary dutch this gathering storm foresaw        and durst not bide it on the english coast      behind their treacherous shallows they withdraw        and there lay snares to catch the british host   180 so the false spider when her nets are spread        deep ambushd in her silent den does lie      and feels far off the trembling of her thread        whose filmy cord should bind the struggling fly   181 then if at last she find him fast beset        she issues forth and runs along her loom      she joys to touch the captive in her net        and drags the little wretch in triumph home   182 the belgians hoped that with disorderd haste        our deepcut keels upon the sands might run      or if with caution leisurely were past        their numerous gross might charge us one by one   183 but with a forewind pushing them above        and swelling tide that heaved them from below      oer the blind flats our warlike squadrons move        and with spread sails to welcome battle go   184 it seemd as there the british neptune stood        with all his hosts of waters at command      beneath them to submit the officious flood        and with his trident shoved them off the sand   185 to the pale foes they suddenly draw near        and summon them to unexpected fight      they start like murderers when ghosts appear        and draw their curtains in the dead of night   186 now van to van the foremost squadrons meet        the midmost battles hastening up behind      who view far off the storm of falling sleet        and hear their thunder rattling in the wind   187 at length the adverse admirals appear        the two bold champions of each countrys right      their eyes describe the lists as they come near        and draw the lines of death before they fight   188 the distance judged for shot of every size        the linstocks touch the ponderous ball expires     the vigorous seaman every porthole plies        and adds his heart to every gun he fires   189 fierce was the fight on the proud belgians side        for honour which they seldom sought before      but now they by their own vain boasts were tied        and forced at least in show to prize it more   190 but sharp remembrance on the english part        and shame of being matchd by such a foe      rouse conscious virtue up in every heart        and seeming to be stronger makes them so  191  nor long the belgians could that fleet sustain        which did two generals fates and cæsars bear      each several ship a victory did gain        as rupert or as albemarle were there   192 their batterd admiral too soon withdrew        unthankd by ours for his unfinishd fight      but he the minds of his dutch masters knew        who calld that providence which we calld flight   193 never did men more joyfully obey        or sooner understood the sign to fly      with such alacrity they bore away        as if to praise them all the states stood by   194 o famous leader46 of the belgian fleet        thy monument inscribed such praise shall wear      as varro timely flying once did meet        because he did not of his rome despair   195 behold that navy which a while before        provoked the tardy english close to fight      now draw their beaten vessels close to shore        as larks lie dared to shun the hobbys flight   196 whoeer would english monuments survey        in other records may our courage know      but let them hide the story of this day        whose fame was blemishd by too base a foe   197 or if too busily they will inquire        into a victory which we disdain      then let them know the belgians did retire        before the patron saint47 of injured spain   198 repenting england this revengeful day        to philips manes did an offering bring      england which first by

211 each element his dread command obeys        who makes or ruins with a smile or frown      who as by one he did our nation raise        so now he with another pulls us down   212 yet london empress of the northern clime        by an high fate thou greatly didst expire      great as the worlds which at the death of time        must fall and rise a nobler frame by fire   213 as when some dire usurper48 heaven provides        to scourge his country with a lawless sway      his birth perhaps some petty village hides        and sets his cradle out of fortunes way   214 till fully ripe his swelling fate breaks out        and hurries him to mighty mischiefs on      his prince surprised at first no ill could doubt        and wants the power to meet it when tis known   215 such was the rise of this prodigious fire        which in mean buildings first obscurely bred      from thence did soon to open streets aspire        and straight to palaces and temples spread   216 the diligence of trades and noiseful gain        and luxury more late asleep were laid      all was the nights and in her silent reign        no sound the rest of nature did invade   217 in this deep quiet from what source unknown        those seeds of fire their fatal birth disclose      and first few scattering sparks about were blown        big with the flames that to our ruin rose   218 then in some closepent room it crept along        and smouldering as it went in silence fed      till the infant monster with devouring strong        walkd boldly upright with exalted head   219 now like some rich or mighty murderer        too great for prison which he breaks with gold      who fresher for new mischiefs does appear        and dares the world to tax him with the old   220 so scapes the insulting fire his narrow jail        and makes small outlets into open air      there the fierce winds his tender force assail        and beat him downward to his first repair   221 the winds like crafty courtesans withheld        his flames from burning but to blow them more      and every fresh attempt he is repelld        with faint denials weaker than before   222 and now no longer letted49 of his prey        he leaps up at it with enraged desire      oerlooks the neighbours with a wide survey        and nods at every house his threatening fire   223 the ghosts of traitors from the bridge descend        with bold fanatic spectres to rejoice      about the fire into a dance they bend        and sing their sabbath notes with feeble voice   224 our guardian angel saw them where they sate        above the palace of our slumbering king      he sighd abandoning his charge to fate        and drooping oft lookd back upon the wing   225 at length the crackling noise and dreadful blaze        calld up some waking lover to the sight      and long it was ere he the rest could raise        whose heavy eyelids yet were full of night   226 the next to danger hot pursued by fate        halfclothed halfnaked hastily retire      and frighted mothers strike their breasts too late        for helpless infants left amidst the fire   227 their cries soon waken all the dwellers near        now murmuring noises rise in every street      the more remote run stumbling with their fear        and in the dark men jostle as they meet   228 so weary bees in little cells repose        but if nightrobbers lift the wellstored hive      an humming through their waxen city grows        and out upon each others wings they drive   229 now streets grow throngd and busy as by day        some run for buckets to the hallowd quire      some cut the pipes and some the engines play        and some more bold mount ladders to the fire   230 in vain for from the east a belgian wind        his hostile breath through the dry rafters sent      the flames impelld soon left their foes behind        and forward with a wanton fury went   231 a quay of fire ran all along the shore        and lightend all the river with a blaze      the wakend tides began again to roar        and wondering fish in shining waters gaze   232 old father thames raised up his reverend head        but feard the fate of simois would return      deep in his ooze he sought his sedgy bed        and shrunk his waters back into his urn   233 the fire meantime walks in a broader gross        to either hand his wings he opens wide      he wades the streets and straight he reaches cross        and plays his longing flames on the other side   234 at first they warm then scorch and then they take        now with long necks from side to side they feed      at length grown strong their motherfire forsake        and a new colony of flames succeed   235 to every nobler portion of the town        the curling billows roll their restless tide      in parties now they straggle up and down        as armies unopposed for prey divide   236 one mighty squadron with a sidewind sped        through narrow lanes his cumberd fire does haste      by powerful charms of gold and silver led        the lombard bankers and the change to waste   237 another backward to the tower would go        and slowly eats his way against the wind      but the main body of the marching foe        against the imperial palace is designd   238 now day appears and with the day the king        whose early care had robbd him of his rest      far off the cracks of falling houses ring        and shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast   239 near as he draws thick harbingers of smoke        with gloomy pillars cover all the place      whose little intervals of night are broke        by sparks that drive against his sacred face   240 more than his guards his sorrows made him known        and pious tears which down his cheeks did shower      the wretched in his grief forgot their own        so much the pity of a king has power   241 he wept the flames of what he loved so well        and what so well had merited his love      for never prince in grace did more excel        or royal city more in duty strove   242 nor with an idle care did he behold        subjects may grieve but monarchs must redress      he cheers the fearful and commends the bold        and makes despairers hope for good success   243 himself directs what first is to be done        and orders all the succours which they bring      the helpful and the good about him run        and form an army worthy such a king   244 he sees the dire contagion spread so fast        that where it seizes all relief is vain      and therefore must unwillingly lay waste        that country which would else the foe maintain   245 the powder blows up all before the fire        the amazèd flames stand gatherd on a heap      and from the precipices brink retire        afraid to venture on so large a leap   246 thus fighting fires a while themselves consume        but straight like turks forced on to win or die      they first lay tender bridges of their fume        and oer the breach in unctuous vapours fly   247 part stay for passage till a gust of wind        ships oer their forces in a shining sheet      part creeping under ground their journey blind        and climbing from below their fellows meet   248 thus to some desert plain or old woodside        dire nighthags come from far to dance their round      and oer broad rivers on their fiends they ride        or sweep in clouds above the blasted ground   249 no help avails for hydralike the fire        lifts up his hundred heads to aim his way      and scarce the wealthy can one half retire        before he rushes in to share the prey   250 the rich grow suppliant and the poor grow proud        those offer mighty gain and these ask more      so void of pity is the ignoble crowd        when others ruin may increase their store   251 as those who live by shores with joy behold        some wealthy vessel split or stranded nigh      and from the rocks leap down for shipwreckd gold        and seek the tempests which the others fly   252 so these but wait the owners last despair        and whats permitted to the flames invade      even from their jaws they hungry morsels tear        and on their backs the spoils of vulcan lade   253 the days were all in this lost labour spent        and when the weary king gave place to night      his beams he to his royal brother lent        and so shone still in his reflective light   254 night came but without darkness or repose        a dismal picture of the general doom      where souls distracted when the trumpet blows        and half unready with their bodies come   255 those who have homes when home they do repair        to a last lodging call their wandering friends      their short uneasy sleeps are broke with care        to look how near their own destruction tends   256 those who have none sit round where once it was        and with full eyes each wonted room require      haunting the yet warm ashes of the place        as murderd men walk where they did expire   257 some stir up coals and watch the vestal fire        others in vain from sight of ruin run      and while through burning labyrinths they retire        with loathing eyes repeat what they would shun   258 the most in fields like herded beasts lie down        to dews obnoxious on the grassy floor      and while their babes in sleep their sorrows drown        sad parents watch the remnants of their store   259 while by the motion of the flames they guess        what streets are burning now and what are near      an infant waking to the paps would press        and meets instead of milk a falling tear   260 no thought can ease them but their sovereigns care        whose praise the afflicted as their comfort sing      even those whom want might drive to just despair        think life a blessing under such a king   261 meantime he sadly suffers in their grief        outweeps an hermit and outprays a saint      all the long night he studies their relief        how they may be supplied and he may want   262 o god said he thou patron of my days        guide of my youth in exile and distress      who me unfriended broughtst by wondrous ways        the kingdom of my fathers to possess   263 be thou my judge with what unwearied care        i since have labourd for my peoples good      to bind the bruises of a civil war        and stop the issues of their wasting blood   264 thou who hast taught me to forgive the ill        and recompense as friends the good misled      if mercy be a precept of thy will        return that mercy on thy servants head   265 or if my heedless youth has steppd astray        too soon forgetful of thy gracious hand      on me alone thy just displeasure lay        but take thy judgments from this mourning land   266 we all have sinnd and thou hast laid us low        as humble earth from whence at first we came      like flying shades before the clouds we show        and shrink like parchment in consuming flame   267 o let it be enough what thou hast done        when spotted deaths ran armd through every street      with poisond darts which not the good could shun        the speedy could outfly or valiant meet   268 the living few and frequent funerals then        proclaimd thy wrath on this forsaken place      and now those few who are returnd again        thy searching judgments to their dwellings trace   269 o pass not lord an absolute decree        or bind thy sentence unconditional      but in thy sentence our remorse foresee        and in that foresight this thy doom recall   270 thy threatenings lord as thine thou mayst revoke        but if immutable and fixd they stand      continue still thyself to give the stroke        and let not foreign foes oppress thy land   271 the eternal heard and from the heavenly quire        chose out the cherub with the flaming sword      and bade him swiftly drive the approaching fire        from where our naval magazines were stored   272 the blessed minister his wings displayd        and like a shooting star he cleft the night      he charged the flames and those that disobeyd        he lashd to duty with his sword of light   273 the fugitive flames chastised went forth to prey        on pious structures by our fathers reard      by which to heaven they did affect the way        ere faith in churchmen without works was heard   274 the wanting orphans saw with watery eyes        their founders charity in dust laid low      and sent to god their everanswered cries        for he protects the poor who made them so   275 nor could thy fabric pauls defend thee long        though thou wert sacred to thy makers praise      though made immortal by a poets song        and poets songs the theban walls could raise   276 the daring flames peepd in and saw from far        the awful beauties of the sacred quire      but since it was profaned by civil war        heaven thought it fit to have it purged by fire   277 now down the narrow streets it swiftly came        and widely opening did on both sides prey      this benefit we sadly owe the flame        if only ruin must enlarge our way   278 and now four days the sun had seen our woes        four nights the moon beheld the incessant fire      it seemd as if the stars more sickly rose        and farther from the feverish north retire   279 in th empyrean heaven the blessd abode        the thrones and the dominions prostrate lie      not daring to behold their angry god        and a hushd silence damps the tuneful sky   280 at length the almighty cast a pitying eye        and mercy softly touchd his melting breast      he saw the towns one half in rubbish lie        and eager flames drive on to storm the rest   281 an hollow crystal pyramid he takes        in firmamental waters dipt above      of it a broad extinguisher he makes        and hoods the flames that to their quarry drove   282 the vanquishd fires withdraw from every place        or full with feeding sink into a sleep      each household genius shows again his face        and from the hearths the little lares creep   283 our king this more than natural change beholds        with sober joy his heart and eyes abound      to the allgood his lifted hands he folds        and thanks him low on his redeemed ground   284 as when sharp frosts had long constraind the earth        a kindly thaw unlocks it with mild rain      and first the tender blade peeps up to birth        and straight the green fields laugh with promised grain   285 by such degrees the spreading gladness grew        in every heart which fear had froze before      the standing streets with so much joy they view        that with less grief the perishd they deplore   286 the father of the people opend wide        his stores and all the poor with plenty fed      thus gods anointed gods own place supplied        and filld the empty with his daily bread   287 this royal bounty brought its own reward        and in their minds so deep did print the sense      that if their ruins sadly they regard        tis but with fear the sight might drive him thence   288 but so may he live long that town to sway        which by his auspice they will nobler make      as he will hatch their ashes by his stay        and not their humble ruins now forsake   289 they have not lost their loyalty by fire        nor is their courage or their wealth so low      that from his wars they poorly would retire        or beg the pity of a vanquishd foe   290 not with more constancy the jews of old        by cyrus from rewarded exile sent      their royal city did in dust behold        or with more vigour to rebuild it went   291 the utmost malice of their stars is past        and two dire comets which have scourged the town      in their own plague and fire have breathed the last        or dimly in their sinking sockets frown   292 now frequent trines the happier lights among        and highraised jove from his dark prison freed      those weights took off that on his planet hung        will gloriously the newlaid work succeed   293 methinks already from this chemic flame        i see a city of more precious mould      rich as the town which gives the indies name        with silver paved and all divine with gold   294 already labouring with a mighty fate        she shakes the rubbish from her mounting brow      and seems to have renewd her charters date        which heaven will to the death of time allow   295 more great than human now and more august        now deified she from her fires does rise      her widening streets on new foundations trust        and opening into larger parts she flies   296 before she like some shepherdess did show        who sat to bathe her by a rivers side      not answering to her fame but rude and low        nor taught the beauteous arts of modern pride   297 now like a maiden queen she will behold        from her high turrets hourly suitors come      the east with incense and the west with gold        will stand like suppliants to receive her doom   298 the silver thames her own domestic flood        shall bear her vessels like a sweeping train      and

and poets vainly strove   in every age the lumpish mass to move   but those were pedants when compared with these   who know not only to instruct but please   poets alone found the delightful way   mysterious morals gently to convey   in charming numbers so that as men grew   pleased with their poems they grew wiser too                      10   satire has always shone among the rest   and is the boldest way if not the best   to tell men freely of their foulest faults   to laugh at their vain deeds and vainer thoughts   in satire too the wise took different ways   to each deserving its peculiar praise   some did all folly with just sharpness blame   whilst others laughd and scornd them into shame   but of these two the last succeeded best   as men aim rightest when they shoot in jest                        20   yet if we may presume to blame our guides   and censure those who censure all besides   in other things they justly are preferrd   in this alone methinks the ancients

receive none the design i am sure is honest but he who draws his pen for one party must expect to make enemies of the other for wit and fool are consequence of whig and tory and every man is a knave or an ass to the contrary side there is a treasury of merits in the fanatic church as well as in the popish and a pennyworth to be had of saintship honesty and poetry for the lewd the factious and the blockheads but the longest chapter in deuteronomy has not curses enough for an antibromingham my comfort is their manifest prejudice to my cause will render their judgment of less authority against me yet if a poem have genius it will force its own reception in the world for there is a sweetness in good verse which tickles even while it hurts and no man can be heartily angry with him who pleases him against his will the commendation  of adversaries is the greatest triumph of a writer because it never comes unless extorted but i can be satisfied on more easy terms if i happen to please the more moderate sort i shall be sure of an honest party and in all probability of the best judges for the least concerned are commonly the least corrupt and i confess i have laid in for those by rebating the satire where justice would allow it from carrying too sharp an edge they who can criticise so weakly as to imagine i have done my worst may be convinced at their own cost that i can write severely with more ease than i can gently i have but laughed at some mens follies when i could have declaimed against their vices and other mens virtues i have commended as freely as i have taxed their crimes and now if you are a malicious reader i expect you should return upon me that i affect to be thought more impartial than i am but if men are not to be judged by their professions god forgive you commonwealthsmen for professing so plausibly for the government you cannot be so unconscionable as to charge me for not subscribing my name for that would reflect too grossly upon your own party who never dare though they have the advantage of a jury to secure them if you like not my poem the fault may possibly be in my writing though it is hard for an author to judge against himself but more probably it is in your morals which cannot bear the truth of it the violent on both sides will condemn the character of absalom as either too favourably or too hardly drawn but they are not the violent whom i desire to please the fault on the right hand is to extenuate palliate and indulge and to confess freely i have endeavoured to commit it besides the respect which i owe his birth i have a greater for his heroic virtues and david himself could not be more tender of the young mans life than i would be of his reputation but since the most excellent natures are always the most easy and as being such are the soonest perverted by ill counsels especially when baited with fame and glory it is no more a wonder that he withstood not the temptations of achitophel than it was for adam not to have resisted the two devils the serpent and the woman the conclusion of the story i purposely forbore to prosecute because i could not obtain from myself to show absalom unfortunate the frame of it was cut out but for a picture to the waist and if the draught be so far true it is as much as i designed  were i the inventor who am only the historian i should certainly conclude the piece with the reconcilement of absalom to david and who knows but this may come to pass things were not brought to an extremity where i left the story there seems yet to be room left for a composure hereafter there may be only for pity i have not so much as an uncharitable wish against achitophel but am content to be accused of a goodnatured error and to hope with origen that the devil himself may at last be saved for which reason in this poem he is neither brought to set his house in order nor to dispose of his person afterwards as he in wisdom shall think fit god is infinitely merciful and his vicegerent is only not so because he is not infinite  the true end of satire is the amendment of vices by correction and he who writes honestly is no more an enemy to the offender than the physician to the patient when he prescribes harsh remedies to an inveterate disease for those are only in order to prevent the chirurgeons work of an ense rescindendum which i wish not to my very enemies to conclude all if the body politic have any analogy to the natural in my weak judgment an act of oblivion were as necessary in a hot distempered state as an opiate would be in a raging fever

they cursed the memory of civil wars   the moderate sort of men thus qualified   inclined the balance to the better side   and davids mildness managed it so well   the bad found no occasion to rebel

is the representation of your own hero it is the picture drawn at length which you admire and prize so much in little none of your ornaments are wanting neither the landscape of your tower nor the rising sun nor the anno domini of your new sovereigns coronation this must needs be a grateful undertaking to your whole party especially to those who have not been so happy as to purchase the original i hear the graver has made a good market of it all his kings are bought up already or the value of the remainder so enhanced that many a poor polander who would be glad to worship the image is not able to go to the cost of him but must be content to see him here i must confess i am no great artist but signpost painting  will serve the turn to remember a friend by especially when better is not to be had yet for your comfort the lineaments are true and though he sat not five times to me as he did to b yet i have consulted history as the italian painters do when they would draw a nero or a caligula though they have not seen the man they can help their imagination by a statue of him and find out the colouring from suetonius and tacitus truth is you might have spared one side of your medal the head would be seen to more advantage if it were placed on a spike of the tower a little nearer to the sun which would then break out to better purpose  you tell us in your preface to the noprotestant plot77 that you shall be forced hereafter to leave off your modesty i suppose you mean that little which is left you for it was worn to rags when you put out this medal never was there practised such a piece of notorious impudence in the face of an established government i believe when he is dead you will wear him in thumb rings as the turks did scanderbeg as if there were virtue in his bones to preserve you against monarchy yet all this while you pretend not only zeal for the public good but a due veneration for the person of the king but all men who can see an inch before them may easily detect those gross fallacies that it is necessary for men in your circumstances to pretend both is granted you for without them there could be no ground to raise a faction but i would ask you one civil question what right has any man among you or any association of men to come nearer to you who out of parliament cannot be considered in a public capacity to meet as you daily do in factious clubs to vilify the government in your discourses and to libel it in all your writings who made you judges in israel or how is it consistent with your zeal for the public welfare to promote sedition does your definition of loyal which is to serve the king according to the laws allow you the licence of traducing the executive power with which you own he is invested you complain that his majesty has lost the love and confidence of his people and by your very urging it you endeavour what in you lies to make him lose them all good subjects abhor the thought of arbitrary power whether it be in one or many if you were the patriots you would seem you would not at this rate incense the multitude to assume it for no sober man can fear it either from the kings disposition or his practice or even where you would odiously lay it from his ministers give us leave to enjoy the government and the benefit of laws under which we were born and which we desire to transmit to our posterity you are not the trustees of the public liberty and if you have not right to petition in a crowd much less have you to intermeddle in the management of affairs or to arraign what you do not like which in effect is everything that is done by the king and council can you imagine that any reasonable man will believe you respect the person of his majesty when it is apparent that your seditious pamphlets are stuffed with particular reflections on him if you have the confidence to deny this it is easy to be evinced from a thousand passages which i only forbear to quote because i desire they should die and be forgotten i have perused many of your papers and to show you that i have the third part of your noprotestant plot is much  of it stolen from your dead authors pamphlet called the growth of popery as manifestly as miltons defence of the english people is from buchanan de jure regni apud scotos or your first covenant and new association from the holy league of the french guisards any one who reads davila may trace your practices all along there were the same pretences for reformation and loyalty the same aspersions of the king and the same grounds of a rebellion i know not whether you will take the historians word who says it was reported that poltrot a huguenot murdered francis duke of guise by the instigations of theodore beza or that it was a huguenot minister otherwise called a presbyterian for our church abhors so devilish a tenet who first writ a treatise of the lawfulness of deposing and murdering kings of a different persuasion in religion but i am able to prove from the doctrine of calvin and principles of buchanan that they set the people above the magistrate which if i mistake not is your own fundamental and which carries your loyalty no further than your liking when a vote of the house of commons goes on your side you are as ready to observe it as if it were passed into a law but when you are pinched with any former and yet unrepealed act of parliament you declare that in some cases you will not be obliged by it the passage is in the same third part of the noprotestant plot and is too plain to be denied the late copy of your intended association you neither wholly justify nor condemn but as the papists when they are unopposed fly out into all the pageantries of worship but in times of war when they are hard pressed by arguments lie close intrenched behind the council of trent so now when your affairs are in a low condition you dare not pretend that to be a legal combination but whensoever you are afloat i doubt not but it will be maintained and justified to purpose for indeed there is nothing to defend it but the sword it is the proper time to say anything when men have all things in their power  in the mean time you would fain be nibbling at a parallel betwixt this association and that in the time of queen elizabeth78 but there is this small difference betwixt them that the ends of one are directly opposite to the other one with the queens approbation and conjunction as head of it the other without either the consent or knowledge of the king against whose authority it is manifestly designed therefore you do well to have recourse to your last evasion that it was contrived by your enemies and shuffled into the papers that were seized which yet you see the nation is not so easy to believe as your own jury but the matter is not difficult to find twelve men in newgate who would acquit a malefactor  i have only one favour to desire of you at parting that when you think of answering this poem you would employ the same pens against it who have combated with so much success against absalom and achitophel for then you may assure yourselves of a clear victory without the least reply rail at me abundantly and not to break a custom do it without wit by this method you will gain a considerable point which is wholly to waive the answer of my arguments never own the bottom of your principles for fear they should be treason fall severely on the miscarriages of government for if scandal be  not allowed you are no freeborn subjects if god has not blessed you with the talent of rhyming make use of my poor stock and welcome let your verses run upon my feet and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads reduced to the last extremity of sense turn my own lines upon me and in utter despair of your own satire make me satirize myself some of you have been driven to this bay already but above all the rest commend me to the nonconformist parson who writ the whip and key i am afraid it is not read so much as the piece deserves because the bookseller is every week crying help at the end of his gazette to get it off you see i am charitable enough to do him a kindness that it may be published as well as printed and that so much skill in hebrew derivations may not lie for wastepaper in the shop yet i half suspect he went no further for his learning than the index of hebrew names and etymologies which is printed at the end of some english bibles if achitophel signifies the brother of a fool the author of that poem will pass with his readers for the next of kin and perhaps it is the relation that makes the kindness whatever the verses are buy them up i beseech you out of pity for i hear the conventicle is shut up and the brother79 of achitophel out of service  now footmen you know have the generosity to make a purse for a member of their society who has had his livery pulled over his ears and even protestant socks are bought up among you out of veneration to the name a dissenter in poetry from sense and english will make as good a protestant rhymer as a dissenter from the church of england a protestant parson besides if you encourage a young beginner who knows but he may elevate his style a little above the vulgar epithets of profane and saucy jack and atheistic scribbler with which he treats me when the fit of enthusiasm is strong upon him by which wellmannered and charitable expressions i was certain of his sect before i knew his name what would you have more of a man he has damned me in your cause from genesis to the revelations and has half the texts of both the testaments against me if you will be so civil to yourselves as to take him for your interpreter and not to take them for irish witnesses after all perhaps you will tell me that you retained him only for the opening of your cause and that your main lawyer is yet behind now if it so happen he meet with no more reply than his predecessors you may either conclude that i trust to the goodness of my cause or fear my adversary or disdain him or what you please for the short of it is it is indifferent to your humble servant whatever your party says or thinks of him

boundless in his will   that kings can do no wrong we must believe   none can they do and must they all receive   help heaven or sadly we shall see an hour   when neither wrong nor right are in their power   already they have lost their best defence   the benefit of laws which they dispense                           140   no justice to their righteous cause allowd   but baffled by an arbitrary

yet all eyes may see   tis working in the immediate power to be   for from pretended grievances they rise   first to dislike and after to despise   then cycloplike in human flesh to deal   chop up a minister at every meal   perhaps not wholly to melt down the king   but clip his regal rights within the ring   from thence to assume the power of peace and war                  230   and ease him by

poem with so bold a title and a name prefixed from which the handling of so serious a subject would not be expected may reasonably oblige the author to say somewhat in defence both of himself and of his undertaking in the first place if it be objected to me that being a layman i ought not to have concerned myself with speculations which belong to the profession of divinity i could answer that perhaps laymen with equal advantages of parts and knowledge are not the most incompetent judges of sacred things but in the due sense of my own weakness and want of learning i plead not this i pretend not to make myself a judge of faith in others but only to make a confession of my own i lay no unhallowed hand upon the ark but wait on it with the reverence that becomes me at a distance in the next place i will ingenuously confess that the helps i have used in this small treatise were many of them taken from the works of our own reverend divines of the church of england so that the weapons with which i combat irreligion are already consecrated though i suppose they may be taken down as lawfully as the sword of goliah was by david when they are to be employed for the common cause against the enemies of piety i intend not by this to entitle them to any of my errors which yet i hope are only those of charity to mankind and such as my own charity has caused me to commit that of others may more easily excuse being naturally inclined to scepticism in philosophy i have no reason to impose my opinions in a subject which is above it but whatever they are i submit them with all reverence to my mother church accounting them no farther mine than as they are authorised or at least uncondemned by her and indeed to secure myself on this side i have used the necessary precaution of showing this paper before it was published to a judicious and learned friend a man indefatigably zealous in the service of the church and state and whose writings have highly deserved of both he was pleased to approve the body of the discourse and i hope he is more my friend than to do it out of complaisance it is true he had too good a taste to like it all and amongst some other faults recommended to my second view what i have written perhaps too boldly on st athanasius which he advised me wholly to omit i am sensible enough that i had done more prudently to have followed his opinion but then i could not have satisfied myself that i had done honestly not to have written what was my own it has always been my thought that heathens who never did nor without miracle could hear of the name of christ were yet in a possibility of salvation neither will it enter easily into my belief that before the coming of our saviour the whole world excepting only the jewish nation should lie under the inevitable necessity of everlasting punishment for want of that revelation which was confined to so small a spot of ground as that of palestine among the sons of noah we read of one only who was accursed and if a blessing in the ripeness of time was reserved for japhet of whose progeny we are it seems unaccountable to me why so many generations of the same offspring as preceded our saviour in the flesh should be all involved in one common condemnation and yet that their posterity should be entitled to the hopes of salvation as if a bill of exclusion had passed only on the fathers which debarred not the sons from their succession or that so many ages had been delivered over to hell and so many reserved for heaven and that the devil had the first choice and god the next truly i am apt to think that the revealed religion which was taught by noah to all his sons might continue for some ages in the whole posterity that afterwards it was included wholly in the family of shem is manifest but when the progenies of ham and japhet swarmed into colonies and those colonies were subdivided into many others in process of time their descendants lost by little and little the primitive and purer rites of divine worship retaining only the notion of one deity to which succeeding generations added others for men took their degrees in those ages from conquerors to gods revelation being thus eclipsed to almost all mankind the light of nature as the next in dignity was substituted and that is it which st paul concludes to be the rule of the heathens and by which they are hereafter to be judged if my supposition be true then the consequence which i have assumed in my poem may be also true namely that deism or the principles of natural worship are only the faint remnants or dying flames of revealed religion in the posterity of noah and that our modern philosophersnay and some of our philosophising divineshave too much exalted the faculties of our souls when they have maintained that by their force mankind has been able to find out that there is one supreme agent or intellectual being which we call god that praise and prayer are his due worship and the rest of those deducements which i am confident are the remote effects of revelation and unattainable by our discourse i mean as simply considered and without the benefit of divine illumination so that we have not lifted up ourselves to god by the weak pinions of our reason but he has been pleased to descend to us and what socrates said of him what plato writ and the rest of the heathen philosophers of several nations is all no more than the twilight of revelation after the sun of it was set in the race of noah that there is something above us some principle of motion our reason can apprehend though it cannot discover what it is by its own virtue and indeed it is very improbable that we who by the strength of our faculties cannot enter into the knowledge of any being not so much as of our own should be able to find out by them that supreme nature which we cannot otherwise define than by saying it is infinite as if infinite were definable or infinity a subject for our narrow understanding they who would prove religion by reason do but weaken the cause which they endeavour to support it is to take away the pillars from our faith and to prop it only with a twig it is to design a tower like that of babel which if it were possible as it is not to reach heaven would come to nothing by the confusion of the workmen for every man is building a several way impotently conceited of his own model and his own materials reason is always striving and always at a loss and of necessity it must so come to pass while it is exercised about that which is not its own proper object let us be content at last to know god by his own methods at least so much of him as he is pleased to reveal to us in the sacred scriptures to apprehend them to be the word of god is all our reason has to do for all beyond it is the work of faith which is the seal of heaven impressed upon our human understanding  and now for what concerns the holy bishop athanasius the preface of whose creed seems inconsistent with my opinion which is that heathens may possibly be saved in the first place i desire it may be considered that it is the preface only not the creed itself which till i am better informed is of too hard a digestion for my charity it is not that i am ignorant how many several texts of scripture seemingly support that cause but neither am i ignorant how all those texts may receive a kinder and more mollified interpretation every man who is read in church history knows that belief was drawn up after a long contestation with arius concerning the divinity of our blessed saviour and his being one substance with the father and that thus compiled it was sent abroad among the christian churches as a kind of test which whosoever took was looked upon as an orthodox believer it is manifest from hence that the heathen part of the empire was not concerned in it for its business was not to distinguish betwixt pagans and christians but betwixt heretics and true believers this well considered takes off the heavy weight of censure which i would willingly avoid from so venerable a man for if this proportion whosoever will be saved be restrained only to those to whom it was intended and for whom it was composed i mean the christians then the anathema reaches not the heathens who had never heard of christ and were nothing interested in that dispute after all i am far from blaming even that prefatory addition to the creed and as far from cavilling at the continuation of it in the liturgy of the church where on the days appointed it is publicly read for i suppose there is the same reason for it now in opposition to the socinians as there was then against the arians the one being a heresy which seems to have been refined out of the other and with how much more plausibility of reason it combats our religion with so much more caution it ought to be avoided therefore the prudence of our church is to be commended which has interposed her authority for the recommendation of this creed yet to such as are grounded in the true belief those explanatory creeds the nicene and this of athanasius might perhaps be spared for what is supernatural will always be a mystery in spite of exposition and for my own part the plain apostles creed is most suitable to my weak understanding as the simplest diet is the most easy of digestion  i have dwelt longer on this subject than i intended and longer than perhaps i ought for having laid down as my foundation that the scripture is a rule that in all things needful to salvation it is clear sufficient and ordained by god almighty for that purpose i have left myself no right to interpret obscure places such as concern the possibility of eternal happiness to heathens because whatsoever is obscure is concluded not necessary to be known  but by asserting the scripture to be the canon of oar faith i have unavoidably created to myself two sorts of enemies the papists indeed more directly because they have kept the scriptures from us what they could and have reserved to themselves a right of interpreting what they have delivered under the pretence of infallibility and the fanatics more collaterally because they have assumed what amounts to an infallibility in the private spirit and have detorted those texts of scripture which are not necessary to salvation to the damnable uses of sedition disturbance and destruction of the civil government to begin with the papists and to speak freely i think them the less dangerous at least in appearance to our present state for not only the penal laws are in force against them and their number is contemptible but also their peers and commons are excluded from parliament and consequently those laws in no probability of being repealed a general and uninterrupted plot of their clergy ever since the reformation i suppose all protestants believe for it is not reasonable to think but that so many of their orders as were outed from their fat possessions would endeavour a reentrance against those whom they account heretics as for the late design mr colemans letters for aught i know are the best evidence and what they discover without wiredrawing their sense or malicious glosses all men of reason conclude credible if there be anything more than this required of me i must believe it as well as i am able in spite of the witnesses and out of a decent conformity to the votes of parliament for i suppose the fanatics will not allow the private spirit in this case here the infallibility is at least in one part of the government and our understandings as well as our wills are represented but to return to the roman catholics how can we be secure from the practice of jesuited papists in that religion for not two or three of that order as some of them would impose upon us but almost the whole body of them are of opinion that their infallible master has a right over kings not only in spirituals but temporals not to name mariana bellarmine emanuel sa molina santare simancha85 and at least twenty others of foreign countries we can produce of our own nation campian and doleman or parsons besides many are named whom i have not read who all of them attest this doctrine that the pope can depose and give away the right of any sovereign prince si vel paulum deflexerit if he shall never so little warp but if he once comes to be excommunicated then the bond of obedience is taken off from subjects and they may and ought to drive him like another nebuchadnezzar ex hominum christianorum dominatu from exercising dominion over christians and to this they are bound by virtue of divine precept and by all the ties of conscience under no less penalty than damnation if they answer me as a learned priest has lately written that this doctrine of the jesuits is not de fide and that consequently they are not obliged by it they must pardon me if i think they have said nothing to the purpose for it is a maxim in their church where points of faith are not decided and that doctors are of contrary opinions they may follow which part they please but more safely the most received and most authorised and their champion bellarmine has told the world in his apology that the king of england is a vassal to the pope ratione directi domini and that he holds in villanage of his roman landlord which is no new claim put in for england our chronicles are his authentic witnesses that king john was deposed by the same plea and philip augustus admitted tenant and which makes the more for bellarmine the french king was again ejected when our king submitted to the church and the crown was received under the sordid condition of a vassalage  it is not sufficient for the more moderate and wellmeaning papists of which i doubt not there are many to produce the evidences of their loyalty to the late king and to declare their innocency in this plot i will grant their behaviour in the first to have been as loyal and as brave as they desire and will be willing to hold them excused as to the second i mean when it comes to my turn and after my betters for it is a madness to be sober alone while the nation continues drank but that saying of their father cres is still running in my head that they may be dispensed with in their obedience to an heretic prince while the necessity of the times shall oblige them to it for that as another of them tells us is only the effect of christian prudence but when once they shall get power to shake him off an heretic is no lawful king and consequently to rise against him is no rebellion i should be glad therefore that they would follow the advice which was charitably given them by a reverend prelate of our church namely that they would join in a public act of disowning and detesting those jesuitic principles and subscribe to all doctrines which deny the popes authority of deposing kings and releasing subjects from their oath of allegiance to which i should think they might easily be induced if it be true that this present pope has condemned the doctrine of kingkilling a thesis of the jesuits maintained amongst others ex cathedra as they call it or in open consistory  leaving them therefore in so fair a way if they please themselves of satisfying all reasonable men of their sincerity and good meaning to the government i shall make bold to consider that other extreme of our religioni mean the fanatics or schismatics of the english church since the bible has been translated into our tongue they have used it so as if their business was not to be saved but to be damned by its contents if we consider only them better had it been for the english nation that it had still remained in the original greek and hebrew or at least in the honest latin of st jerome than that several texts in it should have been prevaricated to the destruction of that government which put it into so ungrateful hands  how many heresies the first translation of tindal produced in few years let my lord herberts history of henry viii inform you insomuch that for the gross errors in it and the great mischiefs it occasioned a sentence passed on the first edition of the bible too shameful almost to be repeated after the short reign of edward vi who had continued to carry on the reformation on other principles than it was begun every one knows that not only the chief promoters of that work but many others whose consciences would not dispense with popery were forced for fear of persecution to change climates from whence returning at the beginning of queen elizabeths reign many of them who had been in france and at geneva brought back the rigid opinions and imperious discipline of calvin to graft upon our reformation which though they cunningly concealed at first as well knowing how nauseously that drug would go down in a lawful monarchy which was prescribed for a rebellious commonwealth yet they always kept it in reserve and were never wanting to themselves either in court or parliament when either they had any prospect of a numerous party of fanatic members of the one or the encouragement of any favourite in the other whose covetousness was gaping at the patrimony of the church they who will consult the works of our venerable hooker or the account of his life or more particularly the letter written to him on this subject by george cranmer may see by what gradations they proceeded from the dislike of cap and surplice the very next step was admonitions to the parliament against the whole government ecclesiastical then came out volumes in english and latin in defence of their tenets and immediately practices were set on foot to erect their discipline without authority those not succeeding satire and railing was the next and martin marprelate the marvel of those times was the first presbyterian scribbler who sanctified libels and scurrility to the use of the good old cause which was done says my author upon this account that their serious treatises having been fully answered and refuted they might compass by railing what they had lost by reasoning and when their cause was sunk in court and parliament they might at least hedge in a stake amongst the rabble for to their ignorance all things are wit which are abusive but if church and state were made the theme then the doctoral degree of wit was to be taken at billingsgate even the most saintlike of the party though they durst not excuse this contempt and vilifying of the government yet were pleased and grinned at it with a pious smile and called it a judgment of god against the hierarchy thus sectaries we may see were born with teeth foulmouthed and scurrilous from their infancy and if spiritual pride venom violence contempt of superiors and slander had been the marks of orthodox belief the presbytery and the rest of our schismatics which are their spawn were always the most visible church in the christian world  it is true the government was too strong at that time for a rebellion but to show what proficiency they had made in calvins school even then their mouths watered at it for two of their gifted brotherhood hacket86 and coppinger as the story tells us got up into a peasecart and harangue the people to dispose them to an insurrection and to establish their discipline by force so that however it comes about that now they celebrate queen elizabeths birthnight as that of their saint and patroness yet then they were for doing the work of the lord by arms against her and in all probability they wanted but a fanatic lord mayor and two sheriffs of their party to have compassed it  our venerable hooker after many admonitions which he had given them towards the end of his preface breaks out into this prophetic speech there is in every one of these considerations most just cause to fear lest our hastiness to embrace a thing of so perilous consequence meaning the presbyterian discipline should cause posterity to feel those evils which as yet are more easy for us to prevent than they would be for them to remedy  how fatally this cassandra has foretold we know too well by sad experience the seeds were sown in the time of queen elizabeth the bloody harvest ripened in the reign of king charles the martyr and because all the sheaves could not be carried off without shedding some of the loose grains another crop is too like to follow nay i fear it is unavoidable if the conventiclers be permitted still to scatter  a man may be suffered to quote an adversary to our religion when he speaks truth and it is the observation of maimbourg in his history of calvinism that wherever that discipline was planted and embraced rebellion civil war and misery attended it and how indeed should it happen otherwise reformation of church and state has always been the ground of our divisions in england while we were papists our holy father rid us by pretending authority out of the scriptures to depose princes when we shook off his authority the sectaries furnished themselves with the same weapons and out of the same magazine the bible so that the scriptures which are in themselves the greatest security of governors as commanding express obedience to them are now turned to their destruction and never since the reformation has there wanted a text of their interpreting to authorise a rebel and it is to be noted by the way that the doctrines of kingkilling and deposing which have been taken up only by the worst party of the papists the most frontless flatterers of the popes authority have been espoused defended and are still maintained by the whole body of nonconformists and republicans it is but dubbing themselves the people of god which it is the interest of their preachers to tell them they are and their own interest to believe and after that they cannot dip into the bible but one text or another will turn up for their purpose if they are under persecution as they call it then that is a mark of their election if they flourish then god works miracles for their deliverance and the saints are to possess the earth  they may think themselves to be too roughly handled in this paper but i who know best how far i could have gone on this subject must be bold to tell them they are spared though at the same time i am not ignorant that they interpret the mildness of a writer to them as they do the mercy of the government in the one they think it fear and conclude it weakness in the other the best way for them to confute me is as i before advised the papists to disclaim their principles and renounce their practices we shall all be glad to think them true englishmen when they obey the king and true protestants when they conform to the church discipline  it remains that i acquaint the reader that these verses were written for an ingenious young gentleman87 my friend upon his translation of the critical history of the old testament composed by the learned father simon the verses therefore are addressed to the translator of that work and the style of them is what it ought to be epistolary  if any one be so lamentable a critic as to require the smoothness the numbers and the turn of heroic poetry in this poem i must tell him that if he has not read horace i have studied him and hope the style of his epistles is not ill imitated here the expressions of a poem designed purely for instruction ought to be plain and natural and yet majestic for here the poet is presumed to be a kind of lawgiver and those three qualities which i have named are proper to the legislative style the florid elevated and figurative way is for the passions for love and hatred fear and anger are begotten in the soul by showing their objects out of their true proportion either greater than the life or less but instruction is to be given by showing them what they naturally are a man is to be cheated into passion but to be reasoned into truth                                         dim as the borrowd beams of moon and stars   to lonely weary wandering travellers   is reason to the soul and as on high   those rolling fires discover but the sky   not light us here so reasons glimmering ray   was lent not to assure our doubtful way   but guide us upward to a better day   and as those nightly tapers disappear   when days bright lord ascends our hemisphere   so pale grows reason at

hard for man to doom to endless pains   all who believed not all his zeal required   unless he first could prove he was inspired   then let us either think he meant to say   this faith where publishd was the only way   or else conclude that arius to confute                           220   the good old man too eager in dispute   flew high and as his christian fury rose   damnd all for heretics who

  thy matchless authors work which thou my friend   by well translating better dost commend   those youthful hours which of thy equals most                     230   in toys have squanderd or in vice

our author not too much a priest   for fashionsake he seems to have recourse   to pope and councils and traditions force   but he that old traditions could subdue   could not but find the weakness of the new   if scripture though derived from heavenly birth   has been but carelessly preserved on earth   if gods own people who of god before                             260   knew what we know and had been promised more   in fuller terms of heavens assisting care   and who did neither time nor study spare   to keep this book untainted unperplexd   let in gross errors to corrupt the text

from time are not secured                        270   how can we think have oral sounds endured   which thus transmitted if one mouth has faild   immortal lies on ages are entaild   and that some such have been is proved too plain   if we consider interest church and gain     o but says one tradition set aside   where can we hope for an unerring guide   for since the original scripture has been lost   all copies disagreeing maimd the most   or christian faith can have no certain ground                     280   or truth in church tradition must be found     such an omniscient church we wish indeed   twere worth both testaments cast in the creed   but if this mother be a guide so sure   as can all doubts resolve all truth secure   then her infallibility as well   where copies are corrupt or lame can tell   restore lost canon with as little pains   as truly explicate what still remains   which yet no council dare pretend to do                           290   unless like esdras they could write it new   strange confidence still to interpret true   yet not be sure that all they have explaind   is in the blest original containd   more safe and much more modest tis to say   god would not leave mankind without a way   and that the scriptures though not every where   free from corruption or entire or clear   are uncorrupt sufficient clear entire   in all things which our needful faith require                     300   if others in the same glass better see   tis for themselves they look but not for me   for my salvation must its doom receive   not from what others but what i believe     must all tradition then be set aside   this to affirm were ignorance or pride   are there not many points some needful sure   to saving faith that scripture leaves obscure   which every sect will wrest a several way   for what one sect interprets all sects may                       310   we hold and say we prove from scripture plain   that christ is god the bold socinian   from the same scripture urges hes but man   now what appeal can end the important suit   both parts talk loudly but the rule is mute     shall i speak plain and in a nation free   assume an honest laymans liberty   i think according to my little skill   to my own mother church submitting still   that many have been saved and many may                           320   who never heard this question brought in play   th unletterd christian who believes in gross   plods on to heaven and neer is at a loss   for the strait gate would be made straiter yet   were none admitted there but men of wit   the few by nature formd with learning fraught   born to instruct as others to be taught   must study well the sacred page and see   which doctrine this or that does best agree   with the whole tenor of the work divine                           330   and plainliest points to heavens reveald design   which exposition flows from genuine sense   and which is forced by wit and eloquence   not that traditions parts are useless here   when general old disinteressd and clear   that ancient fathers thus expound the page   gives truth the reverend majesty of age   confirms its force by biding every test   for best authoritys next rules are best   and still the nearer to the spring we go                          340   more limpid more unsoild the waters flow   thus first traditions were a proof alone   could we be certain such they were so known   but since some flaws in long descent may be   they make not truth but probability   even arius and pelagius durst provoke   to what the centuries preceding spoke   such difference is there in an ofttold tale   but truth by its own sinews will prevail   tradition written therefore more commends                        350   authority than what from voice descends   and this as perfect as its kind can be   rolls down to us the sacred history   which from the universal church received   is tried and after for itself believed       the partial papists would infer from hence   their church in last resort should judge the sense   but first they would assume with wondrous art   themselves to be the whole who are but part   of that vast frame the church yet grant they were                 360   the handers down can they from thence infer   a right to interpret or would they alone   who brought the present claim it for their own   the books a common largess to mankind   not more for them than every man designd   the welcome news is in the letter found   the carriers not commissioned to expound   it speaks itself and what it does contain   in all things needful to be known is plain       in times oergrown with rust and ignorance                     370   a gainful trade their clergy did advance   when want of learning kept the laymen low   and none but priests were authorised to know   when what small knowledge was in them did dwell   and he a god who could but read and spell   then mother church did mightily prevail   she parcelld out the bible by retail   but still expounded what she sold or gave   to keep it in her power to damn and save   scripture was scarce and as the market went                      380   poor laymen took salvation on content   as needy men take money good or bad   gods word they had not but th priests they had   yet whateer false conveyances they made   the lawyer still was certain to be paid   in those dark times they learnd their knack so well   that by long use they grew infallible   at last a knowing age began to inquire   if they the book or that did them inspire   and making narrower search they found though late               390   that what they thought the priests was their estate   taught by the will produced the written word   how long they had been cheated on record   then every man who saw the title fair   claimd a childs part and put in for a share   consulted soberly his private good   and saved himself as cheap as eer he could     tis true my friend and far be flattery hence   this good had full as bad a consequence   the book thus put in every vulgar hand                            400   which each presumed he best could understand   the common rule was

member of a company   was of his trade and of the bible free    plain truths enough for needful use they found   but men would still be itching to expound                         410   each was ambitious of the obscurest place   no measure taen from knowledge all from grace   study and pains were now no more their care   texts were explaind by fasting and by prayer   this was the fruit the private spirit brought   occasiond by great zeal and little thought   while crowds unlearnd with rude devotion warm   about the sacred viands buzz and swarm   the flyblown text creates a crawling brood   and turns to maggots what was meant for food                      420   a thousand daily sects rise up and die   a thousand more the perishd race supply   so all we make of heavens discoverd

ignorance and pride to stem   neither so rich a treasure to forego   nor proudly seek beyond our power to know                         430   faith is not built on disquisitions vain   the things we must believe are few and plain   but since men will believe more than they need   and every man will make himself a creed   in doubtful questions tis the safest way   to learn what unsuspected ancients say   for tis not likely we should higher soar   in search of heaven than all the church before   nor can we be deceived unless we see   the scripture and the fathers disagree                            440   if after all they stand suspected still   for no mans faith depends upon his will   tis some relief that points not clearly known   without much hazard may be let alone   and after hearing what our church can say   if still our reason runs another way   that private reason tis more just to curb   than by disputes the public peace disturb   for points obscure are of small use to learn   but common quiet is mankinds concern                             450       thus have i made my own opinions clear   yet neither praise expect nor censure fear   and this unpolishd rugged verse

is in too high a ferment for me to expect either fair war or even so much as fair quarter from a reader of the opposite party all men are engaged either on this side or that and though conscience is the common word which is given by both yet if a writer fall among enemies and cannot give the marks of their conscience he is knocked down before the reasons of his own are heard a preface therefore which is but a bespeaking of favour is altogether useless what i desire the reader should know concerning me he will find in the body of the poem if he have but the patience to peruse it only this advertisement let him take beforehand which relates to the merits of the cause no general characters of parties call them either sects or churches can be so fully and exactly drawn as to comprehend all the several members of them at least all such as are received under that denomination for example there are some of the church by law established who envy not liberty of conscience to dissenters as being well satisfied that according to their own principles they ought not to persecute them yet these by reason of their fewness i could not distinguish from the numbers of the rest with whom they are embodied in one common name on the other side there are many of our sects and more indeed than i could reasonably have hoped who have withdrawn themselves from the communion of the panther and embraced this gracious indulgence of his majesty in point of toleration but neither to the one nor the other of these is this satire any way intended it is aimed only at the refractory and disobedient on either side for those who are come over to the royal party are consequently supposed to be out of gunshot our physicians have observed that in process of time some diseases have abated of their virulence and have in a manner worn out their malignity so as to be no longer mortal and why may not i suppose the same concerning some of those who have formerly been enemies to kingly government as well as catholic religion i hope they have now another notion of both as having found by comfortable experience that the doctrine of persecution is far from being an article of our faith  it is not for any private man to censure the proceedings of a foreign prince but without suspicion of flattery i may praise our own who has taken contrary measures and those more suitable to the spirit of christianity some of the dissenters in their addresses to his majesty have said that he has restored god to his empire over conscience i confess i dare not stretch the figure to so great a boldness but i may safely say that conscience is the royalty and prerogative of every private man he is absolute in his own breast and accountable to no earthly power for that which passes only betwixt god and him those who are driven into the fold are generally speaking rather made hypocrites than converts  this indulgence being granted to all the sects it ought in reason to be expected that they should both receive it and receive it thankfully for at this time of day to refuse the benefit and adhere to those whom they have esteemed their persecutors what is it else but publicly to own that they suffered not before for consciencesake but only out of pride and obstinacy to separate from a church for those impositions which they now judge may be lawfully obeyed after they have so long contended for their classical ordination not to speak of rites and ceremonies will they at length submit to an episcopal if they can go so far out of complaisance to their old enemies methinks a little reason should persuade them to take another step and see whither that would lead them  of the receiving this toleration thankfully i shall say no more than that they ought and i doubt not they will consider from what hand they received it it is not from a cyrus a heathen prince and a foreigner but from a christian king their native sovereign who expects a return in specie from them that the kindness which he has graciously shown them may be retaliated on those of his own persuasion  as for the poem in general i will only thus far satisfy the reader that it was neither imposed on me nor so much as the subject given me by any man it was written during the last winter and the beginning of this spring though with long interruptions of ill health and other hindrances about a fortnight before i had finished it his majestys declaration for liberty of conscience came abroad which if i had so soon expected i might have spared myself the labour of writing many things which are contained in the third part of it but i was always in some hope that the church of england might have been persuaded to have taken off the penal laws and the test which was one design of the poem when i proposed to myself the writing of it  it is evident that some part of it was only occasional and not first intended i mean that defence of myself to which every honest man is bound when he is injuriously attacked in print and i refer myself to the judgment of those who have read the answer to the defence of the late kings papers and that of the duchess in which last i was concerned how charitably i have been represented there i am now informed both of the author and supervisors of this pamphlet and will reply when i think he can affront me for i am of socratess opinion that all creatures cannot in the mean time let him consider whether he deserved not a more severe reprehension than i gave him formerly for using so little respect to the memory of those whom he pretended to answer and at his leisure look out for some original treatise of humility written by any protestant in english i believe i may say in any other tongue for the magnified piece of duncomb on that subject which either he must mean or none and with which another of his fellows has upbraided me was translated from the spanish of rodriguez though with the omission of the seventeenth the twentyfourth the twentyfifth and the last chapter which will be found in comparing of the books  he would have insinuated to the world that her late highness died not a roman catholic he declares himself to be now satisfied to the contrary in which he has given up the cause for matter of fact was the principal debate betwixt us in the mean time he would dispute the motives of her change how preposterously let all men judge when he seemed to deny the subject of the controversy the change itself and because i would not take up this ridiculous challenge he tells the world i cannot argue but he may as well infer that a catholic cannot fast because he will not take up the cudgels against mrs james to confute the protestant religion  i have but one word more to say concerning the poem as such and abstracting from the matters either religious or civil which are handled in it the first part consisting most in general characters and narration i have endeavoured to raise and give it the majestic turn of heroic poesy the second being matter of dispute and chiefly concerning church authority i was obliged to make as plain and perspicuous as possibly i could yet not wholly neglecting the numbers though i had not frequent occasions for the magnificence of verse the third which has more of the nature of domestic conversation is or ought to be more free and familiar than the two former  there are in it two episodes or fables which are interwoven with the main design so that they are properly parts of it though they are also distinct stories of themselves in both of these i have made use of the commonplaces of satire whether true or false which are urged by the members of the one church against the other at which i hope no reader of either party will be scandalized because they are not of my invention but as old to my knowledge as the times of boccace and chaucer on the one side and as those of the reformation on the other                                        part i    a milkwhite hind

his own interpreter   our airy faith will no foundation find   the words a weathercock for every wind   the bear the fox the wolf by turns prevail   the most in power supplies the present gale   the wretched panther cries aloud for aid   to church and councils whom she first betrayd   no help from fathers or traditions train                         470   those ancient guides she taught us to disdain   and by that scripture which she once abused   to reformation stands herself accused   what bills for breach of laws can she prefer   expounding which she owns herself may err   and after all her winding ways are tried   if doubts arise she slips herself aside   and leaves the private conscience for the guide   if then that conscience set the offender free   it bars her claim to church authority                             480   how can she censure or what crime pretend   but scripture may be construed to defend   even those whom for rebellion she transmits 483   to civil power her doctrine first acquits   because no disobedience can ensue   where no submission to a judge is due   each judging for himself by her consent   whom thus absolved she sends to punishment   suppose the

stands   eternal house not built with mortal hands   oh sure defence against the infernal gate   a patent during pleasure of the state      thus is the panther neither loved nor feard   a mere mock queen of a divided herd   whom soon by lawful power she might control   herself a part submitted to the whole 500   then as the moon who first receives the light   by which she makes our nether regions bright   so might she shine reflecting from afar   the rays she borrowd from a better star   big with the beams which from her mother flow   and reigning oer the rising tides below   now mixing with a savage crowd she goes   and meanly flatters her inveterate foes   ruled while she rules and losing every hour   her wretched remnants of precarious power 510      one evening while the cooler shade she sought   revolving many a melancholy thought   alone she walkd and lookd around in vain   with rueful visage for her vanishd train   none of her sylvan subjects made their court

hunger still increases with the store   without respect they brushd along the wood   each in his clan and filld with loathsome food   askd no permission to the neighbouring flood   the panther full of inward discontent   since they would go before them wisely went   supplying want of power by drinking first   as if she gave them leave to quench their thirst   among the rest the hind with fearful face   beheld from far the common watering place   nor durst approach till with an awful roar                      530   the sovereign lion107 bade her fear no more   encouraged thus she brought her younglings nigh   watching the motions of her patrons eye   and drank a sober draught the rest amazed   stood mutely still and on the stranger gazed   surveyd her part by part and sought to find   the tenhornd monster in the harmless hind   such as the wolf and panther had designd   they thought at first they dreamd for twas offence   with them to question certitude of sense

speak the panther durst      for when the herd sufficed did late repair   to ferny heaths and to their forest lair   she made a mannerly excuse to stay   proffering the hind to wait her half the way   that since the sky was clear an hour of talk   might help her to beguile the tedious walk   with much goodwill the motion was embraced                       560   to chat a while on their adventures passd   nor had the grateful hind so soon forgot   her friend and fellowsufferer in the plot   yet wondering how of late she grew estranged   her forehead cloudy and her countenance changed   she thought this hour the occasion would present   to learn her secret cause of discontent   which well she hoped might be with ease redressd   considering her a wellbred civil beast   and more a

the panther times are mended well   since late among the philistines108 you fell   the toils were pitchd a spacious tract of ground   with expert huntsmen was encompassd round   the enclosure narrowd the sagacious power                          5   of hounds and death drew nearer every hour   tis true the younger lion109 scaped the snare   but all your priestly calves110 lay struggling there   as sacrifices on their altar laid   while you their careful mother wisely fled                       10   not trusting destiny to save your head   for whateer promises you have applied   to your unfailing church the surer side   is four fair legs in danger to provide   and whateer tales of peters chair you tell   yet saving reverence of the miracle   the better luck was yours to scape so well     as i remember said the sober hind   those toils were for your own dear self designd   as well as me and with the selfsame throw                        20   to catch the quarry and the vermin too   forgive the slanderous tongues that calld you so   howeer you take it now the common cry   then ran you down for your rank loyalty   besides in popery they thought you nursed   as evil tongues will ever speak the worst   because some forms and ceremonies some   you kept and stood in the main question dumb   dumb you were born indeed but thinking long   the test111 it seems at last has loosed your tongue              30   and to explain what your forefathers meant   by real presence in the sacrament   after long fencing pushd against the wall   your salvo comes that hes not there at all   there changed your faith and what may change may fall   who can believe what varies every day   nor ever was nor will be at a stay      tortures may force the tongue untruths to tell   and i neer ownd myself infallible   replied the panther grant such presence were                      40   yet in your sense i never ownd it there   a real virtue we by faith receive   and that we in the sacrament believe   then said the hind as you the matter state   not only jesuits can equivocate   for real as you now the word expound   from solid substance dwindles to a sound   methinks an Æsops fable you repeat   you know who took the shadow for the meat   your churchs substance thus you change at will                    50   and yet retain your former figure still   i freely grant you spoke to save your life   for then you lay beneath the butchers knife   long time you fought redoubled battery bore   but after all against yourself you swore   your former self for every hour your form   is choppd and changed like winds before a storm   thus fear and interest will prevail with some   for all have not the gift of martyrdom      the panther grinnd at this and thus replied                    60   that men may err was never yet denied   but if that common principle be true   the canon dame is levelld full at you   but shunning long disputes i fain would see   that wondrous wight infallibility   is he from heaven this mighty champion come   or lodged below in subterranean rome   first seat him somewhere and derive his race   or else conclude that nothing has no place     suppose though i disown it said the hind                        70   the certain mansion were not yet assignd   the doubtful residence no proof can bring   against the plain existence of the thing   because philosophers may disagree   if sight by emission or reception be   shall it be thence inferrd i do not see   but you require an answer positive   which yet when i demand you dare not give   for fallacies in universals live   i then affirm that this unfailing guide                             80   in pope and general councils must reside   both lawful both combined what one decrees   by numerous votes the other ratifies   on this undoubted sense the church relies   tis true some doctors in a scantier space   i mean in each apart contract the place   some who to greater length extend the line   the churchs afteracceptation join   this last circumference appears too wide   the church diffused is by the council tied                         90   as members by their representatives   obliged to laws which prince and senate gives   thus some contract and some enlarge the space   in pope and council who denies the place   assisted from above with gods unfailing grace   those canons all the needful points contain   their sense so obvious and their words so plain   that no disputes about the doubtful text   have hitherto the labouring world perplexd   if any should in aftertimes appear                               100   new councils must be calld to make the meaning clear   because in them the power supreme resides   and all the promises are to the guides   this may be taught with sound and safe defence   but mark how sandy is your own pretence   who setting councils pope and church aside   are every man his own presuming guide   the sacred books you say are full and plain   and every needful point of truth contain   all who can read interpreters may be                              110   thus though your several churches disagree   yet every saint has to himself alone   the secret of this philosophic stone   these principles your jarring sects unite   when differing doctors and disciples fight   though luther zuinglius calvin holy chiefs   have made a battle royal of beliefs   or like wild horses several ways have whirld   the tortured text about the christian world   each jehu lashing on with furious force                           120   that turk or jew could not have used it worse   no matter what dissension leaders make   where every private man may save a stake   ruled by the scripture and his own advice   each has a blind bypath to paradise   where driving in a circle slow or fast   opposing sects are sure to meet at last   a wondrous charity you have in store   for all reformd to pass the narrow door   so much that mahomet had scarcely more                           130   for he kind prophet was for damning none   but christ and moses were to save their own   himself was to secure his chosen race   though reason good for turks to take the place   and he allowd to be the better man   in virtue of his holier alcoran     true said the panther i shall neer deny   my brethren may be saved as well as i   though huguenots condemn our ordination   succession ministerial vocation                                  140   and luther more mistaking what he read   misjoins the sacred body with the bread   yet lady still remember i maintain   the word in needful points is only plain     needless or needful i not now contend   for still you have a loophole for a friend   rejoind the matron but the rule you lay   has led whole flocks and leads them still astray   in weighty points and full damnations way   for did not arius first socinus now                              150   the sons eternal godhead disavow   and did not these by gospel texts alone   condemn our doctrine and maintain their own   have not all heretics the same pretence   to plead the scriptures in their own defence   how did the nicene council then decide   that strong debate was it by scripture tried   no sure to that the rebel would not yield   squadrons of texts he marshalld in the field   that was but civil war an equal set                              160   where piles with piles112 and eagles eagles met   with texts pointblank and plain he faced the foe   and did not satan tempt our saviour so   the good old bishops took a simpler way   each askd but what he heard his father say   or how he was instructed in his youth   and by traditions force upheld the truth     the panther smiled at this and when said she   were those first councils disallowd by me   or where did i at sure tradition strike                           170   provided still it were apostolic     friend said the hind you quit your former ground   where all your faith you did on scripture found   now tis tradition joind with holy writ   but thus your memory betrays your wit     no said the panther for in that i view   when your traditions forged and when tis true   i set them by the rule and as they square   or deviate from undoubted doctrine there   this oral fiction that old faith declare                         180     hind the council steerd it seems a different course   they tried the scripture by traditions force   but you tradition by the scripture try   pursued by sects from this to that you fly   nor dare on one foundation to rely   the word is then deposed and in this view   you rule the scripture not the scripture you   thus said the dame and smiling thus pursued   i see tradition then is disallowd   when not evinced by scripture to be true                          190   and scripture as interpreted by you   but here you tread upon unfaithful ground   unless you could infallibly expound   which you reject as odious popery   and throw that doctrine back with scorn on me   suppose we on things traditive divide   and both appeal to scripture to decide   by various texts we both uphold our claim   nay often ground our titles on the same   after long labour lost and times expense                        200   both grant the words and quarrel for the sense   thus all disputes for ever must depend   for no dumb rule can controversies end   thus when you said tradition must be tried   by sacred writ whose sense yourselves decide   you said no more but that yourselves must be   the judges of the scripture sense not we   against our churchtradition you declare   and yet your clerks would sit in moses chair   at least tis proved against your argument                        210   the rule is far from plain where all dissent      if not by scriptures how can we be sure   replied the panther what traditions pure   for you may palm upon us new for old   all as they say that glitters is not gold      how but by following her replied the dame   to whom derived from sire to son they came   where every age does on another move   and trusts no farther than the next above   where all the rounds like jacobs ladder rise                     220   the lowest hid in earth the topmost in the skies      sternly the savage did her answer mark   her glowing eyeballs glittering in the dark   and said but this since lucre was your trade   succeeding times such dreadful gaps have made   tis dangerous climbing to your sons and you   i leave the ladder and its omen too      hind the panthers breath was ever famed for sweet   but from the wolf such wishes oft i meet   you learnd this language from the blatant beast                  230   or rather did not speak but were possessd   as for your answer tis but barely urged   you must evince tradition to be forged   produce plain proofs unblemishd authors use   as ancient as those ages they accuse   till when tis not sufficient to defame   an old possession stands till elder quits the claim   then for our interest which is named alone   to load with envy we retort your own   for when traditions in your faces fly                             240   resolving not to yield you must decry   as when the cause goes hard the guilty man   excepts and thins his jury all he can   so when you stand of other aid bereft   you to the twelve apostles would be left   your friend the wolf did with more craft provide   to set those toys traditions quite aside   and fathers too unless when reason spent   he cites them but sometimes for ornament   but madam panther you though more sincere                      250   are not so wise as your adulterer   the private spirit is a better blind   than all the dodging tricks your authors find   for they who left the scripture to the crowd   each for his own peculiar judge allowd   the way to please them was to make them proud   thus with full sails they ran upon the shelf   who could suspect a cozenage from himself   on his own reason safer tis to stand   than be deceived and damnd at secondhand                        260   but you who fathers and traditions take   and garble some and some you quite forsake   pretending churchauthority to fix   and yet some grains of private spirit mix   are like a mule made up of differing seed   and thats the reason why you never breed   at least not propagate your kind abroad   for home dissenters are by statutes awed   and yet they grow upon you every day   while you to speak the best are at a stay                       270   for sects that are extremes abhor a middle way   like tricks of state to stop a raging flood   or mollify a madbraind senates mood   of all expedients never one was good   well may they argue nor can you deny   if we must fix on church authority   best on the best the fountain not the flood   that must be better still if this be good   shall she command who has herself rebelld   is antichrist by antichrist expelld                              280   did we a lawful tyranny displace   to set aloft a bastard of the race   why all these wars to win the book if we   must not interpret for ourselves but she   either be wholly slaves or wholly free   for purging fires traditions must not fight   but they must prove episcopacys right   thus those led horses are from service freed   you never mount them but in time of need   like mercenaries hired for home defence                          290   they will not serve against their native prince   against domestic foes of hierarchy   these are drawn forth to make fanatics fly   but when they see their countrymen at hand   marching against them under churchcommand   straight they forsake their colours and disband     thus she nor could the panther well enlarge   with weak defence against so strong a charge   but said for what did christ his word provide   if still his church must want a living guide                      300   and if all saving doctrines are not there   or sacred penmen could not make them clear   from after ages we should hope in vain   for truths which men inspired could not explain     before the word was written said the hind   our saviour preachd his faith to human kind   from his apostles the first age received   eternal truth and what they taught believed   thus by tradition faith was planted first   succeeding flocks succeeding pastors nursed                       310   this was the way our wise redeemer chose   who sure could all things for the best dispose   to fence his fold from their encroaching foes   he could have writ himself but well foresaw   the event would be like that of moses law   some difference would arise some doubts remain   like those which yet the jarring jews maintain   no written laws can be so plain so pure   but wit may gloss and malice may obscure   not those indited by his first command                            320   a prophet graved the text an angel held his hand   thus faith was ere the written word appeard   and men believed not what they read but heard   but since the apostles could not be confined   to these or those but severally designd   their large commission round the world to blow   to spread their faith they spread their labours too   yet still their absent flock their pains did share   they hearkend still for love produces care   and as mistakes arose or discords fell                          330   or bold seducers taught them to rebel   as charity grew cold or faction hot   or long neglect their lessons had forgot   for all their wants they wisely did provide   and preaching by epistles was supplied   so great physicians cannot all attend   but some they visit and to some they send   yet all those letters were not writ to all   nor first intended but occasional   their absent sermons nor if they contain                          340   all needful doctrines are those doctrines plain   clearness by frequent preaching must be wrought   they writ but seldom but they daily taught   and what one saint has said of holy paul   he darkly writ is true applied to all   for this obscurity could heaven provide   more prudently than by a living guide   as doubts arose the difference to decide   a guide was therefore needful therefore made   and if appointed sure to be obeyd                              350   thus with due reverence to the apostles writ   by which my sons are taught to which submit   i think those truths their sacred works contain   the church alone can certainly explain   that following ages leaning on the past   may rest upon the primitive at last   nor would i thence the word no rule infer   but none without the churchinterpreter   because as i have urged before tis mute   and is itself the subject of dispute                              360   but what the apostles their successors taught   they to the next from them to us is brought   the undoubted sense which is in scripture sought   from hence the church is armd when errors rise   to stop their entrance and prevent surprise   and safe entrenchd within her foes without defies   by these all festering sores her councils heal   which time or has disclosed or shall reveal   for discord cannot end without a last appeal   nor can a council national decide                                 370   but with subordination to her guide   i wish the cause were on that issue tried   much less the scripture for suppose debate   betwixt pretenders to a fair estate   bequeathd by some legators last intent   such is our dying saviours testament   the will is proved is opend and is read   the doubtful heirs their differing titles plead   all vouch the words their interest to maintain   and each pretends by those his cause is plain                     380   shall then the testament award the right   no thats the hungary for which they fight   the field of battle subject of debate   the thing contended for the fair estate   the sense is intricate tis only clear   what vowels and what consonants are there   therefore tis plain its meaning must be tried   before some judge appointed to decide      suppose the fair apostate said i grant   the faithful flock some living guide should want                  390   your arguments an endless chase pursue   produce this vaunted leader to our view   this mighty moses of the chosen crew      the dame who saw her fainting foe retired   with force renewd to victory aspired   and looking upward to her kindred sky   as once our saviour ownd his deity   pronounced his wordsshe whom ye seek am i   nor less amazed this voice the panther heard   than were those jews to hear a god declared                       400   then thus the matron modestly renewd   let all your prophets and their sects be viewd   and see to which of them yourselves think fit   the conduct of your conscience to submit   each proselyte would vote his doctor best   with absolute exclusion to the rest   thus would your polish diet disagree   and end as it began in anarchy   yourself the fairest for election stand   because you seem crowngeneral of the land                        410   but soon against your superstitious lawn   some presbyterian sabre would be drawn   in your establishd laws of sovereignty   the rest some fundamental flaw would see   and call rebellion gospelliberty   to churchdecrees your articles require   submission modified if not entire   homage denied to censures you proceed   but when curtana113 will not do the deed   you lay that pointless clergyweapon by                           420   and to the laws your sword of justice fly   now this your sects the more unkindly take   those prying varlets hit the blots you make   because some ancient friends of yours declare   your only rule of faith the scriptures are   interpreted by men of judgment sound   which every sect will for themselves expound   nor think less reverence to their doctors due   for sound interpretation than to you   if then by able heads are understood                             430   your brother prophets who reformd abroad   those able heads expound a wiser way   that their own sheep their shepherd should obey   but if you mean yourselves are only sound   that doctrine turns the reformation round   and all the rest are false reformers found   because in sundry points you stand alone   not in communion joind with any one   and therefore must be all the church or none   then till you have agreed whose judge is best                    440   against this forced submission they protest   while sound and sound a different sense explains   both play at hardhead till they break their brains   and from their chairs each others force defy   while unregarded thunders vainly fly   i pass the rest because your church alone   of all usurpers best could fill the throne   but neither you nor any sect beside   for this high office can be qualified   with necessary gifts required in such a guide                     450   for that which must direct the whole must be   bound in one bond of faith and unity   but all your several churches disagree   the consubstantiating church and priest   refuse communion to the calvinist   the french reformd from preaching you restrain   because you judge their ordination vain   and so they judge of yours but donors must ordain   in short in doctrine or in discipline   not one reformd can with another join                            460   but all from each as from damnation fly   no union they pretend but in nonpopery   nor should their members in a synod meet   could any church presume to mount the seat   above the rest their discords to decide   none would obey but each would be the guide   and face to face dissensions would increase   for only distance now preserves the peace   all in their turns accusers and accused   babel was never half so much confused                             470   what one can plead the rest can plead as well   for amongst equals lies no last appeal   and all confess themselves are fallible   now since you grant some necessary guide   all who can err are justly laid aside   because a trust so sacred to confer                                476   shows want of such a sure interpreter   and how can he be needful who can err   then granting that unerring guide we want   that such there is you stand obliged to grant                     480   our saviour else were wanting to supply   our needs and obviate that necessity   it then remains the church can only be   the guide which owns unfailing certainty   or else you slip your hold and change your side   relapsing from a necessary guide   but this annexd condition of the crown   immunity from errors you disown   here then you shrink and lay your weak pretensions down   for petty royalties you raise debate                              490   but this unfailing universal state   you shun nor dare succeed to such a glorious weight   and for that cause those promises detest   with which our saviour did his church invest   but strive to evade and fear to find them true   as conscious they were never meant to you   all which the mother church asserts her own   and with unrivalld claim ascends the throne   so when of old the almighty father sate   in council to redeem our ruind state                            500   millions of millions at a distance round   silent the sacred consistory crownd   to hear what mercy mixd with justice could propound   all prompt with eager pity to fulfil   the full extent of their creators will   but when the stern conditions were declared   a mournful whisper through the host was heard   and the whole hierarchy with heads hung down   submissively declined the ponderous profferd crown   then not till then the eternal son from high                     510   rose in the strength of all the deity   stood forth to accept the terms and underwent   a weight which all the frame of heaven had bent   nor he himself could bear but as omnipotent   now to remove the least remaining doubt   that even the bleareyed sects may find her out   behold what heavenly rays adorn her brows   what from his wardrobe her beloved allows   to deck the weddingday of his unspotted spouse   behold what marks of majesty she brings                           520   richer than ancient heirs of eastern kings   her right hand holds the sceptre and the keys   to show whom she commands and who obeys   with these to bind or set the sinner free   with that to assert spiritual royalty     one in herself not rent by schism114 but sound   entire one solid shining diamond   not sparkles shatterd into sects like you   one is the church and must be to be true   one central principle of unity                                    530   as undivided so from errors free   as one in faith so one in sanctity   thus she and none but she the insulting rage   of heretics opposed from age to age   still when the giantbrood invades her throne   she stoops from heaven and meets them half way down   and with paternal thunder vindicates her crown   but like egyptian sorcerers you stand   and vainly lift aloft your magic wand   to sweep away the swarms of vermin from the land                  540   you could like them with like infernal force   produce the plague but not arrest the course   but when the boils and blotches with disgrace                     543   and public scandal sat upon the face   themselves attackd the magi strove no more   they saw gods finger and their fate deplore   themselves they could not cure of the dishonest sore   thus one thus pure behold her largely spread   like the fair ocean from her motherbed   from east to west triumphantly she rides                          550   all shores are waterd by her wealthy tides   the gospelsound diffused from pole to pole   where winds can carry and where waves can roll   the selfsame doctrine of the sacred page   conveyd to every clime in every age      here let my sorrow give my satire place   to raise new blushes on my british race   our sailingships like common sewers we use   and through our distant colonies diffuse   the draught of dungeons and the stench of stews                  560   whom when their homebred honesty is lost   we disembogue on some far indian coast   thieves panders paillards115 sins of every sort   those are the manufactures we export   and these the missioners our zeal has made   for with my countrys pardon be it said   religion is the least of all our trade      yet some improve their traffic more than we   for they on gain their only god rely   and set a public price on piety                                   570   industrious of the needle and the chart   they run full sail to their japonian mart   prevention fear and prodigal of fame   sell all of christian116 to the very name   nor leave enough of that to hide their naked shame      thus of three marks which in the creed we view   not one of all can be applied to you                              577   much less the fourth in vain alas you seek   the ambitious title of apostolic   godlike descent tis well your blood can be   proved noble in the third or fourth degree   for all of ancient that you had before   i mean what is not borrowd from our store   was error fulminated oer and oer   old heresies condemnd in ages past   by care and time recoverd from the blast      tis said with ease but never can be proved   the church her old foundations has removed   and built new doctrines on unstable sands   judge that ye winds and rains you proved her yet she stands    590   those ancient doctrines charged on her for new   show when and how and from what hands they grew   we claim no power when heresies grow bold   to coin new faith but still declare the old   how else could that obscene disease be purged   when controverted texts are vainly urged   to prove tradition new theres somewhat more   required than saying twas not used before   those monumental arms are never stirrd   till schism or heresy call down goliahs sword                    600      thus what you call corruptions are in truth   the first plantations of the gospels youth   old standard faith but cast your eyes again   and view those errors which new sects maintain   or which of old disturbd the churchs peaceful reign   and we can point each period of the time   when they began and who begot the crime   can calculate how long the eclipse endured   who interposed what digits were obscured   of all which are already passd away                              610   we know the rise the progress and decay     despair at our foundations then to strike   till you can prove your faith apostolic   a limpid stream drawn from the native source

balance fail   a church unprincipled kicks up the scale   but if you cannot think nor sure you can   suppose in god what were unjust in man   that he the fountain of eternal grace   should suffer falsehood for so long a space   to banish truth and to usurp her place   that seven successive ages should be lost                         630   and preach damnation at their proper cost   that all your erring ancestors should die   drownd in the abyss of deep idolatry   if piety forbid such thoughts to rise   awake and open your unwilling eyes   god hath left nothing for each age undone   from this to that wherein he sent his son   then think but well of him and half your work is done   see how his church adornd with every grace                      639   with open arms a kind forgiving

gold   inquire into your years and laugh to find                         150   your crazy temper shows you much declined   were you not dim and doted you might see   a pack of cheats that claim a pedigree   no more of kin to you than you to me   do you not know that for a little coin   heralds can foist a name into the line   they ask you blessing but for what you have   but once possessd of what with care you save   the wanton boys would piss upon your grave      your sons of latitude that court your grace                     160   though most resembling you in form and face   are far the worst of your pretended race   and but i blush your honesty to blot   pray god you prove them lawfully begot   for in some popish libels i have read   the wolf has been too busy in your bed   at least her hinder parts the bellypiece   the paunch and all that scorpio claims are his   their malice too a sore suspicion brings   for though they dare not bark they snarl at kings                170   nor blame them for intruding in your line   fat bishoprics are still of right divine      think you your new french proselytes121 are come   to starve abroad because they starved at home   your benefices twinkled from afar   they found the new messiah by the star   those swisses fight on any side for pay   and tis the living that conforms not they   mark with what management their tribes divide   some stick to you and some to the other side                     180   that many churches may for many mouths provide   more vacant pulpits would more converts make   all would have latitude enough to take   the rest unbeneficed your sects maintain   for ordinations without cures are vain   and chamber practice is a silent gain   your sons of breadth at home are much like these   their soft and yielding metals run with ease   they melt and take the figure of the mould   but harden and preserve it best in gold                           190     your delphic sword the panther then replied   is doubleedged and cuts on either side   some sons of mine who bear upon their shield   three steeples argent in a sable field   have sharply taxd your converts who unfed   have followd you for miracles of bread   such who themselves of no religion are   allured with gain for any will declare   bare lies with bold assertions they can face   but dint of argument is out of place                              200   the grim logician puts them in a fright   tis easier far to flourish than to fight   thus our eighth henrys marriage they defame   they say the schism of beds began the game   divorcing from the church to wed the dame   though largely proved and by himself professd   that conscience conscience would not let him rest    i mean not till possessd of her he loved   and old uncharming catherine was removed   for sundry years before he did complain                           210   and told his ghostly confessor his pain   with the same impudence without a ground   they say that look the reformation round   no treatise of humility is found   but if none were the gospel does not want   our saviour preachd it and i hope you grant   the sermon on the mount was protestant     no doubt replied the hind as sure as all   the writings of saint peter and saint paul   on that decision let it stand or fall                             220   now for my converts who you say unfed   have followd me for miracles of bread   judge not by hearsay but observe at least   if since their change their loaves have been increased   the lion buys no converts if he did   beasts would be sold as fast as he could bid   tax those of interest who conform for gain   or stay the market of another reign   your broadway sons would never be too nice   to close with calvin if he paid their price                      230   but raised three steeples higher would change their note   and quit the cassock for the cantingcoat   now if you damn this censure as too bold   judge by yourselves and think not others sold    meantime my sons accused by fames report   pay small attendance at the lions court   nor rise with early crowds nor flatter late   for silently they beg who daily wait   preferment is bestowd that comes unsought   attendance is a bribe and then tis bought                       240   how they should speed their fortune is untried   for not to ask is not to be denied   for what they have their god and king they bless   and hope they should not murmur had they less   but if reduced subsistence to implore   in common prudence they should pass your door   unpitied hudibras122 your champion friend   has shown how far your charities extend   this lasting verse shall on his tomb be read   he shamed you living and upbraids you dead                     250      with odious atheist names123 you load your foes   your liberal clergy why did i expose   it never fails in charities like those   in climes where true religion is professd   that imputation were no laughing jest   but imprimatur124 with a chaplains name   is here sufficient licence to defame   what wonder ist that black detraction thrives   the homicide of names is less than lives   and yet the perjured murderer survives                            260      this said she paused a little and suppressd   the boiling indignation of her breast   she knew the virtue of her blade nor would   pollute her satire with ignoble blood   her panting foe she saw before her eye   and back she drew the shining weapon dry   so when the generous lion has in sight   his equal match he rouses for the fight   but when his foe lies prostrate on the plain   he sheaths his paws uncurls his angry mane                       270   and pleased with bloodless honours of the day   walks over and disdains the inglorious prey   so james if great with less we may compare   arrests his rolling thunderbolts in air   and grants ungrateful friends a lengthend space   to implore the remnants of longsuffering grace      this breathingtime the matron took and then   resumed the thread of her discourse again   be vengeance wholly left to powers divine   and let heaven judge betwixt your sons and mine                   280   if joys hereafter must be purchased here   with loss of all that mortals hold so dear   then welcome infamy and public shame   and last a long farewell to worldly fame   tis said with ease but oh how hardly tried   by haughty souls to human honour tied   o sharp convulsive pangs of agonizing pride   down then thou rebel never more to rise   and what thou didst and dost so dearly prize   that fame that darling fame make that thy sacrifice             290   tis nothing thou hast given then add thy tears   for a long race of unrepenting years   tis nothing yet yet all thou hast to give   then add those maybe years thou hast to live   yet nothing still then poor and naked come   thy father will receive his unthrift home   and thy blest saviours blood discharge the mighty sum      thus she pursued i discipline a son   whose uncheckd fury to revenge would run   he champs the bit impatient of his loss                          300   and starts aside and flounders at the cross   instruct him better gracious god to know   as thine is vengeance so forgiveness too   that suffering from ill tongues he bears no more   than what his sovereign bears and what his saviour bore     it now remains for you to school your child   and ask why gods anointed he reviled   a king and princess dead did shimei worse   the cursors punishment should fright the curse   your son was warnd and wisely gave it oer                      310   but he who counselld him has paid the score   the heavy malice could no higher tend   but woe to him on whom the weights descend   so to permitted ills the demon flies   his rage is aimd at him who rules the skies   constraind to quit his cause no succour found   the foe discharges every tire around   in clouds of smoke abandoning the fight   but his own thundering peals proclaim his flight     in henrys change his charge as ill succeeds                     320   to that long story little answer needs   confront but henrys words with henrys deeds   were space allowd with ease it might be proved   what springs his blessed reformation moved   the dire effects appeard in open sight   which from the cause he calls a distant flight   and yet no larger leap than from the sun to light     now let your sons a double pæan sound   a treatise of humility is found   tis found but better it had neer been sought                   330   than thus in protestant procession brought   the famed original through spain is known   rodriguez work my celebrated son   which yours by illtranslating made his own   conceald its author and usurpd the name   the basest and ignoblest theft of fame   my altars kindled first that living coal   restore or practice better what you stole   that virtue could this humble verse inspire   tis all the restitution i require                                340      glad was the panther that the charge was closed   and none of all her favourite sons exposed   for laws of arms permit each injured man   to make himself a saver where he can   perhaps the plunderd merchant cannot tell   the names of pirates in whose hands he fell   but at the den of thieves he justly flies   and every algerine is lawful prize   no private person in the foes estate   can plead exemption from the public fate                          350   yet christian laws allow not such redress   then let the greater supersede the less   but let the abettors of the panthers crime   learn to make fairer wars another time   some characters may sure be found to write   among her sons for tis no common sight   a spotted dam and all her offspring white      the savage though she saw her plea controlld   yet would not wholly seem to quit her hold   but offerd fairly to compound the strife                         360   and judge conversion by the converts life   tis true she said i think it somewhat strange   so few should follow profitable change   for present joys are more to flesh and blood   than a dull prospect of a distant good   twas well alluded by a son of mine   i hope to quote him is not to purloin   two magnets heaven and earth allure to bliss   the larger loadstone that the nearer this   the weak attraction of the greater fails                          370   we nod a while but neighbourhood prevails   but when the greater proves the nearer too   i wonder more your converts come so slow   methinks in those who firm with me remain   it shows a nobler principle than gain     your inference would be strong the hind replied   if yours were in effect the suffering side   your clergys sons their own in peace possess   nor are their prospects in reversion less   my proselytes are struck with awful dread                         380   your bloody cometlaws hang blazing oer their head   the

                 390   the priest continues what the nurse began   and thus the child imposes on the man   the rest i named before nor need repeat   but interest is the most prevailing cheat   the sly seducer both of age and youth   they study that and think they study truth   when interest fortifies an argument   weak reason serves to gain the wills assent   for souls already warpd receive an easy

the realm without control   among my sons for proselytes to prowl   and here and there you snap some silly soul   you hinted fears of future change in state   pray heaven you did not prophesy your fate   perhaps you think your time of triumph near   but may mistake the season of the year   the swallows125 fortune gives you cause to fear      for charity replied the matron tell                            420   what sad mischance those pretty birds befell      nay no mischance the savage dame replied   but want of wit in their unerring guide   and eager haste and gaudy hopes and giddy pride   yet wishing timely warning may prevail   make you the moral and ill tell the tale      the swallow privileged above the rest   of all the birds as mans familiar guest   pursues the sun in summer brisk and bold   but wisely shuns the persecuting cold                             430   is well to chancels and to chimneys known   though tis not thought she feeds on smoke alone   from hence she has been held of heavenly line   endued with particles of soul divine   this merry chorister had long possessd   her summer seat and featherd well her nest   till frowning skies began to change their cheer   and time turnd up the wrong side of the year   the shedding trees began the ground to strow   with yellow leaves and bitter blasts to blow                     440   sad auguries of winter thence she drew   which by instinct or prophecy she knew   when prudence warnd her to remove betimes   and seek a better heaven and warmer climes      her sons were summond on a steeples height   and calld in common council vote a flight   the day was named the next that should be fair   all to the general rendezvous repair   they try their fluttering wings and trust themselves in air   but whether upward to the moon they go                            450   or dream the winter out in caves below   or hawk at flies elsewhere concerns us not to know      southwards you may be sure they bent their flight   and harbourd in a hollow rock at night   next morn they rose and set up every sail   the wind was fair but blew a mackerel gale   the sickly young sat shivering on the shore   abhorrd salt water never seen before   and prayd their tender mothers to delay   the passage and expect a fairer day                              460      with these the martin readily concurrd   a churchbegot and churchbelieving bird   of little body but of lofty mind   roundbellied for a dignity designd   and much a dunce as martins are by kind   yet often quoted canonlaws and code   and fathers which he never understood   but little learning needs in noble blood   for sooth to say the swallow brought him in   her household chaplain and her next of kin                       470   in superstition silly to excess   and casting schemes by planetary guess   in fine shortwingd unfit himself to fly   his fears foretold foul weather in the sky     besides a raven from a witherd oak   left of their lodging was observed to croak   that omen liked him not so his advice   was present safety bought at any price   a seeming pious care that coverd cowardice   to strengthen this he told a boding dream                         480   of rising waters and a troubled stream   sure signs of anguish dangers and distress   with something more not lawful to express   by which he slily seemd to intimate   some secret revelation of their fate   for he concluded once upon a time   he found a leaf inscribed with sacred rhyme   whose antique characters did well denote   the sibyls hand of the cumæan grot   the mad divineress had plainly writ                               490   a time should come but many ages yet   in which sinister destinies ordain   a dame should drown with all her featherd train   and seas from thence be calld the chelidonian main   at this some shook for fear the more devout   arose and blessd themselves from head to foot     tis true some stagers of the wiser sort   made all these idle wonderments their sport   they said their only danger was delay   and he who heard what every fool could say                       500   would never fix his thought but trim his time away   the passage yet was good the wind tis true   was somewhat high but that was nothing new   no more than usual equinoxes blew   the sun already from the scales declined   gave little hopes of better days behind   but change from bad to worse of weather and of wind   nor need they fear the dampness of the sky   should flag their wings and hinder them to fly   twas only water thrown on sails too dry                          510   but least of all philosophy presumes   of truth in dreams from melancholy fumes   perhaps the martin housed in holy ground   might think of ghosts that walk their midnight round   till grosser atoms tumbling in the stream   of fancy madly met and clubbd into a dream   as little weight his vain presages bear   of ill effect to such alone who fear   most prophecies are of a piece with these   each nostradamus can foretell with ease                           520   not naming persons and confounding times   one casual truth supports a thousand lying rhymes      the advice was true but fear had seized the most   and all good counsel is on cowards lost   the question crudely put to shun delay   twas carried by the major part to stay      his point thus gaind sir martin dated thence   his power and from a priest became a prince   he orderd all things with a busy care   and cells and refectories did prepare                             530   and large provisions laid of winter fare   but now and then let fall a word or two   of hope that heaven some miracle might show   and for their sakes the sun should backward go   against the laws of nature upward climb

ease                        540   for martin much devotion did not ask   they prayd sometimes and that was all their task      it happend as beyond the reach of wit   blind prophecies may have a lucky hit   that this accomplishd or at least in part   gave great repute to their new merlins art   some swifts the giants of the swallow kind   largelimbd stouthearted but of stupid mind   for swisses or

blossoms flourish and new flowers arise   as god had been abroad and walking there   had left his footsteps and reformd the year   the sunny hills from far were seen to glow   with glittering beams and in the meads below   the burnishd brooks appeard with liquid gold to flow   at last they heard the foolish cuckoo sing   whose note proclaimd the holiday of spring                       560

insects in the purling springs                        570   and stoop on rivers to refresh their wings   their mothers think a fair provision made   that every son can live upon his trade   and now the careful charge is off their hands   look out for husbands and new nuptial bands   the youthful widow longs to be supplied   but first the lover is by lawyers tied   to settle jointurechimneys on the bride   so thick they couple in so short a space   that martins marriageofferings rise apace   their ancient houses running to decay   are furbishd up and cemented with clay                          580   they teem already store of eggs are laid   and brooding mothers call lucinas aid   fame spreads the news and foreign fowls appear   in flocks to greet the new returning year   to bless the founder and partake the cheer      and now twas time so fast their numbers rise   to plant abroad and people colonies   the youth drawn forth as martin had desired                       590   for so their cruel destiny required   were sent far off on an illfated day   the rest would needs conduct them on their way   and martin went because he feard alone to stay      so long they flew with inconsiderate haste   that now their afternoon began to waste   and what was ominous that very morn   the sun was enterd into capricorn   which by their bad astronomers account   that week the virgin balance should remount                       600   an infant moon eclipsed him in his way   and hid the small remainders of his day   the crowd amazed pursued no certain mark   but birds met birds and

she spread them wider yet but could not cover all   to augment their woes the winds began to move   debate in air for empty fields above   till boreas got the skies and pourd amain                        620   his rattling hailstones mixd with snow and rain      the joyless morning late arose and found   a dreadful desolation reign around   some buried in the snow some frozen to the ground   the rest were struggling still with death and lay   the crows and ravens rights an undefended prey   excepting martins race for they and he   had gaind the shelter of a hollow tree   but soon discoverd by a sturdy clown   he headed all the rabble of a town                                630   and finishd them with bats or polld them down   martin himself was caught alive and tried   for treasonous crimes because the laws provide   no martin there in winter shall abide   high on an oak which never leaf shall bear   he breathed his last exposed to open air   and there his corpse unblessd is hanging still   to show the change of winds with his prophetic bill     the patience of the hind did almost fail   for well she markd the malice of the tale127                   640   which ribald art their church to luther owes   in malice it began by malice grows   he sowd the serpents teeth an ironharvest rose   but most in martins character and fate   she saw her slanderd sons the panthers hate

are unlucky birds to kill                            650   as for my sons the family is blessd   whose every child is equal to the rest   no church reformd can boast a blameless line   such martins build in yours and more than mine   or else an old fanatic128 author lies   who summd their scandals up by centuries   but through your parable i plainly see   the bloody laws the crowds barbarity   the sunshine that offends the purblind sight   had some their wishes it would soon be night                     660   mistake me not the charge concerns not you   your sons are malcontents but yet are true   as far as nonresistance makes them so   but thats a word of neutral sense you know   a passive term which no relief will bring   but trims betwixt a rebel and a king      rest well assured the pardelis replied   my sons would all support the regal side   though heaven forbid the cause by battle should be tried      the matron answerd with a loud amen                            670   and thus pursued her argument again   if as you say and as i hope no less   your sons will practise what yourselves profess   what angry power prevents our present peace   the lion studious of our common good   desires and kings desires are ill withstood   to join our nations in a lasting love   the bars betwixt are easy to remove   for sanguinary laws were never made above   if you condemn that prince of tyranny                             680   whose mandate forced your gallic friends to fly   make not a worse example of your own   or cease to rail at causeless rigour shown   and let the guiltless person throw the stone   his blunted sword your suffering brotherhood   have seldom felt he stops it short of blood   but you have ground the persecuting knife   and set it to a razor edge

remove that bloody note   and stick it on the first reformers coat   oh let their crime in long oblivion sleep   twas theirs indeed to make tis yours to keep   unjust or just is all the question now   tis plain that not repealing you allow      to name the test would put you in a rage   you charge not that on any former age    but smile to think how innocent you stand                         700

could you have done than now you do   had oates and bedlow and their plot been true   some specious reasons for those wrongs were found                 720   their dire magicians threw their mists around   and wise men walkd as on enchanted ground   but now when time has made the imposture plain   late though he followd truth and limping held her train   what new delusion charms your cheated

thought your sovereign bound to send the tide   nor upward lookd on that immortal spring   but vainly deemd he durst not be a king   then conscience unrestraind by fear began   to stretch her limits and extend the span                        810   did his indulgence as her gift dispose   and made a wise alliance with her foes   can conscience own the associating name   and raise no blushes to

was brought   fain would they filch that little food away   while unrestraind those happy gluttons prey   and much they grieved to see so nigh their hall   the bird that warnd st peter of his fall   that he should raise his mitred crest on high   and clap his wings and call his family   to sacred rites and vex the ethereal powers                      1010   with midnight matins at uncivil hours

their lords request   they thought it great their sovereign to control                 1220   and named their pride nobility of soul      tis true the pigeons and their prince elect   were short of power their purpose to effect   but with their quills did all the hurt they could   and cuffd the tender chickens from their food   and much the buzzard in their cause did stir   though naming not the patron to infer   with all respect he was a gross idolater      but when the imperial owner did espy   that thus they turnd his grace to villany                       1230   not suffering wrath to discompose his mind   he strove a temper for the extremes to find   so to be just as he might still be kind   then all maturely weighd pronounced a doom   of sacred strength for every age to come   by this the doves their wealth and state possess   no rights infringed but licence to oppress   such power have they as factious lawyers long   to crowns ascribed that kings can do no wrong   but since his own domestic birds have tried                       1240   the dire effects of their destructive pride   he deems that proof a measure to the rest   concluding well within his kingly breast   his fowls of nature too unjustly were oppressd   he therefore makes all birds of every sect   free of his farm with promise to respect   their several kinds alike and equally protect   his gracious edict

well in pious lost   so lost as starlight is dissolved away   and melts into the brightness of the day   or gold about the regal diadem   lost to improve the lustre of the gem   what can we add to

boundless power and arbitrary lust   made tyrants still abhor the name of just   they shunnd the praise this godlike virtue gives   and feard a title that reproachd their lives      the power from which all kings derive their state   whom they pretend at least to imitate   is equal both to punish and reward   for few would love their god unless they feard      resistless force and immortality
