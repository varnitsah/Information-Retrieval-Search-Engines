commodores cup   the breeze had dropped as the tide ebbed and red rose plunged languidly across the shining swell faint mist obscured the horizon and the yachts engaged in the fiftymile race had vanished although wyndham thought he had not long since distinguished a sail in the distance he was curious about this because if he had seen canvas it was devas and her skipper had probably seen red rose the rest of the fleet was scattered about to the north wyndham had noted their positions carefully before the haze rolled up he wanted to win and meant to leave nothing to chance  in the meantime the yacht crept slowly through the sparkling water closehauled to a light wind that wyndham knew would not last her canvas tapering in a tall white pyramid swayed with a regular heave against the sky in her shadow the sea was a cool luminous green but the sun was hot and wyndham had taken off his coat he wore a white jersey blue trousers and very neat white shoes his age was twentysix his figure was thin but athletic and the molding of his face was good on the whole he was a handsome man and was generally marked by a careless twinkling smile the smile however was to some extent deceptive and at times his blue eyes were hard wyndham was popular he had a way of inspiring confidence and knew and used his talent  marston who sat on the yachts coaming splicing a rope trusted wyndham far marstons round face was burned red and generally wore a look of tranquil goodhumor his mouth was large and his eyes were calm people thought him dull and he was not clever but wyndham knew his comrades stability although bob was honest and trustful he was firm it was characteristic that the splice he slowly made was very neat  their paid hand was occupied at the clanking pump for red rose had shipped some water while the breeze was fresh this was not remarkable since the boat was small but wyndham knew though marston did not that a quantity of water had come in between her working planks she was old and needed repairs wyndham could not afford for all that he hoped to win the commodores cup he had particular grounds for wanting the cup and wyndhams habit was to get what he wanted  i think the splice will stand marston said throwing down the rope  your work does stand wyndham remarked  oh well said marston deprecatingly im slow but i like a good job saves time in the end because you neednt do the thing again  youre a philosopher bob my plan is generally hit or miss but can you see deva  marston searched the horizon the gently heaving sea was empty and red rose alone in a misty circle three or four miles across except for a few razorbills nothing but the ripple she trailed broke the reflection of the calm sky then his glance traveling north stopped and fixed on something faintly distinguishable against the thin mist  no he said i dont see her thought i did some time since but shes faded whats that in the distance on our starboard bow  its hard to tell might be a big blackbacked gull resting on the water the misty light magnifies things  shall i get the glasses  not unless you want them theyre under the stuff we stowed away in the locker aft if charley has finished pumping you might help him get out the spinnaker well have the wind fair when the flood begins to run  marston and the fisherlad vanished down the forecastle hatch and wyndham studied the distant object he did not yet need the sail the others had gone for but he was afraid of charleys keen eyes a buoy indicating a shoal was not far off and the sailing directions for the race stated that all marks of this kind must be kept on the port hand but wyndham knew the coast and imagined the tide was still ebbing in a neighboring river mouth the main stream ran north and would carry the boats off their course but near the shore another stream ran west across some wide shoals if he could steer red rose into this current it would help her on while her rivals farther off the land drifted back when the others came up with the sail wyndham wondered whether marston would ask for the chart but he did not the object they had seen had vanished for although the wind was light the boat slowly forged ahead the color of the smooth undulations indicated that the depth got less  looks as if we were near west hodden sand marston remarked they had a dispute at the committee about keeping us outside the bank makes a longer run but some of the deep boats might have touched bottom if theyd tried to cross at lowwater anyhow it doesnt matter so long as we all keep out  wyndham nodded and began to talk about something else  i hope well get fine weather because i need bracing up when you have not much money business is a grind and im rather young to carry the responsibilities of the house things might have been easier had jim wyndham not died two or three days after he fell ill  marston knew something about this wyndham brothers was a small oldfashioned firm and harry had recently taken control on his uncles sudden death james wyndham was extravagant and marston imagined he had left his affairs involved marston had no occupation and all the money he needed moreover he was harrys friend  well he said if youre short of capital i think some could be got sound investments dont pay much and now and then i feel id like a venture  youre a good sort bob for all that you had better leave business alone because you would get robbed of course if i saw a safe and profitable speculation i might let you join but just now im occupied trying to put things straight some are badly tangled i used to think i could carve my way to fortune if i got a chance but so far its been my luck to use broken tools  marston thought this was so harry was a good shot and racing skipper but he had never had a firstclass gun or boat still he used the makeshifts well and sometimes beat better men  yours is a pretty old house isnt it marston remarked  wyndhams was founded in the days of the slavers and privateers and has traded in west africa and south america ever since the house was famous but its decline began when steamers knocked out the sailing ships we stuck to the old vessels and own one or two small schooners yet though theyre only used for collecting cargo at beaches steamboats do not touch some of the documents ive recently studied tell a romantic tale the wyndhams were all adventurers and a number did not die in bed one or two vanished abroad as perhaps you know my uncle rupert did  i heard something about this said marston what happened  nobody knows he left the west indian factory sailed off in a canoe and was not seen again books and money were in order and his health was pretty good there was no explanation he vanished thats all i saw him once in england and thought him a sober business man one got no hint of wildness but the houses records indicate a vein of romantic extravagance in my ancestors for all that my father was a quiet country parson and i have felt nothing of the kind  marston pondered he knew harry wyndham rather well and had noted in moments of excitement and strain a curious recklessness that was perhaps not altogether normal for example there was the race when red rose and another yacht met closehauled red rose was on the port tack and the rule was she must give way but until the last minute harry sat unmoved at the tiller marston remembered the piledup foam about the plunging hulls as the yachts converged the slanted pyramids of sail that looked as if they must shock and the horrible tension he had felt then when collision was imminent wyndham gave the other room and afterwards laughed  i was tempted to find out how it would feel if we rammed her he confessed  this however was some time since and marston did not dwell on the incident his temperament was essentially normal  no sign of a breeze from the east yet he said  all the same it will come wyndham rejoined  marston looked about the sun was getting low and it was nearly calm now and then the topsail flapped and the mainsail hung slack blocks rattled as the heavy boom jerked about the swell was smooth and in color a curious shining green as if the light were reflected through it from beneath it looked as if they were crossing a big sand but marston did not sound harry knew the coast and the sailing directions required them to keep outside the shoals  in the distance a steamers smoke trailed across the sky one heard her engines beat with a monotonous rhythm in front the mist was melting and vague gray hills were faintly distinguishable the yachts deck was damp but for the rolling she hardly moved  we had better get some food said marston ill light the stove  he went to the cabin and when after the rude meal they lounged and smoked the mist suddenly rolled away long hills with woods among their folds ran back on the port hand in the distance a big black headland cut against the sunset the water astern was hazy and dotted by sails it was now a glassy calm  were nearer the coast than i reckoned but the ebb has given us a big lift marston observed  the rest are a long way back although i think theyre moving  theyve got the breeze and will bring it up said wyndham hoist the spinnaker  for the next few minutes marston and the paid hand were occupied with the big triangular sail which extended from the masthead to the end of a boom they thrust over the boats side a british yachts spinnaker is not fitted with a gaff at first the spinnaker hung slack but presently lifted in gentle curves then the water splashed against the planks and red rose began to move she gathered speed there was a humming noise astern mast and rigging creaked and foam leaped at the bows it got cold white ripples streaked the sea and the wake ran back in a foaming wedge the spinnaker swelled like a balloon and with the tall mainsail on the other side dwarfed the speeding hull  the sun dipped the dark sea stood up in ridges above red roses rail spray began to fly and one heard the rush of wind and groaning of spars the boat yawed about and steering needed skill since if wyndham let her swerve spinnaker or mainsail would swing across and mast or boom would go for all that he risked a glance over his shoulder now and then some of the boats were coming up they were bigger craft and gave red rose time by the handicap she however gave time to others and must save it in order to win  wyndham let go while the sea got rough for the flood tide now ran against the freshening wind while he swayed with the tiller she plunged and rolled about lifting her bows out of boiling foam and sometimes burying them deep water flowed across her deck and presently began to splash beneath the cockpit floor and charley started the clanking pump a full moon had risen and two big boats with canvas that cut black against the silver light were getting near  i think well save our time wyndham said  marston looked at the high topsail and bending spinnaker boom he would have liked to haul the topsail down but his comrades voice had a strange gay note that he had heard before harry meant to carry on he would drive the boat until something broke then marston looked ahead the big promontory was not far off and moonlight touched the towering crags the sea was all white for the current setting strongly round the head ran in angry combers against the wind  we are going to get wet in the tiderace he said you might find slacker water if you edged her off a bit  and sail a longer course wyndham rejoined we give deva four minutes and shes not far astern  marston acquiesced after all his business was to obey oh well he said charley and i had better get out on the booms  he beckoned the paid hand and they crawled along the deck red rose rolled savagely and main boom and spinnaker boom tossed their ends aloft the spars must be kept down lest they swing across and marston clasping the varnished pole with arms and legs crawled out as far as he dared sometimes he swung high above the combers that rushed past below and sometimes swung down until his body was wet by the foam he could hold on if harry kept her straight but if she swerved much the big sails would lurch across and he and charley would hardly escape with broken bones he looked aft wyndhams figure cut against the light it was tense and his head was motionless as if his glance was fixed marston knew he meant to bring red rose in on her time allowance or sail her under  they drew round the head and reeled across a bay a row of lights began to blink and two colored lanterns tossed marston saw the lights for a few moments when the spinnaker soared away from the boom the race was nearly over for the colored lights marked the flagboat anchored off the long iron pier the committee had not given the yachts much room perhaps they thought of their comfort and anchored the steamer near the beach so she would not roll about smart work would be needed to shorten sail before they struck the pier  a shadow touched the spinnaker and marston looked astern a swaying pyramid of canvas shut out the moon and foam leaped about a plunging hull ptarmigan had crept up and would go past but she was large and allowed red rose some time marston could not remember how much she allowed all he could do was to hold on for his arms ached and his head began to swim a few minutes would finish the race and he wondered dully what would happen then there were perhaps two hundred yards between the flagboat and the pier they ought to haul down the spinnaker now but harry would carry on  he saw ptarmigans topsail tilt downwards and dark figures run about her deck her spinnaker collapsed like a torn balloon but red rose leaped on pressed by straining sail then there was a flash and the report of a gun rolled among the crags ahead they drove into the smoke speeding side by side with ptarmigan and the flash of another gun pierced the dark marston crawling inboard dropped into the cockpit as the flagboat swept astern and for the next few minutes he was desperately occupied  the spinnaker went into the sea the topsail thrashed halfway up the mast and red rose listed until the water was deep on her lee deck a white sea swept her forward as they hauled down the staysail and then coming round she plunged head to wind a few yards from the dark ironwork of the pier wyndham came to help and soon afterwards they brought her to a safe anchorage while they stowed the sails a gig crossed the bows and somebody shouted well done red rose youre first by three minutes on handicap time  wyndham put on his jacket and lighted a cigarette not bad for a boat i bought because she was outclassed sometimes i wonder what i could do if i had proper tools he said then he laughed anyhow we had better start the pump     chapter ii  moonlight and glamour   rockets leaped up from the old castle on the narrow flat between the woods and the strait colored fires burned behind the loopholes in the ruined walls and an admiring crowd occupied the lawn that slanted to the water the night was calm and when the band stopped the voices of a choir singing old partsongs on the pier carried well there was a smell of drying seaweed and the yachts anchorlights burned steadily in rows that wavered with the eddying tide the last race was over and the townsfolk had given the crews a feast before the fleet dispersed  marston sat on a broken wall talking to devas owner about the race along the coast elliot was a friend of marstons chisholm the commodores young son stood close by smoking a cigarette  you beat us handsomely and wyndham deserves the cup for his pluck in carrying on when we were forced to lower our topsail elliot admitted still something was due to luck you got the last of the stream along the shore when the tide running down the river carried the rest of us back  wyndham has a talent for that kind of thing said marston sometimes you feel he so to speak thinks like a fish he doesnt need to calculate when the tide will turn and where hell find slack water he knows  wyndham has a talent for getting what he wants chisholm interposed deva ought to have beaten red rose  arent you rather young to judge marston asked with a touch of dryness  oh well said the lad i like a man who loses now and then you can understand that kind of fellow  elliot frowned he could take a beating but he was curious and looked at marston thoughtfully  i suppose you didnt see the knoll buoy  we did not marston replied there was something on the water in the haze but it was too small for the buoy wyndham thought it a gull a big blackback his sight is pretty good  how did the thing bear  marston hesitated because he saw where the question led but he was honest  nearly ahead a point or two to starboard anyhow it vanished although as we didnt change our course we must have passed the spot rather close he replied forgetting that he was below when the object vanished  then it was a gull elliot agreed but chisholm was not satisfied  elliots a sportsman i dont know if i am or not because i was on board deva and feel hurt we didnt get the cup wyndhams a smart skipper but his lucks too good ones inclined to doubt a man who always gets a prize my notion is it isnt altogether due to skill besides i think the commodore would have liked elliot to win the cup  youre not a tactful lad and perhaps youre not in very good form just now elliot remarked well go along and hear the band  they went off and marston lighted his pipe he was rather angry with young chisholm because he was persuaded wyndham had not seen the buoy harry was not the man to win a race by a shabby trick marston trusted his friends  in the meantime wyndham and flora chisholm occupied a bench in a quiet corner of the castle wall now and then a colored fire blazed up on the battlements and red reflections flickered about the crowded lawn but there were dark intervals when they saw the water sparkle and the black hills across the strait when the band stopped one heard the soft splash of the tide and the choir singing old welsh airs flora was young and felt the glamour of the calm moonlight night  moreover there was something strangely romantic about wyndham he was handsome and marked by a dashing recklessness that rather carried one away flora liked his pluck and bold seamanship her father was an old navy man and the yacht club commodore and she had inherited his love for the sea she had watched the finish of the race from the flagboat and had seen red rose reel past horribly pressed by sail fine skill and steady nerve were needed to bring the old boat in first  perhaps this was not important but it was typical of harry wyndham he ran risks and laughed it was bracing to know him and flattering to feel that he was drawn to her yet flora had some doubts after all she had not known wyndham long and he had drawbacks he was poor some of her friends distrusted him and chisholm had given hintshe approved jim elliot and flora thought jim loved her when wyndham was away she hesitated and wondered whether she was rash when he was near she thrilled and caution vanished presently she roused herself and began to talk  wyndham got a hint of strain and his heart beat he imagined flora was vaguely alarmed by his power to move her but she did not go away although her fresh beauty had first attracted him he soon saw she had qualities that strengthened her charm she was proud with a clean pride honest and plucky all the same he was poor his people were known for their romantic extravagance and a touch of moral laxity the business of which he had recently taken control languished and had not been very scrupulously carried on yet wyndham was not daunted and his love for the girl was sincere  things will look different tomorrow when the boats have gone and the little town goes to sleep again he said i feel doleful the holidays nearly over and soon after sunrise therell be nothing left but a happy memory  then you make an early start  at half ebb three or four oclock one wishes the night would last nights like this are not numerous  you ought to be satisfied you won the cup  i meant to win for one thing you wished me luck  flora blushed and wondered whether he could see her face after all that was not much help she said my wishing you luck wouldnt alter the wind and tide  it gave me an object and a stimulus we are a curious lot and much depends on our mood when ones braced enough obstacles dont count one runs risks and wins  flora was fastidious and got a faint jar yet she knew he was not a boaster he did what he said besides she was flattered  you are stopping for a few days with the commodore he resumed  flora said she was and he frowned i must go i ought not to have taken the holiday but the temptation was strong now i must make up for the lost time  your new business keeps you occupied  yes it claims all my thought though now and then i deny the claim the sea pulls and a boats a fascinating toy but a time comes when one must put ones toys away  for all that you came to the regattas and won the cup  wyndham smiled and for the moon was bright flora noted the reckless sparkle in his eyes  you know why i came and why i won the cup he said perhaps im vain but i wanted you to see i could beat the others whose toys are all that occupy them i have not their luck and my object for coming drives me back to town if im to realize my ambitions i have got to work  then you are ambitious flora remarked and looked away  very he replied quietly i know my drawbacks and they must be removed i have inherited the responsibilities of an embarrassed house my jobs to repair its credit wipe out debts and make wyndhams respected as it was respected once a big job but the ambition behind it gives me driving force  he paused and gave her a steady look your fathers friends are merchants and shipowners you know i have much to build up and something to live down  flora was quiet for a moment or two she had heard her friends talk about wyndhams and it was plain that they thought the new head of the house something of an adventurer for all that she was moved she liked his frankness and his resolution looking about she saw marston and a girl she knew cross the lawn and was tempted to join them had it not been for the glamour of the moonlight and sparkling sea she might have gone  i wish you luck again she said quietly  ah he said that will carry me far farther than you think perhaps because i am going away  flora moved abruptly and he saw she was disturbed  where are you going will you stop long she asked and wyndham knew his chance had come her friends might blame him but he meant to use his power  to begin with im going to west africa and then to south and central america we have an old schooner in the guinea coast and i expect to sail her across she can creep into lagoons and call at beaches the steamers do not touch somebody must pull the houses vanishing trade together and i am the head  but its a long ocean passage and an unhealthy coast flora remarked with a note of strain in her voice altogether she tried to be calm  all the same i must go and go soon wyndham replied  he stopped because he knew he had said enough and flora pondered she would miss him much and his going forced her to front a crisis she would sooner have put off she knew he loved her and he had a strange fascination he stood for romance and adventure but she was fastidiously honest and now and then he jarred she felt vaguely that there was something about him she did not like  in the meantime marston and his companion came by again the girl was a friend of floras but she passed without a glance and flora knew she disapproved somehow she wished her lover was like bob marston bob had no fascination indeed he was rather dull but he was frank and honest and one trusted him she knew she ought to join him and mabel there was danger in stopping but she did not go harry would sail at daybreak and she would be lonely afterwards  marston and the girl went on the music stopped and flora heard the drowsy splash of the tide the moonlight sparkled on the strait and she felt a strange longing to be rash one missed much unless one had pluck then wyndham put his hand on her arm and gave her a long ardent look  i am going away he said i must go for your sake i must try to mend my damaged inheritance will you marry me when i come back  flora hesitated until he put his arm round her and her doubts vanished romance conquered and passion swept her away she yielded when he drew her to him and gave back his kiss then he let her go as people came towards them and they crossed the lawn  my dear he said triumphantly i can conquer all my difficulties now and make your friends approve you have given me a power i never had i feel i cant be stopped  his eyes were very bright and he lifted his head he looked unconquerable and his confidence was flattering floras doubts had gone he was her acknowledged lover and she was very staunch  i must see your father when he gets back to town wyndham said presently the committee will keep him until too late tonight  yes said flora with faint misgivings you must see him soon  wyndhams eyes twinkled its possible he will get a jolt ill own i was half afraid but i fear nothing now  he loves me flora answered with a quiet look and wyndham said nothing but pressed her arm  they left the castle grounds for the quiet beach and in the meantime mabel hilliard and marston leaned against the rails on the pier for a time the girl watched the water foam among the pillars and then looked up  why didnt you speak to wyndham she asked  marston smiled i think the reason was plain harry didnt want us why didnt you speak to flora  mabel made a sign of impatience i wanted to but this would have been different flora wouldnt have suspected you were meddling  i see said marston im known to be dull but im not so dull that i miss your meaning well you know harry wyndhams my friend  they were lovers who used no reserve and mabel did not hesitate  floras my friend she said do you always trust wyndham  if i didnt trust him he wouldnt be my friend  in some ways youre very nice bob but im afraid floras attracted by wyndham i wish she were not  why dont you like harry  its rather that i love flora shes sincere and proud shes fastidious i think i mean shes scrupulously honorable  then you imply that harry is not marston asked with a touch of sternness  no i dont altogether imply this but i feel he is not the man for flora  well said marston quietly i have known harry long hes clever and generous he has pluck and when strain comes is his best i know what some folks think about him and harry knows his handicap the wyndhams were rather a wild lot the family business was drifting on the rocks and the character of its recent head was not good all this is a load for harry but hell run straight and i feel my job is to help him out  mabel was not much comforted but she gave him a smile  if he is going to marry flora i want you to help him she replied  they went off and some time afterwards wyndham came along the pier the fireworks were over and the crowd had gone but a group of men stood about some steps that led to a narrow stage where the yachts boats were moored the tide ran fast foaming against the iron pillars but the promenade above threw a dark shadow on the water wyndham stopped at the steps and tried to see if red roses dinghy was tied among the rest it was too dark all he could distinguish was a row of boats that swung about then young chisholm pushed past  the weed on the steps is slippery and im not going down a yachtsman jumps into a punt he said  a yachts punt is small and generally unstable and to jump on board needs skill marston came up and seized chisholms shoulder  dont be a fool jack he said its six or seven feet if you dont capsize her youll go through the bottom  think i cant jump six feet the lad exclaimed and wyndham imagined he had drunk some wine at the committee supper anyhow ill try  he shook off marstons hand and leaped his dark figure vanished and there was a splash below marston and the others climbed down the steps but wyndham jumped he went under water and knew the risk he ran when he came up he had known when he made the plunge the tide swept him past the boats and broke angrily among the ironwork one might get entangled and pulled down and if a punt came to help she would probably capsize when the current drove her against a brace  for a moment or two he drifted and then saw something dark wash about in a wedge of foam it was chisholm clinging to an iron and trying to keep his head above water  let go ill pick you up on the other side shouted wyndham and the current swept them under a beam  then he grasped the lads shoulder and steered him between two pillars the splash of oars indicated that a boat was pulling round the pier wyndhams arm struck a crossbar and next moment something caught his leg but he went clear and dragging chisholm with him drifted into the moonlight he felt safe now all they need do was to wait until the boat arrived they were a hundred yards from the pier when she came up and marston leaned over the bow  let me have him he said back her and sit steady tom  wyndham knew he could trust bob and let chisholm go marston dragged him on board and then balanced the boat while wyndham lifted himself over the stern chisholm did not seem much the worse for he began to squeeze the water from his clothes and laughed  trouble was the punt i jumped for wasnt there he said imagine i owe you something wyndham the other fellows couldnt have got me while i stuck to the brace and if id let go id have gone under the irons  thats all right wyndham remarked youll look before you jump another time  they put chisholm on board a steam yacht and when they reached red rose marston said it was lucky for jack you were about we couldnt have got in between the braces with the punt  it was a stroke of luck for both of us wyndham replied with a laugh     chapter iii  chisholms persuasion   commodore chisholm sat in his smokingroom and knitted his brows while wyndham talked the room was small and plainly furnished and the books on the shelves were all about the sea narratives of old explorers voyages works on naval tactics and yacht registers wyndham spoke fast and with marked eagerness and when he was moved he had a strange power of persuasion but now and then chisholm frowned although he knew he must give way he hesitated there was something romantic and so to speak exotic about wyndham and chisholm liked sober english calm  for all that he loved his daughter whom he had long indulged and knew her mind he had only two children jack and flora and his wife was dead chisholm had loved her well and married rather late it was for her sake and because his pay was small he left the navy and took a post in the service of a public navigation board although he held his navy rank he was generally given his yachting title the commodore he was scrupulously just frank and rather slow a man at whom his friends sometimes smiled but always trusted now he frankly wished his daughter had chosen another lover it was not that he disliked the fellow he knew his family history and what business men thought about wyndham brothers still it looked as if flora was satisfied  you ask me rather a hard thing he remarked when wyndham stopped however if flora agrees i suppose i cannot refuse its obvious i owe you much  you mean my pulling jack out of the water i dont want to urge this it was really nothing and the lad swims well  there is some risk in trying to swim through a net of iron rods when a fourknot current runs through the holes as i expect you knew when you plunged besides its plain jack was excited and a little off his balance the others went for a punt you saw the real danger and steered him through  wyndham imagined chisholm was struggling with his prejudices and trying to be just he had a generous vein and the commodores honesty moved him  my strongest argument is that i love flora he declared  it counts for much said chisholm who felt his sincerity still there are other matters one must talk about  that is so sir wyndham agreed well i know im asking much and im handicapped im poor when i took the family business i took a load of debt and some distrust were not a conventional lot we have long been reckless and adventurous  he stopped for a moment and then while chisholm approved his frankness went on all the same im young the houses fortunes can be mended and its credit made good and i have an object for putting my heart into the job it will be something of a struggle sir but ive got a fighting chance and with floras help i feel im going to win  how do you propose to mend the houses fortunes chisholm asked  for a start ive planned to visit our factories abroad study our trade on the spot and turn out incompetent agents ill begin in west africa and then cross to the caribbean i expect to use our trading schooner  chisholm looked up rather quickly and wyndham saw his interest was roused when one talked about boats the commodore was keen and wyndhams voyage was so to speak safe ground  its a long run chisholm remarked  the slavers road sir said wyndham who meant to lead him on a slow beat against the guinea current until one clears the windward ports and works up to the pambier and then a fast reach across open water in the northeast trades the early adventurers used smaller boats than mine  they pushed off from the azores and canaries north of your track and carried the northeaster farther across if you get to leeward youll strike the equatorial calms but what about your boat  shes an old ninetyton yacht the columbine and was rather famous once  columbine said chisholm who took down a yacht register here she is good builders men who stuck to oak and teak but shes thirty years old  wyndham smiled the commodore was getting keen he was as enthusiastic as a boy when he talked about the sea  i understand shes pretty sound and i must use the tools ive got her draught is light we can cross river bars and get into shallow lagoons our factories stand by the mangrove creeks the slavers haunted wyndhams were slavers long since  an old house said chisholm your folks were pioneers theres something in a long record habits and characteristics go with the blood of an old stock  sometimes that has drawbacks sir wyndham remarked  chisholm did not follow him and wyndham saw he was musing about the romance of the sea  but what about your crew the commodore asked  i expect to keep the liberian krooboys now on board a halftamed reckless lot but every krooboys a sailor  i know fine stuff but needs management chisholm agreed i was on patrol along the guinea coasta long time since blazing sun roaring bars steaming mangrove swamps and sickness for all that theres a fascination you get nowhere else unless its on the caribbean and coast of brazil the worlds alike on the lines of latitude and mans morals follow the parallels he paused with a dreamy look and then resumed im getting old and have my duty but if i could id go with you  for a time they talked about the voyage and then with a halfembarrassed smile chisholm pulled himself up im forgetting there are things i ought to ask  wyndham told him how much money he had and when chisholm looked thoughtful went on i dont expect your consent to our marrying yet its not long since i took control of the business and much depends on the arrangements i hope to make at our factories things will look better when i come back  its possible but you do not know  i really do know sir wyndham declared you can make my ability to put things straight a stipulation if you like im willing to be tested i feel i cant fail  chisholm studied him for a moment or two wyndhams eyes sparkled he looked strangely forceful and resolute and chisholm thought he understood why flora had been carried away the fellow was handsome and romantic besides he was a fine sailor and chisholm knew his pluck  very well he said well let it go like that the wedding must wait until you come back but i wish you luck  wyndham thanked him and when he went off chisholm pondered perhaps he had agreed rather weakly he had meant to be firmer but wyndham had led him to talk about his voyage anyhow the fellow had charm it was hard to refuse him and chisholm had seen he was sincere by and by he got up and lighted his pipe the thing was done with and he had given his consent somehow he had been persuaded and after all if flora was satisfied  chisholm had not stipulated that nobody should be told and floras friends had much to talk about mabel hilliard was disturbed and when marston came to her mothers house one evening took him to the garden  bob she said i suppose you know wyndham is going to marry flora  i do know said marston in fact i approve flora is nearly the nicest girl ive met however i imagine youre not satisfied  i am not flora has been my friend since we were children i am very fond of her and think she is quite the nicest girl you have met  bar one marston interposed  mabel smiled oh well i expect your judgments biased bob but let me go on although its rather awkward ground wyndham has charm hes picturesque something of the gentlemanadventurer type i think thats what i mean  but you dont like the type i thought it appealed to a girls imagination anyhow although were getting conventionalized there are gentlemenadventurers and we have jobs for them yet  i am not romantic mabel replied with a twinkling glance i like sober men even if theyre sometimes slow men who keep a promise but dont protest much one doesnt want to be dazzled a steady light is enough  marston was silent for a moment or two mabels trust moved him and he was half embarrassed then he said theres a remark of yours i cant let go no ground you think you ought to venture on is awkward to us very well you dont approve harrys marrying flora but what line dyou want me to take i cant give him up and youre not going to give up your friend it wouldnt be like you  i want you to stick to him closer than before flora and he may need us both one feels that wyndhams unstable and you make good ballast bob  well i suppose im heavy enough and you have given me an easy job its curious but not long since i told harry id see him out if he wanted help and yesterday he hinted hed like a partner for his voyage south in a way of course i dont want to go  mabel hid her disturbance and mused she was modern and sometimes frivolous but she was very staunch and loved two people well she did not want bob to go and yet she thought he ought mabel had an instinctive distrust for wyndham although she liked him she felt that with his temperament he would run risks in the south and he must be protected for floras sake flora had promised to marry wyndham and mabel knew she would keep her word well sober honest bob who was really cleverer than people thought was the man to take care of him  if wyndham urges it i must let you go she said  marston gave her a steady glance and nodded  i understand of course i think your notions ridiculous harry doesnt need a fellow like me but you mean well although in one way id frankly like the trip in another id much sooner stay  i know said mabel youre a dear bob  then she got up smiling and advanced to meet chisholm and flora who came up the garden path  wyndham urged marston to go with him and a week or two afterwards flora and mabel stood on the deck of a paddle tug crossing a busy river mouth the day was dull and a haze of smoke from two towns hung about the long rows of warehouses and massive river walls out in the stream a small steamer with a black funnel and a row of white deckhouses moved seawards with the tide the figures grouped along her rail got indistinct but floras eyes were fixed upon two that stood away from the rest until they faded then the african boat vanished behind the towering hull of an anchored liner  flora turned and lowered her veil for her eyes were wet chisholm was on board the tug but he was some distance off mabel was near and her look was strained  in a way its only a long yachting trip the latter remarked  no said flora we both know it is not its a rash adventure harry is going south as his people all have gone and some did not come back  of course hell come back travels safe and easy now theyll have no adventures except perhaps at sea  im not afraid of the sea flora said in a quiet voice its the tropic coast the big muddy rivers that get lost in the forest and the dark lagoons among the mangrove swamps the countrys insidious its influence is strong  mabel forced a smile she thought flora was not disturbed about the physical dangers such as fever and shipwreck it looked as if she knew her lover  anyhow bob is going with harry and bob is not romantic she remarked in fact hes the steadiest most matteroffact man i know nothing excites bob much its very hard to carry him away  flora gave her a grateful look since she must not criticize harry they could not be altogether frank but she saw mabel understood the men they loved had very different temperaments and bob would be a useful counterbalance he was sober and practical one could trust him it was hard to own that in a sense she could not trust harry he was rash and flora did not like the stories about the wyndhams who had not come back however bob was going and she imagined she owed mabel much  i like bob she said i expect it cost you something to send him with harry  he wanted to go  flora put her hand in the others arm but you might have stopped him  hes harrys friend said mabel i am yours after all that counts for something but we wont talk about it now your promising to marry harry has drawn us closer its an extra tie because all bobs friends are mine  the tugs whistle shrieked as she swung across the tide to the landing stage and flora looked down the river in the distance where granite walls and warehouses got small and indistinct the african boat melted into the smoke and mist flora felt strangely forlorn and half afraid     chapter iv  the man who vanished   moonlight glittered on the west african river and it was very hot the air was heavy humid and tainted by miasmatic vapors inside the lonely factory moisture dripped from the beams and the big bare room that opened on the veranda smelt of mildew across the river tangled mangroves loomed through drifting mist that hid the banks of mud about their long arched roots wyndhams schooner columbine rode in midstream her tall masts and the graceful sweep of her rail cutting black against the silver light somebody on board was singing a kroo paddling song with a strange monotonous air in the distance one heard the rumble of heavy surf  the factory was old and ruinous and the agents hair was going white he sat opposite wyndham at the end of a table about which documents were scattered a cocktail jug and some glasses occupied the middle ellams was haggard and his skin was a jaundiced yellow marston lounged in a deck chair with the perspiration running down his face and smoked a cigarette  i think i have told you all you want to know and im willing to give up my post ellams remarked indeed im beginning to feel im too old for the job few white men have lived as long in the fever swamps as a rule an agents run was very short when i first came out we didnt bother about mosquitoes then the tropicaldiseases people hadnt discovered the mischievous habits of anopheles  you were here with my uncle i think said wyndham  i was with him for a year or two ellams answered in a reminiscent tone a strange man in some ways i expect its long since you saw him  he came to england when i was a boy  ellams smiled when i saw you cross the compound i thought rupert wyndham had come back wait a moment i have his portrait  he brought a faded and mildewed photograph wyndham studied it without speaking and then gave it to marston who made a little gesture of surprise he imagined rupert wyndham was about his comrades age when the portrait was taken and the likeness was strange there was in both faces a hint of recklessness and unrest although the hint was plainer in the portrait it indicated that rupert would venture much and take paths sober men did not tread somehow it disturbed marston  i suppose you know he vanished in the west indies wyndham remarked  yes said ellams quietly i half expected something like this  ah said wyndham well weve done with business for tonight tell me about my uncle  ellams drained his glass and marston noted that his hand shook the man had obviously suffered much from ague and fever  rupert wyndham was here before me ellams began procter was agent when he arrived and procter had got some native habits thats a risk men who indulge their curiosity run in africa theres danger of forgetting one is white i imagine it was unlucky rupert began with procter his was a strange adventurous temperament  im told i have some of ruperts characteristics wyndham remarked but go on  when your uncle came out there was no rule but the negro headmans british authority stopped a few miles from the outpost stockade and traders made their own laws they lived and drank hard in some ways things are not very different yet we kill mosquitoes and dig drains but africa doesnt change  well procter had gone the way some white men go and when he died your uncle got a jar rupert had only known england and he was young but i dont mean he was daunted rather he lost his balance and started on a line he ought to have left alone sometimes he talked about the thing i suspect he knew the leopards killed procter  the leopards marston interrupted  the ghost leopards a secret society in this country there are a number run by the juju priests theyre supposed to use magic but theyre a power in native politics and have given the british government trouble perhaps the leopards are the strongest the bushmen believe they can take the form of the animals and when they like make themselves invisible anyhow the headman they dont approve seldom rules very long  ellams paused for a few moments and resumed it was a hot night when rupert wyndham thought he heard procter call he said his voice was choked and faint he got up he occupied the room yonder ellams indicated a door opposite and went on there was no light but the moon shone through the window behind us rupert had only been awake a few moments and heard nothing but the faint cry he ran out in his pyjamas and found procter on the floor procters body was warm but when wyndham tried to lift him he saw he was dead he lay across the cracked board where mr marston sits  marston halfconsciously pushed back his chair but what indicated the leopards  there were strange marks on procters throat wyndham thought they looked like the marks of claws  marston pondered while ellams filled his glass he pictured the huddled figure in pyjamas lying across the rotten boards and the marks on the throat as a rule his nerve was good but the picture daunted him and he did not like his comrades strange fixed look in a sense the story was ridiculous that is it would have looked ridiculous in england but africa was different theatrical tragedy was not strange there and he did not think ellams had exaggerated much  well said the latter in the morning wyndham found the factory boys had gone he was alone with procter and could get no help besides he had a dose of fever and when malaria grips you your imagination works he said perhaps the worst was the quietness and the buzzing of the flies he dug a grave but could not get procter down the steps fever makes one very limp you know well he sat there all day keeping the flies off procter and in the evening a millers launch came up stream  a ghastly day said marston but wyndham signed to ellams  you havent told it all go on  im an old servant and youre the head of the house ellams replied meaningly well i think that day left a mark on rupert wyndham when i arrived he was moody and often brooded but it looked as if he had a talent for managing the bushmen they seemed to understand him and the business was growing fast he began to go up river although i imagine no other trader had reached the native market then it was good for business our oil was first quality and we got stuff skins and sometimes ivory millers and the association couldnt buy besides there were bits of pottery brass and silver work the fulah brought across the desert wyndham said the patterns were sarascenic and the stuff was hundreds of years old the house knew where to sell the goods at home once or twice we got aggri beads  i didnt know about that wyndham remarked and turned to marston in africa aggri beads are worth almost any price you like to ask we cant imitate them and dont know how they are made its very rare for a negro headman to let an aggri go  ellams made a sign of agreement and gave wyndham an apologetic glance you see what this implies  i think i see my uncle was getting native habits he was getting an influence  he stopped away from the factory longer men with tattoo marks i didnt know came down and talked to him and sometimes brought no trade i thought he ran risks and warned him but he laughed it went on and we were getting rich when the change began our trade did not fall off much but one felt a difference  ellams paused and looked thoughtful when he resumed i cant altogether make things plain there was a feeling of insecurity and wyndhams moodiness got worse he did not go away so much and locked his room door at night i think he did not sleep and took some draught not drugs white men use but stuff the negroes make when he did sleep he was strangely hard to rouse he was cool and as nearly fearless as any man i knew but he began to look haggard and start at unexpected sounds one morning i could not wake him and went round to the veranda window wyndham was fast asleep and a gun lay across his bed he was a good shot with a pistol but this was a heavy duckgun that threw an ounce and a quarter of shot well i was getting nervy and the factory boys would not stopit looked as if they knew something was wrong i began to wonder how long wyndham could keep it up  the others were quiet when ellams reached for the cocktail jug and finding it empty filled his pipe marston had spent some weeks on the african coast and sympathized with the agent when one had seen the country and breathed the foul miasma that saps the white mans strength one could understand the strain ellams talked about it was a daunting country and the gloom of its steamy forests was the shadow of death  after all said ellams there was no theatrical climax one day a launch brought us a cablegram wyndham was wanted at home the ebb tide was running and a mailboat was due to call at takana lagoon in an hour columbine dropped down stream and my notion is it was a relief to wyndham the cablegram arrived if it had not arrived he would have stayed he was that kind of man  had you trouble afterwards marston asked  i had not it was as if a shadow had melted the strain had gone  then it looks as if my uncle alone were threatened wyndham remarked  ellams nodded yes i think it was so to speak a personal thing for all that our trade got slack and has not since touched the mark it reached in your uncles time well i think thats all and perhaps i have talked too much  if youll mix another cocktail well go to bed wyndham replied and when a few minutes afterwards he went to his room stopped at the door  this is where rupert wyndham slept with the gun beside him i suppose he said i wonder what he dreamed about  for some time marston did not sleep as a rule he did not indulge his imagination but he had been disturbed by the agents tale and there were strange noises some he thought were made by cracking boards and falling damp others puzzled him and he found them daunting in the dark they were like footsteps as if somebody stole about the rooms marston had had enough of africa and yet he owned the country had a mysterious charm white men stayed knowing the risk they ran and without much hope of money reward until they died of fever or their minds got deranged the latter happened now and then in order to keep sane one must concentrate on ones business and refuse to speculate about the secret life of the bush after all there was much to speculate about  marston pulled himself up he was a sober white man and had nothing to do with the negros fantastic superstitions magic and witchcraft were ridiculous but in a country where they were a ruling force it was not easy to laugh he thought rupert wyndham had made rash experiments and had dared too much and although this was perhaps not important harry had his uncles temperament the trouble was there still they would leave the river soon and it would be a relief to go to sea the sea was clean and bracing  three or four days afterwards columbine dropped down stream on the ebb a big naked krooboy held the wheel another in the forechannels swung the lead and called the depth in a musical voice the white factory got indistinct and melted into the swamps the puffs of wind were fresher and marston was conscious of a keen satisfaction as the dreary mangroves slipped astern and yellow sand and lines of foam came into view ahead  wyndham smoking a cigarette leaned against the rail he wore white duck without a crease and a big palegray hat marston thought he looked very english with his keen blue eyes light hair and red skin but his gaze was contemplative  youre not sorry to get away he presently remarked i wonder whether rupert wyndham was  i wonder why he stayed said marston unless of course he was earning money  a plausible explanation but im not sure its good wyndham replied with a smile the head of our house was often extravagant but never i think a miser were not a greedy lot  you were traders the object of trading is to get rich  i doubt if this was my uncles or some of my other ancestors object i think they valued money for what it would buy anyhow they seldom kept it long  since most of us value money for what it will buy i dont understand marston rejoined  you bought a country house a sober sportsmans life and the liking of honest friends well your investments were sound but there are men of other temperaments they mightnt satisfy i dont think they would have satisfied rupert wyndham  then what did he expect to get in the swamps  i dont know said wyndham with a curious smile perhaps strange experiences perhaps knowledge and power i imagine he knew he must buy them and was willing to pay  power over tattooed bushmen marston exclaimed what could they teach him  things we have begun to experiment with and their juju men knew long since the white man who knows the meaning of their tattoo marks has gone some distance theyre not all tribal signs however i dont know what rupert wyndham learned and it looks as if i shall not find out our objects very matter of fact to earn as much money as possible  that is so i mean to stick to it said marston firmly  wyndham laughed i expect you mean to see i take your line well its a good line but were getting near the bar suppose you fetch the chart     chapter v  the tornado   the night was hot and nearly calm and marston sitting on the cabin skylight languidly looked about a krooboy held the wheel and his dark figure cut against the phosphorescent sea columbines bulwarks were low and when she rolled the long smooth swell ran level with their top a dim glow came from the compass binnacle but the schooner was closehauled and the kroo steered by the faint strain on the helm the wind was light and baffling and columbine beat against it as she worked along the coast  she carried all her canvas and her high gafftopsail swung rhythmically across the sky shutting out the stars her dark mainsail looked very big and every now and then shook down a shower of dew as its slack curves swelled a small moon touched the tops of the undulations with silver light and when the bows went down the foam that leaped about the planks glimmered with green and gold booms and blocks rattled and timbers groaned  marston could not see the land which was hidden by the sour hot mist that at sunset rolls off the african coast he did not want to see it he hoped he had done with africa but he doubted columbine was on the track the keels of the old slavers plowed and he felt that the shadow of the dark country might follow him across the sea long since africa had peopled south america and the west indies wyndhams ancestors had helped in that one found mangrove swamps fever and negro superstition on the caribbean coast and it was significant that rupert wyndham had vanished there the trouble was harry had inherited something of his uncles temperament all the same marston had undertaken to stand by him and meant to do so  the breeze got lighter the wet canvas flapped and columbine hardly made steerage way she rolled until her bulwarks touched the water and threw off fiery foam one could not stand on her slanted deck and blocks and spars made a hideous din in the distance the roar of surf rose and fell with a measured beat somewhere in the mist the big combers crashed upon a hammered beach it did not matter if there was wind or not the white band of surf had fringed the coast since the world was young  marston found his watch dreary there was nothing to do nothing that he could see threatened and the scattered light clouds hardly moved across the sky he was filling his pipe when he heard a step and saw wyndham by the wheel he knew him by his white duck the negro crew did not wear much clothes  hallo he said my watch is not up  i was awake wyndham replied felt i ought to get on deck the glass is falling  did you feel you ought to come after you noted this  before said wyndham dryly i didnt know the glass had dropped until i got a light but it looks as if i might have stayed below however since i have turned out well haul down the maintopsail  he gave an order and two krooboys got to work there was no obvious reason for lowering the sail but when wyndham ordered the negroes obeyed although they grinned with frank goodhumor when marston talked to them he knew he did not share wyndhams authority yet harry was not harsh  when the sail was lowered wyndham looked about some of the scattered clouds had rolled together and the sky was black over the land one could scarcely feel the light wind but the surf had got louder its roar came out of the dark as if heavy trains were running along the coast  it looks ridiculous particularly since id like to edge her farther off the beach but i think well stow the mainsail and forestaysail wyndham remarked  marston agreed although he could see no grounds for shortening sail he trusted wyndhams judgment and the krooboys got to work again the ropes however were stiff and swollen with the dew and the mainsail came down slowly the heavy folds of canvas caught between the toppinglifts the gaffjaws jambed on the mast wyndham sent a man aloft to sit upon and ride down the spar but this did not help much and the boom along the foot of the sail lurched with violent jerks blocks banged and loose ropes whipped across the deck the sweat ran down marstons face he wanted to finish the job for one thing columbine was unmanageable while the halflowered canvas flapped about  stopping a moment for breath he glanced over the rail the long swell sparkled with small points of light that coalesced in sheets of green flame when the undulations broke against the schooners side the deck was spangled with luminous patches by the splashes and the wake that trailed astern was bright columbine stole through the water although the wind had nearly gone it was not worth while to bring her headto when they shortened sail  then the helmsman shouted and marston felt one side of his face and body cool the loose canvas flapped noisily its folds shook out and swelled and marston seized a rope his skin prickled he felt a strange tension and a feverish desire to drag down the sticking gaff a few moments afterwards something flickered behind the sail and a peal of thunder drowned the noise on board when it died away rolling hull slanted masts and the figures of the men stood out wonderfully sharp against a dazzling blaze that vanished and left bewildering dark the next peal of thunder deafened marston who thought wyndham shouted but heard no words this did not matter because he knew they must secure the sail before the tornado broke and he pulled at the downhaul he could not hear the wind for the thunder but it had begun to blow  the sail swelled between the confining ropes there was a noise on one side of the yacht water foamed along the planks and she began to swing it looked as if the steersman were putting up the helm the peak of the gaff was nearly down with another good pull they could seize it and lash it to the boom then a dazzling flash touched the deck marston saw wyndham run aft and push the kroo from the wheel but this was the last he saw clearly for sometime he imagined the fellow had meant to run the yacht off before the squall one could ease the strain of a sudden blast like that but if the squall lasted they could not shorten sail while she was before the wind now she was coming round wyndham had put the helm down it looked as if he were too late  the tornado broke upon her side and she went over until her lee rail was in the sea there was a noise like a thunderclap forward as a sail blew away marston thought it was the jib he could see nothing it had got impenetrably dark but he had a vague notion that water rushed along the deck and the mainsail had broken loose and blown out between the ropes unless they could master it the mast would go he heard another report forward and thought somebody had loosed the staysail halyards and the sail had blown to rags although his eyes were useless he knew what was going on  but they must secure the main gaff and clutching at the boom above his head he swung himself up and worked along to its outer end which stretched over the stern a footrope ran below the spar one could balance oneself by its help and he vaguely distinguished somebody close by it was no doubt wyndham because his clothes looked white there was no use in shouting the uproar drowned ones voice besides their job was plain they must get a rope round the end of the gaff and lash it fast  marstons waist was on the boom his feet stuck out behind him braced against the rope in front there was a dark gulf this was no doubt the hollow of the sail and the indistinct slanting line above was the gaff he threw a rope across the latter but the end did not drop so that he could seize it under the sail the wind blew it out straight and tight he tried again farther aft jostling against the figure that looked faintly white and leaning down across the boom caught the end of the rope the other man helped him and when they had got a loop round the end of the gaff he stopped for breath he was shaky after the effort his heart thumped painfully and his chest rose and fell he imagined other men were on the boom but he and his companion were all that mattered they must lash the peak down before the sail blew out again when this was done the others could master the distended folds  the wet rope tore his hands he felt them get slippery with blood but he held on and the man beside him helped marston knew he was not a kroo the kroos were bold sailors but their resolution had a limit when a job looked hopeless they gave up the man beside marston was another type while there was breath in his body he would stick to his task the sail must be conquered  lightning played about them and marstons eyes were dazzled by the changes from intolerable glare to dark he trusted to the feel of things and his seamans knowledge of what was happening he did not think but worked halfconsciously they made the gaff fast and then something broke and the heavy boom swung out over the sea the jerk threw marstons feet from the rope and his body began to slip off the boom he saw fiery foam below but as he braced himself for the plunge the next man seized him it looked as if they must both slip off for marston found no hold for his hands on the smooth wet spar perhaps the pressure of the wind saved them by forcing their limp bodies against the boom for the other man steadied marston until his foot touched the rope again  for a moment or two they hung on not daring to move and waiting until they gathered strength then they carefully worked their way to the inner end of the spar and dropped exhausted on the deck there was however no rest for them the massive boom must be dragged back and dropped into its crutch it could not be left to lurch about and smash all it struck marston was vaguely conscious that a gang of krooboys ran to the mainsheet and wyndham directed their efforts he himself could do no more and he leaned against the rail breathing hard  as his exhaustion vanished he began to note things the men had secured the boom but the schooners bows looked bare and he remembered the jibs had blown away the foresail was torn and halflowered and the gaff at its head was jambed the torn canvas kept the vessel from falling off the wind but would not bring her up enough for her to lie to masts and deck were horribly slanted the windward bulwark was hove high up and luminous spray drove across its top it looked as if she were going over and there was an appalling din for the scream of the tornado pierced the thunder  then lightning enveloped the yacht and ran along the water for an instant marston saw wyndhams white figure at the wheel and then he groped his way towards him in the puzzling dark harry would need help for marston knew what he meant to do since columbine would not come up he was going to run her off before the wind in order to ease the horrible pressure that bore her down the trouble was the tornado blew from sea and land was near marston seized the wheel and using all his strength helped wyndham to pull it round she felt her rudder and began to swing lifting her lee rail out of the water then she came nearly upright with a jerk and although the tornado was deafening marston thought he heard the water roar as it leaped against her bows  the speed she made lifted her forward and a white wave curled abreast of the rigging she was going like a train and marston sweated and gasped as he helped at the wheel there was nothing to do but let her run although it was obvious she could not run long a glance at the lighted compass indicated that she was heading for the land where angry surf beat upon an inhospitable beach if they tried to bring her round the masts would go and she might capsize  she drove on and presently the thunder stopped rain that fell in sheets swept the deck and beat their clothes against their skin one heard nothing but the roar of the deluge and the darkness could not be pierced after a few minutes marston felt the strain on the wheel get easier and lost the sense of speed the deck did not seem to be lifted forward and he thought the bows had resumed their proper level when he turned his head the rain no longer lashed his face the foresail flapped and the straining rattling noises began again it looked as if the wind had suddenly got light  lets bring her round he shouted and heard his voice hoarse and loud  wyndham signed agreement they turned the wheel and the crew ran about the deck she came round and a few minutes afterwards headed out to sea lurching slowly across the swell that now rolled and broke with crests of foam the sky had cleared but not far off an ominous rumble came out of the gloom astern  well wait for daybreak before we make sail wyndham remarked you can get below my watch has begun  i suppose you were with me on the boom  i was on the boom said wyndham somebody else was near  do you imply you didnt know whom it was when you held me up  oh well said wyndham laughing its not important suppose i had grabbed a krooboy who was falling do you imagine i ought to have let him go anyhow we helped each other i dont expect id have reached the deck if i had been alone  marston said no more one felt some reserve when one talked about things like that he looked to windward and seeing the night was calm went below     chapter vi  the middle passage   marston lounged with languid satisfaction on a locker in the stern cabin he had borne some strain and his body felt strangely slack although his brain was active the cabin was small and very plain because the yacht had been altered below decks when she was fitted for carrying cargo moisture trickled down the matchboarded ceiling big warm drops fell from the beams and a brass lamp swung about as she rolled marston however knew this was an illusion the beams moved but the lamp was still  there were confused noises water washed about inside the lurching hull although a sharp clank overhead indicated that somebody was occupied at the pump water gurgled with a noise like rolling gravel outside the planks timbers groaned a seam in the matchboarding opened and shut and a dull concussion shook the boat when her bows plunged into the swell the swell was high although the wind had dropped marston knew these noises and found them soothing they belonged to the sea and he loved the sea although he had not long since fought it for his life now the strain was over he felt the struggle with the tornado had braced and steadied him  in the tropics it was the land he did not like perhaps he was getting morbid for after all he had not seen much of the african coast and yet it frankly daunted him his confused recollections were like a bad dream muddy lagoons surrounded by dreary mangroves from which the miasma stole at night hot and steamy forests where mysterious dangers lurked and rotting damp factories from which the burning sun could not drive the shadow that weighed the white man down marston was not imaginative but he had felt the gloom  he pondered about it curiously the shadow was so to speak impalpable vague yet sinister now and then white men rebelled against it with noisy revels but when the liquor was out the gloom crept back and some drank again until they died yet the coast had a subtle charm against which it was prudent to steel oneself the shadow was a reflection of the deeper gloom in which the naked bushmen moved and served the powers that rule the dark  feverworn traders declared there were such powers one heard strange stories that the men who told them obviously believed it looked as if the juju magicians were not altogether impostors they knew things the white man did not and by this knowledge ruled their rule was owned and firm marston had thought it ridiculous but now he doubted there was something behind the hocuspocus something that moved ones curiosity and tempted one to rash experiment marston knew this was what he feared harry was rash and had rather felt the fascination than the gloom  marston banished his disturbing thoughts and began to muse about their struggle with the sail harry was a normal healthy white man then it was rather his sailors instincts than conscious resolution that led him to keep up the fight when it looked as if he must be thrown off the boom he would have been thrown off before he owned he was beaten one did things like that at sea because they must be done and did not think them fine marston reviewed the fight remembering his terror when he slipped and how his confidence returned after harry seized his arm the thought of the lonely plunge had daunted him it was different when he knew he would not plunge alone if harry and he could not reach the deck they would drop into the dark together that was all but it meant much for one thing it meant that marston must go where his comrade went although he might not like the path in the meantime he was tired and got into his bunk  when he went on deck in the morning the breeze was fresh and columbine drove through the water under all plain sail for they had some spare canvas on board the sky was clear and the sun sparkled on the foam that leaped about the bows and ran astern in a broad white wake the old boat was fast and there was something exhilarating in her buoyant lift and roll marston and wyndham got breakfast under an awning on deck wyndham wore thin white clothes and a silk belt his skin was burned a dark red and his keen blue eyes sparkled one saw the graceful lines of his muscular figure he looked alert and virile  youre fresh enough this morning marston remarked my back is sore and my arms ache it was a pretty big strain to secure the gaff  wyndham laughed if the sail had blown away from us the mast would have gone and the boat have drifted into the surf  i suppose we knew this unconsciously anyhow i didnt argue about the thing  you held on said wyndham well i expect its an example of an instinct men developed when they used the old sailing ships they must beat the sea or drown and sometimes the safety of all depended on the nerve of one i expect it led to a kind of classconscientiousness the common need produced a code  the instincts good somehow all you learn at sea is good i mean its morally bracing  wyndham smiled and indicated a faint dark line that melted into the horizon on the starboard hand  its different in africa for example  oh well said marston cautiously africa has drawbacks but if you dont get fever and are satisfied to look at things on the surface you might stay there sometime and not get much harm  wyndham saw marston meant to warn him and was amused bob was rather obvious but he was sincere  suppose youre not satisfied with things as they look on the surface and want to find out what they are beneath he asked  then i think you ought to clear out and go back to the north  a simple plan as a rule your plans are simple im curious however and sometimes like to indulge my curiosity its easily excited in africa there is much the white man doesnt know hes hardly begun to grasp the negros point of view  the negro has no point of view he gropes in the dark  i doubt it said wyndham thoughtfully i rather imagine he sees a light but perhaps not the light we know theres a rude order in his country and men with knowledge rule the leopards the ghost crocodiles and the other strange societies dont hold power for nothing power thats felt has some foundation  you like power marston remarked  wyndham smiled and looked about while he felt for another cigarette columbine swaying rhythmically to the heave of the swell drove through the sparkling water with a shower of spray blowing across her weather bow her tall canvas gleamed against the blue sky a krooboy lounged at the wheel the most part of his muscular body naked and a broad blue stripe running down his forehead two or three more squatted in the shade of a sail at the galley door the cook sang a monotonous african song the wire shrouds hummed like harpstrings striking notes that changed with the tension as the vessel rolled there was nothing to do but lounge and talk and wyndhams mood was confidential  i have not known much power he said in england power must be bought my father was poor but careless my mother was sternly conventional when he died she tried to turn my feet into the regular beaten path i know now she was afraid i would follow my ancestors wandering steps well at school i had the smallest allowance among the boys and learned to plot for things my comrades enjoyed as a rule i got the things i dont know if the effort was good or not but i was ambitious and wanted a leading place folks like you dont know what it costs to hold ones ground  i expect i got things easily marston agreed perhaps this was lucky because ive no particular talent  you have one talent that is worth all mine wyndham rejoined with some feeling people trust you bob  marston colored but wyndham went on when i left school and went to wyndhams there was not much change for the most part my friends were rich and i had a clerks pay with a vague understanding that at some far off time i might be the head of the house the house was obviously tottering i did not think it would stand until i got control my uncle ruperts brother would not see wyndhams had stood so long he felt it was selfsupporting and would stand well he was kind and im glad he died without knowing how near we really were to a fall  however i didnt mean to talk about the house but rather about my life when i was a shipping clerk i had ambition and thought i had talent i hated to be left behind by my friends it cost much planning to share their amusements join a good yacht club and race my boat sportsmen like you dont know the small tricks and shabbiness we others are forced to use well at length my uncle died and i got control of the falling house with its load of debt id long been rash but the rashest thing i did was when i fell in love with flora yet she loved me and chisholm with some reserves has given his consent i have got to satisfy him and with this in view were bound for the caribbean on board a thirtyyearold yacht  marston thought wyndham did not look daunted in a sense his venture was reckless but harry tried and did things others thought beyond their powers on the whole marston imagined his boldness was justified  if money can help you know where it can be got he said  wyndhams halfironical glance softened  thanks bob so far i havent gone begging from my friends but if i can use your money without much risk i will borrow i think you know this  whats mine is yours marston remarked and went to the cabin for a chart with which he occupied himself  he studied the chart and sailing directions when he had nothing to do and was rather surprised that wyndham did not it was a long run to the caribbean and would be longer if they drifted into the equatorial calms marston had a yacht masters certificate although he was rather a seaman than a navigator he could find his way along the coast by compass and patentlog but to steer an ocean course was another thing one must be exact when one calculated ones position by the height of the sun and stars  for some time they made good progress and then the light wind dropped and columbine rolled about in a glassy calm the swell ran in long undulations that shone with reflected light and there was no shade for they lowered all sail to save the canvas from burning and chafing the sun pierced the awning and it was intolerably hot they had reached the dangerous part of the old slavers track the belt of stagnant ocean where the south wind stopped and the northeast had not begun the belt had been marked long since by horrors worse than wreck for while the crowded brigs and schooners drifted under the burning sun fresh water ran out and white men got crazed with rum while negroes died from thirst  wyndham lounged one morning under the awning after his bath he wore silk pyjamas a red silk belt and a wide hat of double felt he looked cool and marston thought he harmonized with his surroundings the background of dazzling water the slanted masts that caught the light as they swung and the oily black figures of the naked crew he wondered whether harry had inherited something from ancestors who had known the tragedies of the middle passage marston himself was wet with sweat his eyes ached and his head felt full of blood  we may drift about for some time he said throwing down a book he had tried to read the sailing directions indicate that the trades are variable near their southern limit  its a matter of luck wyndham agreed and marston started because his comrades next remark chimed with his thoughts when i studied some of the houses old records i found that two of our brigs vanished in the calm belt one wondered how they went fire perhaps or the slaves broke the hatch at night cant you picture their pouring out like ants and bearing down the drunken crew the crews did drink slaving was not a business for sober men hogsheads of rum figure in our old victualing bills  he paused and resumed with a hard smile well it was a devilish trade one might speculate whether the responsibility died with the men engaged in it and vanished with the money they earned none of the wyndhams seem to have kept money long luck went hard against them when they did not squander misfortune dogged the house  superstition marston exclaimed  wyndham laughed its possible but superstitions common and all men are not fools i expect their fantastic imaginings hold a seed of truth perhaps somebody here and there finds the seed and makes it grow  in africa they water the soil with blood its not a white mans gardening marston rejoined and went forward to the bows but got no comfort there  the sea shone like polished steel heaving in long folds without a wrinkle on its oily surface but for the sluggish rise and fall one might have imagined no wind had blown since the world was young  for a week columbine rolled about and then one morning faint blue lines ran across the sea to the north gasping and sweating with the effort they hoisted sail and sent up the biggest topsail drenched with salt water sometimes it and the light balloon jib filled and although the lower canvas would not draw columbine began to move one could not feel her progress there was no strain on the helm but silky ripples left her side and slowly trailed astern  for all that she went the wrong way heading south into the calm and they could not bring her round her rudder had no grip when they turned the wheel and sometimes she stopped for an hour and then crawled on again the krooboys panted in the shade of the shaking sails and marston groaned and swore when he took his glasses and slackly climbed the rigging the darkblue lines were plainer three or four miles off and he thought they marked the edge of the tradebreeze  wyndham alone looked unmoved he lay in a canvas chair under the awning and smoked and seemed to dream marston wondered what he dreamed about and hoped it was flora in the afternoon marston felt he must find some relief  i want to launch a boat and tow her he said theres wind enough not far off to keep her steering  wyndham nodded very well its recorded that they towed the providence for three days and used up a dozen negroes in the boats besides some gallons of rum the fellow who kept the log was obviously methodical however i want to keep our boys and you cant tow in the sun  its unthinkable marston agreed well begin at dark     chapter vii  the tow   at sunset they hoisted out two boats for wages are low in africa and columbine carried a big crew wyndham stopped on board to steer while marston went in the gig and the sun touched the horizon when he began to uncoil a heavy warp he was only occupied for a few minutes but when he had finished it was dark the relief from the glare was soothing and the gloom was marked by a mistiness that gave him hope he knew a faint haze often follows the northeast trades  the krooboys dipped the oars and the water glimmered with luminous spangles under the blades and fell like drops of liquid fire this was all the light except for the sparkle at columbines bows as she slowly forged ahead she came on towering above the boats in a vague dark mass until she sank with the swell and the tightening rope jerked them rudely back on heaving water towing a large vessel is strenuous work for her progress is a series of plunges and one cannot keep an even strain on the rope  when they began to row marstons boat was drawn back under the yachts iron martingale her bowsprit loomed above it threatening and big and the oars bent as the kroos drove the boat ahead in a few moments she stopped and forged back towards the yacht but the jerk was less violent columbine was moving faster and the heavy warp worked like a spring easing the shock marstons business however was to tow her round and when she began to turn he had trouble to keep his boat in line the tightening rope rasped across her stern the gig swerved and listed over until it looked as if she would capsize the oars on one side were buried deep the men could not clear them for another stroke and the threatening martingale rose and fell close astern  marston when the rope would let him sculled with a long oar and presently the skin peeled from his hands his throat got parched sweat ran down his face and he gasped with straining breath but it was better to use his strength than risk the martingales being driven into his back they pulled her round and it was easier afterwards although he could not relax much the yacht was stealing through the water but they must keep up her speed or the violent jerks would begin again it was only possible to rest for a moment on the crest of the swell when the warp absorbed the backward pull  a negro began to sing and the rest took up the chorus the air was strange and dreary but somehow musical and marston imagined it was very old he understood the kroos had sung their paddling chanties long before the elizabethan slavers touched the fevercoast the night was very calm and dark the figures of the men were indistinct but when the song stopped marston heard their labored breathing and the regular splash of oars they rowed well and he hoped their toil was not wasted by daybreak they might reach the edge of the wind but the fickle zephyrs might die away and the fiery dawn break across another glassy calm  when he was not sculling marston mused he was rich and owned it strange that he was there laboring in the boat as the slavers labored when they towed the providence two hundred years ago he wondered why men went to sea in sailing ships to bear fatigues nobody endured at home to fight for life on slanted yards and stagger waistdeep about flooded decks yet one went and sometimes went for no reward the thing was puzzling  after all the sea had a touch of romance one felt nowhere else it was something to brave the middle passage although one had enough fresh water and no frenzied slaves on board marston thought about the old brigsthey towed the providence three days under the burning tropic sun he could picture her she rode low in the water with her stone ballast and freight of parched humanity packed close on the tweendecks and in the bottom hold she had tall masts for speed was needed and the weight aloft would make her plunge and roll the jerks on the towline embarrassed the boats but white men drove the exhausted negroes with whips and curses until they dropped the oars and died yet they towed her three days  marston could not see his watch and wondered how long it was to sunrise it was unthinkable they should go on rowing in the heat of day he was tired now and remembering the dark ripples alone sustained him he thought they had nearly reached the spot where the surface was disturbed but the fickle puffs of wind might have dropped stopping sculling for a few moments he turned his head his face was wet with sweat but he felt no coolness on his skin it was very dark and ominously calm  he took up the long oar again twisting it with bleeding hands and bracing his legs they must keep columbine moving and his business was to hold the boat straight trouble with the warp would follow if she took a sheer for all that he could not hold out long he had taken life easily and his body revolted from the strain in fact he was beaten now but it counted for much that the krooboys rowed they were raw savages and he was white they owned his control but all the advantages money could buy for him had gone nothing was left but the primitive strength and stubbornness of human nature he must not be beaten he owed it to the ruling stock from which he sprang and with a stern effort he tugged at the oar  at length he felt an elusive chill and wiping his wet face looked about in the east it was not quite so dark and when he turned his head the yacht looked blacker and not so large hull and sails were no longer blurred their outline was getting sharp and he noted that the balloon jib swelled in a gentle curve one side of his face got cold and when he began to scull again he thought the strain on the rope was less  a belt of smoky red spread swiftly along the horizon he heard the high gaff topsail flap booms rattled and then the yacht got quiet the tow rope sank and when it tightened there was no jerk columbine was stealing up behind them  in oars said marston hoarsely let go the warp  the boat drifted back to the schooner and bumped against her side until somebody caught a trailing rope marston with an effort climbed the rail and dropping on deck saw wyndham at the wheel  shall we hoist in the boys are done he said  wyndham nodded days breaking it will soon be blazing hot the sun may kill the wind but i dont know its a fiery dawn  blocks began to rattle and when the first boat swung across the rail marston looked about broad beams of light stretched across the sky and the red sun rose out of the sea he went to a chair under the awning and threw himself down he had earned a few minutes rest but when they had gone he did not move and wyndham smiled as he noted his even breath beckoning a krooboy he sent him for a blanket and gently covered the sleeping man  marston was wakened by a lurch that threw him off the chair and getting up stiffly he noted the sharp slant of deck then he saw foam boil behind the lee rail and straining curves of canvas that kept their hollowness when the yacht rolled to windward she trailed a snowy wake across the backs of the sparkling seas and her rigging hummed on a high piercing note the sky was blue but the blue was dim and the sunshine had lost its dazzling glare one felt a bracing quality in the breeze  looks as if we had hit the trades he said whats her course  about north northwest said wyndham who sat on the stern grating and indicated the kroo at the wheel bad dollar is steering by the wind i reckoned we had better make some northing while we can off our course but the trades are fickle in this latitude suppose you get your sextant its close on twelve oclock  marston looked at the nearly vertical sun and laughed  i feel as if id just gone to sleep he said and went below  the breeze freshened and held columbine with all plain sail set made good speed and they laid off a straight course on the big atlantic chart the risks of the middle passage were left behind if they were lucky she would reach far across on the starboard tack without their shifting a rope  their hopes were justified and at length they made barbadoes and sailing between the windward isles entered the caribbean one phase of the adventure was over but marston with vague misgivings realized that another had begun somehow he felt he had not done with the shadow he had shrunk from in africa for all that nothing happened to disturb him as they followed the coast stopping now and then at an open roadstead and now and then in the stagnant harbor of an old spanish town indeed marston found much that was soothingly familiar smart liners rusty cargo boats and busy hotels in parts the towns had been modernized but civilized comforts and sometimes luxuries contrasted sharply with decay and customs that had ruled since the first spaniards came  wyndhams had agents and correspondents at a number of the ports but as a rule they were darkskinned gentlemen of uncertain stock they lived at old houses with flat tops and central patios where the kitchen generally adjoined the stable and transacted their business in rooms from which green shutters kept out the light the business was accompanied by the smoking of bitter tobacco and draining of small copitas of scented liquor they declared their houses were wyndhams but did not present him and marston to their women  except for some american and german merchants they saw few white people the citizens were mulattos of different shades negroes and halfbreeds who sprang from spanish and indian stock although it was often hard to guess what blood ran in the mestizos veins for the most part they were a cheerful careless lot the coast basked in sunshine with high blue mountains for a background and marston felt nothing of the gloom and mystery that haunted the african rivers at some of the ports wyndham made arrangements for the extension of the houses trade but marston could not tell if he was satisfied or not  when they lounged one evening on the veranda of a big white hotel marston led his comrade firmly to talk about business the hotel had long since been the home of a spanish grandee and although the back was ruinous the moorish front had been altered and decorated by american enterprise marston thought it a compromise between the styles of tangiers and coney island the rash american had gone and the fonda malaguena owned the rule of a fat and urbane gentleman who claimed to have come from spain for all that the malaguena was comfortable and after the yachts cramped hot cabin marston liked the big shaded rooms the wine and food were better than he had thought and as he sat looking out between the pillars with a cup of very good coffee in front of him he was satisfied to stay a few more days small tables occupied part of the pavement whiteclothed waiters moved about and people talked and laughed a band played in the plaza and tram cars jingled along the narrow street there was a half moon and one could see the black mountains behind the ancient town  i dont know if i ought to grumble but its obvious theres not much money to be earned at the ports weve touched wyndham remarked where steamers call and trade is regularly carried on competition cuts down profits you must use a big capital if you want a big return  its the usual line said marston i think its sound  wyndham smiled you like the usual line the trouble is my capital is small  then you have another plan  i have some notions i hope to work out wyndhams have agents and stores at places farther along the coast steamers cant get into the lagoons and we use sailing boats the trades small and risky but the profits big well push on and see what can be done although i dont expect too much  marston pondered he wanted to help wyndham and had sometimes felt his sportsmans life was rather objectless for one thing he might provide himself with an occupation and perhaps stop harrys embarking on rash adventures to invest his money would give him some control  could you make the business pay if you had a larger capital he asked  there are pretty good grounds for imagining so wyndham replied  very well i have more money than i need and have been looking for a chance to use my talents so far ive kept them buried and if i dont dig them up soon they might rust away if you agree id like to make a start now and try a business speculation he named a sum and added you promised youd take my help when you saw how you could use the money  youre generous bob wyndham remarked with a touch of feeling and then smiled however i know you pretty well and think i understand your plan you want to keep me out of trouble and see i take the prudent line but was the plan yours or mabels  mine said marston rather shortly all the same i imagine mabel would approve but this has nothing to do with it and you neednt invent an object for me im looking for a good investment my lawyers only get me three or four per cent  then you make no stipulation  i do not said marston you will have control and command my help if i couldnt trust you with my money i would not have gone to africa with you i wont grumble if you lose the lot the things a speculation  wyndham knitted his brows for a few moments and then looked up  youre a very good sort bob ill take the loan  its not a loan said marston firmly im buying a partnership  a partner is responsible for all losses and liabilities a lender is not he only risks the sum he invests  of course said marston i understand that  a touch of color came into wyndhams face but he smiled  oh well i knew you had pluck  marston got up now we have agreed well get to work lets see if the telegraph office is open to begin with well buy the lot of ballata your agent at the other port talked about  wyndham laughed and they set off up the hot street     chapter viii  the lagoon   after a few days columbine sailed west and one night lurched slowly across the languid swell towards the coast there was a full moon but marston standing near the negro pilot at the wheel could not see much mist drifted about the forest ahead and he heard an ominous roar of surf although no break in the coast was distinguishable the schooner was obviously drifting with the tide toward an opening the wind was light and blew off the land laden with a smell of spices and river mud marston did not like the smell he had known it in africa and when one felt the sour damp one took quinine he had studied the chart which did not tell him much and since there were no marks to steer for he must trust the negro pilot  there was a risk about going in at night and marston would sooner have hove to and waited but the tide rose a few inches higher than at noon and wyndham seldom shirked a risk when he had something to gain by and by he jumped down from the rail where he had been using the lead  i expect well get in but i dont know about getting out if were loaded deep he said  do you expect much of a load marston asked because the chart did not indicate a port  it depends on our luck small quantities of stuff come down scarce dyestuffs rubber and forest produce that manufacturing chemists use we have a halfbreed agent white men cant stand the climate long and the natives are rather a curious lot  negroes said marston thoughtfully  wyndham laughed there are negroes i understand the populations pretty mixed with a predominating strain of african blood i expect you dont like that but trades generally good at places where steamers dont touch profits go up when competitions languid  marston did not like it he had thought his giving wyndham money would limit their business to trading at civilized ports he imagined harry knew this and ought to have been satisfied but he banished his feeling of annoyance after all he had made no stipulation and was perhaps indulging an illogical prejudice he must of course trust his partner  the yacht stopped with a sudden jar and her stern swung round the sails flapped and her main boom lurched across and brought up with a crash she bumped hard once or twice and then floated off and went on again the misty forest was nearer and a dim white belt indicated surf it looked as if they were steering for an unbroken beach then a wave of thicker mist rolled about them and the forest was blotted out wyndham jumped on the rail and marston heard the splash of the lead after that there was silence except for the roar of the surf and marston went forward to see if the anchor was clear but wyndham said nothing and the schooner stole on although the breeze was very light the tide carried her forward and marston felt there was something ghostly about her noiseless progress by and by however wyndham threw the lead on the deck  another halffathom were across the shoals he said i expect the pilot trusts the stream to keep us in the channel  marston nodded he saw trees in front and in one place a dark blur faintly edged by white that he thought was a bank of mud but all was vague and somehow daunting the trees got blacker although they were not more distinct the sails flapped and then hung limp the pilot called out and when marston gave an order the anchor plunged and the silence was broken by the roar of running chain this died away when columbine swung and except for the languid rumble of the surf all was quieter than before the pilot got on board his canoe and vanished in the mist and a few minutes afterwards marston went to the cabin it was very hot but when malaria lurks in the night mist one does not sleep on deck  when he awoke in the morning the cabin floor slanted and going on deck he saw why the pilot had told them to let the boom rest on the port quarter the tide had ebbed and although its rise and fall was not large belts of mud and channels of yellow water occupied the bed of the lagoon all round were dingy mangroves that overlapped and hid the entrance a little water flowed past the yacht but it was plain that her bilge rested on the ground the bottom shelved but the heavy boom inclined her up the bank there was nobody about and nothing indicated that anybody ever visited the spot marston frowned because it was hard to persuade himself he was not in africa  about noon a canoe arrived with two negroes on board and marston and wyndham were paddled to a village some miles up a creek it was a poor place small whitewashed mud houses a rusty iron store and a row of squalid huts occupied a clearing in the forest wyndhams agent had a house by the creek and received his visitors in his office outside the sand was dazzling but the office was dark and comparatively cool a reed curtain covered the window which had no glass there was no door and little puffs of wind blew in don felix was a fat and greasy mulatto dressed in soiled white duck with a broad red sash in which an ornamental spanish knife was stuck  he brought out some small glasses and a bottle of scented liquor and they began to talk and smoke the agents english was not good and he now and then used french and castilian words marston noted that he talked about a number of unimportant matters before he touched on business and seemed unwilling to come to the subject  i can give you a load but trade is bad he said at length and turned to the window with a gesture that seemed to indicate the forest the people up there are lazy and for some time have not brought much produce down  its natural produce i suppose stuff that grows itself marston remarked there isnt much cultivation in the bush  don felix shrugged quien sabe who knows what they do up yonder these people they are drôle sometimes they bring me cargo sometimes they come to beg there is a fiesta in their village they make fandango jamboree the trader pays for the fiesta and gets back nothing  then why do you pay  it is better don felix replied and looked at the door as if to see there was nobody about they are bête the mestizos but when one is wise one does not make enemies there is much obeah in the bush  obeahs something like african juju magic of a sort marston suggested  something like that wyndham agreed i dont know much about it he looked at the agent do you  don felix made the sign of the cross me i am good catholic i know nothing they are drôle in the bush when i think about their folly i laugh  not always i imagine wyndham remarked dryly however we must persuade these folks we have goods theyd find useful thats the beginning of trade when a man sees he needs things somebody else has got he gets to work and looks for something to sell now lets consider  marston listened while his comrade talked harry sometimes surprised people who did not know him well he was romantic but he had a calculating vein harry could plan and bargain and marston reflected that while the wyndhams had long been adventurers they were traders too after an hours talk he had arranged much that promised to help the agents business and they went back to the creek  in a way were lucky wyndham observed while they paddled down stream the people were going to deal with are nearly pure africans and we know something about negroes  marston said nothing he did not know if they were lucky or not and rather doubted  they returned to the schooner and in the morning cargo began to arrive two or three days afterwards wyndham went off to the village with some of the crew and marston gave the others leave to go ashore neither the boys nor wyndham came back at dark but this did not matter although the schooner rose upright for a few hours when the tide flowed she would not float until the new moon and the muddy lagoon was as smooth as a pond  in the evening marston sat in the little stern cabin it was very hot and his brain was dull but he did not want to go to bed until the crew arrived moisture dripped from the ceiling and flies hovered round the lamp that hung at an angle to the beams the skylight was open a few inches and although the opening was covered by mosquito gauze one could not keep out the flies marston hated their monotonous buzzing for there is something about a mangrove swamp that frays a white mans nerves water lapped against the planks and now and then there was a splash in the mud the tide was flowing and marston imagined the water round the vessel was three or four feet deep it looked as if wyndham meant to stay away all night and marston wondered with a slight uneasiness what was keeping him  a mahogany medicine chest stood on the small swing table it was of the type supplied to british merchant ships but larger and the london chemists had fitted it with the latest drugs used in the tropics there was a book about them and marston had meant to rearrange the bottles and packets which had got displaced he was not a doctor but he had studied the book and found it interesting tropical diseases were strange and numerous and he had made some cautious experiments on the crew now his head ached rather badly and he wondered whether he would take some quinine  presently he put down the book and listened something had disturbed him but for a few moments he only heard the splash of the tide then the scuttle over his head opened and a naked foot felt for the ladder the foot was white underneath but although he was somewhat startled marston did not think this strange he had noted that negroes and mulattos soles are often lighter in color than the rest of their skin  he sat still until a half naked man who came backwards down the ladder turned and confronted him with an apologetic smile the fellow was old and his face was wrinkled and a curious yellow color marston had in africa seen badly jaundiced white men look something like that although the sickly tint was not so dark a network of red veins covered his eyes but they looked as if they had been blue his hair was all white he put a small carved calabash on the table and then squatted on the cabin floor  marston frowned and waited the carving had an african touch and it was an african custom for a visitor to bring a present the negroes called it a dash  cappy lib for village the mulatto remarked and marston nodded  he had not heard a canoe and wondered how the fellow got on board since his thin cotton clothes were dry moreover although the halfbreeds marston had met generally used creole french or uncouth castilian the other said lib for like a west african  bad country white man sick too much you sick now the mulatto resumed glancing at the chest  marston made a sign of agreement his head ached and he felt languid it was possible he had a mild dose of fever  i fix you said the mulatto who pulled out a small brass box and emptied some brown powder on the table you drink him in hot water  thank you said marston and scraped the stuff onto a piece of paper thinking he might experiment with it the fellow could have no object for trying to poison him and he understood the halfbreeds knew some useful cures  now you dash me a drink said the other looking at a bottle of whisky in the rack and marston rather wondered why he took down the bottle the whisky was extra good he did not like mulattoes and knew no reason for his entertaining his uninvited guest yet he put a glass on the table one glass  he imagined the other understood the significance of this for his eyes momentarily narrowed it was strange but they now looked blue for all that he poured out a liberal measure of whisky and drank slowly like a connoisseur  marston studied him with some curiosity and on the whole felt repelled the old fellow looked cunning and greedy but not debased one got a hint of cruelty and power and his manner was very calm in west africa marston would perhaps have kicked him out but pure white men are not numerous on the south and west coasts of the caribbean and the distinction of color is relaxed besides he reflected he was engaged in trading with the natives  you lib for here for buy thing the other remarked presently what thing you want  marston mentioned some articles wyndham had talked about and the other nodded you go make me dash and you get them thing agent man fool man him no savvy black mans way in bush  if the stuff comes along well talk about the dash marston answered cautiously although he did not like his visitor and wondered when he would go  when white cappy come back the old fellow asked  in the morning i expect said marston with a yawn  the other got up as if he were going and turned sideways in order to pass between the swingtable and the locker there was not much room for one does not lean against a swingtable which keeps its level by a counterbalance underneath when the vessel rolls it looked as if the mulatto knew this and marston thought it strange next moment however he struck his naked foot against the fastenings in the deck and stumbling put his arm on the table the table tilted and the medicine chest slipped off it turned over as it fell and emptied bottles packets scales and measures on the deck  the mulatto looked at the disordered pile and made for the ladder marston did not stop him although he was angry and kneeling down began to pick up the articles the bottles were strong and had not broken and in a minute or two he replaced them and the other things in the box then he went up the ladder and looked out on deck a lamp hung on the forestay as a beacon for the boats and one could see the sweep of planks and line of the rail there was nobody about and nothing broke the silence beyond the feeble glimmer of the lamp it was very dark but the night was calm and marston knew the splash of a paddle would carry far  he crossed the deck and looked over the rail the water caught a faint reflection and he saw muddy foam and weed float past the tide was rising and running up the lagoon one could hardly wade to land and it was obviously impossible to do so without making a noise yet his visitor had vanished and he had not heard him go marston remembered stories about the ghost leopards he had heard in africa and laughed but the laugh was forced  he went back to the cabin and shutting the hatch examined the medicine chest he did not know if he was surprised to find two articles had gone one was a bottle of laudanum and the other a packet of new and powerful drugs the book warned one to be careful about their use marston lighted a cigarette and pondered he was not certain the bottle and packet were in the box when he got it down although he thought they were he had sometimes taken things out when he dosed the crew and he had used laudanum moreover it looked impossible that the mulatto had picked them up so far as marston remembered he did stoop down or stop then supposing he had taken the stuff it was hard to see why a man who was half a savage should steal laudanum and the other drug  if obeah was like west african juju there were no doubt men who used poison to support their claim to magical power but strange and virulent poisons could be extracted from tropical plants besides the fellow had given marston a cure for fever perhaps he was making a dangerous experiment but his curiosity conquered his caution and he resolved to try the stuff going to the galley he found some hot water and as he came back noted that one could see into the cabin through the halfopened skylight he wondered whether the mulatto had looked down and noted the medicine chest the brown powder melted and he swallowed the draught then he got into his bunk and blowing out the lamp presently went to sleep     chapter ix  don felixs revolt   when marston woke in the morning his headache and languidness had gone it looked as if the powder the mulatto had left had cured him and although he did not find the laudanum and packet of drugs he resolved he would not bother about their loss in a day or two small lots of rather valuable cargo began to arrive and one afternoon marston and wyndham lounged under the awning and watched the krooboys transfer goods from a big canoe to the yacht four or five negroes from up river put the fiber packages in the hoisting slings  the men worked slackly for although the sun was hidden the heat was extreme a yellow haze covered the sky but the oily surface of the lagoon shimmered with subdued light on the other side the reflection of the mangroves floated motionless without a leaf quivering dark shadow lurked in the caves under the high roots and here and there the massed foliage was touched by dirty white marston thought the trees looked as if they were blighted by some foul disease he hated the mangroves and the smell of mud that hung about the vessel  the tides are beginning to get higher he said it will be a relief to leave this dismal spot and go to sea  calling here has paid us wyndham rejoined we are getting stuff for which dyers and chemists give high prices stuff i wanted but hardly expected to obtain in fact ill own your mysterious visitor has earned his dash no doubt hell turn up again and ask for it  dyou reckon he had much to do with our getting the goods  wyndham shrugged i understand he promised you the articles you talked about and they have arrived if he comes again id like to see him perhaps he could be persuaded to send us something else  he asked for you said marston and wondered whether his remark was rash when he saw wyndham was pondering although bob felt he was perhaps illogical he did not want harry to persuade the fellow  i think you said his eyes were blue wyndham resumed presently well one does meet a mulatto with blue eyes now and then and its perhaps not important that the bottom of his feet was white  wyndham stopped for a splash of paddles broke the silence and when a canoe stole out of the shadow across the lagoon marston said we may learn something about him now heres your agent don felix  he thought wyndham was going to reply but he hesitated and then crossed the deck as the agent and another man came on board marston called the steward who put a small table under the awning and brought out a bottle of choice liquor they had bought at the last port the party sat down and marston studied his guests on the whole he liked don felix and thought him honest the fellows greasy fat face was frank and his black eyes met ones glance squarely for all that he thought he did not look well there was a hint of strain about him and his hand shook when he greedily drained his glass the climate however was unhealthy and marston turned to their other guest  father sebastian was white although his skin was dark and wrinkled he was very thin and his threadbare clothes were slack his hair was white and his eyes were sunk he looked about with a frank curiosity and marston imagined it was long since he had been on board a ship and had met civilized white men  by and by don felix began to talk about the cargo and declared that he was puzzled because he had not received so large a quantity of valuable goods for some time  it looks as if the people in the bush were working he remarked and added dryly they work when they are forced  marston told him about the mulattos visit and don felixs face got dark he drained his glass and turning to father sebastian repeated marstons story in awkward french  i do not like it he said this foul bat i think he is plotting again  father sebastian made a sign of agreement and addressed marston whose curiosity was obvious he spoke slowly as if it cost him an effort to remember words but marston thought his french was good  an evil man he is called the bat because he likes the dark moreover they talk about bats that drink human blood  if there are such creatures why dont you kill them marston asked and glanced at wyndham he was smoking a cigarette and looked rather bored but marston knew his friend and doubted  the bat is hard to kill some have tried but perhaps i may be luckier don felix answered and his fat nervous fingers touched his spanish knife then he shrugged all the same it is possible he kills me  the others said nothing don felix was rather theatrical but marston thought him strongly moved by anger or fear by and by don felix went to the hatch and examined one or two of the packages the krooboys were putting in the hold  what is this he asked these packages have a mark i know but i did not buy the goods  the shipper will no doubt come to you for payment and well engage to meet the bill wyndham replied the stuff is getting very scarce and ought to sell for a good price  no exclaimed don felix angrily i buy nothing with that mark you must stop the boys loading the lot send it all back  isnt this ridiculous wyndham asked why do you want us to refuse the goods  don felix sat down and gripped the arm of his chair hard the man whose mark that is is a friend of the bats he said and his voice got hoarse i do not know if the goods are his or the others but i will not buy the stuff bad luck would go with the money one earned by handling it  he said something to father sebastian in rapid creole french and the priest turned to wyndham  it is better that you send back this cargo he remarked quietly don felix is an honest man he has given you advice that may cost him much marston pondered with his eyes on his guest father sebastian was old and shabby he had obviously lived long with his savage flock but he was white his glance was calm and thoughtful and he had a touch of dignity marston thought he knew much about human nature and could be trusted don felix however got up and clenched his fist it looked as if the company of the priest and the others had given him some resolve  what do i care about the cost he exclaimed in french i was afraid and i paid me a good catholic i paid that these pigs might serve their devil but it has gone on long and now i stop this dirty bat will come between me and my employer he leaves me out well let it be so he paused and spread out his hand with a theatrical gesture that marston thought was meant for the negroes in the canoe now i fight my trade is my blood i will kill this bat  father sebastian shook his head but don felix turned to wyndham and resumed in a defiant voice you will send back the packages if not you must get another agent  very well agreed wyndham you can tell the boys to unload the goods you dont like  he gave don felix a quick glance and marston wondered whether he expected him to hesitate but the mulatto went back to the hatch and gave his orders resolutely marston remembered that another lot of fiber packages had been stowed at the bottom of the hold before the agent arrived and were now probably out of sight wyndham however said nothing about these and filled father sebastians glass  our friend is superstitious he remarked you know something about obeah and voodoo magic i expect the men who teach the cult use cunning tricks but how much is trickery  ah said father sebastian who can tell there are powers that rule the dark you know it is permitted when you have lived in the gloom perhaps don felix is superstitious but he takes a hard path it is the right path i think he is brave then he paused and smiled i am old and have lived in this country long there is much about voodoo and other things that puzzles me but this i know they who walk in the light need fear no lasting hurt  sometimes ones light gets dim said marston  that is when we stray into the shadow and our eyes are dull the light burns steadily it will not go out  don felix came back from the hatch and stopped for dinner when he and father sebastian had gone marston asked wyndham what about the other lot of goods that was already in the hold  well said wyndham do you see any object for our returning the stuff for that matter i dont know to whom it ought to be returned  marston said the goods could wait at the village until the owner claimed payment we promised don felix we would not take this cargo he added  you mean i promised wyndham rejoined my promise applied to the particular lot he grumbled about anyhow i want the goods we can sell them for a high price  marston admitted that the argument was plausible although he doubted if it were ethically sound still he must not be fastidiously critical about his friend he was rich and free from one kind of temptation harry was poor wyndham noted his hesitation and resumed  our voyage is not a yachting excursion we are frankly out for what we can earn and im so to speak now on trial im young and the head of a house that people knew was tottering when i took control chisholm and floras relations have reserved their judgment theyre willing to give me a fair chance but wait to see what i can do well you know my drawbacks and how much depends on my making good in order to do so ill run all risks  marston thought there was a risk wyndham did not see flora chisholm was honest and proud her lovers success would not satisfy her if she disapproved the means he used this however was an awkward subject and marston owned that to imagine harry would give her grounds for disapproving was taking much for granted he let the matter go and began to talk about something else  for all that when wyndham left him he lighted a fresh cigarette and mused harry was his friend but he began to see he had got a habit of making allowances for him that he might not have made for others harry had a strange charm and individuality somehow one could not judge him by conventional rules then marston remembered that mabel had let him go in order that he might be harrys protector but the dangers he was to be guarded from were not physical marston understood this better now and doubted if he were clever enough for the job mabel did not mean him to be a hypercritical prig anyhow he had undertaken the job and mabel perhaps rather foolishly trusted him he threw his cigarette away and went off to superintend the stowage of the cargo  the moon was getting small and the tides were higher when one evening a messenger asked them to come to the village they went up river in the mist and marston felt languid and dejected the day had been very hot and it was not much cooler at dark the stagnant air was hard to breathe there was something daunting in the silence and the splash of paddles sounded harshly loud when they landed they found don felix alone in his house except for a halfbreed woman and father sebastian he lay in a fiber hammock and marston saw he was very ill his black eyes were half shut his face was a livid color and wet with clammy sweat  the room was brightly lighted and the halfbreed woman sat on the ground in a limp huddled pose with a black shawl hiding her shoulders and head she did not move when the others came in but don felixs glance hinted at relief and father sebastian indicated two american bentwood chairs that looked strangely out of harmony with the mud walls and floor  if we had known you were ill we would have brought our medicine chest marston said what is the matter  who knows said don felix dully and marston imagined the castilian rejoinder meant his question admitted of no reply i will not live until the morning but i have lived longer than i sometimes thought it does not matter now the good father and my friends have come i am no more afraid  marston was puzzled somehow don felix looked afraid the first part of his statement was easier to understand because marston had learned in africa that negroes and uncivilized halfbreeds slip easily out of life and often seem to know when theirs will end but if don felix was not afraid to go what did he fear  is there nobody about where are the working boys wyndham asked  they have gone they know don felix replied and marston felt half daunted as he asked himself what did the boys know but you will stay the other went on anxiously  of course said wyndham in a quiet voice  father sebastian looked up as if to thank him and marston saw harry had taken the proper line he felt there was no use in trying to persuade don felix he was not very ill it was significant that the priest had not tried  now we will talk a little don felix said to wyndham there is some business to talk about  wyndham glanced at father sebastian who made a sign of permission and then got up and went to the door with marston they sat down on a bench outside and a beam of light and the dull voices of the others came through the door marston did not hear the woman she had not spoken at all but sat motionless and huddled he had not seen her face and never knew what she was like all was quiet in the village and outside the feeble beam the gloom was strangely deep marston sympathized with don felixs liking for plenty of light  what has caused his illness he asked  poison i think father sebastian replied our friend is a good catholic but he is half persuaded it is something else  the other things ridiculous though i suppose they claim to use magic in the bush but you ought to know something about native poisons  i know many but don felixs symptoms are strange said father sebastian quietly  marston asked him about the symptoms and carefully noted his answers then he remarked i dont altogether understand why the boys left him  they were afraid in this country it is rash to help a victim of voodoo  but they are your people i mean they belong to your flock  they are human and one must not expect too much from men who have long walked in the gloom the old gods are powerful  the obeah gods are devils marston declared with an anger that rather surprised himself  father sebastian glanced at the surrounding dark in which blurred trees vaguely loomed  it is possible there are devils yonder things are done they would approve he remarked quietly  i understand the bat is don felixs enemy do you think he poisoned him  i do not know perhaps we shall never know in this country many people are poisoned  marston clenched his fist don felix is wyndhams agent and im a partner in the house if i find out who poisoned him ill see the fellow is held accountable  he stopped for wyndham came to the door beckoning the priest  he wants you he said and they went in  marston long remembered the next hour or two at first don felix was shaken by spasms of pain and groaned but was silent afterwards his eyes were dull and half shut and when they opened wider they turned apprehensively to the open door sometimes he glanced about the room and marston thought he took courage when he saw father sebastian sitting near his hammock and wyndham in the background yet he was obviously afraid and his fear was disturbing  for the most part all was very quiet but sometimes there were noises that jarred marstons nerves although the night was calm leaves rustled in the dark and one heard sounds like the stealthy tread of naked feet marston fancied shadows lurked about the edge of the beam from the door and found it hard to persuade himself he was deceived although he knew nobody was there for a minute or two moisture splashed outside as if somebody had struck a branch and shaken down big drops the noise stopped and marston felt the silence worse  now and then he glanced at wyndham the latter did not move and looked straight in front but his quietness was significant and his mouth was firm marston imagined he bore some strain but it was often hard to tell what harry felt and thought at length don felix moved his hand awkwardly as if he felt for something to which he could cling and the slack movement did not stop until he felt father sebastians grasp his haunted look was plainer although he was now too weak to glance at the door it jarred marston strangely and getting up he went out  halfanhour afterwards there was a wild cry in the house and marston shivered it was the womans voice and he knew why she had cried out then wyndham came to the door and standing with his back against the light looked about for his comrade  we need not stay now he said he was calm at the last and had all the consolation father sebastian could give him an honest man and brave i think believing what its obvious he did believe  he trusted you marston remarked meaningly  its possible he found our being about some help we stayed while we were needed  that is not what i mean marston rejoined if ever i saw a man fight with fear i watched the horrible battle tonight the fellow was your agent and somebody who destroyed his body sent an unthinkable horror to torment his mind the things devilish what are you going to do about it  what can i do said wyndham i have nothing to go upon  marston made a sign of agreement but his face was very stern some day perhaps well find out whos accountable i mean to try  wyndham said nothing and they went back to the canoe     chapter x  marston uses his power   soon after don felix was buried two strangers visited the schooner one was white but so burned by the sun and worn by the climate that he looked like a native peters was agent for a hamburg merchant house with a factory on a neighboring lagoon and told wyndham he had come because he seldom met a white man the other was a government officer and stated apologetically that his business was to make a few inquiries about don felixs death his skin was nearly white but his coarse lips and short curling hair indicated a strain of negro blood  marston knew something about the officials who held small posts on the caribbean coast for the most part they were mulattos paid low wages and willing to augment the latter by presents and bribes as a rule he had found them goodhumored and indolent and he imagined don ramon larrinaga would be satisfied with a few particulars and a little money there was he thought no use in trying to put him on the track of the unknown poisoner he let wyndham take the man to the cabin and sat under the awning on deck with peters for whom he opened a bottle of vermouth  peters knew much about the country and told him some rather curious stories he looked shriveled and desiccated but his glance was keen and marston imagined he was very shrewd marston however did not study him much it was enough that he was an amusing companion while wyndham was occupied byandby the latter opened the cabin scuttle and beckoned  you have some paper money bob lend me a few bills he said  marston asked the sum he wanted and was surprised when wyndham told him  is it necessary to give him so much he asked  perhaps its advisable well soon be ready for sea and i expect the fellow could keep us here while he made fresh inquiries and wrote reports hes polite but he rather hinted something like that of course he has no notion of really finding out why don felix died  we want to find out marston rejoined  wyndham smiled thats another thing the government officials dont want to bother if we knew who was accountable it would be hard to get them to move however don ramon is waiting  marston took out his wallet and after giving wyndham some money went back to peters whose eyes twinkled  your partner knows the customs of the country he remarked on the whole it pays to be generous in a climate like this its prudent to save oneself unnecessary trouble  we dont want to avoid trouble marston replied if i was persuaded our agent was poisoned and could get on the poisoners track id use some energy to follow it up  peters shrugged you can do nothing better let it rest in the fever swamps men who are well one day often die the next it is possible they have an enemy in the bush but the law does not reach up yonder sickness is common and human life is cheap  they talked about something else until wyndham and larrinaga came on the deck the latter bowed to marston when his canoe was paddled to the gangway  i thank you and your partner señor he said if i can be of help remember i am your servant  it was nothing marston replied i expect señor wyndham has told you all we know but if you can find out anything important youll earn our gratitude the man who tells me why don felix died can count on his reward  peters gave him a curious glance and smiled after all the reward may perhaps be claimed it is not likely i admit but things one does not look for sometimes happen  he got into the canoe and when the negroes paddled off marston leaned against the rail  i suppose we need expect nothing from larrinaga he remarked how much did you tell him  all i thought it useful for him to know said wyndham rather dryly hes a common type lazy and greedy now hes got his bribe i dont suppose hell bother us what did you think about the other  i didnt study him much amusing fellow but you get a hint of force i imagine hes clever and a man who can hold on anyhow he doesnt matter since its improbable well see him again well have the holds full in a day or two and ive had enough of the lagoon  all the same im rather afraid we cant get away just yet  marston began to grumble but wyndham smiled  there are things to straighten out and now we have no agent i may be needed but it wont be necessary for you to stay in fact id like you to take the schooner to the next port and transship the cargo then you could come back for me and the extra load i half expect but ill know more when ive been to the village and well talk about this again  wyndham started for the village next day and when it was getting dark marston lounged on deck looking out for the boat some of the crew had gone with wyndham the rest were in the forecastle and except for the cook at the galley door marston had the deck to himself the yacht was slowly lifting with the tide which spread across the mud banks in the lagoon thin mist drifted about the mangroves and there was not a breath of wind the water glimmered with faint reflections but in a few minutes it would be dark  presently marston looking over the rail imagined there was somebody behind him on the deck for a moment or two however he did not turn he had heard no step and had recently felt himself highly strung it looked as if don felixs death had given him a jar but he was not going to indulge his shaken nerves still he felt there was somebody about and he slowly and deliberately looked round the mulatto who had visited him before squatted on the deck as if he had been there some time marston thought he saw amusement in his wrinkled face and his anger arose  cappy wyndham lib for on board the old fellow asked  he is not on board said marston roughly what do you want  you done get them cargo  we did i dont know if you had much to do with it but i suppose you expect your dash what would you like money  the other shook his head money no good my friend sick too much you dash me some medicine  marston remembered the packet of drugs and found it needful to use some control he did not know if the mulatto was the bat or not but on the whole thought he was and the horror of his watch at don felixs house was fresh yet he had nothing to go upon and would not be justified in throwing the fellow overboard the other watched him with bloodshot eyes and although his face was inscrutable marston began to feel uneasy he wondered whether the fellow was something of a hypnotist for he got a hint of force force that he thought malevolent looking forward along the deck he imagined he saw the cook at the galley door but the indistinct figure vanished and marston felt it was significant that the negro had gone inside then he braced himself and looked back  i will not give you medicine but since we did get the cargo perhaps you deserve something he said wait a minute  going to the cabin he opened a locker in which they had put a quantity of african trade goods the stuff was rubbish made to please the negros eye brass jewelry cheap scent colored flannel jackets and frail umbrellas marston picked up as much as he could carry and was conscious of rather dry amusement as he climbed the ladder his visitor had obviously learned english in west africa and he was going to give him the usual african dash but he knew the old fellow had no use for the stuff it was like giving a philosopher a childs toy  there you are said marston throwing down the articles now get off  i lib for see cappy wyndham the other objected  get off the ship said marston dont come back  he wondered how the man would go there was no canoe about and the water round the vessel was three or four feet deep she lay obliquely to the beach it was ridiculous to imagine the other had vanished on his last visit but marston had not seen how he went now however he meant to watch  the mulatto picked up the load of rubbish and went forward along the deck he jumped on the end of the bowsprit and marston smiled for it looked as if he could not use his tricks when one kept ones eye on him balancing himself cautiously he walked along the spar and melted in the dark but in a few moments there was a splash and marston knew he had dropped from the bowsprits end into shallow water somehow this was soothing and he went to the cabin in an hour or two wyndham returned and when they lighted their pipes after supper marston remarked  the old fellow don felix imagined was the bat turned up again  ah said wyndham who looked interested don felix hadnt seen him we dont know he is the bat  father sebastian agreed that he was and i havent much doubt he said the man was evil and i think evils the proper word he gives me a strange nervous shrinking have you felt a kind of nausea when you looked at something repulsive well i feel like that when hes about  as a rule you dont let your imagination carry you away wyndham remarked i expect the heat and the dismal surroundings account for much  anyhow i gave him a dash and ordered him off the boat  wyndham glanced up rather sharply why we have got some valuable goods and although well have to pay their owners it looks as if the old fellow was useful  i dont want any goods he sends marston rejoined my notion is theyre better left alone then im a partner and although i havent meddled much i felt i ought to use my power  oh well said wyndham you are a partner i suppose we must let it go  they talked about something else and next evening marston took the schooners dinghy and rowed down the lagoon he had heard curlew whistle in the dark and wondered whether the birds were as wild as they are in england for a time he followed the edge of the mangroves where water dripped from the arched roots and amphibious things splashed in the muddy caves and then skirted a sloppy bank the tide flowed across now and then he saw a curlew but did not get a shot and by and by he put down the oars the damp heat was enervating and he rested and looked about  it would soon be dark and the mangroves cut in a straight black line against a fading orange glow the landbreeze began to shake the leaves and now and then a pale branch moved all was very quiet but for the dull rumble of the surf outside marston felt languid and vaguely disturbed there was something about wyndham that puzzled him when they were at sea he did not want a better friend but it was different when they went ashore to trade well he had come to look after harry and now understood better why mabel had let him go perhaps harry really needed to be looked after marston was staunch but he knew mabel had not altogether trusted his comrade  there was another thing he must soon sail the schooner to the next port and he wanted to go but harry meant to stay marston did not like this although he could think of no logical objection the mulattos visits bothered him the fellow had asked for wyndham and somehow marston would sooner they did not meet perhaps the thing was ridiculous but he felt like that  it got dark and although there was no obvious reason for his return he felt he ought to get back to the yacht recently he had felt highly strung this was no doubt the consequence of pottering about the unhealthy swamps but he must control his illogical impulses and he lighted his pipe while he let the dinghy drift with the tide  she floated quietly up the lagoon and presently he saw columbines lights in the mist pulling a few languid strokes he let the boat drift again until the vessels dark side was close ahead then he put out his hand and seized a rope he wore rubber boots because he had thought he might wade across the mud and made no noise when he stepped down from the rail there was nobody on deck but a light shone in the cabin and when he went aft he heard voices the skylight was open and one of the voices was the old mulattos  marston stopped abruptly he wanted to go down and turn out the fellow but doubted if he would be justified although he was wyndhams partner somehow it was unthinkable the brute and his comrade should engage in quiet talk for all that he did not go and turning back a few yards stopped again he must not be a fool and no doubt the fellow had come to talk about some goods his friends in the bush could supply marston did not want the goods but forced himself to wait  by and by a shadowy figure came out from the cabin hatch it made no noise and marston would not have seen it had not the indistinct black object for a moment cut against the light outside the beam from the open hatch all was misty and dark still marston thought the fellow knew he was there because he vanished as if he had gone behind the mast marston did not bother about him and went down to the cabin  there was liquor on the table and wyndham had obviously just drained the glass he held his hand shook as he put it down his face was rather white and drops of sweat stood on his forehead it looked as if he had got a knock although marston knew harrys nerve was good  i couldnt get near the curlew so i came back he remarked awkwardly  wyndham looked up with an obvious effort for calm oh well since you are here you might turn out the boys and heave up the slack cable  marston noted that wyndhams voice was hoarse but thought it better to conquer his curiosity harry might give him his confidence later and in the meantime to heave the cable taut would obviate their bringing the boys up again the tide was rising and they wanted to float the schooner off the mud he went forward to call the crew and the clank of the windlass and rattle of chain were soothing since they indicated that columbine was ready for sea marston owned that he would be glad to get away from the lagoon he was occupied for some time and when he went back to the cabin wyndham looked calm  well keep her off the beach after this he said sorry you didnt get a shot the curlew seem as wild as they are at home  i dont want her to take the beach again marston remarked when do we sail  youll sail as soon as the pilot thinks theres water enough on the bar he comes tomorrow  but you mean to stay  i must stay said wyndham we havent an agent and im on the track of some business i cant neglect  marston saw there was no use in urging his comrade to go harrys mouth was ominously firm he wondered whether harry would tell him what the mulatto had talked about but he did not and soon after supper they went to bed     chapter xi  marston goes to sea   the new moon shone in a clear sky and the tide was nearly full puffs of warm landbreeze shook the mangroves and drove small ripples against columbines side she rode to the flood stream ready for sea and the clank of her windlass rolled across the swamps the negro crew were shortening cable and sang as they hove at the levers  wyndham was talking to peters who had arrived in the afternoon and marston standing near them frowned he was annoyed that peters had come because he had wanted to talk to wyndham and after the others arrival this was impossible it was unlucky he had put it off but he did not see why harry had urged the fellow to stay and go back to the village with him when the schooner sailed marston felt rather hurt since it almost looked as if harry had kept peters in order to prevent him trying to satisfy his curiosity  marston was curious the old mulatto had told harry something that had given him a bad jar bob could not forget his comrades strained look when he entered the cabin and he had found no clew to the puzzle it was a relief to go to sea but the satisfaction he had expected to get was dulled he felt as if he were running away and leaving his partner when the latter needed him yet somebody must go and harry would not  short up sah a krooboy shouted when the windlass stopped the pilot gave an order and the foresail began to rise with a rattle of blocks the canvas flapped and swelled and marston went forward  break out the anchor he said hoist the inner jib  dark figures rose and fell with the windlassbars slowly at first then faster as with a harsh clank the chain ran through the pipe marston had generally found the noise inspiriting it hinted at adventure on the open sea but it did not move him now he was not leaving the lagoon for good yet he was soothed when columbine began to move after lying on the mud he liked to feel her lift as she met the gentle swell the tide brought in and hear the ripple splash about her bows the mangroves stole past a gap opened in the trees and a faintlyglittering track led out to sea  hoist the mainsail said the pilot and the splash of ripples was louder when the dark canvas rose  she drove out with the landbreeze and met the rollers on the bar they were not high and hardly broke only one here and there melting into foam she lurched across with dry decks and when the leadsman got deeper water the pilot brought her round and pulled up his canoe marston went to the gangway with wyndham and peters and the latter laughed as he gave him his hand  i dont know if well meet again but its possible he said you offered a good reward for some information not long since i wonder whether you were rash  the offer stands marston replied the man who tells me all about our agents death will find me generous  oh well said peters i cant state that i expect to claim the reward but after all i might then i hope well both be satisfied  marston let him go he would have given much for ten minutes frank talk with wyndham but this was impossible the pilot was waiting and the yacht drifting near a dangerous shoal he resigned himself and gave his comrade his hand  run no risks and take care of yourself until i come back he said  good luck said wyndham and jumped into the canoe  marston signed to the steersman the sails filled and the canoe dropped astern columbine gathered speed and listed down throwing spray about while the water foamed below her lee rail small white waves rolled down the glittering track ahead and marstons mood got lighter after all it was a relief to put to sea the salt wind was tonic and blew morbid thoughts away it was bracing to grapple with breaking waves and savage squalls  he looked astern the canoe had vanished and a misty line indicated the land marston was conscious of a strange repugnance as he watched it fade sickness lurked in the steamy forest where the gloom was touched by mystery and something of horror for a time he had done with it and he would come back strengthened and invigorated by the change  he gave the helmsman the course and going to the cabin opened a tin box that held letters for england and manifests of cargo he must copy these out on the bills of lading when he transshipped the goods and as he studied the lists he felt some surprise columbine did not carry much but her freight was valuable some had been put on board without his knowing and he thought it strange wyndham had not talked about its cost for example there were small pearls one found pearls at places on the caribbean but the fisheries were jealously guarded and none were near the lagoon then there was a packet of ambergris and marston knew ambergris was worth much don felix had said nothing about this curious stuff which the cachalot whales throw up and marston wondered where wyndham had got it  the voyage was obviously going to pay but the strange thing was their cargo for the most part had come down after the agent died to some extent this bore out marstons conclusion that the old mulatto was the bat and had power over don felixs uncivilized customers marston began to muse about the fellow he had power one felt it although he was old and repulsive something indicated that he had inherited from his white ancestors qualities not often found in halfbreeds marston began to see that this was partly why the fellow repelled him one got a hint of intelligence put to a base use  the matter was not important and he pondered about his finding wyndham and the other in the cabin harry was badly shaken although marston knew his pluck something very strange and startling was needed to drive the blood from his face and bring the sweat to his forehead all the same it was ridiculous to imagine the mulatto had frightened him the old fellow was clever and no doubt claimed to be a magician in the bush but harry was not the man to be cheated by his tricks after a time marston gave it up and went on deck  columbine leaned over to the steady breeze the sea was flecked with white and a spray shower leaped about her bows a foaming wake trailed behind her and marstons heart got light as he heard the shrouds hum and felt her measured swing he liked the sense of speed and buoyancy the feeling that he had control of straining wood and sail to fight the sudden wild northers and keep her off reefs and shoals was a mans job but it was a job he knew he did not know the other that mabel had given him and often felt puzzled yet he had undertaken it and meant to make good byandby he went down to the cabin and to bed  after a quick run he reached port transacted some business shipped his cargo home by steamer and then returned to the lagoon where he found wyndham had another load ready on the night after his arrival they sat in the cabin talking and although wyndham said nothing about the mulatto he was frank indeed marston smiled when he remembered the doubts with which he had left his comrade all the same he thought he noted something about harry he had not known before  you will sail again as soon as we can load the cargo but for another port wyndham said we have so to speak found a treasure house and want to keep it dark if other folks get to know the treasure will soon be picked up anybody can buy a pretty good chart of the coast for a few shillings and we have been lucky so far largely because the shoals keep steamers out  the thing will be known sometime marston remarked  of course but i hope to get the most part of the stuff thats worth getting before our rivals come in  after that youll let this branch of the business go  i think not wyndham replied if i can find a good agent we ought to hold our ground in the regular trade although the profits will not be large  but you yourself dont mean to stay very long  no said wyndham when i get the best of the produce that seems to have been piling up and appoint our agent ill willingly clear out but i dont expect to do so for three or four months ive got my chance now and must seize it  three months is a long time to stay at the lagoon besides who will look after the business at home  my manager is pretty capable though hes young and recently promoted would you like to go  marston laughed im not a business man would you trust me  i dont think it would be rash youre a careful fellow bob and it begins to look as if you had talents you didnt know you have transacted our business like a shipping clerk  for a moment or two marston hesitated wyndham looked amused and bob admitted that the situation had a touch of humor he meant to stay at a place for which he had a strange superstitious dislike in order to help his comrade who would sooner be left alone  i may go byandby but i wont go yet he replied  they let the matter drop and in the morning wyndham went up the creek in the boat he stated rather vaguely that he must arrange about some cargo and it was three or four days before he returned then marston sailed with another load for a different port and the french creole who shipped the goods to england was frankly surprised by their value indeed his remarks indicated that the freight was worth much more than marston had thought the latter returned to the lagoon satisfied in one way but disturbed in another and did not see much of his comrade  wyndham often left the vessel and although he did not tell marston where he went the loaded canoes that came down the creek hinted that he was usefully engaged it was plain that the business was remarkably profitable but marston imagined wyndham was overdoing the thing he began to look worn and was sometimes moody for a white man cannot strain brain and body hard in the tropic swamps  marston got uneasy about him but to some extent sympathized they could not long enjoy their monopoly rivals would soon be attracted to the lagoon and harry was justified in seizing his chance he had not thought harry greedy but there was much at stake chisholms approval harrys business standing and his marriage to flora marston could understand his comrades running heavy risks for a girl like that  still he was bothered because he did not know all the risks it was possible that harry was being driven far by his very natural ambition but there were lengths to which one ought not to go  another thing puzzled marston don felix had known the negroes and had moreover negro blood in his veins but the trade had not extended until he was dead it was strange the efforts of a white man and a stranger had led to the sudden extension harry had obviously qualities and knowledge that had not marked the other but what were the qualities and what did he know although marston sometimes brooded over this he saw no light  one evening he sat in the cabin and studied their trading accounts while wyndham smoked it was very hot and marstons face and hands were wet with sweat and his eyes were dazzled flies hovered about the light and now and then a beetle struck the mosquito gauze in the skylight presently marston put down his pen and frowned  my brains dull tonight he said i ought to be satisfied with the results of our venture but there are things i dont see quite plain for example we have got a lot of stuff for which we dont seem to have paid  you are supercargo wyndham rejoined the accounts are yours and theyre remarkably accurate all we have got is properly charged against us  that is so i have used your figures all the same we havent handed over much money  the business is largely done by barter  of course said marston with a touch of impatience we havent delivered much goods against the account  the goods will be delivered our customers havent yet stated the articles they want  this means they trust us until we can bring the stuff from england or america in fact theyre willing to trust us for some time  it looks like that said wyndham and laughed are you puzzled about it bob after all wyndhams has long traded here and the houses reputation is obviously pretty good  but i understand your agents never got such stuff as we have got  they were agents and we are principals i expect that accounts for something wyndham replied with a twinkle besides wyndhams never had a supercargo like you  marston frowned and tried to think of some other matters that had excited his curiosity but could not make the effort and wyndham put a bottle and glasses on the table  shut the books and ill mix a cocktail he said youre working too hard and its very hot  they went to bed soon afterwards and when he awoke marstons head ached and he did not get up he thought he had a dose of fever and felt strangely annoyed somehow he had not expected to get fever he had thought harry might get it and to be kept in his bunk was a complication he had not reckoned on although wyndham dosed him as the medical book directed the fever did not abate for some days he tossed about in his narrow bunk with a throbbing head and pain in his limbs and then lay halfconscious in limp exhaustion he had strange dreams and long remembered ones indeed he sometimes doubted if it were all a dream  he imagined he was back at the factory on the african river and wyndhams uncle the man who vanished was in the big mildewed room marston saw him come out of his door and stand for a moment listening with his face touched by the moonlight and then run forward and stop by the body on the boards the dream was horribly vivid and real but the big room got hazy and melted as it were into columbines cabin  marston saw the lamp turned low hang at an angle to the beams and the charts and cargo books in the net rack he smelt the mud and heard the ripples splash against the schooners side somebody sat in front of the table and when the man looked up he saw it was rupert wyndham marston knew him because he had seen his portrait but his hair had gone white and his skin very dark in fact he did not look like a white man he got up and his face and bent figure melted as the room at the factory had melted but very slowly got distinct again and marston thrilled with repulsion and horror rupert wyndham had changed to the old mulatto  his naked feet made no noise as he crossed the floor and marston struggled to get up but could not his lips refused to move when he tried to call for help the old fellow had fixed his bloodshot eyes on him and he felt powerless the mulatto stopped by his bunk holding out a glass and marston knew he meant to poison him he resolved he would not drink but felt he must there was something in the fellows steady look that broke his resistance and for a few moments he fought a horrible battle against a strange conquering force then he took the glass and drained it and the mulatto melted away he did not vanish this implied suddenness he faded out of the cabin by imperceptible degrees  marston knew no more and awoke in daylight haunted by the dream he was surprised to feel he was not worse indeed his head did not ache and although he was very weak the pain in his limbs had gone his throat was parched and there was a strange taste in his mouth as if he had swallowed the draught he dreamed about wyndham sat on the locker and got up when he saw marston was awake  you look different i think you have seen the worst he said ive been bothered about you bob  marston smiled he did not want to talk and the relief he saw in his comrades face was soothing he went to sleep again and it was dark when he awoke he did not dream that night and in a few days got rather shakily out of his bunk wyndham put some cushions for him on the locker and they began to talk  the boats full to the hatches and we go to sea tomorrow wyndham said if the wind keeps fair i expect to put you on board the spanish liner for the canaries in three or four days youll transfer to a homeward cape boat when you arrive  but i dont want to go home yet marston objected  you are going all the same wyndham declared you have been very ill and a sick man hasnt much chance in this miasmatic air theres no use in arguing you have got to go  marston grumbled but they sailed with the next high tide and when they made the port where the spanish steamer lay he let wyndham help him on board     part ii  wyndham claims his reward     chapter i  mabel ponders   it was four oclock in the afternoon and marston sat by a window in an english country house his pose was limp and his face was thin for the fever had shaken him but he felt his strength coming back outside bare trees shook their branches in a fresh west wind and a white belt of surf crept across the shining sands in the broad estuary on the other side the welsh hills rose against the sunset in a smooth black line  marston felt pleasantly languid and altogether satisfied mabel had put a cushion under his head and given him a footstool it was soothing to be taken care of by one whom one loved and after the glare of the caribbean and the gloom of the swamps the soft colors and changing lights of the english landscape rested his eyes for all that they did not wander long from mabel who sat close by quietly pondering with her yellow hair and delicate pink skin she looked very english and all that was english had an extra charm for marston he liked her thoughtful calm mabel was normal she so to speak walked in the light and the extravagant imaginings he had indulged at the lagoon vanished when she was about  yet he had been forced to remember much for chisholm and flora had come to hear his story and he had felt he must make them understand in order to do his comrade justice floras grateful glance and the sparkle in chisholms eyes hinted that he had not altogether failed  its a moving tale i felt i was young again chisholm remarked when marston stopped a daring voyage for a craft as old as columbine and harry obviously handled her well some folks declare were decadent but my notion is a race that loves the sea cant lose its vigor and the spirit that sent out the old adventurers is living yet well i wish i had been with you he paused with an apologetic smile and turned to flora its plain that harry has qualities  he has a good partner flora replied and gave marston a friendly nod i mean that bob  the persistence of the family type is a curious thing chisholm resumed in old times wyndhams sent out slavers and privateers and although harrys modern hes taking the path his ancestors trod well in a sense hes lucky because he can make seafaring pay the rest of us must indulge it tamely on board a yacht and however you economize yachting costs you much  harry has a talent for making his occupations pay marston agreed and noted that flora knitted her brows  you are romantic father she said i dont think harry is taking his ancestors path they were hard and reckless men and traded in flesh and blood you trade in rubber and dyewoods dont you bob  for the most part however we get a bit of everything ambergris pearls and curious drugs  i like pearls flora remarked but stopped rather abruptly and mabel gave marston a quick glance he thought he saw what she meant he must not talk about pearls just then  after a time flora said they must go and went out with mabel but chisholm stopped by marstons chair  it looks as if you were quite satisfied about this venture of wyndhams bob he said  why yes marston replied ive backed my approval by investing a good sum  chisholm was quiet for a moment or two and then resumed that is not altogether what i meant in fact its hard to state frankly what i do mean i like harry wyndham hes clever resolute and a good sportsman but when he wanted to marry flora i hesitated well your story has given me some comfort you have been with wyndham and are satisfied one can trust you  you are very kind sir marston answered with a touch of awkwardness the business is risky the climates bad and one must use some control leave liquor alone for example i think you understand still harrys rather a spartan theres an ascetic vein in him besides he wont stay long as soon as he has put things straight hes coming back  thank you said chisholm but when he went off marston felt embarrassed  chisholm trusted him and he was not sure he had been altogether frank wyndham of course was free from certain gross temptations to which some white men in the tropics were victims but there were others subtle and insidious that rather appealed to the brain than the body marston could not declare that harry resisted these yet it was impossible he should tell chisholm his vague but disturbing doubts it was some relief when mabel returned and sat down opposite  have they tired you bob she asked light a cigarette and dont talk unless you want  i want to talk said marston who used no reserve with her  very well to begin with you saw my hint when flora talked about the pearls  marston laughed after all im not so dull as some people think you didnt want flora to know i had brought you pearls  something like that why did harry send her none  its rather puzzling marston replied thoughtfully i suggested i should take a few to flora but he said they were not good enough theyre not really firstclass pearls you know then he said they might be unlucky the strange thing is i think he meant it  yet you brought some for me youre honest but you dont always use much tact dear bob  oh well were not superstitious and id no grounds for thinking the pearls would bring bad luck  it looks as if your partner had some grounds  yes said marston i dont understand the thing for that matter i was puzzled about other things now and then and although i wanted to get back to you i felt shabby about coming home somehow i had a notion i ought to stay after all you let me go and would like me to finish my job  youre rather a dear and very staunch mabel remarked with a gentle smile anyhow you were ill and had done enough  she was quiet for a time and marston was satisfied to smoke and study her it had got dark but the fire was bright and touched her face while she sat still as if lost in concentrated thought marston thought her beautiful and she had beauty but her beauty was not her strongest charm  bob she remarked presently yours was a curious dream  i had fever you know but the thing was remarkably real it was like lantern pictures melting on the screen background and figures were accurate and lifelike in the last scene i knew i was in columbines cabin and can hardly persuade myself i was quite asleep the tide splashed about the boat i could smell the mud  yet you saw wyndhams uncle change into the horrible old mulatto  marston nodded he faded and got distinct again different but not different altogether this was the puzzling thing however the story the agent told us about the leopards had haunted me and id often thought about rupert wyndham perhaps it was because i saw his portrait and he was like my partner  you mean he was like him physically  thats not all of course a portrait doesnt tell one very much but i thought harry had ruperts temperament  i see said mabel knitting her straight brows to begin with do you know rupert wyndhams temperament  in a way harry and ellams the agent talked about him much he was a daring man i think reckless is the proper word we sober folks have our code we must do this and not the other men like rupert wyndham have none if a thing looked worth getting hed venture much and break rules for it harry you know is like that i mean hed venture much well i think rupert made some rash experiments in africa he studied the negroes habits and tried to get their point of view  with an object you suggest what did he want  harry imagined it was power  ah said mabel harry wants flora and he has ruperts recklessness  marston made a sign of disagreement theres a difference a man might do much for power but for a girl like flora he must be fastidious it wouldnt help if he got money and lost her respect harry knows this hes not a fool  but suppose flora didnt know how he got his money  harry doesnt cheat he wouldnt use means she disapproved and then claim his reward  oh well said mabel i think well let it go i like you to trust your friends  soon afterwards a car came to the steps and mabel saw that marston put on a warm scarf and fastened his collar before he drove off then she went back to the fire and pondered his story and subsequent remarks the story was strange but she thought she saw a light where all was dark to bob she had long suspected that wyndham was reckless and would not be bound by rules if the prize he sought made his breaking them worth while moreover she had got books about west africa and the caribbean that touched on fetish and voodoo superstitions perhaps she was romantic but it was possible wyndham led by strong temptation had ventured where a white man ought not to go with an effort mabel banished her doubts after all the thing was unthinkable bob had not been cheated he knew harry  in the morning marston occupied himself with some old books in wyndhams office at the top of a big stone building the office was comfortably furnished and there was a good picture of an oldfashioned sailing ship on the wall the big singletop sails indicated when she was built at the end of the street the window commanded the masts and funnels of channel steamers rose above a warehouse where wyndhams barks and brigs had loaded goods they bartered for slaves marston glanced at the modern iron masts and smiled when he looked up for the book he studied had nothing to do with business  it was the log of the slaver providence that wyndham had talked about and it related how they towed her with the boats when the negroes died in the suffocating hold there was something about a sacrifice that did not bring the needed wind and its cost was charged against the freight they were hard men touched by strange superstitions who towed the providence but their brutality was businesslike marston found an entry for the negroes used up at the oars with their value at jamaica properly noted  after a time he shut the logbook he had read enough and resolved there would be a break in some of wyndhams traditions now he was a partner in the house he had noted things he did not like and harry would support his new plans when he came home by and by he heard steps in the clerks office and a broker was announced the latter came in and put a small brown jar on the table  i told your people we wanted some hard oil and they sent us samples he said if the bulks quite up to specimen i think it ought to meet the bill we must have prime quality for the particular job  marston picked up the jar which held a quantity of thick yellow grease it was palm oil and its strong but rather pleasant smell awoke vivid memories he saw the whitewashed factory shine beside the muddy river and a gang of naked negroes filling big barrels in a compound tunneled by landcrabs holes the compound glowed with light against a background of forest wrapped in unchanging gloom from which the palm oil came for all that the oil was a wellknown article of commerce there was nothing mysterious about its production and marston would have been satisfied had wyndhams confined its trade to stuff like this then he saw the broker was waiting  dont samples generally stand for the bulk he asked  the broker looked at him rather sharply and smiled  it depends upon the people with whom you deal and the skill of their warehouseman a man who knows his job can draw samples that will pass a goodmiddling lot as prime and this without the buyers being able to claim that theyre not fairly representative but of course you know  i dont know you see im a beginner marston replied and examined a ticket stuck in the oil well i saw this lot barreled in africa the quality is not prime  the broker looked surprised and annoyed then your manager has made things rather awkward for us one uses some judgment about samples but our customer must have a firstclass article and we engaged to supply him at a stated price ill own that the price was a little below what others asked we quoted on your offer  our offer stands said marston who indicated the jar will you be satisfied if the oil we send is all like this  we will be quite satisfied  very well send in the order and youll get the quality you want  the broker lighted a cigarette and gave marston his case i like the way you do business we are buying for big people the trades steady and good but we havent dealt much with wyndhams before if this lots all right other orders will follow  you can take it for granted the lot will be all right marston replied  he frowned when the broker went out it looked as if wyndhams goods had not always been up to sample and marston remembered hints he heard about the character of the house harry however had not long had control and had perhaps left things to his clerks it was going to be different now  presently marston got up and went to the general office where he interviewed the young manager he did not say much but he was very firm and when he returned to his room the other shrugged  if the new partner takes this line your next balance sheet wont be good he remarked to the bookkeeper     chapter ii  mabels pearls   four months after marston reached england wyndham came home he had got thin and when he was quiet looked worn but he had returned in triumph and soon persuaded marston that his efforts had earned a rich reward things had gone better than his letters indicated  on the evening of his arrival he waited in floras drawingroom for chisholm who had not yet got back from his office at the port electric lights burned above the mantel and wyndham sat by the cheerful fire with flora in a low chair opposite for a time she had listened while he talked and now her eyes rested on him with keen but tranquil satisfaction harry had come back as she had known he would come like a conqueror she was proud that he had justified her trust and although it had been hard to let him go this did not matter  she was ashamed of her hesitation when he first declared himself her lover but the suspicion that she was rash had not lasted long flora was loyal and when she had accepted him looked steadily forward it was not her habit to doubt and look back one thing rather disturbed her harry was obviously tired before he went away his talk and laugh were marked by a curious sparkle that flora thought like the sparkle of wine this had gone but in a way she liked him better although his sober mood was new  byandby he glanced about the room which was rather plainly furnished but with a hint of artistic taste chisholm was not rich and the taste was floras then he moved his chair and leaned forward to the fire with a languid smile  our english cold is bracing but it bites keen when one has known the tropics he said i like light and warmth  you got both on the caribbean flora remarked  no said wyndham not much light for a few hours the glare was dazzling but soon the shadow crept back from the bush and the fevermist floated about the boat on the creek and at the village you got a sense of gloom that never melted he paused and added with a smile its often like that in the tropics and the gloom is not altogether physical  flora noted the thinness of his face and his pallor her glance got soft and pitiful  my dear she said i wanted you to win not that i cared for your winning but because i wanted you to satisfy others who do not know you so well  your father for example he rejoined with a twinkle well he took the proper line but i think i have some arguments that will persuade him  i sent you she said with a touch of color afterwards i saw that i was shabby and vain i ought not to have let you go what did it matter about the others when i was satisfied you have won and they will own this but im afraid it has cost you much  wyndham gave her a rather sharp glance and then smiled one must pay for what one gets but if its much comfort i was very willing  you were always generous but im afraid youre sometimes rash  the rashness was justified if i had to choose again id stake my all fortune mind and body and think the risk worth while  youre very nice said flora and added with a blush but in one way there was no risk even if you had been beaten i would have persuaded father it was rather for his sake you went than mine and thats why im half ashamed but he deserved something he has long indulged me  she got up there were steps in the passage and chisholm came in wyndham stayed for dinner and afterwards went with chisholm to his smokingroom and gave him a document  my bookkeeper drafted the statement because i thought you ought to know where i stand he said the sum indicated could be invested for flora not much of a marriage settlement of course but perhaps it will help to banish your very natural doubts  chisholm studied the paper with some surprise you have done much better than i thought i dont know if this is flattering or not in fact when one remembers that you have not long been head of the house your success is rather remarkable  i ran some risks said wyndham smiling we have got started perhaps im optimistic but i came home persuaded we are going on its possible we may go far  you have a good partner chisholm remarked  the best wyndham agreed quietly  chisholm liked his hint of feeling but hesitated although there was no obvious reason for this he liked wyndham and the latter was on the way to mend his fortune all the same he shrank rather illogically from giving his formal consent to the wedding  well he said with something of an effort im glad your affairs are going as well as you hoped and i suppose you now expect me to keep my promise ive no grounds to refuse and you can marry flora when she is ready  wyndham went soon afterwards and chisholm said to flora you declared harry would force me to approve and he has done so  what do you approve flora asked smiling  oh well said chisholm i think i see what you suggest looks as if i must be frank since my duty is to take care of you its a big relief to find harry is a good business man and is going to make wyndhams prosperous i like to feel hes able to give you all you ought to have  floras glance was proud i want you to be satisfied and it was for this i let harry go i would not have hesitated had he come back disappointed and poor now i feel half cheated because in one way he doesnt need my help  you are a plucky girl said chisholm still i expect its better he has come back rich after all romance wears off and then if moneys short the strain begins  your philosophys not very good flora rejoined with a laugh real romance never wears off the strains the test that marks the difference between the true and false however since you have carried out your duty and used a caution thats rather new you ought to be happy  she kissed him and he let her go but he was thoughtful afterwards he felt he ought to be happy but somehow he was not byandby he got up and went to meet mabel and marston whom he heard come in a famous shakespearian actor was visiting the town and marston had called to suggest that they should see the play together they fixed a night without knowing in which of his favorite parts the tragedian would appear mabel said this was not important because he was good in all  when the car stopped at the theater she went with flora to the cloakroom and began to take off her furs in front of a long glass as she did so she hesitated because she remembered something she ought to have remembered before it was too late now for as the cloak slipped off her shoulders a string of small pearls caught the light flora had not long since said she liked pearls then mabel saw that flora had seen the pearls and thought she had noted her hesitation because she smiled  they are very pretty flora remarked i suppose bob gave them to you  they are small said mabel deprecatingly but not because she did not value her lovers present bob said something about their not getting any harry thought good enough to send home  bob and you are very nice but youre sometimes obvious flora rejoined however im not jealous and if the pearls are small they stand for much  these stand for endurance and bold adventure i think bob did not get them easily  that would not matter to bob said flora but i wonder what they cost the others the darkskinned men who found them on the sands beneath the caribbean pearls you know sometimes stand for tears she moved from the glass for the room was filling and smiled as she resumed i dont know why i indulge a morbid sentiment when im happy you will never have much grounds to cry for bob  they went down a passage and found their places in the stalls the house was full and marston had engaged such seats as he could get wyndham flora and chisholm were in front mabel and marston in the row behind  macbeth he said as he gave mabel a program rather curious but i like the play kind of plot one can understand  why is it curious mabel asked dont you understand them all  not like this said marston with a touch of awkwardness the mottoor dyou call it the motiveis plain from the start ambition that overleaps itself if im quoting right  mabel said nothing bob was not clever but he was sometimes shrewd and she saw what was in his mind this was easier because he looked uncomfortable the poor fellow felt he had not been quite loyal to his friend then mabel frowned perhaps bob had seen clearly there was a parallel  the lights went out and when the curtain rose marston tried to banish his disturbing thoughts and enjoy the play he had seen it often but the story gripped him with a force he had not felt before all was well done pale flames played round the witches cauldron and there was something strangely suggestive about the bent figures that hovered about the fire and faded in the gloom he had sometimes thought the witchscene unnecessary but now he felt its significance in shakespeares days men believed in witchcraft and when one had been in africa one owned there were powers that ruled the dark bob was quiet and listened with his mouth firmly set  a line caught his notice her husbands to aleppo gone the master of the tiger marston had not thought much about this before but he saw the strange highpooped old vessel manned by merchant adventurers plunge across the surges of the levant she was a type there were always merchant adventurers and he pictured columbine rolling on the african surf  then for a time he let the play absorb him the witches were tempting macbeth flattering his ambition promising him power the gloom and the flickering light round the cauldron recalled africa marston had seen the naked factory boys crouch beside their fires tapping little drums and singing strange monotonous songs that sounded like incantations he thought about rupert wyndham witches were numerous in africa and marston wondered what they had promised him was it power or knowledge the cautious white man shuns marston glanced at wyndham in front he had not spoken since the curtain rose and the pose of his head indicated that his eyes were fixed on the stage he was very still and marston thought the drama had seized his imagination  the cauldron fire leaped up throwing red reflections that touched a figure moving in the gloom marston wondered whether his eyes were dazzled for the hooded figure began to look like the bat then there was a flash the witches vanished and he felt a strange relief when the curtain fell and the lights went up  very well done a realistic scene wyndham remarked looking round did you know it was macbeth bob  i did not said marston if i had known i think id have picked another night  wyndham looked hard at him and then laughed and began to talk to flora but marston felt jarred harry laughed like that in moments of tension when others swore then he saw that mabel was studying him  you are quiet bob she said  its long since i saw a good play marston replied my first relaxation since i got to work and i expect it grips me harder because its fresh full house isnt it do you know many people  i see one or two friends of yours they have been looking at you but you wouldnt turn  i didnt see them said marston ive got the habit of dropping people since i joined wyndhams regular work is something of a novelty and while the newness lasts you get absorbed i dont know if its good or not what do you think  mabel laughed well done bob it cost you something but you felt you ought to talk  it oughtnt to have cost me anything said marston apologetically but how did you know  my dear youre honest and obvious besides we do know things by instinct perhaps i would always know when you were disturbed  im not disturbed you are here  ah said mabel now youre very nice but lets be frank you were thinking about another drama in real life that touches you close i see one comfort theres no lady macbeth in the piece  marston agreed and mused the light was good and touched mabels face and neck where the small pearls shone he saw floras face in profile her shoulders and the flowing curve of her arm he liked the fine poise of her head she looked proud and somehow vivid one got a hint of her fearless impulsive character her hair and eyes were brown and she wore a cornyellow dress mabels skin was white and red and her dullblue clothes matched the color of her eyes she was calm steadfast and sometimes reserved a contrast to flora although in ways they were alike both were honest and hated what was mean marston felt comforted there was no lady macbeth in the piece  moreover a glance along the rows of people was calming there were business men with shining bald heads and some younger whose clothes were cut in the latest mode women of different ages for the most part fashionably dressed sat among the others but all wore the conventional english stamp there was nothing extravagant about them marston thought they sat contentedly by modern hearths they were not the people to follow wandering fires perhaps he was something of a romantic fool but when one had been in africa and the swamps beside the caribbean  the play went on he saw macbeths ambitions realized the witches promises were fulfilled but with fulfillment came retribution that had looked impossible this was the touch that fixed marstons thought macbeth was cheated but he must pay the powers of evil lied one wondered whether it was always like that  when the curtain fell and the lights went up shortly before the end marston remarked after all there were the witches lady macbeth was so to speak unnecessary  mabel had indulged him before indeed his mood had chimed with hers but she thought he had followed this line far enough his illness had left a mark and he sometimes brooded she laughed when flora turned  bobs getting to be a dramatic critic and something of a philosopher she said perhaps hell tell you how he would improve the play  you know what i mean marston replied goodhumoredly arent a mans greed and ambition enough to drive him on without an outside tempter  without a bad woman to urge him flora suggested  when one comes to think of it a good woman might be as dangerous as the other said marston  mabel frowned she saw where her lovers remark led but doubted if the others did she forced a laugh when wyndham looked round  bob has a flash of imagination now and then she said  i expect bob would sooner leave out the witches now he knows something about ghost leopards and voodoo wyndham replied anyhow i think the mummery round the cauldron rather crude the act was no doubt written to meet the spirit of the times temptation by repulsive hags would not appeal to an uptodate young man my notion of a tempter is an urbanely ironical mephistopheles  marston said nothing he remembered the bats strange mocking grin and then roused himself and laughed he was getting morbid the wretched fever had shaken him he joked with flora until the curtain rose and when it came down on the closing scene resolved to forget the play  ive ordered supper it will brace us up he said  they went to a crowded restaurant and marston liked the tinkle of glass voices and cheerful laughter but he shivered when they left the glittering room and got into the car  put the rug round you before we start said mabel  i think i will marston replied apologetically i feel as if my temperature was up malaria has an annoying trick of coming back when it does come back you get moody and pessimistic sorry if i bored you tonight  perhaps it was malaria but i wasnt bored said mabel with an indulgent smile     chapter iii  peters offer   wyndham and flora were married at a small country church the morning was bright and the sun touched the east window with vivid color and pierced the narrow lancets on the south red and green reflections stained the mosaics inside the chancel rails but shadows lurked behind the arches and pillars for the old building had no clerestory  mabel was bridesmaid marston was groomsman and as he waited for a few moments by the rails he looked about commodore chisholm had numerous friends and for the most part marston knew the faces turned towards the chancel he had sailed hard races against some of the men and danced with their wives and daughters they were sober english folk and he was glad they had come to stamp with their approval his partners wedding some however he could not see because they sat back in the gloom  then he glanced at his companions he was nervous but mabel was marked by her serene calm floras look was rather fixed and although she had not much color her pose was resolute and proud marston wondered whether she felt she was making something of a plunge but if she did so he knew she would not hesitate chisholms face was quiet and perhaps a trifle stern he looked rather old and marston imagined him resigned the commodore was frank one generally knew what he felt all three looked typically english but wyndham did not although his eyes were very blue and his hair was touched by red he was different from the others his face as marston saw it in profile was thin and in a way ascetic but it wore a stamp of recklessness his pose was strangely alert and highly strung there was something exotic about him  the vicar began the office and marston remarked with a sense of annoyance that the church got dark as if the sun had gone behind a cloud he was not superstitious but he had had enough of gloom and the fever had left him with a touch of melancholy he glanced at mabel and felt soothed her face was quiet and reverent she was unostentatiously religious and her calm confidence banished his doubts after a few minutes the light got stronger and yielding to a strange impulse he looked round a sunbeam shone through a south window and picked out a face he knew marston moved abruptly and came near forgetting how he was engaged  the face stood out yellow and withered against the surrounding shadow the eyes were fixed on the wedding group and marston thought their look ironical but the bright beam faded and he wondered whether he had been deceived it was hard to believe that peters whom he had last seen at the lagoon was in the church and marston hoped he was not peters belonged to the feverhaunted forest he brought back the gloom and sense of mystery bob wanted to forget there was something strangely inappropriate about his coming to harrys wedding  wyndham turned his head although the movement hardly seemed enough to enable him to look across the church marston however roused himself for he had followed the office and slipped the ring into his comrades hand wyndham put it on the book and then as the vicar gave it back let it drop there was a tinkle as it struck the tiles and for a moment an awkward pause flora started and chisholm frowned but marston picked up the ring and when wyndham put it on floras hand tried to feel he had not got a jar perhaps he was ridiculous but he wished peters had stayed away and harry had not dropped the ring  there was no further mishap the sun shone out again and as its beams drove back the shadows the gilded cross above the screen caught the light and flashed mabel looked up marston thought her unconscious movement directed his glance and he was moved to tenderness and calm after the feeling of repugnance peters had excited the thing was strangely significant and he knew the glittering symbol was mabels guiding light  the vicar stopped flora gave marston her hand in the vestry and he put his on wyndhams shoulder as he wished them happiness in a few minutes they went out and when wyndhams car drove off marston stood by the gate with mabel waiting for theirs people stood about talking to one another and marston tried to hide his annoyance when a man outside the group caught his eye he had not been deceived the fellow was peters for he smiled  for a moment marston hesitated there was however no obvious reason for his refusing to acknowledge peters and he nodded when he advanced the latters clothes were in the latest fashion he wore light gloves and very neat varnished shoes at a little distance he looked like a prosperous englishman but as he came up and took off his hat the sun touched his yellow deeplined face and the curious white tufts in his hair then he looked pinched and shriveled  i hardly thought to see you indeed i imagined i had cheated myself marston remarked  peters laughed our meeting is after all not strange i landed a few days since and stopped to transact some business before i go on to hamburg a paragraph in a newspaper caught my eye and having nothing to do this morning i thought id come to your partners wedding since i really dont know him well i didnt stop him as he came out  will you be long in town marston asked  another day or two said peters i must try to look you up  he stepped back as a car started and marston saw no more of him on the whole he thought he had seen enough and was annoyed because peters was coming to the office this however was not important and he forgot about it  in the afternoon mabel and he walked across a heathy common that sloped to the river mouth the tide was ebbing and thin white lines of surf curved about the sands here and there a wet belt shone with reflections from the sky the woods and fields on the western shore were getting dim and a long range of hills rose against the fading light the soft colors and the hazy distance where one heard the sea beat on the outer shoals were restful to marstons eyes he loved the quiet english landscape and glancing at mabel halfconsciously gave thanks because he was at home  who was the strange little man at the church mabel asked presently  peters said marston we met him on the caribbean did you think him strange  i didnt study him his eyes were strange they seemed restless and very keen the white tufts in his hair were unusual  fever leaves its stamp when you get it often marston remarked besides i expect the fellow has had some romantic adventures anyhow hes not a friend of ours we gave him dinner on board because he was a white man thats all  i wonder whether harry saw him just before he dropped the ring  what do you think marston asked with some curiosity  i dont know harry looked round  oh well said marston if harry did see him i dont imagine it had much to do with his dropping the ring  mabel gave him a quiet glance she knew bob and thought he was trying to persuade himself not to cheat her  yet you did not like to see the man  i did not marston admitted he so to speak brought things back our agents dying and the dreams i had when i was ill some people belong to their surroundings i mean they stand for the places they come from and peters belongs to the mangrove lagoons you and flora stand for england spots like this where alls bracing and calm i think well let peters go  youre very nice said mabel smiling if we are going to flatter each other you stand for the sea  no said marston the seas restless breezy and sparkling and im not you have got a rather dull fellow for a lover  ah said mabel quietly you are my lover bob and that means much  she mused while they crossed the heath in the fading light bob was not what he called breezy and he did not sparkle but she would not have him other than he was she had not often seen him angry but she knew he could be strongly moved and forces then set in motion were not easily stopped bob was steadfast this was perhaps the proper word he had a reserve of strength and tenacity of which she thought he was not altogether conscious she had loved him long and it was significant that she loved him better than at the beginning  by and by he looked at her i grudge harry nothing and have much for which im thankful all the same i envied him his luck today  poor old bob said mabel but you know when i promised  he nodded i know and of course im satisfied i cant urge you but sometimes like today waitings hard  mabels eyes were very soft there was love in her glance but he got a hint of tears  my dear she said i think you will not be forced to wait very long she paused and tried to smile as she resumed never mind bob you neednt talk i know your sympathy  he said nothing but took her hand and she felt comforted mrs hilliard was a widow and had long been ill and bob had known mabel would not marry while her mother needed her at the beginning he had urged that he was able to take care of both and since he was rich things might be made easier for the invalid if she lived with them mabel however was firm and bob gave in he would not argue that her sense of duty was perhaps mistaken and mrs hillards refusal might be selfish mabels strong persuasion was enough for him  you will come in and see her she has been alone all day mabel said and marston went  mrs hilliard sat by the fire in an invalids chair and when he entered gave him a friendly smile she looked very pinched and fragile and he thought mabels fears were justified for an hour he talked about the wedding and other matters as cheerfully as he could and when he went mabel kissed him at the gate  you are very good bob she said i owe you much and some day ill try to pay my debt  in the morning marston went to the office and soon afterwards peters was shown in marston gave him a cigar and they talked about the caribbean  im beginning to feel ive had enough peters presently remarked life in the swamps is strenuous and one likes quiet when ones no longer young  on the surface things looked pretty dull i felt languid as soon as i arrived and didnt really wake up until i left  peters smiled yet i imagine you found the monotony is sometimes broken besides you didnt stay long enough to learn that much thats curious goes on beneath the surface theres an underworld he paused and added meaningly on the whole i think the term is pretty good  i was satisfied with the surface anyhow i didnt try to look beneath marston rejoined with some dryness in fact id sooner leave some things alone  a prudent resolve when one can carry it out but dyou imagine your partner controlled his curiosity  marston feared that wyndham had not and frowned because he felt peters had meant his remark to be significant the latter resumed of course you can live tranquilly at the old spanish ports that is if you are sober and resist the darkskinned señoritas charms perhaps the worst risk a rash stranger runs is being found in a dark calle with a jealous halfbreeds knife in his back in order to get hurt you must court danger in the swamps it haunts you of course if you trade in the regular markets the profit is not large but if i could get a good post at a port with a casino and cafés i think id be satisfied  havent your employers a job that would suit to offer you marston asked carelessly  they have not they have been grumbling recently and hinting that ive got slack as a matter of fact they have some grounds my knowledge of the business is pretty extensive but since your partner came on the scene the goods we want to get have gone to wyndhams im now going to hamburg to account for this but doubt if i can do so satisfactorily my explanations rather romantic than plausible  then you have an explanation  peters smiled yes it looks as if the bat had let his old friends go and taken wyndham up  ridiculous said marston what has the bat to do with trade hes not a merchant or a cultivator  for all that the fellow has power the president rules the cities the guardias rurales the cleared land but the bat and the devil rule the bush i know halfcivilized mestizos who believe the bat is the devil anyhow hes a useful friend  hes not my friend marston rejoined however if your employers are not satisfied i dont see how i can help  i have a plan said peters i know the bush the negroes and their habits as few white men know them and my knowledge is worth much to a merchant house well im not greedy and imagine youd find it worth while to give me a small partnership or if youd sooner appoint me your agent at a port from which i could control the lagoon trade  marston looked at him with some surprise on the whole he did not like the fellow and he had no grounds for trusting him  im afraid i cant agree he replied we have a pretty good agent at all the ports where we trade and wyndham sent a man he was satisfied about to the lagoon our business is not large enough to justify our taking a new partner  the business is extending would you like to talk to wyndham about it  he wont be back for some time and i expect hell agree that we dont need help i think you had better stick to your hamburg friends  oh well said peters philosophically it looks as if i must drop the plan but if you need me later you know where i can be found in the meantime well let it go when i left ramon larrinaga sent you his compliments hes getting an important man had some part in the plot that put the new president in power and has no doubt claimed his reward  you may give him our congratulations when you go back marston replied and soon afterwards peters went off  marston smoked a cigarette and reviewed his visitors remarks the fellow had implied that wyndham had by some means gained the bats support and this jarred perhaps it jarred worse because marston had tried to banish suspicions that chimed with the hint then he imagined peters offer was rather made to wyndham than to him marston meant to urge his partner to refuse he did not want to see peters again but doubted the fellow was cunning and obstinate byandby marston threw away his cigarette and rang for his clerk he would not bother about peters until he was forced in fact if peters did not come back he was not sure he would tell wyndham about it at all     chapter iv  the lost explorers   the days were getting longer and although the evening was cold marston rejoiced that winter had gone he had worked hard at the office until wyndhams return from his honeymoon and now he was glad to get on the water again putting down his oars he let red roses dinghy drift because he doubted if the tide had risen enough to carry him across the sands a bitter wind blew up the estuary where belts of shining water wound among the shoals and some distance astern red rose rode at her moorings in a sheltered pool for half a mile sand and shallow water ran between marston and the beach  he had brought the yacht round from a neighboring river mouth where the smoke of a busy port blackened her gear and had since been occupied on board now he was pleasantly tired hungry and braced by the cold he knew no amusement that gave him as much satisfaction as working on board a yacht in fact if one went about the thing properly it was really a scientific job  the dinghy grounded and letting her bump across the sand he lighted his pipe and reviewed his changed life since wyndham won the commodores cup things had begun to change then for the most part he had worked hard at first as columbines mate and supercargo afterwards as a merchants clerk although he had invested a good sum he was really a clerk sometimes he stated his views and wyndham listened politely but when one came to think about it harry did not tell him much then he did not altogether understand transactions in which the house engaged  for all that marston was not hurt he admitted that his judgment was not worth much he had not like harry been trained for business in fact it was something of a relief when harry came home and he got rid of his responsibility although he thought he had on the whole managed rather well recently he had taken things easier and wyndham had encouraged him to do so he suggested marstons going off for a few days now and then and told him not to bother about the office while he fitted out red rose harry was a good sort and since he did not need him marston was glad to occupy himself with the yacht  byandby the dinghy floated off the shoal and marston saw the welsh hills on the other shore were getting dim and blue he was cold and drove the little boat briskly across the rippling water carrying her up the beach he went to an inn where he left his yachting clothes and then set out across the heathy common for mrs hilliards house mabel gave him tea by the fire and when it got dark outside they talked in the flickering glow flora wyndham and chisholm were coming to dinner but would not arrive yet and marston lounged contentedly in a big easy chair  i dont know if im tired or lazy he remarked anyhow its very nice to sit by the fire with you  when youre lazy said mabel with a smile  always marston declared however you get a particular satisfaction from loafing after you have had a good day  on board the yacht im not jealous bob but you havent been to the office much  that is so marston admitted i was rather keen about the business in fact im keen yet i like to know how things are going even if i cant help but the boats a temptation and harry doesnt need me all the time  do you know how things are going  for the most part marston replied with a touch of embarrassment because he sometimes felt he did not know as much as he would like i dont bother about small particulars  has harry stated he did not need you or did you imagine this and make it an excuse for a holiday  marston pondered for a moment or two he did not altogether approve mabels line perhaps because it excited doubts he had tried to banish  harry knows i like pottering about the boat he said he has hinted that i neednt stick to business quite so close now hes in control after all theres hardly enough work for two partners  mabel let this go she knew bob and thought he was rather trying to justify wyndham than to find an excuse for his own laziness it looked as if he suspected his partner was willing to get rid of him now and then moreover bob was not lazy  harrys occupied pretty closely is he not she said i have thought he looks tired  that is so agreed marston who had recently noted a hint of strain about his comrade wyndham was sometimes impatient his gay carelessness had gone after all managing a business like ours is not an easy job he resumed things however are going well and i imagine i made a sound investment in fact were getting rich  a car rolled up the drive and mabel rang for lights flora wyndham and chisholm came in and soon afterwards dinner was served mrs hilliard did not come down and mabel sitting at the top of the table studied her guests flora looked charming she had since her marriage got a touch of dignity mabel thought she was happy but now and then she gave her husband a quick glance wyndham was thin and although he talked and laughed when he was quiet the jaded look mabel had remarked was plain she knew bobs mind and his puzzled uneasiness about his partner that he would not own chisholm she thought was altogether satisfied and the grounds for his satisfaction were obvious wyndhams was prospering and his consent to his daughters marriage was justified still chisholm did not see very far  when they got up mabel gave them coffee by the fire in the hall and told the men to smoke chisholm feeling for his tobacco pulled a piece of newspaper from his pocket  have you read the news today he asked wyndham  i have not wyndham replied one may be able to study newspapers at the office of a navigation board but my job is not a sinecure besides bob deserted me and id hardly time for lunch  then ive something that may interest you i cut the thing out in case you missed it its headed a tragic story of tropical adventure  wyndham looked up rather sharply and held out his hand for the cutting but marston said to chisholm suppose you read it then well all hear  very well said chisholm who polished his spectacles and began  some time since a small exploring expedition started inland from the salinas coast of the caribbean he stopped and asked isnt that the country you are exploiting  yes said wyndham with some dryness its not a healthy country for white explorers unless theyre acclimatized but go on  the party consisted of a commercial botanist a student of tropical diseases a mining expert and a trader stationed on the coast  peters said wyndham looking at marston no doubt he persuaded the others i expected the fellow would try to get on our track  thats the name said chisholm and resumed  the party engaged a number of halfbreed porters and set off although they had been warned the bush country was disturbed the belt of swampy forest was penetrated by the spaniards four hundred years since but it is for the most part little known by white men and its mestizo and negro inhabitants dislike strangers  the newspaper man seems remarkably well informed wyndham observed i expect he has a correspondent in the neighborhood  when some time had gone and no news of the explorers reached the coast the government got alarmed chisholm went on señor larrinaga the head official for the district fitted out a rescue expedition and searched the forest they found one survivor the trader peters exhausted by suffering  peters said ramon larrinaga was getting an important man marston interposed sorry sir please dont stop  peters story was tragic the porters had got uneasy soon after the start but their employers forced them to go on until one night when the party stopped at an empty village they vanished in the morning peters left his companions with the object of overtaking the porters but lost their track and returning in two or three days found the others dead they were in a native hut and he saw no indication that violence had been used since the party carried their own provisions it did not look as if they had been poisoned señor larrinaga had some trouble to reach the village the halfbreeds and negroes in the forest belt are turbulent and rebellious and the rescue party was small he however pushed on and when he arrived found the hut had been burned and nobody about two of the explorers had previously undertaken the development of rubber and mining concessions for merchants of this city by whom their mysterious fate is much regretted  chisholm put down the cutting and the others were silent for a few moments wyndham looked disturbed but lighted a cigarette rather deliberately  peters ought not to have taken those fellows into the bush he knew the risk he said  the others probably knew it since the paper states they had done such work before marston replied  i think not anyhow they did not know all the risk peters did its significant that he escaped  you dont imply that he ought not to have escaped chisholm said with some surprise  certainly not still the fellows cunning and greedy i expect he got up the expedition and he gambled with his companions lives if he had won i dont imagine they would have got much of the reward  mabel studied wyndham it was plain that he did not like peters and she thought he had some grounds for resenting his attempt to explore the country wyndham was a trader and peters no doubt a rival but she did not think he was altogether moved by commercial jealousy somehow the thing went deeper than this his voice was level but she saw his calm was forced mabel remembered that he had taken some time to light his cigarette  the halfbreeds seem to be a lot of savage brutes chisholm remarked what stock do they spring from the carib  the african strain is strongest and pure negroes are numerous in central and part of south america its hard to fix the origin of the population about the cities theyve made some progress and a number of their institutions are good in the swamps i know best they have gone back to rules of life the slaves brought from africa long since if you want to understand them thats important  do you think the bat had anything to do with the explorers getting killed marston asked  we dont know they were killed and the bats rather a bogey of yours wyndham replied anyhow from one point of view perhaps his efforts to keep out peters and his gang were justified the country belongs to the bat and his friends their rules are not ours but they suit the people who use them and i expect they know what often happens to a colored race when white men take control semicivilization and industrial servitude forced on you for others benefit are a poor exchange for liberty  you mean their leaders know said mabel they would lose their power when the white men came  wyndham said nothing for a moment and marston imagined he was getting impatient then flora gave him a puzzled glance and he smiled  did the fellow you thought the bat look very powerful bob he asked  in a way he did not said marston he was a dirty ragged old impostorand yet i dont know perhaps it was his grin but you got a hint that he was a bigger man than he looked there was something about him  something mephistophelian wyndham suggested with a twinkle  but mephistopheles was rather a gentleman flora remarked  thats it you have given me the clew i was feeling for said marston you felt the old fellow might have been a gentleman long since and had degenerated now i come to think of it his confounded grin was ironical as if he knew your point of view and laughed at it in fact i imagine he laughed at himself at his claim to be a magician and the tricks he used a cynical brute perhaps but he was not a fool  arent you getting romantic bob flora asked  marston said nothing he had seen wyndhams frown and imagined he had had enough for a few moments mabel studied both she saw bob wanted to talk about something else but she did not mean to help him yet his portrait of the old mulatto had given her ground for thought for one thing it had disturbed wyndham and she wondered why she was not deceived when wyndham laughed  as a rule bob is not romantic but he was ill before he left the lagoon and fever excites ones imagination well let it go did you shift the ballast they stowed forward of red roses mast bob  i did we moved half a ton of iron and she trims much better with it aft marston replied  then they talked about the yacht until mabel got up and took them to the drawingroom she was curious but in the meantime did not think her curiosity would be satisfied bob knew no more than he had told and it was plain that wyndham meant to use reserve     chapter v  wyndham changes his plan   there was no wind the sun was hot and the reflection of red roses mast and rigging trembled on the shining sea she rode at anchor in a quiet bay near the woods that rolled down to the smooth white boulders dark firs checkered the fresh green of the beeches and the bronzy yellow of the new oak leaves the tide flowed smoothly past the yacht and across the strait a lonely cloud threw a soft blue shadow on the scarred face of a lofty crag now and then the echoes of a blasting shot rolled among the hills flora sat in the yachts cockpit she wore a pale yellow dress that harmonized with her brown eyes and hair wyndham lay on the counter smoking a cigarette and when she thought he did not see her flora gave him a careful glance after a few days at sea harrys face was getting brown and he was losing his jaded look but he was thin and she did not like the way his mouth was set he had been working hard for some time and now he had taken a holiday the strain he had borne did not relax flora did not altogether understand this because things were going well with wyndhams  she looked up the strait not far off an old castle stood upon a lawn where a long green point ran out and the spot had romantic memories for her she had promised to marry harry on the lawn one summer night when the yachts lanterns twinkled in the roadstead and colored fires burned on the castle walls wyndham lifted his head and smiled when he saw where she was looking  it is not very long since scarcely twelve months but much has happened in the meantime he said  how did you know flora asked and blushed  your thoughts were in your eyes gentle thoughts it looks as if you were not disillusioned yet  im not said flora firmly for all that i dont know if i like you when youre cynical  its a relapse or perhaps a reaction living up to your standard is a bit of a strain now and then  would you sooner i lowered the standard  not at all said wyndham with a twinkle keep it as high as you can for yourself so long as you are willing to make some allowances for me  thats a mans point of view flora remarked however on the whole youre very good i really dont get many jars  she studied him and mused harry was all or very nearly all she had thought and she was happy sometimes perhaps she wished he would give her a little more of his confidence about the office for example the control of the extending business was not easy she saw he had cares he did not talk about he was a handsome man and she approved the fastidious neatness of his white yachting clothes but he looked finedrawn flora rather liked this halfascetic look harry had no gross passions to draw him away from her although she sometimes feared she had a rival in his ambition he was ambitious and did not tell her much about his plans  she looked about near the point a little varnished boat shone in the strong light bob had taken mabel for a row in the dinghy  im sorry for them she remarked  sorry for whom said wyndham and turned his head oh yes its hard for bob mabel no doubt gets some satisfaction from feeling shes doing what she ought i myself dont know if she ought or not but this doesnt matter so long as bobs persuaded well i suppose shes worth waiting for and bob is patient  you are not patient flora rejoined you refused to wait  wyndham gave her a twinkling smile no i hadnt bobs advantages i seized my chance and made a plunge so i think did you  after all i wasnt very rash i knew you better than my friends but ill own to feeling proud because theyre all satisfied you were not very long persuading them  it cost me something said wyndham quietly however well let it go i mean to have a lazy day and brace up for our climbing trip in the morning i sent a message that we would need a car  flora nodded and glanced at a peak that rose behind the hills across the sparkling strait she was a mountaineer and sometimes wondered whether she liked best the high rocks or the sea then she turned and noted a long plume of smoke that rolled across the woods  the early boat from town she said  a steamer swung round the point and headed for the yacht piling the oily water in a wave at her bows the thud of her paddles nearly drowned the music of the band on board and confused echoes rang among the trees a group of passengers forward sang lustily and a row leaned against the rail  shell pass pretty close said wyndham i wonder whether anybody we know is on board  flora picked up the glasses and wyndham resting on his elbow turned his head the steamer drove on a feather of foam shooting up her stem and wyndham languidly studied the faces of the passengers then when she was level with the yacht he moved abruptly for a short thin man with a yellow face sat on a bench looking at red rose  do you see somebody shall i give you the glasses flora asked  no said wyndham sharply hold fast look out for her wash  flora seized the coaming and the white wave from the steamers paddles lifted the yacht red rose plunged violently and when she steadied the passenger boat was slowing near the pier flora put down the glasses and turned to wyndham she had seen the little man on the bench and imagined harry was studying him the fellow looked like a foreigner and she did not like his face yet it was strange his being on board the steamer had annoyed harry she thought it had annoyed him although the need to warn her about the wash perhaps accounted for the sharpness of his voice  i saw all i wanted wyndham resumed with a touch of grimness i thought you might drop the glasses when the wave struck us if i wasnt lazy id send a complaint to the office about their driving their boats full speed across a yacht anchorage has the splash hurt your dress  flora looked down and shook the sparkling drops from the thin material  this stuff wont spoil a dress that will spoil is no use for yachting ive been to sea before  soon afterwards the others returned they had promised to lunch with chisholm at the hotel where flora and mabel had a room but by and by wyndham remarked  i feel rather dull and think i wont go ashore perhaps you had better stay bob and well fit the new rigging screws the others look as if the hooks might draw in a hard breeze  stay if you like said flora you have come for a holiday are you sure you feel equal to our climb in the morning  wyndham hesitated id hate to disappoint you but i am lazy i found the scramble up the big gully hard enough the last time i went along the ridge and i hadnt been to africa then after close work in an office three thousand feet and some awkward rock climbing is a stiff pull  flora looked at the others harry was tired and rather slack and she wanted to indulge him it was something of a relief when marston played up  we came for a cruise not to climb hills he said lets stop and go fishing in the dinghy  there arent many fish and digging baits a bother wyndham replied ive a better plan the wind will turn east at sunset and there is a moon suppose we run down the coast to carmeltown and see the irish boats finish their crosschannel race  the others agreed and in the evening red rose left the anchorage it was getting dark when they hoisted sail but marston who occupied with the halyards thought he heard a distant shout looking round he saw a dinghy near the point  is that somebody hailing us he asked  i dont think so said wyndham there are other boats about but be careful youve got the topsail yard foul of the lift  marston pulled the yard clear and dropping down the channel through the sands they stole out to sea a light east wind blew behind them the water sparkled as the moon rose and shadowy woods and dark hills opened out and faded on their port side the night was warm the sea ran in long undulations wrinkled by the breeze in the distance one heard surf break upon the reefs and now and then a steamer with throbbing engines went by wyndham lounged at the tiller marston and mabel sat under the booby hatch and talked quietly while flora in the cockpit sang a song red rose lurching gently with all sail set headed for the west  harrys plan is good flora remarked when she finished her song there are two grand things the sea and the mountains but on a night like this i like the sea best  then you ought to be happy and i hope you are rejoined mabel the trouble about dividing your affection between two objects is when you get one you feel you want the other  that is so now and then flora agreed when you cant have both you are forced to choose and choosings generally hard  you let harry choose for you perhaps its a good plan but i dont know if ill use it much with bob  flora laughed and thought mabels remark was justified it looked as if harry had meant to leave the strait although he had said nothing about this until the passenger boat arrived anyhow it did not matter she was glad to indulge him and it was a splendid night for a sail flora was happy and began to sing again  the wind freshened as they crossed a rockfringed bay where a famous emigrant ship went down sparkling ripples flecked the swell which presently began to roll in short angry waves the rigging hummed a foaming wake ran astern and a white ridge stood up about red roses bows after a time marston and the paid hand set a smaller jib and hauled down the topsail and when they had finished bob stood on deck looking about the sea ahead was white and red rose rolled hard when the rising combers picked her up astern the dinghy sheered about and lifted half her length out of the water when she felt the strain on the rope once or twice she surged forward on a wave as if she were going to leap on board marston had seen enough and jumped into the cockpit  its freshening up he said the tide will be running strong round carmel when we get there and the sea breaks awkwardly in the race if youre going on well heave down a reef and pull the dinghy on deck  wyndham looked at his watch i dont know if im going on or not the floods running now and there are two nasty races before we reach carmel suppose we make for porth gwynedd i dont see much use in getting wet  the porths an awkward harbor to enter in the dark marston remarked thoughtfully  i know the way said wyndham mrs evans will give the girls a room we have got her up late at night before ask them what they think  flora and mabel agreed wyndham changed his course and the dark hills they were following got nearer by and by marston hauled down the staysail and stood on the deck forward studying the forbidding coast wyndham steered for  a narrow strip of gloom piercing the hills indicated a valley and at its end a dim red light blinked one could see no entrance shadowy rocks dropped to the water and a line of foam marked the course of the tide across a reef a white belt of surf glimmered without a break at the foot of the cliffs  wyndham however did not hesitate and flora glanced at him with quiet confidence the moonlight touched his face and she liked his calm one could trust harry when there was a strain she was proud of his pluck and steady nerve besides he looked strangely handsome and virile as he controlled the plunging yacht  when the white turmoil on the reef was close ahead she saw a break in the rocks the gap was dark and very narrow spouting foam played about its mouth wyndham signed to the fisher lad at the mainsheet blocks rattled and red rose swerving listed over until her lee deck was in the foam showers of spray blew across her she was sailing very fast and flora knew she would soon be broken on the rocks if wyndham missed the harbor mouth  they drove past the reef the long boom lurched across and red rose rolled violently dark rocks towered above her mast and the sails thrashed and filled in the conflicting gusts but the water got smooth and the harbor opened up presently marston jumped to the foot of the mast and the peak of the mainsail swung down  starboard he shouted look out for the perch  flora looked under the sail and saw a tall post with iron stays running from it into the water she wondered whether the flapping canvas hid it from wyndham because he was slow to move the helm  starboard it is he answered after a moment or two leaning hard on the tiller as he pushed it across  there was a heavy shock something cracked and broke and a thick iron bar ground against the yachts side she slowed but did not stop and when she forged ahead again marston leaped forward  bobstays gone and bowsprits broken at the cap he shouted  down sail ready with the anchor said wyndham quietly  marston dropped the anchor under the bows running chain rattled and red rose stopped they pulled up the halfswamped dinghy and when they had thrown out the water marston took a rope to a pier wyndham went forward and occupied himself with the wreck at the bows until marston returned  well need a new bowsprit and shes drawn the staybolt on the stem he said i think thats all but it will keep us here two or three days perhaps you had better see if you can wake mrs evans before we land the girls  marston pulled up the harbor and returning after a time said mrs evans was getting a room ready flora and mabel got on board the dinghy and when marston rowed them to the steps mabel remarked i suppose harry couldnt see the perch  he could hear me shout said marston i made noise enough if hed shoved his helm over instead of looking for the perch wed have gone past i dont quite understand it because harrys not often slow however a new bowsprit doesnt cost much the only trouble is well have to stay while somebody makes it  flora said nothing although she was somewhat puzzled on the whole she imagined harry had not looked for the perch the sail was in his way he was slow to move the helm and she thought this strange all the same it was not important and she talked to mabel about the welsh landlady as they went to the inn     chapter vi  peters renews his offer   red rose remained in port for a week wyndham needed a stay and fastenings for the new bowsprit and although the welsh shipchandler could supply him with galvanized iron articles he sent to southampton for copper marston thought this curious but harry was fastidious about the boat and for use in salt water copper was better than iron the party however was not bored porth gwynedd with its small slate houses standing between the clear green water and the quarries that scarred the face of a hill was picturesque the breeze was light and warm and sunshine sparkled on the sea they went fishing swam about a sheltered cove and climbed the rocks wyndhams mood was cheerful and flora was content she thought harry was recovering from the strain a rest was all he needed and she was glad she had persuaded him to make the cruise  when the new bowsprit was fitted they set off again along the coast and stopped at another rockbound port a summer hotel stood by a cove outside the little town and a day or two after their arrival marston and wyndham lounged on the terrace by the water at the end of the lawn the spot was sheltered by a tall cliff and a thick shrubbery ran between the grass and terrace flora and mabel occupied a bench in a nook cut out of the thick foliage the sun was hot and all was very quiet but for the drowsy splash of water on the rocks and the intermittent rustle of leaves  i like this spot said flora i have enjoyed the cruise theres something about the sea that soothes one  do you need soothing mabel asked  flora smiled a rather thoughtful smile not in a way ive good grounds for being satisfied but i had begun to get disturbed about harry he works too hard no doubt hes forced to bother about his business but he looked thin and was sometimes moody  he has done too much mabel agreed bob tells me things are going remarkably well for wyndhams all the same i expect it has cost harry some effort  harry does not grudge the effort said flora i grudge it for him it was mainly for my sake he went abroad and overtaxed his strength in an unhealthy climate in order to make wyndhams prosperous she stopped and looked up knitting her brows here is the little man i saw on board the steamer i wonder what he wants  mabel studied the man who crossed the lawn she remembered that she had seen him at floras wedding his face was yellow and wrinkled and although he wore light summer clothes made in the latest english fashion there was something foreign about him he went towards the shrubbery with quick resolute steps  its peters somebody bob and harry met abroad mabel remarked no doubt hes looking for them theyre on the terrace not far off  its strange but i feel id sooner he hadnt come said flora with a frown  the man vanished behind the shrubs and a few moments afterwards wyndham lighting a cigarette on the terrace dropped the match  peters he exclaimed  hallo said marston who turned and gave the newcomer an unfriendly glance we didnt expect you  peters sat down on a bench all the same i have followed you along the coast for a week felt i needed a change after my adventures with the exploring party which i dare say you heard about business was slack and i had a dispute with my employers i resolved to give up my post caught a royal mail boat and here i am  i dont see why you followed us said marston coldly  then i must explain some time since i suggested your giving me a partnership the plan has some extra advantages now  the advantages are not very obvious marston rejoined  let me state them said peters coolly the back country behind the lagoon is disturbed there are indications that the negroes and halfbreeds mean to rebel and ramon larrinaga is resolved to put them down its possible he may do so but i doubt  i dont know if this is much of an argument for our extending our business in the neighborhood but why do you doubt don ramons ability to keep order  its an argument for your putting a man who knows the country in control if a rebellion breaks out there will be opportunities for business such as one seldom gets that is if the situations cleverly handled but well let this go in the meantime larrinaga has a cunning antagonist who is much stronger than he thinks  you mean the bat  peters nodded i expect you have heard about the black napoleon who founded a negro state in the antilles well its not impossible the bat will make himself as powerful as the other  ridiculous said marston such things cant be done again the times have changed  i wonder whether wyndham thinks it ridiculous hes better informed than you peters said meaningly  marston turned to wyndham but he said nothing his face was set and he looked as if he tried to brace himself  you had an example of the bats power not long since peters went on my exploring companions were poisoned but not before the tropical diseases man had made some interesting discoveries although the swampbelt is unhealthy malarial fever is not so common as some people think in fact it does not account for all the fatal sickness  yet strangers die from fever and among the halfbreeds the mortality is large  that is so peters agreed all the same my notion is its better to study obeah than medicine and if you want to enjoy good health cultivate the friendship of the bat he knows how to get rid of people he disapproves  the brute ought to be shot however i dont see what this has got to do with our giving you a share in our business  i think your partner sees said peters meaningly and wyndham advanced a few steps with his fist clenched his eyes shone and the veins on his forehead swelled but when marston thought he would seize the other he stopped a yard or two off  how much do you know he asked in a hoarse voice  nearly all i think peters replied and turned to marston the bat is clever and knows how to use the natural products of the swamps in fact i imagine some of his discoveries would surprise our doctors he cannot however make all he needs and somebody has supplied him with arms and cartridges besides chemicals and drugs in use in civilized countries its sometimes an advantage to cure your friends as well as destroy your antagonists and the power of an uptodate obeah man is not altogether founded on magic  who has supplied him marston asked with strange and horrible misgivings  peters smiled you were very dull for some time but i think you begin to see well i suppose you can comfort yourself with the reflection that when you shared the profit you didnt know how it was earned  marston turned and struggled for control when he saw wyndhams face the sweat stood on the latters forehead and he shrank from his comrades glance  is this true harry marston asked have we been backing that devilish mulatto  you know now said wyndham with forced quietness it looks as if you had got a nasty knock id hoped you would not find out  marston tried to pull himself together he must be calm but calm was hard peters gave him a mocking smile  theres something yet the bat is not a mulatto  not a mulatto said marston dully what is he then  a white man if youre not satisfied ask your partner he knows him best  who is the bat harry  rupert wyndham wyndham answered and turned his head  for a moment or two marston said nothing and then his lethargy vanished horror gave way to fury and he clenched his hand as he turned to peters  you have shot your bolt and missed he said youre a cunning brute but all the same a fool now get off or ill throw you over the wall  peters hesitated his surprise was plain and wyndhams tense face softened to a grim smile peters had not reckoned on bob the latter advanced upon him threateningly  did you think you could blackmail us he resumed with a hoarse laugh that wed take you for a partner in order to keep you silent while we got rich the things ridiculous now you begin to understand this arent you going  peters said nothing and went his mistake was obvious he might have forced wyndham to accept his terms but he had misjudged marston when he had gone marston sat down rather limply and there was silence for a few minutes  well said wyndham at length  marston looked up i have got a knock but the things done and theres no use in calling myself a careless fool for all that i ought to have seen what was going on im a partner in the house  and if you had seen wyndham asked  id have stopped the business and brought you away  its possible youre a resolute fellow bob but what are you going to do about it now  put things straight as far as money can put them straight said marston quietly the cost doesnt matter its lucky i am rich  then you dont mean to break the partnership and give me up  certainly not said marston in a surprised voice we are partners for good and bad and mabel is floras friend when we started for africa she told me my job was to stand by you  wyndham laughed a bitter laugh it looks as if i didnt cheat mabel when i cheated all the rest but you had better let me go before your staunchness costs you too much  im going to stick to you marston declared i undertook the job theres no more to be said he paused and resumed quietly how did you get into rupert wyndhams power  wyndhams grimness vanished he looked embarrassed and moved youre a very good sort bob i dont know if i did get into his power anyhow not at first i rather think ambition carried me away you have not known poverty i doubt if youll understand  ill try said marston and wyndham went on  the house was bankrupt when i got control and i was in love with flora perhaps you think it was dishonorable to tell her so well i havent your scruples and we wyndhams like a risk the worst was i let her run a risk she didnt know we met the bat at the lagoon and he showed me how i could get rich he knew me i didnt know him at the beginning cant you see the situation id won the girl i loved but i must support my wife i couldnt force her to bear hardship because she loved me and for her sake i must satisfy her friends well i saw and seized my chance and almost before i knew id gone so far i could not draw back  did you want to draw back marston asked  wyndham gave him a curious smile youre cleverer than people think bob sometimes i was sorry i had begun but i imagine i would not have stopped if i could i meant to get rich to give flora a high place andthough the statement looks ironicalto justify myself well i went on until bad luck sent peters to pull me up  marston pondered for a moment or two now i understand why the witches in macbeth made me think about the bat they tempted him with lying promises but im not much of a philosopher and we have the bat to reckon on peters doesnt count  doesnt he count wyndham asked  not at all said marston when he told me his secret he lost the power to bully you the fellows a fool he thought me greedy  but he can tell others larrinaga for example  thats not important said marston quietly we dont want to earn more money by helping the bat were going to put things straight and if larrinagas government has a just claim on us we must pay  after all the bats my uncle wyndham remarked  yes said marston it complicates things we must go out again and get him away  get him away the man is powerful i doubt if the government can put him down  for all that were going to try  youre an obstinate fellow bob well talk about it again there is somebody else peters might tell  flora hell be too late you must tell her now  for a moment or two wyndhams mouth set firm and the sweat stood on his forehead then he said quietly it will be a hard job desperately hard all the same i suppose it cant be put off rupert wyndham and the powers he stands for have cheated me but i must pay  marston made a sign of agreement when you have paid youre free and can begin again  then he turned and saw flora in the narrow path between the bushes her face was white but her eyes were gentle when she looked at him thank you bob we owe you much she said  marston pulled himself together and gave her a friendly smile then he touched wyndhams arm as if to encourage him and left them alone     chapter vii  wyndham pleads guilty   when marston had gone flora sat down on the bench she was pale and trembled wyndham looking very grim leaned against the wall they were quiet for a moment or two and then he asked  how much did you hear  i heard enough said flora with an effort for calm i dont understand it all but i must understand i heard bobs voice sharp and angry and came to see if you were quarreling with the strange little man then i stopped where the shrubs are thick perhaps i oughtnt  it doesnt matter wyndham replied bob urged that you must be told and i think i meant to tell you anyhow when one is found out its better to plead guilty well what do you want to know  flora turned her head his stern coldness hurt she thought he feared her judgment would be merciless harry did not know her yet  well he said again  i must know all you helped the man they call the bat you sent him goods he needed drugs among other things although you knew he would use some to poison people and make the superstitious negroes think him a magician  yes said wyndham at least i gave him drugs i dont altogether know how he used the stuff  he poisoned the explorers who went into the bush  its possible said wyndham i think thats all  still you knew he was cunning and cruel you knew he killed people who wouldnt obey him and he used magic  i dont know much about voodoo and cant state if its magic or tricks however i imagine the bat did use it against people who disputed his rule  he gave you valuable goods you were getting rich flora resumed then she paused and added in a gentler voice he gave you pearls but you sent me none although bob brought some for mabel you said they were unlucky  it looks as if i was a romantic sentimentalist anyhow i didnt want you to wear pearls i got from the bat  yet you were willing to trade with him you gave him your support  i did said wyndham grimly for a tempting price now my luck has turned and i wont get the price my reward has vanished when it was in my hands nothing is left  flora pondered in a sense she thought he exaggerated because much was left all the same she was glad he had been cheated and the reward for his wrongdoing had gone he might have wanted to keep it and her refusal to share it might have separated them still she would not think about this yet she must break down his stern calm and much depended on the line she took  you misjudged me and perhaps that accounted for your giving way she said you thought i hadnt pluck enough to marry you when you were poor my dear i loved you and knew you were not rich  you hadnt known poverty there was another thing your father made stipulations and of course he was justified i was forced to satisfy him and your friends would you have liked them to pity you for a romantic fool whom a common adventurer had carried away  ah said flora you didnt know my friends much better than you know me mabels my friend and she let her lover go away i think it hurt bob when he found out what you had done but has he turned from you  wyndham said nothing and she resumed however all this is not important now you cant go on what are you going to do  it looks as if bob had made some plans for me i dont know yet if ill consent my plan is simpler and would save him trouble and risk it depends on you if i carry it out  flora gave him a quick glance for his manner was baffling he looked stern and his mouth was set  how does it depend on me she asked  i cheated you and your father and you have found me out you know how deep in the mud ive gone and it wouldnt be strange if you thought i might go deeper i expect you have lost all trust in me well if the shocks too great you must give me up ill drop out vanish like my uncle and trouble you no more  flora laughed a hoarse emotional laugh that shook her and brought the blood to her skin  you thought i would give you up you have been afraid of this since you saw peters at the church and you dropped the ring oh but you are very dull i love you and it was for my sake you did wrong well i am not afraid to share the punishment if i could save you id bear it all the thing that hurts is you doubted if i was brave enough  i knew your pluck you gave me proof when you married me for all that i knew your hatred of shabbiness and wrong im an unsuccessful criminal  all the same you are my husband said flora quietly  wyndham looked hard at her and hesitated  my dear he said i cannot urge this claim it would hurt less to leave you than try to keep you if you shrank  then you doubt me yet  no im ashamed and humbled i dont know what i ought to do or what i ought to say  there is not much to be said but it is difficult come here harry and give me your hand one hates to talk like a moralizing prig and it does no good but you have gone down hill for me and i want to help you back  wyndham came to the bench and she took his hand in hers i am your wife and will not let you go she went on still you must give up the money you have earned and put straight the harm you have done it doesnt matter if this makes us poor i can go without much you have given me id be glad to go without  ah he said with strong emotion i didnt know you flora although you hate my offense you mean to stick to me  my dear i expect the temptation was very strong and at the beginning you did not know all you did it was rather horrible to help a renegade outcast to plot against civilized rule and try to put in its place superstitious cruelty but thats done with we must think how we can make good  i cant make good at my cost you and bob must pay and i cheated bob  bob will bear you no grudge and i want to help  very well said wyndham with forced quietness you have given me a chance i dont deserve to get straight again and id be a meaner brute than i am if i let it go he got up and his face was very resolute now ill look for bob  he went off and flora although badly shaken was satisfied she had saved her husband from the bat and from himself he had not protested much on the whole he had been reserved and cold but she knew he was moved and one could trust him when he looked like that she began to feel comforted and get back her calm the soft splash of languid waves on the rocks beyond the terrace was soothing except for this all was very quiet and the quietness steadied her  byandby she heard a step and looking up saw peters had come back he smiled but his smile was cruel and she shrank from him with a quick halfconscious movement peters took off his hat  mrs wyndham i believe he said  i am mrs wyndham flora replied what do you want  a few minutes talk i imagine you will be interested  flora hated him he knew harrys offense and meant to use his power perhaps to demand money and perhaps for revenge he had power but since she and bob knew harrys guilt not as much as he thought she wanted to make him feel the scorn and loathing he excited all the same she might find out something useful if she led him on he was an unscrupulous antagonist and she meant to fight for her husband she made a vague sign of agreement and peters sat down on some steps in the terrace wall  your father holds an important post and your friends are wellknown people he began i expect you value their rather exclusive society  what has this to do with you flora asked  peters made a deprecating gesture wyndhams has now some standing on the exchange the houses credit is pretty good and people are beginning to think your husband a clever business man wyndham is clever but for a man to build up a business he must be known for something else if he wants to command peoples trust he must keep certain rules  i suppose that is so flora agreed with forced carelessness  very well said peters im afraid wyndhams new prosperity rests on an unsafe foundation a statement about their trade on the caribbean would shake it badly in fact i doubt if the house would stand the shock a merchant must enjoy his customers confidence and confidence is soon destroyed  you imply you could destroy the confidence people have in wyndhams  it is possible for all that i hesitate you see you and to some extent commodore chisholm would be involved in your husbands fall but i neednt labor this you know how prosperous conventional people treat friends who lose their place  flora struggled for calm but her eyes flashed and the blood came to her skin  oh she said forgetting the part she meant to play you want a bribe money to be silent you could not rob my husband so you came to me you think i am weaker and you can work on my fears  it looks as if he had told you something peters remarked coolly i do not think he has told you all  there was a step on the path behind them and as flora turned marston advanced his face was red and very grim bob was generally calm but he was savage now  suppose you leave the thing to me i saw the fellow coming here he said to flora and stopped in front of peters you havent gone yet i had some trouble to get rid of you before and dont mean to be bothered by you again this is the last annoyance you will give us  moving forward deliberately he seized the other and swung him off his feet peters was short and light for fever had worn him thin marston was big and powerful he got a good hold where the others clothes were slack and lifting him with a strong effort went up the steps peters kicked and struggled marston gasped and when his hat fell off flora laughed she was moved by a reaction after the strain when marston reached the top step he held peters over the edge of the wall  the tides low he said hoarsely with obvious disappointment i was going to throw you into the water  if you drop me somebody would find me on the rocks peters replied in a breathless voice and flora tried to stop her wild laughter her control was vanishing and the scene was ludicrous peters had looked grotesque while he wriggled in bobs grasp and now his coolness supplied a last touch of grim humor  i dont know if its worth while to go to jail for you and perhaps its not marston gasped he put peters down and shook him savagely for a blackmailer youre a poor sort of fool cant you see yet how youve muddled things you cant tell mrs wyndham more than she knows and i wont pay you to tell nobody else youll get no bribe for letting wyndhams carry on the lagoon trade because the trade has stopped for good it ought to be obvious that your hold on us has gone and now youre going too  he paused and seizing peters shoulders turned him round and half pushed and half threw him across the terrace peters fell into a clump of shrubs and getting up stole away in silence then marston turned to flora  sorry i expect you dont approve but i felt i must let myself go when people make me think about that confounded lagoon i get savage  i do approve said flora trying to be calm perhaps it wasnt really humorous but i was forced to laugh did you meet harry he went to look for you  no said marston i want to see him and after this little exploit expect youll be glad to get rid of me however i think you have got rid of the other fellow  he found wyndham writing a letter in the hotel smokingroom and sitting down opposite waited until he looked up  i suppose you told flora all about it marston remarked  i did your advice was good  it was better than i thought if you had waited peters would have given her his story before she knew yours i found him trying to begin it a few minutes since  ah said wyndham it looks as if i had run some risk after all i dont know he paused and resumed with emotion i admitted everything but she trusts me yet i think she would have trusted me had i put my confession off its strange but i didnt know how staunch my wife is well let this go what did you do with peters  marston laughed i came near to throwing him over the wall held him over the edge and wanted to let him drop but the brute suggested that somebody would find him on the rocks i saw the force of this because the consequences would have been awkward now we have a big job on hand its plain that you will need me  i do need you its lucky i have such a partner ive got to make restitution and cant do so at my proper cost yet ive no claim i cheated you as i cheated my wife im an unsuccessful rogue and didnt let my scruples bother me until i was found out  thats sentimental extravagance marston said with some embarrassment anyhow i am your partner and your responsibilities are mine i dont disown my debts  the debts are heavy i ran them up without your knowing  we can pay said marston smiling it wont break us im pretty rich and mean to see you out you can count on my help and my money in fact on all i can give now thats done with theres no more to be said  wyndham gave him a quick grateful glance thanks youre rash but i must try not to disappoint you friendship like yours is rare  when marston went off he sat for a time looking straight in front he felt slack and strangely humbled but was conscious of a new resolve although he had gone far down hill it was perhaps not too late to stop the climb back would be long and hard he could never reach his wifes and his friends level all the same he meant to front the ascent they had borne much for him he must so far as he was able try to repay them     chapter viii  up hill   the smokingroom of the marine hotel at carmeltown was crowded with yachtsmen on the evening after the channel regatta marston and wyndham occupied a small table the former trying to read a newspaper while the latter looked about the big room echoed with voices a haze of tobacco smoke drifted round the pillars and now and then a peal of laughter marked the end of an irish yachtsmans tale for all that wyndhams face was rather grim and marston looking up byandby thought he was brooding  hallo heres elliot he exclaimed spose he came across on the mailboat i heard her whistle not long since thought he was going to stop and see if they could salve deva anyhow id like to hear about the collision and it looks as if he was making for us  yes said wyndham i imagine he wants to see me  elliot crossed the floor stopping now and then when somebody spoke to him and after a time reached marstons table where he sat down  ive been trying to get to you for some minutes but the irishmen wouldnt let me pass the news of my bad luck soon got across he remarked  we didnt get much news said marston what about the boat  shes gone cut down to the bilge and sunk in six fathoms no chance of salvage and the navigation board is going to blow her up  marston said he was sorry and asked about the collision  to begin with i want a drink said elliot who called a waiter and then resumed it was dark and hazy and we were creeping up to the anchorage at kingstown with all sail set i was at the tiller but the wind was very light and she would hardly steer the tide was carrying her along jevons looking out under the boom said he saw a steamers lights but just then i heard a northwall boat in the fog you know the noise they make when theyre steaming fast and the fogs pretty bad when those boats slow up i knew she wasnt far off when i saw her lights red white and green all together that meant we had to do something quick  marston nodded when a steamers three lights are seen she is heading direct for the observer  our flare wasnt handy and the first match broke elliot resumed reckon i was awkward and not very cool however i got a light and it was a relief when her whistle indicated that she was changing her course but while i was fumbling with the matches i forgot the other boat so did jevons he owned it afterwards the northwall man went past us like a train lights all over the passenger decks and a fourfoot wave rolling off the bows she left us dazzled and rather shaken and then jevons shouted that the other fellow was close ahead  elliot stopped and drained his glass and when he went on his voice was hoarse we were crossing her bows closehauled on the starboard tack our business of course was to carry on but our lights were low and not very bright and as a rule its prudent to give a steamer room anyhow i shoved down the helm to bring her round and told jevons to get out the big oar when i found her slow the wind was light and she was plunging on the northwall boats wake she came headto and then a roller hit her bows and she fell off jevons was trying to pull her round and for two or three moments i saw the steamers forecastle she was a big clumsy craft going light and looked as high as a house  then there was a crash and the mast went i saw our side deck crumble and the others stem cut through to the cabin top mast and boom were over the side and when the round of her bow filled our cockpit i knew it was time to go by good luck we had towed the dinghy and the steamer held up deva until we got on board then as we cut the painter the old boat broke away and the steamer went on over the top of her i imagine she stopped because we heard her whistle in the fog but wed had enough of her and pulled for the beach we landed at kingstown and i think thats all  marston sympathized and ordered drinks elliot drained his glass and turned to wyndham  well he said she was insured and i want another boat whats your price for red rose  red rose is not for sale marston interposed  then why did forwood tell me you wanted an offer  marston looked at wyndham who nodded its all right bob im going to sell then he turned to elliot and stated a sum  a moderate price the other remarked ill admit its less than i thought is she sound  she is not wyndham replied port sides weak where the strain of the rigging comes she needs some new timbers the covering board ought to be relaid all round keels shaky aft the deadwood ought to be lifted  he indicated the repairs he thought necessary and elliot looked at him with surprise  since you want to sell arent you taking a rather unusual line  wyndham smiled i allowed for defects when i fixed the price the carpenters job will be expensive but if its properly done the boat will afterwards be nearly as good as new i think you can rely on this  marston gave his partner a puzzled glance and elliot said after your frankness ill buy her and take my chance  i imagine its a safe investment wyndham rejoined  for a few moments elliot was quiet and then he fixed his eyes on wyndham and said in a thoughtful voice red rose is fast and you sailed her cleverly all the same i never understood how you beat us when you won the commodores cup  i imagine i went the wrong side of the knoll buoy wyndham answered coolly perhaps this gave us some advantage because the tide runs longer near the coast  marston moved abruptly but wyndham went on im not certain but if you had filed a protest i wouldnt have claimed the prize bob thought he saw something in the haze it might have been a gull but it might have been the buoy anyhow we went on and the tide carried us along the shore  the short silence that followed had a hint of strain wyndham knew elliot knew his winning the race had appealed to floras imagination moreover he thought elliot had wanted to marry flora and would have had chisholms support marston saw they had got on awkward ground and felt embarrassed  after all you did beat us and you were not sure it was the buoy elliot said in a quiet meaning voice its too late to file a protest now besides we were talking about the boat  ill put her on the hard if youd like a proper survey before you decide  no said elliot i dont think its needful your statement satisfied me ill buy her  he went off and wyndham gave marston a smile you look surprised bob  lets have another drink said marston who called a waiter and then resumed awkwardly elliot played up pretty well i like the fellow hes a sportsman but after all i think it was a gull we saw anyhow we wont bother about it again why have you sold red rose  it ought to be obvious a yacht costs something and my keeping an expensive toy wouldnt be justified just now  romantic exaggeration youre frankly ridiculous said marston with some warmth wyndhams isnt going broke  wyndham picked up the newspaper and indicated an advertisement i really think im logical perhaps this ought to persuade you ive made up my mind  preposterous marston exclaimed throwing down the paper your pretty new house besides its floras house as well as yours  flora agrees said wyndham quietly  marston got up and his face was red looks as if you dont mean to let me help much its senseless exaggeration things arent as bad as you make out however ive had enough ill get angry if i stay  you ought to approve i imagined you liked a thorough job wyndham rejoined and marston frowned as he crossed the floor  men spoke to him as he passed their tables but he did not stop and going to the drawingroom found flora alone when he came in she put down her book and indicated an easy chair  stop and talk to me bob i was beginning to feel neglected she said but what has happened you look annoyed  i am rather savage marston admitted think ill stand until i get cool do you know harry has sold red rose  i knew he wanted to sell her flora said quietly  this is not all dyou know about the ridiculous advertisement hes put in the newspaper  of course i dont altogether see why you are surprised  marston hesitated he did not want to admit he had been surprised and after studying flora thought he could not urge that wyndhams reformation might be overdone  anyhow you can see why im annoyed he said im harrys partner and am going to marry your oldest friend  i have not forgotten this and it helps me to be frank youre generous bob but harry has done wrong and must pay he cannot make good at anothers cost  the trouble is you must pay your house for example you planned it you worked out all the colors and thought where everything ought to go the house is beautiful youre proud of it and a womans home means much to her  flora turned her head for a moment but when she looked up again her eyes shone  i would sooner be proud of my husband i am proud now and am going to be prouder harry has pluck and meeting obstacles spurs him on our part is to encourage him while he struggles up hill i know hell reach the top  with a wife like you he ought to go far said marston quietly im sorry you wont let me help in the way i want but spose i must agree dont know if im romantic but ive felt the worlds a better place since i knew you and mabel  he went off and soon afterwards chisholm came in carrying a newspaper  what does this mean he asked indicating an advertisement telford showed me the paper wanted to know why you were selling the house i couldnt tell him is harry getting rich so fast that it isnt big enough  flora smiled the storys rather long but i think you must be told if we stay here somebody may come in lets go to the breakwater  she got her hat and crossing a street they reached a long granite wall that ran out to sea the languid swell beat against the massive dovetailed blocks the moon was rising above the gray hills and when they had passed the landing place there was nobody about byandby chisholm indicated a mooring post and when flora sat down leaned against the granite parapet  my dear he said ive been puzzled recently had a notion something was wrong for all that wyndhams was obviously prosperous harrys an indulgent husband and i wouldnt own id grounds for bothering until i saw this advertisement well sometimes its rash to meddle but im anxious tell me all you can  flora told him and after she stopped he was quiet for a time the moonlight touched his face and she saw the lines get deeper the old commodore was deeply moved but she was glad he did not look stern  ive got a knock and know how you were hurt you bear it well he said to some extent the fault is mine when harry wanted to marry you i doubted but gave way i ought to have been firm  you are not accountable flora replied i wanted you to approve but i meant to marry harry i loved him though i knew his drawbacks but this doesnt matter i love him now  chisholm looked at her with knitted brows and she saw he was suffering for her sake  you are very staunch but i knew this you say harry means to make reparation now hes found out his repentance is strangely thorough  you must not be bitter said flora quietly  very well lets be practical your husbands job will be hard and long he must carry his load but part will fall on you its already doing so  that is just much of the fault was mine i trusted harry and after all i trust him better but at the beginning this was not enough i wanted you and our friends to know him to own he had talent and see my pride in him was founded well in a way it was a mean ambition i wanted him to get rich not because im greedy  i think i understand chisholm remarked perhaps we use the money standard oftener than we ought its not high but all the same to earn money demands some useful qualities he paused and added with a sigh i am poor and know  you are a dear your honesty is worth much more money than you could have earned then youre not hard as some honest people are you will not be hard to harry now he is trying to make amends  far from it what right have i to hurt a broken man  flora smiled harry is bruised but not broken then you see i made his temptation stronger when i ought to have held him back i halfconsciously urged him on it was for my sake he broke rules we try to keep and i mustnt grumble if some of his punishment falls on me  after all you did not know what you did  i ought to have known i am his wife but i think you understand and theres no more to be said  chisholm got up a nasty knock but we can bear it you have pluck and one cant be beaten when one is not afraid  they went back silently and near the end of the wall met wyndham going to the landing steps chisholm stopped and gave him his hand  flora has told me all he said your friends will stand by you     part iii  reparation     chapter i  wyndham pays duty   red reflections trembled on the sea a fringe of languid surf broke along the beach and as the liner turned a point a white town that rose in terraces glimmered like a pearl a yellow flag ran up to the masthead the throb of engines slowed and a noisy launch steamed out from behind the mole marston leaning on the rail watched her approach and his look was thoughtful when he turned to wyndham  if don ramon got our telegram hes probably on board he said i hope he is because if he doesnt come it might imply he means to make things difficult for us he could if he liked  larrinaga will come wyndham replied from all accounts hes a pretty good officer but i dont expect he neglects his interests while he looks after the states im counting on this  i spose one mustnt be fastidious but i dont want to get involved in fresh intrigue the job weve undertaken is awkward enough  very awkward wyndham agreed with some dryness in a way it looks too big for us to begin with we have got to pay duties we dodged and satisfy the government we cheated then without exciting the latters curiosity were going to stop a rebellion and carry off its leader theres the worst puzzle the fellows cunning and powerful moreover hes my uncle  he stopped for the engines clanked noisily as the screw turned astern then the anchor splashed and the launch swung in to the gangway the port doctor came on board and after him a man in tightfitting american clothes his wide black belt was spun from the finest silk and marston noted his hat indians had woven the delicate material under running water presidents and dictators wore hats like that and none of the few produced were sent to europe it was obvious that señor larrinaga was now a man of importance  you sent for me he said with a bow  the steamer goes on in the morning wyndham replied we hesitated about landing and calling for fear we might trespass on your time by sending a telegram we left you free to refuse if you are not much occupied i hope youll dine on board  larrinaga said he was willing and after a time they went to the saloon for the most part the passengers had landed and only three or four occupied the tables byandby the others went out and wyndham opened a fresh bottle of italian wine a steward turned on the electric light and soft reflections fell on colored glass and polished wood beads of damp sparkled on the whiteandgold ceiling although the skylights were open and a throbbing fan made a cool draught about the table footsteps echoed along the deck and when the steamer rolled the water gurgled about her side but it was quiet in the saloon byandby larrinaga put down his glass  one likes to meet ones friends but i do not know if this alone is why you sent for me he said if it is not you see your servant  wyndham bowed we value your friendship and particularly your honesty and tact there is a matter we thought you might arrange for us  if it is possible but you must be moderate one is watched and criticized as one rises in rank and it is difficult to allow ones friends exclusive privileges to grant too many robs the government  we want to make the government richer wyndham replied in fact we propose to give you a sum that ought to have been paid in smaller amounts before you will no doubt be able to hand it to the proper officer without our being bothered by awkward formalities  larrinaga looked at him with puzzled surprise in this country one pays when one is forced and the government is generally paid last of all one seldom gives money for which one is not asked  we do not mean to rob your government and my partner is rich enough to be honest said wyndham smiling you have no customs officer at the lagoon and we found on studying our accounts that some duties had not been paid  proper copies of your cargo manifests ought to have been sent the officer at the port where your vessels clearance papers were stamped  i think the manifests were sent but now and then we got cargo at the last moment as we were going to sea besides the officer was a friend of ours  larrinaga filled his glass and while he pondered wyndham lighted a cigarette the matter needed careful handling it was plain that larrinagas surprise had gone and he was cautious  then you propose to give me the money you ought to have paid the latter presently remarked  yes said wyndham we are traders and must get on with our business while the officer we knew has given up his post if we write to his successor we must comply with numerous formalities and a stranger would insist on knowing why we did not pay at the proper time well if you take the money i expect you can straighten things out  larrinaga looked hard at him and wyndham smiled he imagined the fellow was not honester than other government officials he had met on the caribbean larrinaga knew it was in his power to keep back as much of the sum as he liked for his private use and would no doubt do so in fact the fellow would imagine he was offered a bribe since one does not give bribes for nothing wyndham must hint that he had an object and the hint must be plausible  then you expect no particular privileges larrinaga remarked  oh no said wyndham all we want is to carry on our business without the small officials bothering us we are not smugglers but we would not like the vessel stopped if a manifest now and then is not properly made up one must go in and out when the tide serves and sometimes we do not know what goods we have on board until we check the tallies when we get to sea if we find we have cheated the customs you can trust us to put things straight only we would sooner deal with somebody important yourself for example  larrinagas eyes twinkled very well i think i can promise you will not be bothered much he paused and resumed in a thoughtful voice i expect you know your trading at the lagoon just now may lead to trouble  all trade is troublesome particularly when it is carried on in the mangrove swamps marston interposed the lagoon is not much worse than other spots anyhow the profits are large and we must earn some money  but señor wyndham stated that you are rich  rich people are sometimes greedy marston rejoined with a touch of awkwardness i did not begin business with the object of losing my capital  wyndham thought he would leave bob alone larrinaga would not suspect him of plotting and his rather obvious embarrassment was an advantage bob was the man one would expect to be embarrassed when engaged in trying to bribe a government officer to sanction his smuggling for all that wyndham gave larrinaga a keen glance the latter leaned back carelessly and rolled a cigarette his movements were firm and quick  don ramon was clever and knew much about the bush it was possible he knew wyndham had supplied the bat with goods and he might mean to let him do so for a time while he took his bribes hoping to cheat both by giving them a feeling of false security wyndham however did not think don ramon knew the bat was his relation peters knew but he was not the man to share a secret he had thought worth much although one must not altogether take this for granted wyndham could not see another plan  very well said larrinaga when he had made his cigarette i will take your money and see you are not bothered then he looked hard at wyndham i will give you a hint wait until your cargo comes down and do not go far from the beach the bush is dangerous for strangers just now  we heard something about this marston replied i dont like the mestizos and if theyre plotting trouble hope youll put them down  my partner has a horror of the swamps marston remarked with a smile if he was not keen to earn some money he would not enter the lagoon he has not joined me long and wants his friends to think he has a talent for business  larrinaga shrugged and got up the english and americans are hard to understand if i were rich i would be satisfied to lounge about the plaza and now and then gamble at the casino with my friends i would not gamble with the mestizos in the swamps the chances are too much on the side of the banker there well i wish you good luck until we meet again  the others went with him to the gangway and when the launch steamed off marston sat down and looked about it had got dark but a half moon drew a sparkling track across the calm sea anchor lights swung languidly by the shore and in the background the white town shone with a pale reflection against the dusky hills music came off across the water with the rumble of the surf and the smooth swell splashed softly against the vessels side presently marston turned and looked to the east  one feels an english steamers a bit of england she takes civilization and decency where she goes but it will be different tomorrow when we board columbine i wish our job was finished and we were going the other way anyhow it must be finished and i dont know if i liked the line you took don ramon wont hand over all the money  its possible wyndham agreed still i think you urged that we must begin by paying the duties we had dodged  i wanted them paid to the government not to a corrupt official who thinks hes got another bribe the duties belong to the country  oh well i dont know a channel by which the country would get its dues all are leaky in fact they are meant to leak its significant that official salaries are small however i dont expect don ramon is dishonester than the rest some of the money will go where it ought  perhaps its not important marston said thoughtfully all the same you rather let the fellow think we wanted to smuggle  smugglings profitable it was prudent to hint we had an object for haunting the lagoon on the whole i imagine a frank statement that we were trying to be honest would not have satisfied don ramon one must make allowances for the other fellows point of view i hope he is satisfied but i doubt  he is not a fool marston remarked i expect he reckons we mean to supply the bat with things he needs to fight the government if hes not altogether corrupt why does he let us go on  its not very plain anyhow i imagine he wont let us go on very long in fact speeds important we must finish the job before we are stopped  the rebellion must be stopped marston agreed in a way i dont care who rules the country i expect nobody would rule it well all the same im not going to see white traders murdered and the swampbelt given up to a cruel brute who would rule it on the african plan  the bat cant start his rebellion without supplies which we dont mean to give him wyndham said dryly things would be easier if he were not my uncle  marston hesitated this bothers me most dyou think larrinaga knows  i think not peters knows however and when he finds out where weve gone i expect well soon have him on our track this means we must reckon on three antagonists  three said marston with a puzzled look  wyndham nodded i expect well find rupert wyndham the worst however i see one advantage none of the three knows our plans and all theirs clash we are not up against a combine  we havent a plan marston objected  oh well said wyndham since that is so we must trust our luck  he went off and marston smoked a cigarette and mused he had wanted to be open and honest but since they could not use force he admitted reluctantly that they must intrigue the job did not look as simple as he had thought in england it was getting obvious that rupert wyndham would be their worst antagonist the fellow was so to speak no longer a white man he was a savage with a lust for cruelty and power but he had a white mans intelligence to imagine he could be persuaded to give up his ambitious plans was ridiculous he had no moral sense to which one could appeal all the same it was unthinkable that they should let him be captured by larrinaga and shot  marston could see no light and presently threw away his cigarette and got up the job was awkward but he must not own he was beaten before he had begun he would go on and trust his luck in the meantime he had promised to play cards with some passengers and he went to the smokingroom they played until the electric light went out when marston found he had lost five pounds it did not look as if his luck was very good  in the morning the steamer sailed and when she stopped again as dark fell a boat was hoisted out high land loomed vague and blue against the sunset drifting mist hid the beach and not far off two masts and a dark hull cut against the hazy background as he went to the gangway marston looked back with a curious feeling of regret the steamer stood for much that he liked and knew and he had enjoyed the society of her officers their temperament was sane and practical they did not seek strange adventures theirs was a healthful struggle against the obvious dangers of the sea  in front all was different and marston could not see where his path led mystery and perhaps horror deepened the gloom through which he must grope his way and his face was grim as he went down the ladder he did not talk while the sailors rowed him to columbine and leaving wyndham to give the crew some orders he sat down on the gratings by the wheel  the dew was falling and the deck was damp moisture dripped from the masts and ropes and it was very hot the anchor light tossed against the portentous gloom of the land the yacht looked old and dirty though marston knew her strength and speed the halfnaked crew made no noise as they stole about their dark skin was scarcely distinguishable and marston thought they rather looked like ghosts than men  in the meantime the steamers boat was pulling back marston saw her move across the dim reflections on the water but the splash of oars got faint and by and by she vanished in the dark then a whistle shrieked and lights that twinkled in the distance began to move the throb of engines traveled far but it presently died away and all was quiet marston was launched on his adventure and since he was practical he went below and studied the chart     chapter ii  marston gets a warning   it was dark and the mud village was strangely quiet thin mist drifted about the house don felix had occupied and wyndhams new agent leaned forward slackly with his arm on the table he was a young french creole but his face was pinched and careworn  marston sitting in a corner studied the man when he last saw lucien moreau he was vigorous and marked by a careless confidence now his glance was furtive and sometimes he fixed it on the window there was no glass and the shutters had been left open because the night was hot marston remembered don felixs disconcerting habit of looking at the window when it was dark the miasma from the swamps had obviously undermined moreaus health but marston doubted if this accounted for all  moreau had been talking for two or three minutes when wyndham stopped him  i understand you want to give up your post he said  that is so the other agreed for one thing you do not need an agent when you are closing down your business he paused and gave wyndham a sullen look besides i have had enough  your pay is good  good pay is of no use if one dies before one can spend it moreau rejoined  very well said wyndham if you have had enough we must try to let you go however since your engagement runs for some time you must stay a month  moreau agreed unwillingly and wyndham asked have you sent for the fellow who gave us our last load  he is coming tonight you will stay until he goes  of course said wyndham smiling i dont want to put too much strain on you it looks as if you were afraid of your customers  i am afraid one is always afraid here moreau admitted it has been worse since you did not send the goods you promised  we will send no more said marston firmly and they talked about something else until they heard steps outside and a man came in  he was a big darkskinned fellow and carried a thick blanket folded across his shoulder his feet and the most part of his thin legs were bare his chest and arms were powerful and he looked truculent he glanced at marston curiously and then turned to wyndham  have you brought payment for my goods he asked in uncouth castilian  we have said wyndham señor moreau has a list of the cargo and we will begin to unload in the morning tell him what we have brought don lucien  moreau did so and the other frowned these things are of no use to me  they are standard trade goods that count as money wyndham replied  you know what we wanted said the other and added meaningly  in this country it is not prudent for a stranger to disown his debts  we are not cheats marston rejoined the stuff is all good but we are willing to pay in money  wyndham stopped him and turned to the mulatto if you are not satisfied send your master we do not dispute with servants  moreau looked alarmed as if he thought the reply would provoke the other but wyndham gave him a peremptory glance and he said a few words in castilian the mulatto smiled a rather cruel knowing smile  one needs courage to dispute with the bat it is not often people in his debt want to see him  all the same we want to see him  i doubt if he will come the custom is to send a present and ask leave to visit the bat but i will take your message  and what about the goods wyndham asked  i can do nothing until i get an order  then well send them up the creek and put them in the store you can let them remain or take them as you like we have paid our debt  i doubt said the other grimly and with an ironical salutation went off  marston felt relieved when he had gone and soon afterwards he and wyndham walked through the silent village to the creek there were no lights the quietness and gloom were disturbing and marston noted that the negroes had not left the boat he thought they were glad when wyndham told them to shove off  we have made our first move i expect you dont see the next he said  not yet wyndham agreed it depends on our antagonist i think hell understand our challenge but its going to be an intricate game  marston lighted his pipe and tried to think about something else he hated intrigue and liked to see his path it was a relief when columbines lights began to twinkle in the mist and he went to the cabin when they got on board the little room was very hot and no air seemed to pass the gauze beneath the skylight but the glow of the brass lamp was comforting he owned that he had begun to fear the dark  next day they unloaded cargo and when they stopped in the evening marston took his gun and went off in the dinghy the tide was near its lowest ebb the uncovered mud banks gave off a sickly smell and for a time marston pulled languidly down the channel then he saw a strip of firmer bank where a little path came out a creek flowed through the wet forest not far off and he thought he might find his way across the ducks fed at twilight in the pools in the swamps pulling up the dinghy he looked at his watch the tide had not turned there was a moon and it would not be very dark one got cramped on board the yacht and he wanted exercise  the path was faint and the ground wet but it bore his foot here and there a huge cottonwood towered above the jungle which was choked by fallen branches and fresh growth that sprang from the tangled ruin of the old knotted creepers strangled slender trees and pulled each other down to the corruption that covered the boggy soil green things rotted as they grew parasitic plants drained the sap from drooping boughs one sensed the pitiless savageness of the struggle for life in which the beaten were devoured by the survivors before they were dead  dark water that smelt horribly oozed through the jungle the mosquitoes had come out and marston pulled down the veil fastened to his double felt hat the forest daunted him there was something about it that one felt in a nightmare but he was tired of loafing and pushed on if he could reach the creek he might get a shot by and by however the path bent back towards the lagoon and he stopped at the edge of a channel that crossed his path it was not wide but looked deep and the banks were very soft the creek he meant to reach was farther on  marston considered the channel marked the edge of the forest which it followed for some distance and then turning ran obliquely to the lagoon there was a muddy flat on the other side where he thought ducks might feed and he did not want to turn back all the same he did not like the bridge that spanned the channel somebody had thrown a small trunk across and stayed it as a suspensionbridge is stayed by creepers partly pulled down from neighboring trees the log looked rotten and the rounded top was wet with slime the water obviously covered it when the tide was full marston however was sure footed and steadying himself by the bent creepers went cautiously across  when he reached the flat the sand and mud were soft and his step got labored but the light was going he heard ducks and thought he might get near them in the gloom they flew off and he followed some curlews that led him on for a time and then vanished with a mournful cry marston stopped and looked about he had gone far enough the tide had turned and it was getting dark dark came quickly at the lagoon  across the little channel mangroves rose from sloppy mud their roots were five or six feet high and mudfish splashed in the holes beneath crabs crawled about the roots for he heard their claws scratch on the smooth bark he knew the noise one heard it on board the schooner when the tide was low and marston hated the hideous mangrovecrabs that swarmed about the lagoon they were savage and not afraid if one sat on the sand they crawled over ones body and their bite was sharp a curlews wild cry pierced the gloom and then all was quiet  marston frowned now the light was going the forest looked sinister perhaps he was imaginative but his halfconscious shrinking had some grounds in the tropics the woods were hostile and sheltered mans enemies of which the insect tribes were perhaps the worst they attacked in hosts with poisoned jaws then a pale glimmer caught marstons wandering glance the tide was creeping across the mud  he went back and stopped at the bridge dark had fallen but the moon was above the jungle and its light touched the channel the log ran across like a thin black bar a few feet above the slime it looked frailer than when he had come he braced himself and balancing carefully went a yard or two along the trunk then he heard a crack and seized the creeper as the log dropped under his feet he held fast although the strain on his arm was sharp there was a splash the creeper broke and swinging back with one end he dropped in the mud it rose to his knee and for a minute or two he splashed and struggled furiously somehow he got out and floundered back to the bank he had left he was breathless and rather surprised to find he had not dropped the gun but the arm by which he had hung was horribly sore  then it dawned on him that he was on the wrong side of the channel and could not get across when he fell into the mud he was not far from the bank but he had gone deep and it was unthinkable that he should venture farther out the halfliquid mire would suck him down still the tide was rising and he could not stop on the flat after a few moments another thing struck him when he crossed the bridge although narrow and slippery was firm but now it had given way as soon as it bore his weight the log had slipped down or broken suddenly he wondered whether it had been meant to break a few strokes with the cutlass the halfbreeds carried would be enough and he could not have struggled out had he dropped where the mud was deep  marston clenched his fist and raged with helpless fury he was persuaded somebody with devilish cunning had set the trap for him when the tide rose the dinghy would drift up the lagoon and in the morning the yachts crew would find her stuck among the mangrove roots it would look as if he had landed on a mud bank and had stopped too long then with an effort marston pulled himself together he must search for a place where the bottom was not so soft  he ran across the flat heading for the lagoon and hoping he might find a belt of firm sand that would enable him to wade across but there was none and by and by he came to the main channel it was wider and he saw clumps of weed and flakes of foam drift past the tide was rising and would presently cover the flat he went back as near as he could get to the jungle and sitting down with the gun across his knees took off his shoes he had sometimes gone wildfowling on the english coast and knew one can pull ones naked foot out of mud where ones boot would stick the gun might be an embarrassment but he meant to keep it to the last because the fellow who had cut the bridge might be lurking about  treading very cautiously marston tried the bank again but began to sink and had some trouble to regain the flat it was obvious that he could not cross and he doubted if he would be much better off if he reached the mangroves some distance from the path the tide flowed back among them their trunks were slender and they were haunted by poisonous insects and the horrible crabs if the crabs attacked him when the tide rose and he was forced to cling to the trees he could not beat them off all the same he could not swim to the schooner  for a time he wandered up and down the flat although he saw no way of escape he could not keep still in the end he must swim but he meant to wait until the tide drove him off the flat there was not much use in swimming when one could not find a spot to land the rising water presently forced him back to the small channel where he stopped the moon had got bright and although for the most part the mangroves on the other side rose like a dark wall the silver beams touched their branches here and there marston searched them keenly because he had a strange feeling that somebody was about perhaps the fellow who had cut the bridge had stopped to watch him drown  he thought he heard a soft rustle leaves moved and throwing the gun to his shoulder he pulled the trigger the barrel jerked the sharp report rolled across the woods and leaves and twigs came down but that was all and marston swinging the gun pulled the other trigger then as the echoes died away he thought he heard a distant shout and a regular throbbing noise he paused as he pushed in fresh cartridges and listened hard the noise was like the splash of oars and got louder it was the splash of oars and a shout came across the water again marston fired another shot and then waited trembling with the reaction wyndham was coming for him on board the gig and the crew were pulling hard they would reach him before the tide covered the flat  when the sand was all but covered the boat grounded close by and marston got on board wyndham gave him a nod and marston noted that he was hot and breathless a heavy oar he had thrown down lay in the sculling notch  the boys went out to make fast a warp and saw the dinghy drifting up wyndham remarked we reckoned we had better start  thanks said marston who imagined his comrade did not want to talk just then have you got a cigarette  they shoved off and when they reached columbine went to the cabin marston mixed a cocktail  theres enough for two he said i expect you sculled pretty hard  i did wyndham admitted the boys shoved her along handsomely looks as if they liked you but the tide was rising fast well what were you shooting at  i imagined it was at the man who sent the dinghy adrift  ah said wyndham i wondereddidnt think youd carelessly stop too long in fact i was pretty anxious until i heard the gun but do you reckon somebody did push off the dinghy  marston stated his grounds for believing this and wyndham after pondering for a few moments looked hard at him  well i suppose you see what it implies  im in the way somebody meant to get rid of me  yes but thats not all said wyndham with a dry smile it looks as if im not thought dangerous the man were up against is not persuaded my reforms sincere on the whole this may be an advantage to puzzle your antagonist is good strategy  he drained his glass and lighted his pipe in the meantime well let it go what about the new running gear have we enough manilla rope for the peakhalyards     chapter iii  wyndham tries persuasion   the moon had not risen and thick mist drifted past the schooner before the hot landbreeze marston was talking to wyndham in the cabin but stopped when something bumped against the vessels side  whats that he asked sharply  a canoe i think said wyndham and both listened  marston wanted to run up on deck but did not since his adventure on the flat had rather shaken his nerve he meant to use some control for a few moments they heard nothing and then the sliding hatch rattled as if somebody pulled it back marston thought it significant that none of the crew had challenged the stranger the hatch opened and the old mulatto came down he did not squat on the deck as he had done before but sat like a white man on the side locker  give me a drink you know my taste he said and marston noticed that he spoke good english  wyndham gave him some old brandy and he drank with leisurely enjoyment although he wore ragged and dirty cotton and his legs were bare it was obvious that rupert wyndham had now done with pretense  im your guest he said to wyndham perhaps its not good manners but id sooner mr marston left us alone  bobs my partner i think well let him stay wyndham replied all that interests me interests him  rupert shrugged it looks as if you had given him your confidence  he knows who you are  oh well said rupert you sent for me i dont know if i approve the form of the invitation you gave my servant  something like lè majesté wyndham suggested  something like that said rupert with a touch of dryness after all im king de facto in the bush  then i think you ought to be content wyndham rejoined the republic is forced to challenge a king de jure  rupert looked at him with halfclosed bloodshot eyes and marston thought his face was now like a negros after all his civilized talk and manners were a mask the fellow was a negro underneath  well talk about this again he said in a careless voice you seem to have got scrupulous since you went home is it a prudish girls influence or your partners  my wifes for the most part if you take it for granted that i agree it will clear the ground  ahsaid rupert frowning it looks as if i were foolish when i helped you to marry perhaps i forgotits long since i studied things from the white mans point of view and women dont count in the bush they are toys and dont make rules for their lovers  unless human natures different in the jungle i expect some do so marston remarked  their end is generally sudden said rupert with grim humor then he turned to wyndham i promised to make you rich have i cheated you  no in a sense you have kept your promise but for all that i was cheated my reward vanished when i got it  rupert gave him a mocking smile sometimes it happens so but this is your affair and we will not philosophize you made a bargain and got the goods for which you must pay  im willing to pay we have brought a load of stuff that has a standard value in the bush if this wont satisfy you ive paid a sum to your account at my bank you can draw it when you like  neither plan will do i dont want trade rubbish and money is not much use i need the goods i expected you to bring if you refuse to supply me you miss a chance you will not get again  im not sure that to seize the chance would be a very sound speculation wyndham rejoined in a thoughtful voice  marston looked hard at him harrys manner almost hinted that he was hesitating but this was unthinkable rupert however smiled  you are a tactful fellow you want me to state things plainly in order to persuade you well i will be frank and if i can banish your scruples so much the better we are relations and ought not to be enemies  rupert paused for a moment or two and then went on i sent you rare goodsthat sell for high prices in england but so far i have not sent you the best there are plants in the swamps for which doctors and chemists would give very much a few of my people know where they can be found but i am perhaps the only man who knows how the essences can be distilled after all i am not a magician for nothing  there is not much modern chemists do not know marston interposed  your manufacturing chemists have not got the plants said rupert dryly the finished product is scarce and valuable i have the knowledge that can bring the raw material to the distilling retorts well if i use this knowledge i make my charge and i have offered my nephew a generous share  on some conditions to which i cant agree wyndham rejoined your secret is worth money but you can use it in one of two ways you mean to smuggle the stuff into england in small quantities at a monopoly price i think the other line would pay you better ship all you can develop the trade openly and although the price will drop and you may have rivals the sums paid will be large and you will be first on the ground  rupert gave him an ironical smile you are rather obvious harry you want me to come out of my seclusion and engage in conventional trade i see drawbacks in six months english american and german buyers would overrun the country touting for business the countrys mine and my people will not let white men get control we are satisfied with the old rules and dont want tramroads clearings and factories in fact we dont mean to be exploited for the advantage of larrinagas greedy politicians whod sell the foreigners trading privileges for bribes  he stopped and drained his glass and there was silence for a minute or two wyndham understood his uncle and rather sympathized independence and liberty to follow ones bent were worth much one would not change them carelessly for the commercialism that gave a man no choice but to work by rule or starve marston however was puzzled and presently remarked  clearings would let in some light which the country needs  the light your industrial civilization gives is dim i and the others would sooner have the dark you hate the shadowy world because you do not know it i have lived in it long  how have you lived marston asked you are a white man and its plain you have unusual gifts yet youre satisfied to skulk about the swamps in dirt and rags cheating superstitious brutes by conjuring tricks the things unthinkable  rupert looked at him with the smile marston hated it was malevolent and mocked his philosophy  some of the tricks are clever they have puzzled you we will not argue whether all are tricks or not anyhow the clever impostor is a common type men who claim magic power direct your companyfloating and manipulate your politics but perhaps its among primitive people the fakir has most influence in the bush im highpriest and something of a prophet  you claim to be king said wyndham very dryly prophecys not difficult when you rather trust to knowledge your disciples havent got than inspiration no doubt you make lucky shots but royaltys another job an unacknowledged king must fight for his crown i want you to think if you hadnt better give it up  marston looking from one to the other felt the crisis had come both were calm but he thought harry was highly strung their glances were strangely keen they looked like fencers about to engage marston reflected that rupert did not know harrys new plans nor did he know peters meant to meddle  well said rupert suppose i agree what have you to offer  much i think your return to civilized life and the place where you properly belong however well be practical you can resume the partnership in wyndhams that is really yours ill give you any just share to which bob will consent and well use your knowledge as far as we can do so lawfully our business could be extended and the house ought to prosper in our joint control  rupert laughed you offer money in england it would buy no power i have not got and the things i like i have well let this go you are my nephew and perhaps you feel you must be generous but dont you think youre rash have you forgotten the years ive lived in the dark habits stick it would be embarrassing if your relation used the manners of a savage and i have idiosyncrasies that would give fastidious people a nasty jolt then since you have married what about your wife women are rather strict about conventional niceties  my wife agrees wyndham replied incautiously  to your plans for my reform then you have some plans you are so to speak missionaries well i imagine marston is fitter for the job his confidence cant be shaken and he doesnt bother about the other fellows point of view the successful missionary is a fanatic  give the thing up said marston with some sternness youre white youre english come out of the mud  rupert shrugged and turned to wyndham your partners staunch but does not use much tact can you see me ordering smart young clerks talking at an old mens club and amusing your wifes friends in a conventional drawingroom if so your imaginations vivid i cant see myself he laughed a harsh laugh in the bush i rule with power that nobody challenges  wyndham made a sign of resignation and marston owned defeat after all he had not expected to persuade the bat then the latter resumed  you refuse to supply the goods i need  yes  then why do you stay and keep your agent at the village  moreau will not stay long said wyndham and marston seeing where ruperts question led wondered how harry would account for their haunting the lagoon  we came to trade wyndham went on although i now see it wont pay to keep an agent we must clear off our stock of goods  you cant do so without my leave  i doubt this said wyndham anyhow were going to try its obvious you have some power but a firm rule generally provokes opposition and we may do some business with the dissatisfied  rupert looked hard at him you may find the experiment dangerous on the whole my servants are staunch and know the advantage of keeping out foreigners well this is your affair and since its plain we cant agree i wont stay  he got up and while marston studied him with a touch of horror he seemed to change as if he shook off the superficial civilization he had worn his lips got thick and stuck out they looked strangely red and sensual his eyes got dull and the colored veins were plainer and he rubbed one bare foot with the others flexible toes marston felt he had reverted to the old mulatto  you go dash me them bottle he said with a grin  they let him pick up the bottle of brandy he climbed the ladder and the hatch slid back there was no noise on deck and they did not hear a paddle splash but they knew he had gone marston drained his glass and looked at wyndham whose face was rather white he saw harry had got a jar and said nothing  after a few moments wyndham broke out at the last he looked a halfbreed a trick of pushing out his lips and stretching his nostrils perhaps but one feels he is a halfbreed i think he will never really be a white man again he gave no hint of regret for all that he has lost it was rather horrible to see he was content  he is content he has done with civilization said marston quietly we must remember this  wyndham nodded from now we have not to deal with rupert wyndham but with the bat to some extent it makes the job easier all the same we cant give him up to larrinaga its unlucky we could not have kept him on board  that was impossible your asking him to come implied that he was safe besides we were forced to try persuasion first well we have tried whats the next plan  i have none we must wait  do you think he was satisfied with the grounds we gave for stopping i mean do you imagine he believes we merely want to trade  i dont know said wyndham moodily perhaps i made a lucky shot when i talked about our trading with the opposition i imagine it touched him looks as if there was an opposition then i dont suppose he knows peters is on our track and his well in the meantime we must use patience and trust our luck  he went up on deck and marston went to bed for a time he heard wyndhams restless tread on the planks above him and then he went to sleep     chapter iv  wyndham finds a clew   a few days after ruperts visit to the schooner a quantity of cargo arrived the goods were not valuable but the owners were satisfied with the payment wyndham told his agent to offer and marston was surprised they had got a load at all  its strange said wyndham thoughtfully when they lounged under the awning while the negroes unloaded the canoes of course the bat may have allowed the stuff to come down for reasons that are not very plain on the other hand its possible some of the halfbreeds dont yet own his rule since this might be important id rather like to know but dont see much chance of our finding out  marston noted that harry called rupert the bat but he agreed rupert was no longer a white man all the same he was harrys relation  i imagine our chance of finding out anything useful here is very small he rejoined  then suppose we take the cargo across for transshipment and see if we can pick up a clew at the other end wyndham suggested if we knew something about larrinagas plans it might help  although the schooner was not halfloaded marston agreed any excuse was good that took him away from the lagoon and at noon next day columbine went to sea the voyage to the white town was short and on the evening of their arrival marston lounged contentedly on the arcade in front of his hotel a full moon shone above the flat roofs the hotel was lighted and the glow from the windows touched the pavement beyond the pillars citizens enjoying the cool of the evening crowded the streets and sometimes stopped at the small tables to drink a glass of wine on the opposite side of the street the straightfronted houses threw a dark shadow the band of the cazadores regiment played on the plaza  wyndham was talking to a gentleman from whom his agent bought goods don luis came to town to gamble at the casino and marston had met him before  you must come and see my finca he said there are ducks on the marsh and you english are fond of sport  marston said he would be pleased to go if they stopped long enough and then letting wyndham carry on the talk watched the passersby after a few minutes a big muscular negro entered the belt of light and marston glanced at him with some surprise  theres pepe he exclaimed  he doubted if the negro heard him through the clink of glasses and hum of talk but it looked as if he saw his quick movement for he turned his head and went behind a group at a table  somebody like him said wyndham carelessly and when marston looked back across the street the negro had vanished  people moved about and marston imagined he had retired into the gloom where one could not distinguish him from the others pepe was the pilot at the lagoon a goodhumored fellow whom they had generally given a small present besides his pay as a rule he did not wear much clothes on board but he was now rather neatly dressed in white cotton and his hat was good on the caribbean coast men spend large sums on their hats it looked as if pepe was getting rich but marston could not imagine why he did not want to be seen he was going to talk about this when he caught wyndhams eye and he lighted a cigarette  my partner is a good shot wyndham said to their companion we will be occupied for two or three days but perhaps after that  don luis fixed a day for their visit and when he went off marston turned to wyndham  it was pepe he declared  yes i saw him i think he was with the officer of the portguard  but what is he doing here and why did he step back when i turned to you  i dont know said wyndham the things interesting  marston agreed but he could suggest no explanation and they talked about don luis in the morning when the narrow streets got hot they went to the marina where the sea breeze blew among the peppertrees and palms after lounging for a time on a shady bench wyndham indicated some carpenters at work behind the mole  its too early to meet our agent lets see what those fellows are doing he proposed  they crossed a belt of shingle and found the carpenters mending a big open boat two or three other boats were drawn up close by and planks lay about when marston stopped a man who had been sitting in the shade got up and turned to him with a careless smile it was pepe the negro pilot  hallo said marston have you given up your job  not for long one likes a change the other replied  in the meantime wyndham examined the boats he knew the type which was used for taking off cargo to vessels that did not come into the harbor for their length they carried a big load and were generally propelled by four men who pulled the heavy oars doublebanked their flat bottom adapted them for use in shallow water  are you going to buy the candrays wyndham asked  pepe grinned one does not get rich by fishing and piloting it is cool here in the shade and i have not much to do  oh well said wyndham no doubt you have seen the schooner i expect well sail in about a week and we can give you a passage if you are going back  pepe said he did not mean to return yet and marston and wyndham went away  i wonder what he is doing about the boats although i dont know if it matters marston remarked  he was rather obviously loafing  id have expected to find him loafing about a secondclass wine shop  with a hat like his and new yellow boots said wyndham dryly  they may have cost him all hes got these fellows are vain all the same theres something strange about his being here and trying to pass without our seeing him last night hes frank enough this morning  he may have been making the best of it because he could not steal off before we came up  its possible although i dont see why he should want to dodge us marston replied and added thoughtfully since hes allowed to pilot vessels at the lagoon i expect hes the bats man  looks like that said wyndham i imagine he has been in africa although his castilian is not remarkably bad the english he uses on board has the true westcoast twang you might hear the words at kingston but the accents good sar leone however if hes a friend of the bats why was he going about with one of the presidents portguard  perhaps he met him at a wineshop theyre both sailors marston suggested i thought you rather went out of your way to tell him we would sail in a week  an example of instinctive caution its possible we may sail before in the meantime we wont bother about the thing  they went to the agents office and after transshipping their cargo set out one morning for don luis finca the road was bad their horses were poor and when they reached the big whitewashed mud house their host persuaded them to stop the night dinner was served at four oclock and soon afterwards don luis gave them fresh horses and they started for the marsh it got dark while they floundered through the mud and reeds but they shot some ducks as the light was going and stayed until the mosquitoes drove them off  going back they took a road that crossed a steep hillside trees in dark masses rolled down the slope and thin hot mist drifted about the trunks the moon however was full and where there was an opening in the wet leaves bright beams pierced the gloom and made pools of silver light on the ground a cloud of mosquitoes followed them and marstons horse was fresh he was not used to the big stirrups and wide spanish saddle and now and then found it hard to hold the animal by and by a regular throbbing noise came up the hill and he turned to don luis  it sounds like soldiers marching he said  don luis pulled up it is soldiers a battalion of cazadores occupies the old mission if we could go another way it would be better but there is no road up the hill  the road was bad and narrow there would not be much room for the soldiers to pass and marston imagined this accounted for don luis wanting to turn off  they keep the troops a long way from the town he said  the old mission makes a good barracks don luis replied besides this is the presidents own battalion they are very loyal while their pay is regular and made disturbances in the town wrecking the wine shops where there was revolutionary talk  they rode on and when the tramp of feet got louder marston asked do the cazadores often drill in the dark  once they scarcely drilled at all said don luis laughing however since ramon larrinaga became the presidents friend they drill them much with german officers in command recently the drilling has got harder and one wonders why this is and whether it means something all the same i am a supporter of the presidents and if he is satisfied  the measured tramp was now very close and the creak of leather and rattle of straps and slings came out of the gloom marston thought he could hear the labored breath of men toiling up hill then a hoarse challenge rang out and his horse plunged across the road  hold him said wyndham sharply and two or three men with glittering bayonets came into the moonlight that shone between the trees  a picket or advance guard wyndham resumed get down bob you mustnt let the brute go  marstons horse reared and tried to turn from the shining steel but he got his foot out of the awkward stirrup and swung himself from the saddle the others dismounted and the soldiers led them off the road and then stood on guard  i do not know if we are arrested don luis remarked with a shrug one must use patience but i am not without some influence and expect apologies when the officers arrive  when he had quieted his horse marston lighted a cigarette and leaned against a tree for a few yards the moonlight shone upon the road and when the first fours of the leading platoon crossed the illuminated belt he was surprised the cazadores were short darkskinned men their sloped rifles wavered at different angles and their march was slouching but they carried complete field equipment pouches messtins tools and bandoliers it was the first time he had seen the republican soldiers in regular marching order  your government has been extravagant he said to don luis  don luis spread out his hands it is these germans somebody will have to pay and the country is poor perhaps it is well to pay the soldiers but one need not spend money on equipment until there is risk of war  then there is no risk of war just now wyndham interposed  i know of none i cannot see why we should quarrel with our neighbors and although the negroes are turbulent in the back country one leaves them alone the germans have led us into extravagance señor all must be efficient and worked on a plan they do not understand us we are not machines like them  he stopped for one of the guards roughly ordered the party farther back into the wood from their new position they could not see much sloped rifles tossed and wavered across the opening in the trees steel bands and swivels shone in the moon and one distinguished shadowy figures going by after a time the measured tramp got fainter and rolled up the hill and the beat of horses feet came out of the gloom the soldier who had driven the party back went to the road and his voice reached the others then he ordered them to advance and they saw two or three mounted officers in the moonlight one sat stiff and motionless and asked a few sharp questions in uncouth castilian after which he turned to a companion  they say they are sportsmen and the fellow in the cloak claims to be well known the others look like foreigners i will leave you to talk to them don maccario  ah said don luis now the thing resolves itself  the other officer pushed his horse forward and then laughed it is you my friend well perhaps we ought to make our apologies but we are being trained on the german model and you are not as discreet as usual  is one forbidden to look at the soldiers for whom one must pay don luis asked  one is not encouraged when they marched at night the other rejoined dryly  i and my friends come back from shooting and there is no other road what must we do it is well known that i am a staunch supporter of the presidents and a friend of don ramons however you can see the ducks and our guns  it is not necessary do you know don ramon is at the mission i think he means to breakfast with you tomorrow but who are your friends  don luis presented wyndham and marston and after greeting them politely the officer let the party go they rode on down the hill and don luis grumbled  i am staunchly for the government the thing was ridiculous i do not see why they hide our soldiers it is some german plan we will talk about it to don ramon if he comes in the morning  when they reached the finca and wyndham and marston were alone for a few minutes the former said perhaps its lucky we came here because i think i have found a clew i expect you noted they tried to keep the drilling and equipping of the presidents battalion a secret  it looks like that said marston still i dont see what it implies  for one thing it implies they want a small highlyefficient striking force the force is obviously to be used these fellows dont study efficiency for its own sake  but why dont they want people to know  i think thats rather plain theres an advantage in striking before your antagonist is ready and the citizens of this country have some talent for political intrigue plot and counter plot are always going on i dont imagine the president altogether trusts his friends  ah said marston i begin to see  he stopped and when don luis came up talked about the shooting     chapter v  don luis breakfast party   one got up early at the finca buenavista and when they had been given some black coffee and a small hard roll wyndham and marston went to a bench in the patio the house was built in a hollow square and its occupants used the patio when the rooms were hot one wall was pierced by arches opening to the kitchen and stable outside stairs balconies and windows with green shutters broke the straight front of the others in places purple masses of bougainvillea glowed against the ochre wash and beyond the flat roof a steep hill darkly green with foliage rolled up against a background of distant mountains in the middle of the square a pepper tree stretched its thin branches across a marble fountain in which shining water splashed the finca dated back to days when the country prospered under spanish rule  wyndham lighted his pipe and looked thoughtful when he began to smoke  if larrinaga is curious about us he will come to breakfast he said since i think we can take this for granted we had better choose our line  why do you think he is curious marston asked  to begin with i doubt if hes persuaded our object for stopping at the lagoon is to carry on an ordinary lawful trade we have some grounds for imagining peters has not told him the bat is my relation but i expect he knows we could not get much cargo without the bats consent then its possible he has heard about our examining the boats and now we are found watching the secret maneuvers of his troops its pretty obvious whom they are to be used against  marston nodded ive been pondering this they could put three or four platoons of cazadores on board the old gunboat and land them where they are wanted in the cargo lighters in fact if it was fine weather the governments tug could tow them all the way thats why larrinaga brought the pilot over the question is what ought we to do about it do you mean to warn the bat  not yet said wyndham thoughtfully if he got warning soon enough he would probably be able to make a good fight although i dont imagine he could win a number of the soldiers would be killed we dont want this  marston agreed their business was not to take a side indeed it was unthinkable that they should help either party all the same he was puzzled because since they could not allow the bat to be captured and shot something must be done after a moment or two wyndham resumed  i have a halfformed plan we must find out where the soldiers will land and when theyll start then we must get across before them and take the bat the news while they are marching through the bush it will not matter if his spies bring him word a few hours sooner this will bear out our tale but our arrival must be carefully timed  yes said marston and pondered  harrys plan was vague but on the whole it was good the bat must be taken by surprise without time being given him to organize a defense then he might be forced to surrender not to the soldiers but to his relation and they must try to smuggle him on board the yacht the scheme however needed to be carefully worked out  you are reckoning on his not being ready to fight he said  wyndham gave him a curious smile that is so you ought to see why he is not ready because to some extent you are accountable negroes and halfbreeds armed with cutlasses and a few old guns cant stand up against welldrilled troops the bat has been embarrassed by not getting the material he expected us to bring  of course said marston awkwardly well how are we to find out when the troops will sail  i dont know so far we have been lucky we must trust our luck again  suppose all goes as you expect and the bat sees a struggle would be useless and gives himself up to us what are we going to do with him  thats perhaps the worst puzzle said wyndham dryly we must try to solve it when it comes its possible however the bat may solve it for us  marston smoked for a time glancing sympathetically at wyndham who knitted his brows then bob said to begin with we have got to bluff larrinaga and he is not a fool how do you mean to satisfy him  on the whole i think ill leave the job to you wyndham replied and his eyes twinkled when he saw marstons surprise don ramons a good judge of character and would think a little embarrassment on your part rather natural youre not the stuff romantic conspirators are made of and our being partners will imply much however theres a drawback he mustnt think i have cheated and am using you  then im to look simple and trustful but not altogether a fool you give me a hard part i doubt if i can play it marston grumbled  you mustnt try to play a part said wyndham firmly be frank where you can but dont talk too much theres a thing may help us don ramon will be careful not to hint our seeing the boats and the soldiers in field equipment is important  oh well said marston gloomily ill be glad when breakfasts over  about eleven oclock two servants began to spread a table under the pepper tree where the shadow of a projecting balcony stretched across the broken flags soon afterwards don luis looking hot and slightly disturbed entered the patio with larrinaga and a thin darkfaced gentleman who wore plain white clothes marston however noted that his hat and silk belt were remarkably good and thought he had somewhere seen his portrait only the man had then worn a handsome uniform bob got up as the strangers advanced and wyndham taking off his hat gave him a quick glance marston felt he was warned to brace himself  my poor house is honored today don luis remarked our illustrious president will breakfast with us  the president smiled urbanely and don luis presented his guests wyndham saw and frankly returned larrinagas twinkle but he felt some strain and hoped bob would take the proper line if as he thought he understood don ramon the latter had perhaps hinted they would sooner breakfast unceremoniously in the patio wyndham afterwards found this supposition correct the stage was so to speak properly set the light was strong and a row of windows commanded the table nothing indicated plot or secrecy the party would meet without reserve and engage in careless talk  i did not know his excellency was at the mission or i might have ventured to offer him hospitality don luis remarked when the president was served  nobody knows said the latter smiling now and then i neglect my duties and steal away from town i can trust my officers when they do not know i have gone a president has some cares and perhaps deserves a holiday besides i like to watch my soldiers drill  wyndham imagined the president had thought it prudent to account for his visit to the mission and admitted that the statement was plausible he said that so far as he could judge the cazadores were excellently drilled  i understand it was dark when you saw them the president replied however if soldiers interest you and i am not recalled to town you and señor marston must come and see them at the morning parade  i hope we did not break your rules last night said marston perhaps i ought to have pulled up sooner but my horse was fresh and got out of control then i was not used to the saddle and stirrups i do not ride much  señor marston is a sailor what the english call a yachtsman larrinaga interposed for him sport means the sea his taste is strange but some of his countrymen are like that if i were rich i would sooner amuse myself at the casino  then our friend is rich the president remarked but i rememberthese gentlemen paid some duties our officers neglected to collect it is a thing that does not often happen in this country since señor marston is both rich and honest he has my felicitations however we owe him and don luis some apologies he turned to the others i hope you were not treated roughly but our new officers are very strict and use all military caution  wyndham laughed we make no complaint but surely even a german officer could not imagine three or four men with shotguns meant to attack a battalion of soldiers as brave and disciplined as yours we would much like to see them in the daylight  if i am allowed to stop at the mission we will fix a time the president said graciously  is not the mission an awkward spot for a barracks wyndham asked it is a long way from the town and the road is bad  it is lonely and quiet ours is a small country and we have jealous neighbors one must take precautions but since spies are numerous it is not prudent to display our readiness to fight when one wants peace one does not go about with a fine new pistol in ones belt  wyndham agreed the presidents explanation was plausible and his humorous frankness calculated to banish doubt but wyndham was not deceived moreover he thought larrinaga was watching him larrinagas object for bringing the president was plain he wanted his master to see the men he had allowed to trade at a spot where the bat would try to get supplies wyndham felt that he and marston were being closely examined then the president turned to marston  since i am told you came from africa in your little ship it looks as if you are a keen sailor  i love the sea said marston simply there is no other sport like sailing  the president shrugged and pushing back his plate gave marston a cigar  it is a love that needs cultivation when i go to sea i am very ill then one understands you others have comfortable yachts to go to sea in a trading boat is another thing  all the same one is at sea marston replied besides in a sense a yacht is a toy and when you have sailed about for a time you begin to feel it is playing and does not lead to much he paused and resumed apologetically yachting is not serious if you understood i expect my castilian is very bad  the president smiled and wyndham thought his look of puzzled amusement was well done he was satisfied with his comrades reply bob was not playing up he was sincere the others would recognize this  the english are a serious people the president remarked but go on my friend i am not bored  well said marston when i got tired of playing i saw how i could make my yachting useful i thought i could earn some money then harry i mean señor wyndham he stopped and gave wyndham an apologetic glance  he means he wanted to help me wyndham interposed  to earn money is certainly useful the president observed and turned to wyndham your partner is a very scrupulous gentleman he would not rob me and feels that he must use his talents but you do not go to sea altogether because you like it  i am a merchant and live by trade i am forced to earn money  then i hope you will earn enough to pay us our duties and i expect don ramon will help you when he can said the president i am sorry we have no ships to show señor marston because we are too poor to build a navy yet we have an old gunboat and a big new tug i do not know why we bought the tug but the captain of the portguards uses her to travel about the coast  he paused and got up now i must go back to the mission if it is possible you shall see our soldiers and if not i may perhaps come to see your ship  larrinaga and don luis went off with him and marston drained his glass  thats done with he remarked with keen relief after all it was easier than i thought but i got a knock when i saw the fellow was the president don luis is a staunch supporter of his and perhaps he imagined breakfasting with him would be a cheap reward presidents and such people do things like that  its possible but i doubt said wyndham dryly  then suppose he came to study us do you think he feels we might be dangerous  i imagined he feels he neednt bother about you id much like to know what he thinks about me  oh well said marston he didnt push me hard and i got a part i could play im on firm ground so long as i can talk about boats all the same when you come to think of it if the fellow wanted to study us the things ominous the countrys not big but hes its head and i dont know if presidents are often polite to traders  exactly said wyndham we must be careful anyhow we have found out something they dont want us to think they suspect us or that their drilling the soldiers is important theyre clever but their frankness was overdone however we must start for the port when don luis returns     chapter vi  a sail in the dark   columbines gig rubbed against the landing steps and wyndham and marston lounged about the end of the mole the sun had sunk behind a high black range and the landbreeze had begun to blow in gentle gusts that crisped the greasy water and dropped again when the crew were trimming ballast in the hold a man shouted that some chain wyndham had ordered had arrived and he and marston pulled the gig to the steps after putting the chain on board they strolled to the town where they drank a glass of wine and bought a newspaper and then went back to the mole for the last few nights they had slept on board but it was early in the evening and the top of the wall was cooler than the deck of the yacht besides a spanish liner was steering for the port and they waited to watch her passengers land  presently wyndham looked up from the newspaper its lucky we bought the diario it declares the report that the sta catalina mission was recently plundered is not confirmed  isnt that father sebastians station marston asked  wyndham nodded a few mud huts and a small thatched church still it belongs to a famous order and pious folk no doubt sent gifts because the diarios remarks indicate that the virgins jewels were supposed to have been stolen if this is true the things significant the most part of the people here are pretty staunch catholics  but the newspaper states the report is not confirmed  it is not denied said wyndham meaningly i imagine the government had given the editor a hint you see the desecration of a church by negroes would rouse the citizens feelings and lead to a popular demand for swift punishment if the president complied the bat would know about it and the republicans would lose the advantage of surprise all the same they must strike soon because the bat will now get ready  then why do you think he let his people rob the mission  i dont think he did so perhaps some were too keen and got out of control perhaps some meant to force larrinaga to put him down theyre a treacherous lot and given to intrigue however theres another bit of news the gunboat campeador has gone into anagas damaged after stranding and will need extensive repairs i expect this is true because folks at anagas could see the boat  its important marston declared if the gunboats damaged don ramon cant use her to carry his troops still i suppose the government tug could tow them along the coast on board the lighters they are overhauling her at san cristobal looks as if we had better find out when theyll finish the job  wyndham nodded san cristobal was some distance off a small town with a good harbor where there was a foundry and a coaling wharf yet it would be dangerous to make open inquiries about the tug or to visit the place because wyndham had grounds for imagining they were watched indeed one of the portguards was lounging near them when a whistle screamed he looked up and saw the liner circle outside the mole foam broke about her side as the screw turned astern a row of lights flashed into brightness and big electric hatch lamps blazed up on deck she stopped the anchor splashed and the doctors noisy launch went off then the yellow flag came down and shore boats crowded about the ship  it was nearly dark when the returning boats pulled towards the mole a steamer was anchored near the entrance and columbine rode between her and the wall leaving a narrow channel through which the boats must pass when the first was close by wyndham glanced carelessly at the passengers but after a few moments his glance got fixed among the row of faces there was one he thought he knew and as the boat drew level with him he clenched his fist  look at the third man in the sternsheets bob he said  marston looked and started its peters this is going to make things awkward the brute has lost no time dyou think he knows were here  he knows columbine said wyndham i imagine he sees her peters turned his head and his movements indicated that he was talking to the sailor who rowed on the thwart in front  that is enough marston remarked hell try us again in the morning and if were firm hell see what he can do with larrinaga we are going to be firm i wont buy off the brute  then we had better get to sea but we must find out about the tug before we start on the whole i think well get about it now  marston was surprised san cristobals a long way off and i dont know if we could hire horses then i doubt if we could return by noon tomorrow and one of the portguards might board columbine in the morning larrinaga would guess our object if he found out where wed gone  exactly said wyndham we cant go by road but the gig is here and wed shorten the distance by sailing across the bay in fact if were lucky we ought to have an hour or two to look about and then get back by daybreak the landbreeze will soon blow fresh a fair wind both ways  by george said marston the thing can be done  running down the steps they pushed off the gig she was a wellbuilt boat twenty feet long and on the african coast marston had got a fanti carpenter to fit her with a centerboard she carried a big sail when she had a crew on board and now the heavy chain would make good ballast when they had got a compass a lantern and some food from columbine they pulled off among some shore boats going to the liner and vanished into the darkness round her stern  if the portguard saw us hed reckon we meant to board the mailboat but its possible he didnt pick us out from the others wyndham remarked well the breeze is freshening lets put up the mast  they were occupied for some minutes and then wyndham sat down at the tiller and the gig leaning over gathered speed marston had had the lugsail and jib made in england by a famous yachtchandler and the boat was fast foam piled up at her lee bow lapped the gunwale at her waist and boiled round her stern the breeze came down in gusts from the high land and now and then the boat listing sharply shipped some water wyndham might have avoided this by slackening the sheet but he held on to the rope and kept his course although the night was dark he could see the hills against the sky and for a time he followed the coast then when the shore curved back in a wide bay he told marston to put the compass on the thwart and light the lantern  get out the baler and bucket afterwards he said theres room enough for the wind to knock up the sea and shell take some water on board as we reach across times valuable and we must hold her to it without shortening sail  marston crouched behind the lifted weather gunwale and lighted the lantern then he saw that halyards and sheets were clear and afterwards pulled up the wellboard in the stern flooring sitting down with the baler in his hand by the hole he waited and looked about the sea began to break as they drew out from the land showers of spray beat into the hollow of the jib and the splashes that blew across the weather bow got heavier the wind was not as they had hoped abeam but a point or two ahead and marston lowered the centerboard which jolted in its trunk when she plunged she was not shipping much water yet and he wondered whether he could light his pipe then wyndham said look out  a white comber rose to windward there was a thud and jib and short bowsprit vanished a white cloud hid the mainsail and foaming water flooded aft as he used the baler marston heard the sheetblocks rattle wyndham was easing her while he threw the water out it was hard to fill the bucket because the flood washed to and fro but he knew the job was urgent he was wet and breathless when he looked up  a nasty one he gasped  heres another said wyndham and flying water whipped marstons face  after this he was kept occupied sometimes he used the bucket and sometimes the baler for water came on board fast now and then he imagined wyndham slackened the sheet to ease a plunge that might swamp the boat but this was harrys business and he must not neglect his balancing himself against the lurching he scooped up the splashing flood when a gust heeled the boat over it gained on him and then as the pressure slackened he held his own but while he used his best efforts he could not bale her dry at length when his arms ached and he was very wet he stopped for a few moments  dont know if i can keep it up for long im horribly cramped he said cant we drop the lug and tie in a reef  i doubt if shed hold her course with sail shortened wyndham replied the breeze has drawn another point ahead and well lose time we cant spare if were forced to tack stick it out bob well get smoother water when we pick up the land again  he stopped and jerked the tiller a moment too late for a sea came over the bow the water foamed about marstons knees the lantern went out and he thought he felt the compass strike his legs  bale said wyndham sharply shell capsize if she ships another before you get this lot out  marston did his best while the lantern and compass washed against the bucket there was no use in stopping to pick them up since he could not get a light and harry was now steering by the wind he must keep her as near it as she would point until they crossed the bay and found the land again marston hoped this would be soon for some time he did not look up and afterwards wondered how wyndham kept her afloat but at length the plunges got easier and the water did not come on board so fast by degrees he got it under and stopping to stretch his cramped limbs looked to windward the sea was smoother and the breeze not so fresh there was a vague dark line not far off and he knew they were approaching the beach  well be round the point in a few minutes said wyndham bale her dry and then look out for the red light at san cristobal  soon after he stopped baling marston saw a red twinkle the gig was sailing very fast swaying down and recovering buoyantly as the gusts came and went the lugyard bent in a strained curve and showers of spray blew into the sail marston stooping behind the gunwale managed to strike a match and told wyndham the time when he had looked at his watch  we have made a good run but shell beat it going back when well have the wind a point or two aft he added this ought to give us an hour or perhaps an hourandahalf at the port  it will be enough unluckily the tide is ebbing yet and although theres not much rise and fall i dont know if we can both leave the boat it would be awkward if she grounded and we couldnt shove her off  marston nodded the gig was heavy and he doubted if they could launch her down a beach it would be risky to tie her to landing steps because the portguards watched the harbors at night vessels were not allowed to enter after dark yet he did not want to be separated from harry  in the meantime they were fast coming up with the light and when a high dark wall ran out in front wyndham luffed the boat and they lowered sail and took down the mast marston sculled her past the wall and the narrow harbor opened up a few anchor lights swung languidly inside and the indistinct dark shape of a steamer shut out part of the wall when they got near her marston stopped sculling  the repairing slip is up at the top by the foundry he said i expect the brigantine to starboard has a rope out if we try to get across we might make a splash if we go the other side well pass close under the steamers rail shes a pretty big boat theyll have a sereno on board and keep harbor watch if somebody hailed us it might bring the portguard  wyndham nodded and for a few moments they looked about the harbor was long and narrow for the most part the town at its end was dark but two or three big electric lamps threw a silver gleam across indistinct masses of foliage marston thought these were trees on the marina at the waters edge if so the faint light lower down came from the office of the portcaptain turning to the wall abreast of the gig he imagined he saw some steps  perhaps you had better land me and wait while i try to find the tug he said i ought to get back in an hour  the awkward part is going along the mole wyndham replied youll have to pass two or three vessels and somebody may speak to you this must be risked one way but instead of coming back it might be prudent to cross the land end of the mole and join me on the beach in front of the marina theres not much surf to bother us but it will make some noise and if anybody is about you wont be heard  marston agreed and sculling to the steps jumped out he pushed off the gig and wyndham picked up the oar in another few moments the boat vanished in the dark     chapter vii  the tug   when he had climbed the steps marston stopped now he had started on his adventure he saw its difficulties to begin with he must pass two or three vessels and the lights that burned on the steamer touched the mole she came from cadiz and spanish passenger boats carried a sereno whose particular duty was to keep watch at night marston was afraid the man might hail him although he had laboriously studied castilian he did not speak it well and his accent would indicate that he was a foreigner if the sereno were curious and kept him talking the portguard might come up anyhow there was some risk of his meeting the latter and he would then be asked to account for his wandering about in the dark it was obvious that he could not do so satisfactorily and there was a telephone to the government office at the capital  marston doubted if larrinaga could imprison him for spying but it did not matter much if he were found at san cristobal don ramon would know his object and would not let him go until he had sent off his soldiers to put down the bat if the latter were not warned he would probably be surprised and captured this was unthinkable and marston saw he must not be caught although to run away from the portguard might lead to his getting shot the fellows carried pistols which they were empowered to use caution was plainly needed and he crept past the steamer keeping close to the high parapet of the mole  nobody hailed him and he went on until he came opposite a small marque she had no lights but as he stole by his foot struck a mooring rope and he fell he lay flat on the ground for some moments and then hearing no movement on board got up and crept away looking out for the next rope the mole was long and he had not gone far when he heard the splash of oars a boat came out of the dark and a break in the wall indicated a row of steps marston did not want to turn back and it was possible the men were going to one of the vessels if they were going to the town he had better get past the steps before they landed a pile of goods forced him to leave the gloom of the parapet and it looked as if his figure cut against the sky for the splash of oars stopped  ola compañero somebody shouted  marston saw he must trust his luck and asked gruffly que quiere  the man said they were coming to let go a schooners rope but he might throw it down and marston dragged the heavy warp to the edge  cojele he said in a hoarse voice and threw down the rope  he imagined it fell upon the others heads for somebody said mal rayo esta borracho  then the boat pulled away and marston went on if the fellows thought him drunk so much the better this would account for his brevity and uncouth accent he wondered whether the shouting had excited the portguards curiosity but although he stopped to listen he heard nothing  byandby he got near the end of the mole and distinguished the repairing ship which ran down obliquely to the water the trees on the marina rose behind it touched in places by the glow from two big electric lamps and a blurred dark mass cut against the illumination this was no doubt the tug and he wondered rather anxiously whether the crew were on board stopping where the gloom was deepest he looked carefully about  the tugs bow rose high above him but he doubted if the tide had left her stern so far as he could feel with his feet the stones were covered by broken shells and he smelt paint in the tropics the bottom of an iron vessel soon gets crusted with shells and weed and it looked as if the crew had scraped the boat when the plates were clean they would paint her with redoxide before applying the antifouling coat it was important for him to find out which they had put on because since they could only work at lowwater this might mean a difference of a day or two in the time needed to finish the job all the same he could not take it for granted that she would be ready for sea when the last coat was dry he understood her engines were being overhauled and must ascertain if the work were done  marston moved lower down the inclined slip the tug was a big propeller boat and rested upright on heavy shores when he was level with the engineroom he saw a ladder against her side and his foot struck something that tinkled stooping down he felt about and found a number of short tubes some of which had torn ends they had obviously come from the condenser and retubing a condenser might be a long job it looked as if he would have to get on board but to begin with he had better see how far the men had gone with the painting  he rubbed his hand along the plates although they were pretty smooth this did not tell him much and he got no plainer hint when he used his nose there was a strong smell of paint but he could not tell if it was the priming coat or the antifouling that would finish the work perhaps he could find the drum that had held the paint and he began to feel about as he moved down the slip he had not gone far however when he trod on a piece of iron that tilted up and dropped with a sharp rattle to continue the search might be dangerous and he stopped and listened  all was quiet on board the tug the trees on the marina tossed in the wind and the surf rumbled behind the mole a clinking noise came up the harbor and marston imagined the men whose rope he had thrown down were getting ready to go to sea at sunrise vessels were not allowed to leave or enter port in the dark this reminded marston that it was some time since he had left wyndham and they must reach the schooner before daybreak  he went back up the slip hoping he might be able to see the tugs deck now he was on higher ground he noted a faint and rather puzzling illumination behind her bulwarks its position indicated that it came from the engineroom and he imagined the skylight was open but somebody had thrown a tarpaulin across the frames the hinged lights opened from the bottom and perhaps the engineer wanted to dry his paint and yet keep the heavy dew off the machinery anyhow since there was a light in the engineroom one could see below  marston hesitated at the bottom of the ladder it would be very awkward if he were caught on board the tug but he must find out if she were ready for sea and he wore light rubbersoled deck shoes the ladder was not fastened for the top began to slip along the plates when he climbed and he was forced to reach up and seize the rail next moment he stepped cautiously down on deck nobody seemed to have heard him and all was dark but for the glow from the skylight which only shone for a few feet on the damp planks as marston made for the engineroom his foot struck an iron drum and he stopped it was a paintdrum but he must discover if it were empty and what paint the crew had used  he tilted the drum and its lightness indicated that there was not much inside then he turned it round carefully until he could see the brass label on the top the letters were obscured by paint but he distinguished jesand was satisfied he knew the famous antifouling composition the crew had put on the last coat and so far as her being painted went the tug was ready for sea now he must look at her engines and he put back the drum its rim jarred on the deck and marston thought he heard a movement below stooping down he looked under the tarpaulin and got something of a shock  a man stood on the floor plates in the engineroom with his face turned up towards the skylight as if he had been disturbed marston could not see him well because the bars of the top platform were in the way but the fellow carried a small bright piece of steel and a ball of waste it looked as if he had been cleaning a valvespindle and his working at night was significant marstons heart beat but after a few moments the other seemed to be satisfied and sitting down on a locker picked up a file  when the fellow bent his head over his work marston glanced carefully about the engineroom he saw the condenser the cover was on which indicated that the repairs were finished a chain tackle hung from the beams above the cylinders and some nuts lay about their heads the pistons had obviously been lifted in order to put on new rings other things marston noted implied that the engines had been given a thorough overhaul he thought the work was nearly completed but when one examined a vessels engines the boiler was generally opened and he crept cautiously to the stokehold  the ladder came up to a grating on deck and when he had gone down half way he struck a match he could see the manhole the cover had recently been taken off and replaced for smears of redlead marked the joint and marston went cautiously back to the deck he knew all he wanted to know the tug had been put in firstrate order as if in preparation for some important work and he thought she could be floated off after another tide he must now rejoin wyndham as soon as possible so far he had been lucky but when he went to the rail it looked as if his luck had turned  a man singing lustily crossed the marina and his hoarseness implied that he was returning from a carouse as he passed the portcaptains office somebody hailed him and marston heard him answer fogonero  there was a short colloquy that seemed to get abusive and then somebody said vaya al diablo  the man laughed and came on unsteadily towards the mole he was a ships fireman and marston who did not want to meet him hoped he was not making for the tug after a few moments he fell down and marston thought he kicked something savagely when he got up his figure was now faintly distinguishable and it was plain that he meant to board the tug marston crawled round the skylight and crouched against the bulwarks on the other side a rope ran across the rail and he tried to feel if its end was fast the rope might help him to reach the ground  then the awkward steps stopped at the tug and the ladder shook its upper end slipped and a noise below indicated that the fireman had fallen off  pancho panchito he shouted come out and help little parrot  marston heard the engineer clatter across the iron platforms and cross the deck so far as marston could understand his remarks were grossly rude but the other interrupted  what is a small bottle of caña to a fireman it is the ladder that is drunk if you will not hold it little parrot i must sleep in the cold  to judge by the noise they made pancho seized the ladder while the other scrambled up he jumped on deck laughing boisterously a door shut and when the mens feet rattled on the platform bars in the engineroom marston crawled across the deck he found the top of the ladder but had only gone down a few steps when it slipped across the side and threw him off although he did not fall far the ladder struck the ground with a crash and he lay down in the gloom under the tugs bilge  after waiting for a few moments he saw the others were not coming back on deck and he got up and stole along the slip crossing the mole with a few quick steps he climbed the parapet and dropped to the stones on the other side when he had gone a hundred yards along the beach he whistled softly and although the gravel rolled about in the languid surf heard wyndhams answer then the gigs white hull appeared indistinctly among the streaks of foam and he plunged into the backwash as a wave recoiled seizing the gigs bow he pushed her off and got on board while wyndham sculled her round for two or three minutes they let her drift offshore and then stepped the mast and hoisted sail  well said wyndham did you find the tug  marston related his adventures and added i expect theyll float her off next tide but some of the small jobs i noted would hardly be finished then shell have to coal fill her tanks and get up steam in fact i dont imagine she could start until sometime after dark tomorrow five or six lighters were lying near the slip  shell no doubt bring them across said wyndham thoughtfully i expect the skipper will go halfspeed across the bay well suppose she arrives in the morning the seabreeze will freshen as the sun gets high and towing the loaded boats would be dangerous in broken water perhaps we can take it for granted the troops wont leave until its dark at night theyd get smooth water because the winds off the land this means we have about fortyeight hours warning but slack the jib sheet a little our first jobs to get on board by daybreak  as they opened up the bay the sea got rougher but the wind was on the gigs quarter and they let her go she rolled on the angry combers and the boom that stretched the lugsails foot tossed up if she fell off much and the sail lurched across the shock would capsize her or carry away the mast wyndham however held her straight and she drove on with curling foam piled about her side it was a wild run and they were glad when they got near the land again and found shelter the sea was smooth now and the breeze moderate although it blew in gusts that heeled the boat and set the water splashing against her planks once or twice wyndham made marston strike a match and look at his watch  we may get in but we have not much time to spare he said at length  the breeze fell and the boat rose nearly upright marston put out an oar and began to pull for when he looked east the sky was getting pale the gig was sailing but the splash at the bows was faint and at times the canvas hung slack half an hour afterwards they pulled down the mast and wyndham took the other oar  a steady stroke dont force the pace but you have got to row he said  the need for speed was plain the eastern sky was clearing and the mist began to roll back from the coast marston saw a belt of surf and shadowy rocks and woods ahead a light marked the harbor mouth but it was some distance off and the gig was a heavy boat for two men to row yet they must reach port before day broke and gasping and straining they labored on after his hasty glance about marston saw nothing but wyndhams back swinging to and fro in front with a regularity that he must emulate he felt the bow lift as he dragged the heavy oar through the water then there was a faint gurgle and his heart beat as he swung forward again his hands blistered and the sweat ran into his eyes  at length wyndham said something hoarsely and a high wall washed by languid surf rose above the boat they were entering the harbor but marston dared not turn to look ahead the light was growing and the wall would guide them to columbine he must not miss a stroke because the portguard might be able to see them now three or four minutes afterwards wyndham stopped rowing and said easy let her go  marston fell forward with his oar and fought for breath his heart beat like a hammer his arms and legs trembled and he felt he had not strength to lift his head then the end of his oar struck something and they were alongside columbine rousing himself with an effort he leaned out and seized a rope wyndham got up and began to lift the mast  find the compass and lantern then help me put the gear on board he said  when the gig was empty of all but the oars they got over the schooners rail and pulled off their wet clothes in the tropics white men as a rule do not bathe in cold water but the galley fire was not lighted and wyndham filled a bucket over the side the cool brine braced them and going to the cabin they began to take out dry clothes wyndham however stopped as if listening and marston heard the splash of oars  pyjamas i think said wyndham somebodys coming  as they put on their pyjamas the oars stopped close by and a man shouted  one of us will be enough wyndham resumed look as sleepy as you can  marston went up with his pyjamas half buttoned and leaned on the rail it was daylight for on the caribbean dawn comes swiftly at about six oclock a boat carrying two men in the portguards uniform floated a few yards off marston thought they were looking at the gig and he waited in keen suspense  a note from señor larrinaga said one  don ramon gets up early marston remarked with a yawn and when the man gave him the note added wait a minute  opening the envelope he went to the cabin and said to wyndham we are asked to breakfast at the mission and see the soldiers parade i imagine were expected to stop the day don ramon is sending horses theyll be ready in half an hour  well said wyndham i suppose we must go  marston gave the men a bottle of caña and sent them off then he went back and sat down limply  if we had been ten minutes longer theyd have found us out he said i dont feel up to riding far and their asking us to the mission now is awkward still i expect we couldnt sail until its dark its lucky we got our clearance papers     chapter viii  at the mission   half an hour after the boat pulled away marston and wyndham mounted the horses larrinaga had sent the mission was some distance off but breakfast would not be served until about eleven oclock and they rode slowly up the hill behind the town two soldiers followed thirty or forty yards in the rear but marston had found out that they knew no english wyndham was quiet and preoccupied  the horses are the best ive seen and i suppose don ramons sending an escort is something of a compliment marston said presently we are going to the mission like honored guests i dont know about our coming back yet we must get back tonight  we calculated the tug would sail with the lighters tomorrow after dark and we need twentyfour hours start wyndham replied it ought to be enough if the breeze is strong landing the troops will be a long job however we must not be late  marston agreed larrinaga was using every precaution to keep the dispatch of the expedition secret and no doubt hoped to surprise the bat if they were too late they might be captured with him if however they brought him warning long enough beforehand he might make a stubborn defense and this would involve them in fresh entanglements  id feel happier if i knew the presidents plans for today marston resumed  so would i said wyndham smiling i imagine they will to some extent depend on the line we take on the whole his object for sending for us is plain he wants to keep us away from the port as long as possible  if he thought we were spying for the bat he might lock us up  i think not he would then have to inform the consul and state the grounds for our arrest all the same if hes not satisfied he may tax us with cheating the customs or something of the kind and keep us until the tug has sailed in the meantime perhaps its lucky we are not about the port because i think peters wont offer his help to the government until he has seen us if larrinaga knew what peters knows we wouldnt reach the lagoon  i expect that is so said marston gloomily well it will be a big relief when all this intrigue is done with and we leave the coast for good  for the most part they were silent until they reached the mission the building was old and falling to ruin but it had a touch of stateliness for its foundations were laid when the spanish conquerors were influenced by the austere beauty of moorish art the front was pierced by saracenic arches that led to a cloistered walk on one side of the patio from which an outside stair went up to the officers rooms the rest of the building was plainer and was now used for a barracks palms grew round the square in front and in the background dusky forest rolled back to the mountains that cut the sky two or three companies of cazadores were drawn up in the square  the president and larrinaga received their guests at the central arch where chairs had been put in the shade there was another gentleman whom wyndham imagined belonged to the presidents cabinet and he thought the minister quietly studied him and marston it was possible señor villar had joined the party with this object if so it looked as if the others had not yet decided if they were dangerous or not  now you have arrived we will go on with the drill the president remarked afterwards señor marston will tell us what he thinks about my soldiers  my opinion is not worth much i am a sailor marston replied with some awkwardness because he thought the president was amused  you are modest the latter rejoined well we cannot ask what you think about our fleet our gunboat the campeador has stranded and this only leaves us the tug  i have seen the tug said marston and stopping for a moment went on a very fine boat she looks powerful and ought to steam fast  wyndham wondered whether the others had noted marstons pause it was not long and perhaps his frank admission would satisfy them  let us try to turn kilometers into what you call knots said the president it is a complicated sum you must help me don ramon  about twelve knots wyndham interposed when they began the calculation however you must not indulge my comrade by letting him talk about ships we came to see the soldiers  the president signed to an officer who shouted and the cazadores wheeled and formed on a new front the bands and muzzles of their rifles sparkled in the searching light and dust rolled about them as they moved they were little wiry men and although they did not drill remarkably well and their white uniforms were not clean wyndham noted that their rifles were good moreover their equipment was up to date and new  the officer shouting savagely kept the men moving about and when at length he dismissed them came back hot and sprinkled by dust with a look of disgust wyndham allowing something for the german character thought the disgust was rather marked  then you are not satisfied yet the president asked  they are your excellencys subjects the other replied with a shrug i do my best but we do not make much progress perhaps with extra drill for two or three months  the president laughed one must use patience and in this country one goes slowly besides i do not know if speed is needed he turned to wyndham now we will leave you to don arnoldo for a few minutes i promised señor villar i would examine the quartermasters books there are people who grumble about our military extravagance  he went off with the others and the officer sat down wyndham imagined him a soldier of fortune whose main object was to earn his pay for all that it looked as if he had been given a part in the plot and had played up well  i expect you find drilling these fellows a tiresome job marston said in english  it is so the other agreed the president is too ambitious i think he wastes his money his people have no military feeling they are stupid individualists and one cannot give them massconsciousness one might make them brigands but not soldiers yet i think they would fight and after all the best school for soldiers is war  you dont want a war for the sake of drilling your men marston exclaimed and the officer laughed  in my country we are no longer sentimentalists and i do not pretend to be humanitarian in the meantime there is no war and i am satisfied to draw my pay playing with soldiers is expensive and some of the people grumble but so far the pay is regular when it stops i give up my post  soon afterwards the president came back and breakfast was served behind the pillars for a time he talked to marston about the soldiers and then remarked i understand you do not stop long  our business is nearly finished and we expect to sail very soon wyndham replied now our visit to the coast is over i feel there is much for which we must thank you and don ramon  we hope your visit has been prosperous enough to bring you back villar interposed you paid us some duties all foreigners are not so honest  i expect foreigners are something of a nuisance it is strange but when one goes abroad one feels justified in breaking rules  villar smiled this is illogical have you broken our rules  not many my partner is scrupulous and if i have given way to temptation it was not from greediness  then what persuaded you  perhaps it was british impatience with other peoples regulations in a way we are rather an arrogant lot and it flatters our selfimportance to know that if we do get into trouble our consuls will probably save us from the punishment we deserve you cannot lock up a drunken british sailor without inquiries being made don arnoldos people are proud of their army but our fleet is ubiquitous  señor wyndham is frank although i doubt if he is just to himself the president remarked with a twinkle i will confess it is sometimes hard to bear with foreigners philosophically but we make the effort my country is poor and we need the trade and money they bring if we do not always love them we make allowances he paused and gave wyndham a thoughtful glance there is however one thing about which we are firm no stranger must meddle with our politics it is our monroe doctrine and is sternly enforced  a good rule wyndham agreed after all your people do not need much help from strangers they have some talent for political intrigue how many antagonistic parties have you just now  six said the president dryly they hate each other but to gain an advantage all will combine against my government moreover in this country the vote is not the only way of marking ones disapproval but we will let this go you will stop with us tonight and don ramon will give you some shooting when the evening gets cool  wyndham thought quickly he had expected something like this and it was obvious that much depended on his reply  we ought to go back he said with pretended hesitation you see we want to sail as soon as the wind is fair and must get water and stores on board it might however help if you would let us leave port at night the landbreeze would carry us some distance off the coast before it dropped when the sun got up  very well said larrinaga i will send the portcaptain orders and if you tell him when you want to sail he will let you go  wyndham allowed himself to be persuaded and soon afterwards the president went off and larrinaga took them to a shady room he said dinner would be served at four oclock and then they would go to a lake and shoot when he left them marston looked at wyndham  why did you agree to stop  i did not think there was much use in refusing their urging us to stop was an experiment if i had insisted on going theyd have known why  then dyou imagine theyd keep us by force asked marston  its possible i studied the president when i made my boast about our british citizenship he stated they would allow no meddling with their politics and he meant this anyhow if id shown him his suspicions were wellgrounded he would have found a plausible excuse for keeping columbine in port  all the same we have got to get away said marston in a resolute voice  wyndham nodded thats plain well if we go to bed soon after shooting and are lucky they wont miss us until somebody brings our early breakfast i dont know if we can get the horses now im going to sleep  he got into a hammock and marston lay down in a long chair they had been strenuously occupied all night and did not expect much rest the next nobody would bother them until dinner and although they were disturbed and anxious they went to sleep  after dinner larrinaga took them to a lake where they shot some ducks the president was occupied when they returned at dark and for a time they sat on the arcade playing cards the cards were spanish and marston could not remember their value and the rules of the game mosquitoes hovered about them the night was gloomy and very hot something in the still air made one strangely languid moreover he was tired and anxious and he did not feel much relief when villar put the cards away and they began to talk  marston suspected the others remarks were not as careless as they looked and might lead him to some awkward statements it was like fencing with a clever antagonist when all one could do was to stand clumsily on guard for the most part he left the talk to wyndham and although harry played up well marston thought the effort was difficult he wondered whether their companions saw this there was one comfort in the tropics people got up early and he imagined their hosts would not sit very long  at length larrinaga pushed back his chair time goes and my duties begin at sunrise then i think you would like to make an early start  wyndham said they must get off as soon as possible and larrinaga nodded  don arnoldo will give the necessary orders about the horses they belong to the soldiers and nobody else is allowed about the stable i believe he posts a guard at night the germans are like that and the mission is now under military rule it has drawbacks but the army is the presidents hobby and we submit  the officer laughed and said the horses would be ready soon after daybreak and when the others went off marston and wyndham climbed the outside stairs to their room  looks as if they meant to keep us don ramons hint was plain marston observed  its lucky white men dont walk much in this country wyndham replied a pasear round the plaza while the band plays is about all the exercise people take and i dont imagine anybody above the rank of a peon has ever walked from the mission to the port in fact its very possible don ramon hasnt calculated that we might set off on foot he paused and went to the window the nights dark but very calm a noise would carry we must wait for some time     chapter ix  columbine steals away   all was quiet at the mission but for the soft rustle of the palms when a puff of wind came down the hill the last light had gone out behind the narrow windows across the patio and wyndham looking at his watch got up  we must chance it now he said if all goes well we ought to reach the port two or three hours before dawn and our hosts wont miss us until the majordomo sends our breakfast  marston pulled himself together the port was a long way off and since he had left england he had not walked much but it was obvious that he must make good speed tonight opening the door quietly they stole downstairs carrying their boots and stopped for a few moments in the gloom of an arch it was very dark the palms across the square hardly showed against the sky there was a sentry on the terrace but they could not see him and waited until they heard his measured steps  when the sentry passed the arch they crept out and started across the square small stones hurt their feet but they went on as fast as possible until they heard a soft rattle of leather and jingle of steel the sentry had wheeled round at the end of his beat and was coming back and they lay down on the sand and waited until the steps receded they must reach the gloom of the trees before he turned again and they pushed on listening hard marstons heart beat and his hands trembled as he clutched his boots the measured steps stopped for a moment and then began to get louder but bob drew a deep breath when he distinguished the long branches of the palms overhead nobody could see him now  a few minutes afterwards they set off down hill at the fastest pace they could make the road was rough one could not see the holes and marston was soon wet with perspiration he had got soft in the tropics and his legs began to ache but he thought he was going nearly five miles an hour since time was valuable he must try to keep it up he had no breath to talk and wyndham said nothing with clenched hands and eyes fixed straight in front they labored on halfseen palms went by but in places the gloom was impenetrable and now and then they fell into a hole  byandby marstons boot began to gall his foot the smart got worse and sometimes he limped when he did so he dropped behind wyndham and setting his mouth tight he trod squarely one could not walk fast on the side of ones foot he must push on and bear the pain it was ridiculous that he should lose time because his boot scraped his toe yet long afterwards he remembered the effort to keep up his speed  when the first white houses of the town came out of the gloom his clothes were sticking to his skin and his wet hair was flat on his head he stopped and sat down in a dusty gutter  ive got to take off my boots theres a pavement of sorts he gasped  wyndham nodded and looked about the houses were indistinct and the sky was dark he could not see his watch but he calculated it was about four oclock and day would not break for two hours yet puffs of wind touched his wet face and he heard it in the trees behind the town they were in time but had none to waste  be quick he said were a mile from the harbor  marston got up and they set off straight and nearly blank walls now shut them in for the houses got light from the patios wyndhams steps echoed in the dark but except for this all was quiet it looked as if nobody were about a strange smell hung about the houses for the street was narrow and the landbreeze did not sweep it clean  byandby they crossed a square and kept back from a lamp at the end of another street to meet one of the armed police would be awkward for although the fellows curiosity might be appeased by a bribe to persuade him would occupy some time they met nobody but after some minutes wyndham thought it prudent to cross the alameda where shady paths wound among tall trees the gloom would hide them and from one end a dark street ran down to the harbor marston agreed and set his lips as he struggled on for the walks were covered by sharp fresh gravel stealing along the dark street they reached the mole and stopped for a moment so far as they could see the tug had not arrived and although they distinguished columbines masts against the sky she was moored to a buoy some distance from the wall wyndham had warned the crew to keep a watch but there was a risk in hailing them  one of the portguards is generally about this side of the harbor he said  they listened but only heard the sea splash against the wall and the wind in a neighboring vessels rigging the landbreeze was fresh and blew down the harbor if they could get on board it would not be long before columbine was at sea  we might swim marston suggested  i think not said wyndham theres a nasty splashing ripple that would break in our faces besides the gig would be quicker we must chance a hail  he shouted and marston clenched his fist when no answer came it was unthinkable that they should be stopped by the negligence of a sleepy lookout before long the portguard would walk up the mole and if they were not gone would take them to the captains office one must get leave to go on board because the port was closed at night  they waited for two or three minutes since wyndham dared not shout again and then a soft rattle came out of the dark marston started and thrilled  i believe thats somebody jumping into the gig he said  it is said wyndham softly and after a few moments added shes coming  they could not see the boat and she made very little noise there was no splash it looked as if somebody sculled her cautiously by and by a dark object glided out of the gloom beside the wall and they went to the steps  go back softly softly wyndham said to the indistinct figure in the stern as they got on board  in a few minutes they reached the schooner and marstons spirits rose he had done with tracks and plots now his job was straightforward moreover he knew it well  ill cast off the bow mooring he said when wyndham got on board give me a line and you can haul the chain up quietly it mustnt run through the pipe  shoving the gig forward he jumped out on the buoy then he unscrewed the shackle and fastening on the line he brought waved his hand the chain slipped gently into the water and did not make much noise when the men on board pulled it up columbine was free now and had begun to drift when marston seized her rail he made the gigs painter fast and left her alongside because the blocks on the burton tackle would clatter if they tried to hoist her in it was something to feel the schooners deck under his galled feet but there was much to be done before he could indulge his relief although they could not see the tug she might have reached the port and they must pass the threemile limit before they would be safe in the meantime columbine was drifting slowly down the harbor  we must chance hoisting the staysail wyndham remarked get it up handsomely stop if the chain clinks much  the staysail had chain halyards and marston sent a man aloft with a greaseswab for all that the halyard made some noise and the sail thrashed in the fresh breeze until they hauled the sheets and wyndham got her round columbine with a small triangle of canvas set stole down the harbor and if the portguards did not keep a keen look out she might get away  marston sitting on the bowsprit loosing the jib watched the shadowy wall move back they were passing the cuban barque and she was not far from the end of the mole columbine moved faster he heard the water ripple at her bows and the beam of the lighthouse ahead got near it was a sector light screened on one bearing and they could keep outside its illumination  in a few minutes they would clear the end of the mole and when the jib was loose marston looked aft shadowy figures moved about the deck getting the canvas ready to hoist not long since he had doubted if they could steal out of the harbor when one studied the plan coolly it looked ridiculous but they had tried and he began to hope they would succeed then he turned his head and thrilled as he saw the end of the mole slip by  hoist the outer jib said wyndham when marston joined him we must be cautious the captains launch has steam up and could catch us yet  they got to work the blocks rattled as the jib went up but the wind blew the noise away the splash at the bows was louder and wyndham waited measuring the distance from the receding mole  boomforesail he said sharply  the tall dark canvas rose and swelled columbine began to list and trailed a white line astern the mole faded and the light looked farther off  mainsail next said wyndham hoist handsomely  the winch by the mast began to clink the big sail shook and thudded while its slack folds blew out and the kroos started a wild paddling song the tension was over they were running out to sea and nobody could hear them now the song however soon got breathless it was hard to drag up the heavy canvas while she was before the wind and wyndham would not round her to he braced himself against the wheel and steered offshore for the threemile limit  they set the sail and got more wind as they left the land she rolled and foam ran level with her dipping rail the long main boom lurched up and groaned one heard the masts creak and the rigging hum her wake ran back into the dark like a white cataract  hoist gafftopsail said wyndham trim the squaresailyard  marston gave him a quick glance and then got to work he doubted if the gear would stand the strain but harry knew the boat although the krooboys looked surprised it was obvious that they trusted him it cost them a struggle to cover her with sail and she drove along almost too fast to roll a white wave stood up above her waist another curled astern and the hollow squaresail swelled like a balloon although the sea was smooth water foamed on board and spray swept the deck in savage showers the men crouched behind the bulwarks and when marston went aft he got an exhilarating sense of speed  do you want help he asked can you hold her  i think i can said wyndham with an exultant note in his voice we have sailed some hard races bob but none for a stake like this if the masts will stand she must go tonight  marston nodded looks as if we ought to win i imagine the tug is not in harbor and don ramon is comfortably persuaded were asleep at the mission when he finds were not well be a long way off i dont suppose they can march the troops to the port and embark them before its dark he paused and laughed when he resumed his promise to send the portcaptain orders to let us go if we told him when we wanted to sail was clever he knew of course we couldnt do so  he sat down on a coil of rope and lighted his pipe now the long strain was over a reaction had begun his head was heavy he felt very tired and limp showers of spray blew about and when he began to get wet he thought he would go to the cabin and study the chart it was plain that they could not leave the schooner at the lagoon besides a little mental exercise might rouse him  when he lighted the lamp he found he could not see the small figures on the chart his eyes and brain were dull for two nights and a day of effort and suspense had worn him out the coastline however was clearly marked and indicated a number of bays and inlets so far as marston could remember they were bordered by mangrove swamps with dark forest behind looking up at the compass which was fixed in the skylight and allowed the glow of the binnacle lamp to shine through he tried to calculate where wyndham was steering he could not fix the course within two or three points and presently gave it up then his head dropped forward the chart fell on the floor and sinking down on the locker cushion he fell asleep     chapter x  the bat owns defeat   at daybreak wyndham entered the cabin and wakened marston the latter yawned stretched his arms and glanced at the compass  its getting light i expect ive been asleep he said where are we heading  wyndham picked up the chart and indicated a spot this bay she has made a good run although the wind has nearly gone  you know where to find the bat i think  i have a notion wyndham replied indicating another spot some distance from the coast but come up on deck the sun will soon rise and i must try to get our bearings  marston went up the wind had dropped and was now very faint columbine carrying all the sail they could set scarcely crept across the smoothly heaving sea ahead a bank of mist hid the low coast farther back vague mountain tops rose against the pale sky in places rippling streaks lined the gray water the picture had a strangely flat and lifeless touch that reacted on marston he felt dull and shivered although it was not cold turning to the galley he saw a plume of smoke trail from the bent funnel  ill get some coffee and then well talk he said  coming back in a few minutes with a jug he sat down on the sterngratings  to begin with can you hide the boat he asked  not properly there are one or two creeks but theyd so to speak invite examination on the whole id sooner trust an open beach columbines low hull and masts wont be very distinct against a background of forest im steering for an anchorage behind some shoals  marston signed agreement larrinaga cant keep the tug searching the coast hell send her back for supplies i expect he knows how to reach the bat  its possible he has spies and the german colonel has no doubt made careful plans there are two routes east and west of the high ground and i reckon hell send the cazadores up in two columns the first will probably try to get behind the bats position  then well strike one columns line of march said marston thoughtfully in fact since we must come back well strike it twice  yes i see some advantage in this our taking their path wont matter when we go up because well be in front and we agreed that the time of our arrival is important we must give the bat just long enough to reach the coast before the soldiers turn back and cut us off i expect it will mean our pushing across the hills for some distance when we cross their line well be in front again  marston signified his agreement by a nod it was plain that they must leave much to luck and lighting his pipe he leaned against the rail as the sun rose the mist ahead began to melt wooded heights rose out of the streaming vapor and presently wyndham found the marks he wanted and went off to sleep while marston kept his anxious watch it was now nearly calm sometimes a puff of wind ruffled the water sometimes the sails hung slack and the ripple at the bows died away the sun got hot the smooth swell shimmered with reflected light and nothing indicated when the seabreeze would begin  the calm however would not stop the tug and marston pictured her steaming up from san cristobal with engines thumping hard and the empty lighters astern news of columbines departure had no doubt reached the mission bugles would be calling and the cazadores strapping on their equipment ready to start still it was a long march to the harbor and marston hardly thought the troops would embark before nightfall if wind would come wyndham might keep in front of them but in the meantime columbine hardly moved marston wondered whether they ought to hoist out the gig and tow although the labor would be exhausting and they could not make much progress  a dark streak broke the glittering surface a cool draught touched marstons face and the slack sails swelled columbine began to move and presently gathering speed listed over to the fresh seabreeze  after an hour or two he wakened wyndham who got another bearing and changed the course at dusk they steered for the coast and towards morning anchored behind a shoal there was nothing but the background to hide the vessel and marston knew the risk when they landed with four of the crew in the steamy heat of the forest exertion soon wears a white man out and the negroes were needed to carry food and some shelter from the dew at night  after dark on the second evening they reached the bats headquarters in the company of a gang of savage negroes they were exhausted by the journey their clothes were torn and they did not know if the negroes were their captors or their guides so far as one could see the village looked mean a few small mud huts stood among mahogany trees and big cottonwoods there was no light in the huts but a fire burned outside one and although the night was warm indistinct figures crouched about the blaze they vanished and appeared again when the light leaped up and marston remembered the factory boys squatting round the fires in africa but the kroo laborers sang and these fellows were strangely silent in fact a daunting quietness brooded over the spot  the bats hut was larger than the rest and a rude veranda occupied the front there was no furniture except some mats and stools and a badlycleaned paraffin lamp gave a dim light the bat sat on a carved stool and wore a striped tennis jacket over his dirty white clothes his legs and feet were bare his lips stuck out and his nostrils were wide and marston felt that to fear and shrink from him was ridiculous yet he did shrink then he noted with some surprise that father sebastian occupied a mat in the corner next moment the bat looked up with a mocking grin  why you lib for my village it d poor place he said  well explain that later wyndham replied in the meantime why is father sebastian here  i take care of him said the bat fool black man rob his church he paused and added with a cruel smile them fool man pay  wyndham turned to the priest will you give us a few minutes padre we will send for you soon  father sebastian got up and the bat nodded as if he gave him leave to go he went out and wyndham sat down on a mat  now he said suppose you drop this negro mummery and talk like an englishman i want to remember you are rupert wyndham no doubt you meant to keep the missionary for a hostage but its not important i imagine you did not expect to see us  ruperts face changed something of its coarseness vanished his lips straightened and he looked less like a mulatto  i did expect you anyhow i heard white men were coming although i could only account for one he said and added with an ominous smile i sent to meet you because i did not want you to lose your way  marston knew that in africa the negroes can signal news across the bush with remarkable speed it looked as if rupert had learned how this was done and taught his people  whom did you expect he asked  peters he is a fool but he has pluck some pluck is needed when one tries to blackmail me  i imagine peters will come later but not to bargain with you marston said dryly we have some grounds for believing he means to sell you to the government  ruperts glance got very keen ah he said this is interesting perhaps it explains your visit which rather puzzled me  before long you will get some fresh news wyndham interposed larrinaga and the german colonel with two or three companies of cazadores have landed and are marching for your village  for a few moments rupert did not move and his face was inscrutable then he looked up and the red veins in his eyes were very plain  is this true you will find it dangerous to cheat me  wyndham told him what they had found out and stated the conclusions they had drawn when he stopped rupert nodded  it looks plausible you are cleverer than my spies but we will wait if the soldiers have landed i will soon know  you may wait too long  if theres a risk you share it said rupert meaningly you were rash when you came to see me without being asked however the entrance of the lagoon is shallow and the surf is often bad can larrinaga find the channel  pepe the pilot is with him i expect hell steer the tug  ah said rupert i rather trusted pepe but he has been bribed well it is possible he will get his reward however i imagine you have made some plans for me  wyndham braced himself although luck had given him strong arguments rupert was bold and cunning since his situation looked desperate he might try some desperate remedy that would ruin them all he must be persuaded to use the obvious way of escape  you cant fight its too late he said if you start now and we push across the hills between the two columns we may cross one detachments line after they have passed when they find out you have gone we will have got a start and ought to travel faster than loaded soldiers the schooner is ready and would sail in a few minutes after we got on board i dont see another plan and if youre caught larrinaga will shoot you his men are well equipped and drilled he has been getting ready for some time  rupert pondered for a minute or two and the others waited anxiously then he said if i go i leave people who trusted me in larrinagas power it is not a very heroic exit  does this count for much  on the whole it does not said rupert coolly after all my followers can take care of themselves they are an elusive lot and don ramon would soon wear out his troops hunting them in the bush all the same to slink away is something of an anticlimax  we didnt run a big risk in order to help you save your dignity wyndham rejoined and rupert gave him a mocking smile  your objects plain and i owe you nothing you hope to mend the familys fortunes and see an awkward chance of its getting known that a leader of negro rebels is your relation however what do you reckon to do with me if i go you proposed another time that i should return to england  we dont propose it now well land you at an american port and i will try to pay you a small allowance so long as you stay in the united states the south might suit you and one could trust the americans to see you didnt make trouble there  for guests you take a bold line its rather strange you imagine im forced to agree you dont seem to understand that theres not much to prevent my leaving you here and going off with your yacht  we thought about this wyndham replied if we dont return by a stipulated time columbine will sail and carry a statement i left with the mate to the british officers at kingston jamaica the cable is ready for slipping the sails are loose and if strangers try to board her the boat will go to sea  one must approve your caution said rupert dryly well i think my plans were good and but for two things they might have been carried out our robbing father sebastians church forced larrinaga to move but i was not responsible for this the others more important and the mistake was mine he turned to marston as he went on when you were ill with fever i ought to have poisoned you instead i tried a cure civilized doctors would hesitate to use  ah said marston you saved my life  i dont want thanks to some extent i thought it policy it did not seem worth while to bother about your antagonism then afterwards when we tried to drown you we were too late you had persuaded your partner your work was done if you had not meddled id have led him where i wanted  i think that is so bob i owe you much wyndham interposed  if harry had brought me the supplies i needed i could have fought the presidents troops rupert resumed fixing his bloodshot eyes on marston well you spoiled the plot and if im beaten now it is not larrinaga but you who wins you ought to be flattered for such a man as you are its a remarkable victory  there was something sinister in his sneering voice and wyndham said sharply it will be prudent for you to see bob does not fall ill again if i meet with any misfortune he will make you accountable  rupert shrugged we will let it go and wait until news about the soldiers arrives in the meantime i have some preparations to make you can sleep until i come back nobody will disturb you  i have a pistol but dont expect to use it wyndham replied your need of our help is our best protection and so long as the need is obvious i think we are pretty safe  when rupert went out they lay down on the mats although they were near physical exhaustion it was impossible to sleep the tension they had borne had not relaxed because until the news of the soldiers advance was signalled the situation was not free from danger the tug might strand among the shoals a strong breeze and breaking surf might stop her entering the lagoon to land the troops and delay would give rupert time to form fresh plans marston did not trust him yet if rupert could escape without their help he would not leave them at liberty to meddle again  they heard nothing from outside and the hut was very quiet the silence began to wear marstons nerve he could not wait much longer but it might be rash to go out and he forced himself to smoke although the tobacco burned his tongue and his mouth was parched it looked as if rupert were not coming back perhaps he had cheated them and gone off alone marston pictured his malicious grin as he stole off through the bush and left them to wait for larrinaga  at length however rupert returned to the hut i have got news he said coolly your boys are ready and we will start father sebastian is an embarrassment you will see that we cannot leave him behind  send for him said wyndham you had better understand that im accountable for his safety  father sebastian came in and wyndham asked if he would promise to say nothing about their visit and departure with the bat  no said father sebastian i will not promise i do not know what is happening but it looks as if the punishment this man deserves were overtaking him i will not help him to escape  you are in his power yet wyndham remarked  father sebastian smiled i am an old man and my work in the dreary swamps is hard my life is not worth much there are things i value more  i was wrong said wyndham quietly however since you refuse we must take you with us as far as the coast it would help if you promised not to run away  i will run away if it is possible this man is bad and cruel i think he killed your agent and now he is stealing off the soldiers must be coming i will warn them if i can  after all is this your business you are a missionary wyndham urged  i am the churchs servant and a citizen of the country the bat defies perhaps its rule is corrupt but it is better than his its citizens are christians and follow the light although their steps are sometimes weak these others would plunge the land in the dark of superstitious horror i know i have long watched the shadow deepen  you are a loyal servant wyndham replied i am afraid you must come with us but we will try to make your journey easy  white man fool man black man fix them thing different rupert remarked with his cruel grin then he indicated marston and added in good english this fellow is certainly a fool but his boyish scruples have beaten my cleverest schemes  he signed them to go out the krooboys from the schooner were waiting and in a few minutes the party plunged into the woods     chapter xi  the bats exit   columbine rolled heavily on the broken swell and the lamp that swung from a beam threw a puzzling light about the cabin now and then water splashed on the deck and the slack sails flapped the fresh breeze had dropped although the sea had not yet gone down and marston had set the topsail and the balloon jib the light canvas would chafe and was not of much use but he must reach kingston as soon as possible he was exhausted by physical effort and anxious watching and when rupert replaced the bandage on his comrades face he leaned back slackly on the locker seat  wyndham lay in an upper berth in the faint draught that came down through the open skylight a wet cloth covered his face and the cabin smelt of drugs he did not move and had not been altogether conscious for some time rupert wore harrys white clothes and looked in the unsteady light like a rather haggard and jaundiced englishman marston had noted his firm touch when he fixed the bandage and now he was methodically putting back some bottles in the medicine chest when he finished he bent over the berth for a moment as if he listened to wyndhams breathing  i think he will live he said although he is very weak we have got the fever down and the wound is not as septic as it was anyhow you must get him into hospital at kingston soon  marston remembered afterwards that rupert had said you not we and thought it significant now however he was dully pondering something else  if you had not been on board harry would not have lived he said  youre puzzled about my saving him rupert rejoined well i dont owe harry much and i owe you less on the whole i hardly think our relationship accounts for my efforts a bold experiment is interesting when somebody else is the subject and one rather enjoys using ones skill  since there were only one or two very simple surgical instruments in the medicine chest marston thought ruperts skill was remarkable he had envied him his firm hand and nerve when he cut out the bullet that had pierced harrys cheek and jaw and lodged in his neck as he remembered the operation in which he had been forced to help marston shuddered after a few moments rupert looked up  you need fresh air go and see how she steers harry will sleep but if its necessary i will watch  marston went on deck it was a little cooler and the touch of the dew on his face was soothing he put on an oilskin and sat down by the wheel the night was clear and the tops of the broken swell shone with phosphorescence columbine rolled about shaking her masts and booms with savage jerks blocks rattled and now and then the canvas banged yet she forged ahead and kept her course  byandby marston lighted his pipe and tried to fix the elusive pictures of their journey to the coast to begin with the night they left the hut wyndham owned he had a dose of fever in the morning he was worse but time was valuable and they pushed on then at evening when they came down from the hills to cut the soldiers line of march they saw two or three peons run out from a ruined village and plunge into the bush another who was slower and was caught stated that they had been left behind to wait until some more troops came up the village was empty but the peon took the party to a hut he had been ordered to watch it was getting dark and when they went in marston struck a match next moment he let it drop for a white man lay on the floor and something strange about his attitude indicated that he was dead then rupert picked up the burning match and lighted a lantern  marston shuddered as his memory recaptured the scene the dim illumination touched the dead man had drawn up his legs and his face was distorted but marston did not want to remember this it was peters face and he knew the fellow had not met a peaceful death father sebastian knelt down by the body rupert stooped and smiled  you cannot help him and i do not think you will find a mark i doubt if he belonged to any flock but it was not to yours anyhow he is dead and you need not bother about how he died  yet you know said father sebastian fixing him with steady eyes  rupert nodded he meant to sell me and it is possible he got his reward although he did not enjoy it long one could philosophize about it but i leave this to you well i think we will not wait until his friends arrive  i will wait said father sebastian firmly it is a duty to bury the dead  rupert shrugged and looked at marston wyndham shivering with ague had sat down and rested his head in his hands as if he did not know what was going on  watching the padre did not run off has cost us some time rupert remarked however it would be awkward if he sent the next detachment of cazadores after us i expect he knows how i would meet the difficulty  we will leave you and not bother you for a promise marston said to father sebastian who gave him his hand  there is much that puzzles me and i do not know why you help this bad man to escape but i feel you are honest he said sometimes one must trust without understanding he lifted his hand solemnly vaya con dios  then they went out and left him in the dark with peters  marston did not know if father sebastian sent the soldiers after them but although he thought he did he bore him no grudge the man was staunch and from his point of view was justified in the morning rupert declared they must push on faster and their march became a race for the coast now marston could think about it coolly he imagined rupert feared some of the negroes had joined larrinaga and were signalling news of the partys flight wyndham stumbled as they forced their way savagely in scorching heat across reedy swamps and through tangled bush but he would not be carried and this would have delayed them dangerously marston recaptured with strange vividness the last scene  it was dark when they broke out of the forest and saw the sea sparkle under a halfmoon the landbreeze blew fresh and now and then belts of warm mist trailed across the beach there were no mangroves the beach was flat and open but they were some distance off the spot where the schooner lay and they labored across the soft sand marston owned that the suspense had shaken his nerve he was desperately anxious to get on board before he was stopped but wyndham could hardly walk for halfanhour marston dragged him along  when they were nearly level with the schooner indistinct figures ran out from the bush wyndham turned and shaking off marston drew his pistol he fired two or three shots but since the distance was long marston thought he rather expected to warn the crew than stop their pursuers the latter did not stop and marston dragged wyndham on again a boat was coming but he doubted if they could reach it before the others arrived the sand was soft he was exhausted and wyndham lurched about sometimes he nearly pulled marston down  shots were fired behind them and bullets hummed overhead the negroes were running hard close in front and the boat plunged into the belt of surf then wyndham fell and pulled marston over when he fell marston got some sand in his eyes and could hardly see somebody seized his arm and dragged him to his feet men were splashing in the foam about the boat he stuck to harry but did not know how they got on board then he felt the boat plunge and saw the halfnaked kroos were pulling for their lives wyndham leaned against him and marston felt his jacket getting wet he afterwards found that it was wet by blood he put harry down in the sternsheets and seized the nearest krooboys oar thrusting while the other pulled  when they got on board the schooner the sails were going up and nobody else was hit marston and rupert carried wyndham to the cabin and marston remembered his horror when they put him in his berth a glancing bullet turning over endways had mangled the lower part of his face  this however was some days since and marston was getting over the shock rupert had told him harry would live although he would always wear the scar  byandby marston got up and walked about the deck he dared not think about flora yet he must navigate columbine to kingston and get wyndham into hospital there was a little more wind now and the damp sails did not shake but the rolling and lurching stopped the schooner although it was important to make kingston soon one could do nothing to help their progress and marston presently returned to the wheel he waited for a time because he did not want to talk to rupert his shrinking from the fellow had not lessened but he was very tired and limp and at length he went down and got into his bunk  in the morning the breeze was fresh and columbine threw the spray about as she plunged across the white combers at noon marston got his sextant to take the sun and sat for some minutes on the skylight calculating the schooners position then he looked up and saw rupert  i think the wind will hold said the latter when do you expect to arrive  marston told him and added you are not on the crew list and since kingstons a british port we will have to comply with the usual formalities we must think of a way of accounting for your being on board he paused and added with a touch of embarrassment it may be some time before the doctors let me take harry home and i dont know  you dont know what to do about me rupert suggested with the smile marston disliked well suppose you wait until you get there i imagine i wont bother you much in the meantime you havent hauled your patentlog lets see what distance it marks  columbines log was oldfashioned in order to read the dial it was necessary to bring the torpedoshaped instrument on board and rupert jumping on a grating put his foot on the low taffrail as he began to haul the line the line was long the log with its spiral vanes offered some resistance and marston knowing it would be a minute or two before rupert lifted it out of the water studied the compass looking round he saw the others bent figure outlined against the foaming wake and then he glanced ahead the wind was fresh and columbine sailed fast white combers rolled up to windward and as she plunged across their tops she threw up clouds of spray  in about a minute marston looked aft again and braced himself as he gazed at the slanted rail he had heard no splash or cry but rupert had gone he shouted and signed to the kroo steersman who pulled round the wheel columbine shipped some water as with sails flapping and banging she came head to wind the long booms jerked blocks and ropes whipped to and fro and the crew began to run about the deck one or two hauled down the foresail one or two trimmed the jibs aback and marston helped the others at the burton tackle to hoist out the gig  he jumped on board as she took the water four excited negroes leaped down from the schooners bulwarks and a white sea washed across the bows as they shoved her off they got away without damage and pulled obliquely to leeward while marston tried to calculate how far columbine had gone since he last saw rupert it was necessary to be accurate because except when the combers picked up the boat he could see nothing but the white tops of the waves besides rowing on an angry sea is hard and the men would soon get exhausted since they could not search long he must reach the proper spot  no floating object tossed among the foam and after half an hour he gave it up rupert wyndham had gone he was old and a good swimmer could not have lived long in such a sea because a man buffeted by breaking waves may drown before he sinks the boat had shipped much water the crew were worn out and had some trouble to row back to columbine when they had hoisted in the gig and put the schooner on her course marston went to the cabin and mixed a drink he was wet his hands shook and his arms ached for he had been forced to use his strength while he labored with the big sculling oar  moreover he was strangely disturbed he had shrunk from rupert wyndham with halfinstinctive repulsion in one sense ruperts drowning would relieve him and wyndham from an awkward responsibility marston admitted that he had recognized this although he hoped he had not allowed it to influence him indeed because he did not like rupert he had made sterner efforts to reach the spot where he had gone overboard but he wondered whether he had perhaps afterwards neglected means he might have used had the man been his friend on the whole he did not think so and his tormenting doubts began to vanish for all that he was glad wyndham was asleep  when some hours later marston went back to the cabin wyndhams eyes were open the lower part of his face was covered by the bandage and he could not talk but marston thought he missed rupert and was curious although harry was very weak marston felt he had better tell him now if he did not his unsatisfied curiosity might keep him restless and bring the fever back  i know what you want to ask he said quietly ruperts not here he fell overboard when he was hauling up the log  wyndhams eyelids flickered and his hand moved under the blanket but this was the only sign he gave  she was rolling marston went on he stood with his foot on the taffrail leaning out to gather in the line you see there was nothing to save him if he lost his balance  he stopped for he saw wyndham was looking at him very hard then he resumed i think he did lose his balance but i dont know i was looking forward wondering whether we ought to haul down a reef and none of the boys saw him fall there was not a splash  a feeble movement of wyndhams head urged him to go on  we got the gig over soon but the boat had been going fast and headreached some distance when we brought her round then there was a confused sea  marston saw wyndham understood he need not labor his explanation but he wished harry could talk there was an assurance he wanted his comrade to give harry knew how he had felt about rupert  i think i did my best he said awkwardly she nearly capsized once or twice the sea was hollow and curled before you expected the water on board was getting deep and we couldnt bale  a very faint smile flickered in wyndhams eyes and marston was conscious of keen relief harry had understood his embarrassment and was satisfied to hint at regret would be useless cant there was nothing more to be said for all that marston was glad when a krooboy called him on deck it was blowing fresher and he gave some orders and occupied himself by shortening sail     chapter xii  the fresh start   dusk had fallen and rows of lights twinkled along the walls at the rivermouth tall chimneys and warehouses rose against the sky there was a biting wind and marston shivered at the door of the liners smokingroom her engines throbbed slackly as she steamed in with the tide past the dark shapes of anchored vessels a mile or two ahead bright streaks in which the separate lights were merged marked the landing stages and marston looked for the red white and green triangle that would indicate the companys tug for his comrades sake he was illogically relieved because he could not see her yet although the moment he dreaded could not be put off long  after a time he went back into the smoking room wyndham wearing a heavy coat lounged on a settee he was very thin and his face was haggard but this was not all his mouth was distorted for one side drooped giving him a strange look of vacant amusement the contrast between this and the melancholy in his eyes was rather horrible marston was getting used to the disfigurement but he had seen that strangers were jarred besides wyndham would never again articulate clearly his talk was slow and awkward and the kingston doctor doubted if he would altogether get back his strength  ten minutes yet i dont see the tug said marston shall i help you out on deck when she comes  wyndham smiled and answered with the deliberation he was forced to use there wouldnt be much use in that bob i heard them fixing the big gangway lights  marston knew he was thinking about flora and the shock she must get it was going to be hard for flora in fact it was hard for both  she knows he said quietly i was frank with mabel and told her all before the doctor would let you write  thanks flora has pluck but the pluck that hides a hurt does not cure it  it goes some way said marston when flora sees you i dont think she will see the scar  then one or two of the passengers came in and they waited until the engines stopped and they heard the tugs paddles wyndham got on his feet awkwardly and waved back marston who had meant to give him his arm his face was very pinched but his eyes were bright and as they went out he forced a smile  a big electric lamp hung from the spardeck and threw down a searching light the tugs gangway was run out and people began to come on board marston saw mabel and his heart beat with mixed emotions as he noted her black dress for a cablegram had told him mrs hilliard was dead he was unselfishly sorry for mabel but she had met the last claim of duty and he had waited long  then flora stepped down from the gangway and went straight across the deck to wyndham who stood under the lamp the strong light touched their faces and marston imagined the corners of floras mouth twitched this was all her step was swift and eager and her eyes shone with tender welcome she was very brave marston saw no pity in her look there was nothing but gladness and love  my dear she cried and wyndham took her in his feeble arms  a few moments afterwards mabel gave marston her hand and when he had gazed at her his glance rested on her black dress  im sorry very sorry i think you understand  i know bob said mabel you thought about me you dont think much about yourself but i must speak to harry  she left him and he was filled with tenderness and pride as he watched her greet wyndham her smile was frank and her voice was sympathetic but one got no hint of pity that might jar a sensitive nerve mabel struck the right note and marston knew it was not all goodbreeding that guided her he loved her for the human kindness she gave his comrade  when they went down the gangway wyndham was forced to lean on marstons arm a car was waiting at the floating bridge that led to the pierhead and marston helped wyndham in  ill go to the office early and report to you in the evening he said you must take things easy and not bother at all  flora and chisholm got in and when they drove off marston took mabels hand  if you dont mind well walk to the top i want to look about and realize im at home i feel like a boy who has just come back from his first term at school  was it very hard bob mabel asked sympathetically  marston smiled it was foreign if you understand and that was worse plots gloom sickness and mystery that made you savage because you didnt know if you were being cleverly cheated or not sometimes i half believed the bat was a magician in fact it was all from which a sober fellow revolts  yet you were strong enough to carry out the job you hated that is much bob  marston looked down the river long rows of lights pricked out the dock walls that narrowed to a dark gap in the distance low constellations marked the ferry landing stages and in the stream other lights colored green and red moved swiftly up and down in the background were misty towers and spires whistles shrieked and one heard the splash of paddles and the throb of propellers for the commerce of two cities floated up on the tide bobs imagination was sometimes dull but the river noises moved him then he got a hint of ordered effort and useful activity sober men brought home the ships and controlled the trade that extended across the world perhaps if one looked for it with understanding there was a romance about this farspread trade but of one kind of romance bob had had enough  we will go to the car he said presently with quiet happiness ive got back and you are with me i have all i want coming up channel my satisfaction was half spoiled the trouble waiting flora haunted me then to some extent i felt i hadnt justified her trust id promised to see harry out and i brought him home like that  if you had not been very staunch he might not have come home at all but will he always be disfigured  the mark of the bullet wont wear off and he will never talk easily for the rest the kingston doctor wasnt very encouraging he said harry had obviously borne a crushing strain for long and now it had broken him we mustnt look for a quick recovery still he was young and proper treatment in england would help well his meeting flora is over and ive got rid of a load  you ought not to have been afraid for flora  i see this now she was wonderful marston agreed human natures rather mixed and some is pretty base metal but you feel that floras almost without alloy  mabel smiled i like you when youre romantic bob but even then youre cautious  oh well said marston after all i only know one girl who is pure gold  now youre quite extravagant but youre very nice indeed mabel replied and their car rolled up  next evening mabel went with bob to wyndhams small house wyndham looking pale and jaded occupied an easy chair by the fire and mabel ordered him not to get up  i have been to the office and all is going well marston remarked next week you can come down for perhaps an hour a day we wont need you longer and i mean to be firm nevis tells me he wont stay i imagine he doesnt approve my methods but id rather expected this and think ive got a better man  if youre satisfied said wyndham smiling since nevis began at the office i suppose you feel he belongs to the old state of things  marston looked half embarrassed but nodded i did feel something like that a new man is better when you make a fresh start on another line however im not going to bother about business ive told you enough to put your mind at rest theres something much more important mabel has agreed to marry me next month  flora kissed mabel and for a time they engaged in happy talk then marston got up  we are going to the drawingroom its a long time since i heard good music and mabel said shed play  i didnt know you liked music much bob flora remarked  all the same i do like it marston rejoined its true ive been to concerts that bored me but all musics charming when mabel plays  flora let them go and then looked at wyndham a wedding presents the next thing harry and it will need some thought what can we give them who have given us so much  wyndham smiled i imagine bob would be content with our gratitude although hed feel badly embarrassed if you made it too plain his smile however vanished as he resumed anyhow i shall never wipe out my debt there are not many like bob  he mused for a few moments and went on i remember his telling me rupert was drowned my face was bandaged i couldnt speak and was too weak to move bob could only see my eyes and as he watched them i knew what he thought because he had hated rupert from the beginning he was desperately anxious to persuade me he had done his best the thing was of course ridiculous bob being the man he is one could not doubt him it was unthinkable to imagine he had not used every effort although the sea was rough and he risked a capsize the boat was half swamped when he brought her back yet i imagine he was more disturbed than me  i think bob did not see him fall overboard  no said wyndham rupert may have lost his balance but i doubt we were not far from kingston and when we got there he must so to speak resume a white mans responsibilities and begin life again he had lived like a savage commanding fear and using power that few civilized rulers know but all that had gone and he was proud  but you were disturbed when bob told you flora urged  at first i was conscious of relief i thought rupert had seen the only way out of the tangle before he went id begun to feel the situation was impossible for us all afterwards i saw that my greedy ambition had helped to involve us and he had borne the punishment had he not thought he could get supplies from me he would not have plotted the rebellion  flora hesitated for a moment and then said when bob came in the morning to ask if you had slept i kept him a few minutes and we talked about this he declared your engaging to supply the goods was not important because if you had refused rupert could have got all he needed from peters or somebody else so long as he was willing to give a high price  its possible after all bob is cleverer than people sometimes think and i see an explanation for peters vindictive pursuit id stopped his trading with rupert and refused him for a partner well he paid and rupert paid and i owe my escape to bob  you made reparation said flora gently  i tried when i was found out it was rather late then and bob carried much of the load but i did not get off free i spent days of torment thinking about what you must bear before i resigned myself to coming home broken in body to be a burden to you  floras eyes shone oh my dear you have come home and thats all that matters besides youll get well in england your strength will return  it may be long said wyndham quietly i cannot grumble for myself im thinking about bob it looks as if he must carry my load and his but he wont growl hes strong and his plucks unbreakable pluck and honesty like bobs are worth more than talent  he paused and smiled when he resumed well while i try not to lose patience waiting and wondering whether ill be fit to work again hell build a new wyndhams on a surer foundation than i could have laid i can see him stopping now and then with his puzzled look but not stopping long bobs way is to go on straight and steadfastly  we owe him much said flora your debt is mine  then there were steps in the passage and the others came in mabel blushed when she saw floras smile  after all it looks as if music did bore bob flora remarked we didnt hear you playing long  we talked said mabel with a frank glance there was much to talk about and all was rather wonderful perhaps this looks extravagant but i dont think it is  hold fast to your persuasion said flora gently it will take you far love conquers many doubts and troubles  mabels troubles ought not to be numerous wyndham interposed she is going to marry my partner the best man i know  marstons face got red but mabel laughed a soft happy laugh  i really think bob stands alone she said hes like nobody else and im sure theres nobody like him   the end
