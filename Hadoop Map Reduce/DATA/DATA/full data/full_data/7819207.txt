   preface by the rev h c beeching m a   this edition of miltons poetry is a reprint as careful as editor and printers have been able to make it from the earliest printed copies of the several poems  first the 1645 volume of the minor poems has been printed entire then follow in order the poems added in the reissue of 1673 the paradise lost from the edition of 1667 and the paradise regaind and samson agonistes from the edition of 1671  the most interesting portion of the book must be reckoned the first section of it which reproduces for the first time the scarce small octavo of 1645  the only reprint of the minor poems in the old spelling so far as i know is the one edited by mitford but that followed the edition of 1673 which is comparatively uninteresting since it could not have had miltons oversight as it passed through the press we know that it was set up from a copy of the 1645 edition because it reproduces some pointless eccentricities such as the varying form of the chorus to psalm cxxxvi but while it corrects the errata tabulated in that edition it commits many more blunders of its own  it is valuable however as the editio princeps of ten of the sonnets and it contains one important alteration in the ode on the nativity this and all other alterations will be found noted where they occur  i have not thought it necessary to note mere differences of spelling between the two editions but a word may find place here upon their general character  generally it may be said that where the two editions differ the later spelling is that now in use  thus words like goddess darkness usually written in the first edition with one final s have two while on the  other hand words like vernall youthfull and monosyllables like hugg farr lose their double letter  many monosyllables eg som cours glimps wher vers aw els don ey ly so written in 1645 take on in 1673 an e mute while words like harpe windes onely lose it by a reciprocal change ayr and cipress become air and cypress and the vowels in daign vail neer beleeve sheild boosom eeven battail travailer and many other words are similarly modernized  on the other hand there are a few cases where the 1645 edition exhibits the spelling which has succeeded in fixing itself as travail 1673 travel in the sense of labour and robd profane human flood and bloody forest triple alas huddling are found where the 1673 edition has roabd prophane humane floud and bloudy forrest tripple alass and hudling  indeed the spelling in this later edition is not untouched by seventeenth century inconsistency  it retains here and there forms like shameles cateres where 1645 reads cateress and occasionally reverts to the olderfashioned spelling of monosyllables without the mute e  in the epitaph on the marchioness of winchester it reads and som flowers and some bays  but undoubtedly the impression on the whole is of a much more modern text  in the matter of small or capital letters i have followed the old copy except in one or two places where a personification seemed not plainly enough marked to a modern reader without a capital thus in il penseroso l 49 i print leasure although both editions read leasure and in the vacation exercise l 71 times for times also where the employment or omission of a capital is plainly due to misprinting as too frequently in the 1673 edition i silently make the correction examples are notes for notes in sonnet xvii l 13 anointed for anointed in psalm  ii l12  in regard to punctuation i have followed the old printers except in obvious misprints and followed them also as far as possible in their distribution of roman and italic type and in the grouping of words and lines in the various titles to follow them exactly was impossible as the  books are so very different in size  at this point the candid reader may perhaps ask what advantage is gained by presenting these poems to modern readers in the dress of a bygone age  if the question were put to me i should probably evade it by pointing out that mr frowde is issuing an edition based upon this in which the spelling is frankly that of today  but if the question were pressed i think a sufficient answer might be found  to begin with i should point out that even prof masson who in his excellent edition argues the point and decides in favour of modern spelling allows that there are peculiarities of miltons spelling which are really significant and ought therefore to be noted or preserved  but who is to determine exactly which words are spelt according to the poets own instructions and which according to the printers whim  it is notorious that in paradise lost some words were spelt upon a deliberate system and it may very well happen that in the volume of minor poems which the poet saw through the press in 1645 there were spellings no less systematic  prof masson makes a great point of the fact that miltons own spelling exhibited in the autograph manuscript of some of the minor poems preserved in trinity college cambridge does not correspond with that of the printed copy note this manuscript invaluable to all students of milton has lately been facsimiled under the superintendence of dr aldis wright and published at the cambridge university press  this is certainly true as the reader may see for himself by comparing the passage from the manuscript given in the appendix with the corresponding place in the text  miltons own spelling revels in redundant es while the printer of the 1645 book is very sparing of them  but in cases where the spelling affects the metre we find that the printed text and miltons manuscript closely correspond and it is upon its value in determining the metre quite as much as its antiquarian interest that i should base a justification of this reprint  take for instance such a line as the eleventh of comus which prof masson gives as          amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats  a reader not learned in miltonic rhythms will certainly read this          amongst th enthroned gods  but the 1645 edition reads          amongst the enthrond gods  and so does miltons manuscript  again in line 597 prof masson reads          it shall be in eternal restless change         selffed and selfconsumed  if this fail         the pillared firmament is rottenness  c  but the 1645 text and miltons manuscript read selfconsumd after which word there is to be understood a metrical pause to mark the violent transition of the thought  again in the second line of the sonnet to a nightingale prof masson has          warblest at eve when all the woods are still  but the early edition which probably follows miltons spelling though in this case we have no manuscript to compare reads warblst so the original text of samson l 670 has temperst  the retention of the old system of punctuation may be less defensible but i have retained it because it may now and then be of use in determining a point of syntax  the absence of a comma for example after the word hearse in the 58th line of the epitaph on the marchioness of winchester printed by prof masson thus          and some flowers and some bays         for thy hearse to strew thy ways  but in the 1645 edition          and som flowers and som bays         for thy hears to strew the ways  goes to prove that for here must be taken as fore  of the paradise lost there were two editions issued during miltons lifetime and while the first has been taken as our text all the variants in the second not being simple misprints have been recorded in the notes  in one respect however in the distribution of the poem into twelve books instead of ten it has seemed best for the sake of practical convenience to follow the second edition  a word may be allowed here on the famous correction among the errata prefixed to the first edition  lib 2 v 414 for we read wee  this correction shows not only that milton had theories about spelling but also that he found means though his sight was gone to ascertain whether his rules had been carried out by his printer and in itself this fact justifies a facsimile reprint  what the principle in the use of the double vowel exactly was and it is found to affect the other monosyllabic pronouns it is not so easy to discover though roughly it is clear the reduplication was intended to mark emphasis  for example in the speech of the divine son after the battle in heaven vi 810817 the pronouns which the voice would naturally emphasize are spelt with the double vowel                                   stand onely and behold         gods indignation on these godless pourd         by mee not you but mee they have despisd         yet envied against mee is all thir rage         because the father twhom in heavn supream         kingdom and power and glorie appertains         hath honourd me according to his will         therefore to mee thir doom he hath assignd  in the sons speech offering himself as redeemer iii 227249 where the pronoun all through is markedly emphasized it is printed mee the first four times and afterwards me but it is noticeable that these first four times the emphatic word does not stand in the stressed place of the verse so that a careless reader might not emphasize it unless his attention were specially led by some such sign          behold mee then mee for him life for life         i offer on mee let thine anger fall         account mee man  in the hymn of creation v160209 where ye occurs fourteen times the emphasis and the metric stress six times out of seven coincide and the pronoun is spelt yee where it is unemphatic and in an unstressed place it is spelt ye two lines are especially instructive  speak yee who best can tell ye sons of light l 160  and          fountains and yee that warble as ye flow         melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise l 195  in v 694 it marks as the voice by its emphasis would mark in reading a change of subject          so spake the false archangel and infusd         bad influence into th unwarie brest         of his associate hee i e the associate together calls c  an examination of other passages where there is no antithesis goes to show that the lengthened form of the pronoun is most frequent before a pause as vii 95 or at the end of a line i 245 257 or when a foot is inverted v 133 or when as object it  precedes its verb v 612 vii 747 or as subject follows it ix 1109 x 4  but as we might expect under circumstances where a purist could not correct his own proofs there are not a few inconsistencies  there does not seem for example any special emphasis in the second wee of the following passage                                          freely we serve         because wee freely love as in our will         to love or not in this we stand or fall  v 538   on the other hand in the passage iii 41 in which the poet speaks of his own blindness                                  thus with the year         seasons return but not to me returns         day c  where if anywhere we should expect mee we do not find it though it occurs in the speech eight lines below  it should be added that this differentiation of the pronouns is not found in any printed poem of miltons before paradise lost nor is it found in the cambridge autograph in that manuscript the constant forms are me wee yee there is one place where there is a difference in the spelling of she and it is just possible that this may not be due to accident  in the first verse of the song in arcades the ms reads          this this is shee  and in the third verse          this this is she alone  this use of the double vowel is found a few times in paradise regaind in ii 259 and iv 486 497 where mee begins a line and in iv 638 where hee is specially emphatic in the concluding lines of the poem  in samson agonistes it is more frequent eg lines 124 178 193 220 252 290 1125  another word the spelling of which in paradise lost will be observed to vary is the pronoun their which is spelt sometimes thir  the spelling in the cambridge manuscript is uniformly thire except once when it is thir and where their once occurs in the writing of an amanuensis the e is struck through  that the difference is not merely a printers device to accommodate his line may be seen by a comparison of lines 358 and 363 in the first book where the shorter word  comes in the shorter line  it is probable that the lighter form of the word was intended to be used when it was quite unemphatic contrast for example in book iii l59 his own works and their works at once to view with line 113 thir maker and thir making and thir fate but the use is not consistent and the form thir is not found at all till the 349th line of the first book  the distinction is kept up in the paradise regaind and samson agonistes but if possible with even less consistency  such passages however as paradise regaind iii 414440 samson agonistes 880890 are certainly spelt upon a method and it is noticeable that in the choruses the lighter form is universal  paradise regaind and samson agonistes were published in 1671 and no further edition was called for in the remaining three years of the poets lifetime so that in the case of these poems there are no new readings to record and the texts were so carefully revised that only one fault paradise regaind ii 309 was left for correction later in these and the other poems i have corrected the misprints catalogued in the tables of errata and i have silently corrected any other unless it might be mistaken for a various reading when i have called attention to it in a note  thus i have not recorded such blunders as lethian for lesbian in the 1645 text of lycidas line 63 or hallow for hollow in paradise lost vi 484 but i have noted content for concent in at a solemn musick line 6  in conclusion i have to offer my sincere thanks to all who have collaborated with me in preparing this edition to the delegates of the oxford press for allowing me to undertake it and decorate it with so many facsimiles to the controller of the press for his unfailing courtesy to the printers and printers reader for their care and pains coming nearer home i cannot but acknowledge the help i have received in looking over proofsheets from my sister mrs p a barnett who has ungrudgingly put at the service of this book both time and eyesight  in taking leave of it i may be permitted to say that it has cost more of both these inestimable treasures than i had anticipated  the last proof reaches me just a year after the first and the progress of the work has not in the interval been interrupted in tenui labor et tenuis gloria nevertheless i cannot be sorry it was undertaken  h c b  yattendon rectory

reader there was no argument at first intended to the book but for the satisfaction of many that have desired it i have procurd it and withall a reason of that which stumbled many others why the poem

1668     the verse   the measure is english heroic verse without rime as that of homer in greek and of virgil in latin rime being no necessary adjunct or true ornament of poem or good verse in longer works especially but the invention of a barbarous age to set off wretched matter and lame meeter gract indeed since by the use of some famous modern poets carried away by custom but much to thir own vexation hindrance and constraint to express many things otherwise and for the most part worse then else they would have exprest them  not without cause therefore some both italian and spanish poets of prime note have rejected rime both in longer and shorter works as have also long since our best english tragedies as a thing of it self to all judicious eares triveal and of no true musical delight which consists only in apt numbers fit quantity of syllables and the sense variously drawn out from one verse into another not in the jingling sound of like endings a fault avoyded by the learned ancients both in poetry and all good oratory  this neglect then of rime so little is to be taken for a defect though it may seem so perhaps to vulgar readers that it rather is to be esteemd an example

black fire and horror shot with equal rage   among his angels and his throne it self   mixt with tartarean sulphur and strange fire   his own invented torments but perhaps                               70   the way seems difficult and steep to scale   with upright wing against a higher foe   let such bethink them if the sleepy drench   of that forgetful lake benumme not still   that in our proper motion we ascend   up to our native seat descent and fall   to us is adverse who but felt of late   when the fierce foe hung on our brokn rear   insulting and pursud us through the deep   with what compulsion and laborious flight                            80   we sunk thus low th ascent is easie then   th event is feard should we again provoke   our stronger some worse way his wrath may find   to our destruction if there be in hell   fear to be worse destroyd what can be worse   then to dwell here drivn out from bliss condemnd   in this abhorred deep to utter woe   where pain of unextinguishable fire   must exercise us without hope of end   the vassals of his anger when the scourge                           90   inexorably and the torturing houre   calls us to penance more destroyd then thus   we should be quite abolisht and expire   what fear we then what doubt we to incense   his utmost ire which to the highth enragd   will either quite consume us and reduce   to nothing this essential happier farr   then miserable to have eternal being   or if our substance be indeed divine   and cannot cease to be we are at worst                             100   on this side nothing and by proof we feel   our power sufficient to disturb his heavn   and with perpetual inrodes to allarme   though inaccessible his fatal throne   which if not victory is yet revenge   he ended frowning and his look denouncd   desperate revenge and battel dangerous   to less then gods on th other side up rose   belial in act more graceful and humane   a fairer person lost not heavn he seemd                           110   for dignity composd and high exploit   but all was false and hollow though his tongue   dropt manna and could make the worse appear   the better reason to perplex and dash   maturest counsels for his thoughts were low   to vice industrious but to nobler deeds   timorous and slothful yet he pleasd the eare   and with perswasive accent thus began   i should be much for open warr o peers   as not behind in hate if what was urgd                            120   main reason to perswade immediate warr   did not disswade me most and seem to cast   ominous conjecture on the whole success   when he who most excels in fact of arms   in what he counsels and in what excels   mistrustful grounds his courage on despair   and utter dissolution as the scope   of all his aim after some dire revenge   first what revenge the towrs of heavn are filld   with armed watch that render all access                            130   impregnable oft on the bordering deep   encamp thir legions or with obscure wing   scout farr and wide into the realm of night   scorning surprize or could we break our way   by force and at our heels all hell should rise   with blackest insurrection to confound   heavns purest light yet our great enemie   all incorruptible would on his throne   sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould   incapable of stain would soon expel                                 140   her mischief and purge off the baser fire   victorious thus repulsd our final hope   is flat despair we must exasperate   th almighty victor to spend all his rage   and that must end us that must be our cure   to be no more sad cure for who would loose   though full of pain this intellectual being   those thoughts that wander through eternity   to perish rather swallowd up and lost   in the wide womb of uncreated night                                150   devoid of sense and motion and who knows   let this be good whether our angry foe   can give it or will ever how he can   is doubtful that he never will is sure   will he so wise let loose at once his ire   belike through impotence or unaware   to give his enemies thir wish and end   them in his anger whom his anger saves   to punish endless wherefore cease we then   say they who counsel warr we are decreed                          160   reservd and destind to eternal woe   whatever doing what can we suffer more   what can we suffer worse is this then worst   thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms   what when we fled amain pursud and strook   with heavns afflicting thunder and besought   the deep to shelter us this hell then seemd   a refuge from those wounds or when we lay   chaind on the burning lake that sure was worse   what if the breath that kindld those grim fires                    170   awakd should blow them into sevenfold rage   and plunge us in the flames or from above   should intermitted vengeance arme again   his red right hand to plague us what if all   her stores were opnd and this firmament   of hell should spout her cataracts of fire   impendent horrors threatning hideous fall   one day upon our heads while we perhaps   designing or exhorting glorious warr   caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurld                          180   each on his rock transfixt the sport and prey   of racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk   under yon boyling ocean wrapt in chains   there to converse with everlasting groans   unrespited unpitied unrepreevd   ages of hopeless end this would be worse   warr therefore open or conceald alike   my voice disswades for what can force or guile   with him or who deceive his mind whose eye   views all things at one view he from heavns highth                190   all these our motions vain sees and derides   not more almighty to resist our might   then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles   shall we then live thus vile the race of heavn   thus trampld thus expelld to suffer here   chains and these torments better these then worse   by my advice since fate inevitable   subdues us and omnipotent decree   the victors will to suffer as to doe   our strength is equal nor the law unjust                           200   that so ordains this was at first resolvd   if we were wise against so great a foe   contending and so doubtful what might fall   i laugh when those who at the spear are bold   and ventrous if that fail them shrink and fear   what yet they know must follow to endure   exile or ignominy or bonds or pain   the sentence of thir conquerour this is now   our doom which if we can sustain and bear   our supream foe in time may much remit                              210   his anger and perhaps thus farr removd   not mind us not offending satisfid   with what is punisht whence these raging fires   will slackn if his breath stir not thir flames   our purer essence then will overcome   thir noxious vapour or enurd not feel   or changd at length and to the place conformd   in temper and in nature will receive   familiar the fierce heat and void of pain   this horror will grow milde this darkness light                   220   besides what hope the neverending flight   of future days may bring what chance what change   worth waiting since our present lot appeers   for happy though but ill for ill not worst   if we procure not to our selves more woe   thus belial with words cloathd in reasons garb   counseld ignoble ease and peaceful sloath   not peace and after him thus mammon spake   either to disinthrone the king of heavn   we warr if warr be best or to regain                              230   our own right lost him to unthrone we then   may hope when everlasting fate shall yeild   to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife   the former vain to hope argues as vain   the latter for what place can be for us   within heavns bound unless heavns lord supream   we overpower suppose he should relent   and publish grace to all on promise made   of new subjection with what eyes could we   stand in his presence humble and receive                           240   strict laws imposd to celebrate his throne   with warbld hymns and to his godhead sing   forct halleluiahs while he lordly sits   our envied sovran and his altar breathes   ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers   our servile offerings this must be our task   in heavn this our delight how wearisom   eternity so spent in worship paid   to whom we hate let us not then pursue   by force impossible by leave obtaind                              250   unacceptable though in heavn our state   of splendid vassalage but rather seek   our own good from our selves and from our own   live to our selves though in this vast recess   free and to none accountable preferring   hard liberty before the easie yoke   of servile pomp our greatness will appear   then most conspicuous when great things of small   useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse   we can create and in what place so ere                            260   thrive under evil and work ease out of pain   through labour and endurance this deep world   of darkness do we dread how oft amidst   thick clouds and dark doth heavns allruling sire   choose to reside his glory unobscurd   and with the majesty of darkness round   covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar   mustring thir rage and heavn resembles hell   as he our darkness cannot we his light   imitate when we please this desart soile                           270   wants not her hidden lustre gemms and gold   nor want we skill or art from whence to raise   magnificence and what can heavn shew more   our torments also may in length of time   become our elements these piercing fires   as soft as now severe our temper changd   into their temper which must

such applause was heard                          290   as mammon ended and his sentence pleasd   advising peace for such another field   they dreaded worse then hell so much the fear   of thunder and the sword of michael   wrought still within them and no less desire   to found this nether empire which might rise   by pollicy and long process of time   in emulation opposite to heavn   which when beelzebub perceivd then whom   satan except none higher sat with grave                           300   aspect he rose and in his rising seemd   a pillar of state deep on his front engraven   deliberation sat and publick care   and princely counsel in his face yet shon   majestick though in ruin sage he stood   with atlantean shoulders fit to bear   the weight of mightiest monarchies his look   drew audience and attention still as night   or summers noontide air while thus he spake   thrones and imperial powers offspring of heavn                  310   ethereal vertues or these titles now   must we renounce and changing stile be calld   princes of hell for so the popular vote   inclines here to continue and build up here   a growing empire doubtless while we dream   and know not that the king of heavn hath doomd   this place our dungeon not our safe retreat   beyond his potent arm to live exempt   from heavns high jurisdiction in new league   banded against his throne but to remaine                           320   in strictest bondage though thus far removd   under th inevitable curb reservd   his captive multitude for he be sure   in highth or depth still first and last will reign   sole king and of his kingdom loose no part   by our revolt but over hell extend   his empire and with iron scepter rule   us here as with his golden those in heavn   what sit we then projecting peace and warr   warr hath determind us and foild with loss                        330   irreparable tearms of peace yet none   voutsaft or sought for what peace will be givn   to us enslavd but custody severe   and stripes and arbitrary punishment   inflicted and what peace can we return   but to our power hostility and hate   untamd reluctance and revenge though slow   yet ever plotting how the conquerour least   may reap his conquest and may least rejoyce   in doing what we most in suffering feel                            340   nor will occasion want nor shall we need   with dangerous expedition to invade   heavn whose high walls fear no assault or siege   or ambush from the deep what if we find   some easier enterprize there is a place   if ancient and prophetic fame in heavn   err not another world the happy seat   of som new race calld man about this time   to be created like to us though less   in power and excellence but favourd more                          350   of him who rules above so was his will   pronouncd among the gods and by an oath   that shook heavns whol circumference confirmd   thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn   what creatures there inhabit of what mould   or substance how endud and what thir power   and where thir weakness how attempted best   by force or suttlety though heavn be shut   and heavns high arbitrator sit secure   in his own strength this place may lye exposd                     360   the utmost border of his kingdom left   to their defence who hold it here perhaps   som advantagious act may be achievd   by sudden onset either with hell fire   to waste his whole creation or possess   all as our own and drive as we were driven   the punie habitants or if not drive   seduce them to our party that thir god   may prove thir foe and with repenting hand   abolish his own works this would surpass                           370   common revenge and interrupt his joy   in our confusion and our joy upraise   in his disturbance when his darling sons   hurld headlong to partake with us shall curse   thir frail originals and faded bliss   faded so soon advise if this be worth   attempting or to

have power and right   to question thy bold entrance on this place   imploid it seems to violate sleep and those   whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss   to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow   gabriel thou hadst in heavn th esteem of wise   and such i held thee but this question askt   puts me in doubt lives ther who loves his pain   who would not finding way break loose from hell   though thither doomd thou wouldst thy self no doubt              890   and boldly venture to whatever place   farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change   torment with ease  soonest

in scorn the warlike angel movd   disdainfully half smiling thus replid   o loss of one in heavn to judge of wise   since satan fell whom follie overthrew   and now returns him from his prison scapt   gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise   or not who ask what boldness brought him hither   unlicenct from his bounds in hell prescribd   so wise he judges it to fly from pain                               910   however and to scape his punishment   so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth   which thou incurrst by flying meet thy flight   seavenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell

his violence thou fearst not being such   as wee not capable of death or paine   can either not receave or can repell   his fraud is then thy fear which plain inferrs   thy equal fear that my firm

to make the way easier from hell to this world to and fro they pave a broad highway or bridge over chaos according to the track that satan first made then preparing for earth they meet him proud of

perish   with this corporeal clod then in the grave   or in some other dismal place who knows   but i shall die a living death o thought   horrid if true yet why it was but breath   of life that sinnd what dies but what had life                    790   and sin the bodie properly hath neither   all of me then shall die let this appease   the doubt since humane reach no further knows   for though the lord of all be infinite   is his wrauth also be it man is not so   but mortal doomd how can he exercise   wrath without end on man whom death must end   can he make deathless death that were to

1010   to better hopes his more attentive minde   labouring had raisd and thus to eve replid   eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems   to argue in thee somthing more sublime   and excellent then

god will deigne to dwell on earth                        280   so many and so various laws are givn   so many laws argue so many sins   among them how can god with such reside   to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin   will reign among them as of thee begot   and therefore was law given them to evince   thir natural pravitie by stirring up   sin against law to fight that when they see   law can discover sin but not remove   save by those shadowie expiations weak                             290   the bloud of bulls and goats they may conclude   some bloud more precious must be paid for man   just for unjust that in such righteousness   to them by faith imputed they may finde   justification towards god and peace   of conscience which the law by ceremonies   cannot appease nor man the moral part   perform and not performing cannot live   so law appears imperfet and but givn   with purpose to resign them in full time                            300   up to a better covnant

will said th angel but from heavn   hee to his own a comforter will send   the promise of the father who shall dwell   his spirit within them and the law of faith   working through love upon thir hearts shall write   to guide them in all truth and also arme   with spiritual armour able to resist                               490   satans assaults and quench his fierie darts   what man can do against them not affraid   though to the death against such cruelties   with inward consolations recompenct   and oft supported so as shall amaze   thir proudest persecuters for the spirit   powrd first on his apostles whom he sends   to evangelize the nations then on all   baptizd shall them with wondrous gifts endue   to speak all tongues and do all miracles                          500   as

bordering desert wild   and with dark shades and rocks environd round   his holy meditations thus persud   o what a multitude of thoughts at once   awaknd in me swarm while i consider   what from within i feel my self and hear   what from without comes often to my ears   ill sorting with my present state compard                         200   when i was yet a child no childish play   to me was pleasing all my mind was set   serious to learn and know and thence to do   what might be publick good my self i thought   born to that end born to promote all truth   all righteous things therefore above my years   the law of god i read and found it sweet   made it my whole delight and in it grew   to such perfection that ere yet my age   had measurd twice six years at our great feast                    210   i went into the temple there to hear   the teachers of our law and to propose   what might improve my knowledge or their own   and was admird by all yet this not all   to which my spirit aspird victorious deeds   flamd in my heart heroic acts one while   to rescue israel from the roman yoke   thence to subdue and quell ore all the earth   brute violence and proud tyrannick powr   till truth were freed and equity restord                        220   yet held it more humane more heavenly first   by winning words to conquer willing hearts   and make perswasion do the work of fear   at least to try and teach the erring soul   not wilfully misdoing but unware   misled the stubborn only to subdue   these growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving   by words at times cast forth inly rejoycd   and said to me apart high are thy thoughts   o son but nourish them and let them soar                           230   to what highth sacred vertue and true worth   can raise them though above example high   by matchless deeds express thy matchless sire   for know thou art no son of mortal man   though men esteem thee low of parentage   thy father is the eternal king who rules   all heaven and earth angels and sons of men   a messenger from god foretold thy birth   conceivd in me a virgin he foretold   thou shouldst be great and sit on davids throne                   240   and of thy kingdom there should be no end   at thy nativity a glorious quire   of angels in the fields of bethlehem sung   to shepherds watching at their folds by night   and told them the messiah now was born   where they might see him and to thee they came   directed to the manger where thou laist   for in the inn was left no better room   a star not seen before in heaven appearing   guided the wise men thither from the east                          250   to honour thee with incense myrrh and gold   by whose bright course led on they found the place   affirming it thy star new gravn in heaven   by which they knew thee king of israel born   just simeon and prophetic anna warnd   by vision found thee in the temple and spake   before the altar and the vested priest   like things of thee to all that present stood   this having heard strait i again revolvd   the law and prophets searching what was writ                       260   concerning the messiah to our scribes   known partly and soon found of whom they spake   i am this chiefly that my way must lie   through many a hard assay even to the death   ere i the promisd kingdom can attain   or work redemption for mankind whose sins   full weight must be transferrd upon my head   yet neither thus disheartnd or dismayd   the time prefixt i waited when behold   the baptist of whose birth i oft had heard                       270   not knew by sight now come who was to come   before messiah and his way prepare   i as all others to his baptism came   which i believd was from above but he   strait knew me and with loudest voice proclaimd   me him for it was shewn him so from heaven   me him whose harbinger he was and first   refusd on me his baptism to confer   as much his greater and was hardly won   but as i rose out of the laving stream                             280   heaven opend her eternal doors from whence   the spirit descended on me like a dove   and last the sum of all my fathers voice   audibly heard from heavn pronouncd me his   me his beloved son in whom alone   he was well pleasd by which i knew the time   now full that i no more should live obscure   but openly begin as best becomes   the authority which i derivd from heaven   and now by some strong motion i am led                              290   into this wilderness to what intent   i learn not yet perhaps i need not know   for what concerns my knowledge god reveals   so spake our morning star then in his rise   and looking round on every side beheld   a pathless desert dusk with horrid shades   the way he came not having markd return   was difficult by humane steps untrod   and he still on was led but with such thoughts   accompanied of things past and to come                              300   lodgd in his brest as well might recommend   such solitude before choicest society   full forty days he passd whether on hill   sometimes anon in shady vale each night   under the covert of some ancient oak   or cedar to defend him from the dew   or harbourd in one cave is not reveald   nor tasted humane food nor hunger felt   till those days ended hungerd then at last   among wild beasts they at his sight grew mild                    310   nor sleeping him nor waking harmd his walk   the fiery serpent fled and noxious worm   the lion and fierce tiger glard aloof   but now an aged man in rural weeds   following as seemd the quest of some stray ewe   or witherd sticks to gather which might serve   against a winters day when winds blow keen   to warm him wet returnd from field at eve   he saw approach who first with curious eye   perusd him then with words thus uttred spake                    320   sir what ill chance hath brought thee to this place   so far from path or road of men who pass   in troop or caravan for single  none   durst ever who returnd and dropt not here   his carcass  pind with hunger and with droughth   i ask the rather and the more admire   for that to me thou seemst the man whom late   our new baptizing prophet at the ford   of jordan honourd so and calld thee son   of god i saw and heard for we sometimes                           330   who dwell this wild constraind by want come forth   to town or village nigh nighest is far   where ought we hear and curious are to hear   what happns new fame also finds us out   to whom the son of god  who brought me hither   will bring me hence no other guide i seek   by miracle he may replyd the swain   what other way i see not for we here   live on tough roots and stubs to thirst inurd   more then the camel and to drink go far                           340   men to much misery and hardship born   but if thou be the son of god command   that out of these hard stones be made thee bread   so shalt thou save thy self and us relieve   with food whereof we wretched seldom taste   he ended and the son of god replyd   thinkst thou such force in bread is it not written   for i discern thee other then thou seemst   man lives not by bread only but each word   proceeding from the mouth of god who fed                           350   our fathers here with manna in the mount   moses was forty days nor eat nor drank   and forty days eliah without food   wandred this barren waste the same i now   why dost thou then suggest to me distrust   knowing who i am as i know who thou art   whom thus answerd th arch fiend now undisguisd   tis true i am that spirit unfortunate   who leagud with millions more in rash revolt   kept not my happy station but was drivn                           360   with them from bliss to the bottomless deep   vet to that hideous place not so confind   by rigour unconniving but that oft   leaving my dolorous prison i enjoy   large liberty to round this globe of earth   or range in th air nor from the heavn of heavns   hath he excluded my resort sometimes   i came among the sons of god when he   gave up into my hands uzzean job   to prove him and illustrate his high worth                        370   and when to all his angels he proposd   to draw the proud king ahab into fraud   that he might fall in ramoth they demurring   i undertook that office and the tongues   of all his flattering prophets glibbd with lyes   to his destruction as i had in charge   for what he bids i do though i have lost   much lustre of my native brightness lost   to be belovd of god i have not lost   to love at least contemplate and admire                            380   what i see excellent in good or fair   or vertuous i should so have lost all sense   what can be then less in me then desire   to see thee and approach thee whom i know   declard the son of god to hear attent   thy wisdom and behold thy godlike deeds   men generally think me much a foe   to all mankind why should i they to me   never did wrong or violence by them   i lost not what i lost rather by them                              390   i gaind what i have gaind and with them dwell   copartner in these regions of the world   if not disposer lend them oft my aid   oft my advice by presages and signs   and answers oracles portents and dreams   whereby they may direct their future life   envy they say excites me thus to gain   companions of my misery and wo   at first it may be but long since with wo   nearer acquainted now i feel by proof                             400   that fellowship in pain divides not smart   nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load   small consolation then were man adjoynd   this wounds me most what can it less that man   man falln shall be restord i never more   to whom our saviour sternly thus replyd   deservedly thou grievst composd of lyes   from the beginning and in lies wilt end   who boastst release from hell and leave to come   into the heavn of heavens thou comst indeed                     410   as a poor miserable captive thrall   comes to the place where he before had sat   among the prime in splendour now deposd   ejected emptyed gazd unpityed shund   a spectacle of ruin or of scorn   to all the host of heaven the happy place   imparts to thee no happiness no joy   rather inflames thy torment representing   lost bliss to thee no more communicable   so never more in hell then when in heaven                          420   but thou art serviceable to heavens king   wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear   extorts or pleasure to do ill excites   what but thy malice movd thee to misdeem   of righteous job then cruelly to afflict him   with all inflictions but his patience won   the other service was thy chosen task   to be a lyer in four hundred mouths   for lying is thy sustenance thy food   yet thou pretendst to truth all oracles                           430   by thee are givn and what confest more true   among the nations that hath been thy craft   by mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes   but what have been thy answers what but dark   ambiguous and with double sense deluding   which they who askd have seldom understood   and not well understood as good not known   who ever by consulting at thy shrine   returnd the wiser or the more instruct   to flye or follow what concernd him most                          440   and run not sooner to his fatal snare   for god hath justly givn the nations up   to thy delusions justly since they fell   idolatrous but when his purpose is   among them to declare his providence   to thee not known whence hast thou then thy truth   but from him or his angels president   in every province who themselves disdaining   to approach thy temples give thee in command   what to the smallest tittle thou shalt say                          450   to thy adorers thou with trembling fear   or like a fawning parasite obeyst   then to thy self ascribst the truth foretold   but this thy glory shall be soon retrenchd   no more shalt thou by oracling abuse   the gentiles henceforth oracles are ceast   and thou no more with pomp and sacrifice   shalt be enquird at delphos or elsewhere   at least in vain for they shall find thee mute   god hath now sent his living oracle                                 460   into the world to teach his final will   and sends his spirit of truth henceforth to dwell   in pious hearts an inward oracle   to all truth requisite for men to know   so spake our saviour but the subtle fiend   though inly stung with anger and disdain   dissembld and this answer smooth returnd   sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke   and urgd me hard with doings which not will   but misery hath rested from me where                               470   easily canst thou find one miserable   and not inforcd ofttimes to part from truth   if it may stand him more in stead to lye   say and unsay feign flatter or abjure   but thou art plact above me thou art lord   from thee i can and must submiss endure   check or reproof and glad to scape so quit   hard are the ways of truth and rough to walk   smooth on the tongue discourst pleasing to th ear   and tuneable as silvan pipe or song                               480   what wonder then if i delight to hear   her dictates from thy mouth most men admire   vertue who follow not her lore permit me   to hear thee when i come since no man comes   and talk at least though i despair to attain   thy father who is holy wise and pure   suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest   to tread his sacred courts and minister   about his altar handling holy things   praying or vowing and vouchsafd his voice                         490   to balaam reprobate a prophet yet   inspird disdain not such access to me   to whom our saviour with unalterd brow   thy coming hither though i know thy scope   i bid not or forbid do as thou findst   permission from above thou canst not more   he added not and satan bowing low   his

wilderness   the rest commit to me i shall let pass   no advantage and his strength as oft assay   he ceasd and heard thir grant in loud acclaim   then forthwith to him takes a chosen band   of spirits likest to himself in guile   to be at hand and at his beck appear   if cause were to unfold some active scene   of various persons each to know his part                           240   then to the desert takes with these his flight   where still from shade to shade the son of god   after forty days fasting had remaind   now hungring first and to himself thus said   where will this end four times ten days i have passd   wandring this woody maze and humane food   nor tasted nor had appetite that fast   to vertue i impute not or count part   of what i suffer here if nature need not   or god support nature without repast                                250   though needing what praise is it to endure   but now i feel i hunger which declares   nature hath need of what she asks yet god   can satisfie that need some other way   though hunger still remain so it remain   without this bodies wasting i content me   and from the sting of famine fear no harm   nor mind it fed with better thoughts that feed   mee hungring more to do my fathers will   it was the hour of night when thus the son                         260   commund in silent walk then laid him down   under the hospitable covert nigh   of trees thick interwoven there he slept   and dreamd as appetite is wont to dream   of meats and drinks natures refreshment sweet   him thought he by the brook of cherith stood   and saw the ravens with thir horny beaks   food to elijah bringing even and morn   though ravenous taught to abstain from what they brought   he saw the prophet also how he fled                                 270   into the desert and how there he slept   under a juniper then how awakt   he found his supper on the coals prepard   and by the angel was bid rise and eat   and eat the second time after repose   the strength whereof sufficd him forty days   sometimes that with elijah he partook   or as a guest with daniel at his pulse   thus wore out night and now the herald lark   left his groundnest high towring to descry                        280   the morns approach and greet her with his song   as lightly from his grassy couch up rose   our saviour and found all was but a dream   fasting he went to sleep and fasting wakd   up to a hill anon his steps he reard   from whose high top to ken the prospect round   if cottage were in view sheepcote or herd   but cottage herd or sheepcote none he saw   only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove   with chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud                       290   thither he bent his way determind there   to rest at noon and entrd soon the shade   high rooft and walks beneath and alleys brown   that opend in the midst a woody scene   natures own work it seemd nature taught art   and to a superstitious eye the haunt   of woodgods and woodnymphs he viewd it round   when suddenly a man before him stood   not rustic as before but seemlier clad   as one in city or court or palace bred                           300   and with fair speech these words to him addressd   with granted leave officious i return   but much more wonder that the son of god   in this wild solitude so long should bide   of all things destitute and well i know   not without hunger  others of some note   as story tells have trod this wilderness   the fugitive bondwoman with her son   out cast nebaioth yet found he relief   by a providing

  how hast thou hunger then  satan replyd   tell me if food were now before thee set                           320   wouldst thou not eat  thereafter as i like   the giver answerd jesus why should that   cause thy refusal said the subtle fiend   hast thou not right to all created things   owe not all creatures by just right to thee   duty and service nor to stay till bid   but tender all their power nor mention i   meats by the law unclean or offerd first   to idols those young daniel could refuse   nor profferd by an enemy though who                               330   would scruple that with want opprest behold   nature ashamd or better to express   troubld that thou shouldst hunger hath purveyd   from all the elements her choicest store   to treat thee as beseems and as her lord   with honour only deign to sit and eat   he spake no dream for as his words had end   our saviour lifting up his eyes beheld   in ample space under the broadest shade   a table richly spred in regal

then ganymed or hylas distant more   under the trees now tripd now solemn stood   nymphs of dianas train and naiades   with fruits and flowers from amaltheas horn   and ladies of th hesperides that seemd   fairer then feignd of old or fabld since   of fairy damsels met in forest wide   by knights of logres or of lyones                                 360   lancelot or pelleas or pellenore   and all the while harmonious airs were heard   of chiming strings or charming pipes and winds   of gentlest gale arabian odors fannd   from their soft wings and floras earliest smells   such was the splendour and the tempter now   his invitation earnestly renewd   what doubts the son of god to sit and eat   these are not fruits forbidden no interdict   defends the touching of these viands pure                          370   thir taste no knowledge works at least of evil   but life preserves destroys lifes enemy   hunger with sweet restorative delight   all these are spirits of air and woods and springs   thy gentle ministers who come to pay   thee homage and acknowledge thee thir lord   what doubtst thou son of god sit down and eat   to whom thus jesus temperately replyd   saidst thou not that to all things i had right   and who withholds my powr that right to use                       380   shall i receive by gift what of my own   when and where likes me best i can command   i can at will doubt not as soon as thou   command a table in this wilderness   and call swift flights of angels ministrant   arrayd in glory on my cup to attend   why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence   in vain where no acceptance it can find   and with my hunger what hast thou to do   thy pompous delicacies i contemn                                   390   and count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles   to whom thus answerd satan malecontent   that i have also power to give thou seest   if of that powr i bring thee voluntary   what i might have bestowd on whom i pleasd   and rather opportunely in this place   chose to impart to thy apparent need   why shouldst thou not accept it but i see   what i can do or offer is suspect   of these things others quickly will dispose

to shew forth his goodness and impart   his good communicable to every soul   freely of whom what could he less expect   then glory and benediction that is thanks   the slightest easiest readiest

thou callst them those ten tribes   i must deliver if i mean to raign   davids true heir and his full scepter sway   to just extent over all israels sons   but whence to thee this zeal where was it

monster what if i withal   expel a devil who first made him such   let his tormenter conscience find him out                          130   for him i was not sent nor yet to free   that people victor

free   know therefore when my season comes to sit   on davids throne it shall be like a tree   spreading and overshadowing all the earth   or as a stone that shall to pieces dash   all monarchies besides throughout the world                        150   and of my kingdom there shall be no end   means there shall be to this but what the means   is not for thee to know nor me to tell   to whom the tempter impudent replid   i see all offers made by me how slight   thou valust because offerd and rejectst   nothing will please the difficult and nice   or nothing more then still to contradict   on the other side know also thou that i   on what i offer set as high esteem                                 160   nor what i part with mean to give for naught   all these which in a moment thou beholdst   the kingdoms of the world to thee i give   for givn to me i give to whom i please   no trifle yet with this reserve not else   on this condition if thou wilt fall down   and worship me as thy superior lord   easily done and hold them all of me   for what can less so great a gift deserve   whom thus our saviour answerd with disdain                        170   i never likd thy talk thy

that on eve                           180   and more blasphemous which expect to rue   the kingdoms of the world to thee were givn   permitted rather and by thee usurpt   other donation none thou

composd hath been ever held the gravest moralest and most profitable of all other poems therefore said by aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear or terror to purge the mind of those and such like passions that is to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight stirrd up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated nor is nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion for so in physic things of melancholic hue and quality are usd against melancholy sowr against sowr salt to remove salt humours hence philosophers and other gravest writers as cicero plutarch and others frequently cite out of tragic poets both to adorn and illustrate thir discourse  the apostle paul himself thought it not unworthy to insert a verse of euripides into the text of holy scripture i cor 15 33 and paraeus commenting on the revelation divides the whole book as a tragedy into acts distinguisht each by a chorus of heavenly harpings and song between  heretofore men in highest dignity have labourd not a little to be thought able to compose a tragedy  of that honour dionysius the elder was no less ambitious then before of his attaining to the tyranny augustus caesar also had begun his ajax but unable to please his own judgment with what he had begun left it unfinisht  seneca the philosopher is by some thought the author of those tragedies at lest the best of them that go under that name  gregory nazianzen a father of the church thought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a tragedy which he entitld christ suffering this is mentiond to vindicate tragedy from the small esteem or rather infamy which in the account of many it undergoes at this day with other common interludes hapning through the poets error of intermixing comic stuff with tragic sadness and gravity or introducing trivial and vulgar persons which by all judicious hath bin counted absurd and brought in without discretion corruptly to gratifie the people and though antient tragedy use no prologue yet using sometimes in case of self defence or explanation that which martial calls an epistle in behalf of this tragedy coming forth after the antient manner much different from what among us passes for best thus much beforehand may be epistld that chorus is here introducd after the greek manner not antient only but modern and still in use among the italians in the modelling therefore of this poem with good reason the antients and italians are rather followd as of much more authority and fame the measure of verse usd in the chorus is of all sorts calld by the greeks monostrophic or rather apolelymenon without regard had to strophe antistrophe or epod which were a kind of stanzas framd only for the music then usd with the chorus that sung not essential to the poem and therefore not material or being divided into stanzas or pauses they may be calld allaeostropha  division into act and scene referring chiefly to the stage to which this work never was intended is here omitted  it suffices if the whole drama be found not product beyond the fift act of the style and uniformitie and that commonly calld the plot whether intricate or explicit which is nothing indeed but such oeconomy or disposition of the fable as may stand best with verisimilitude and decorum they only will best judge who are not unacquainted with aeschulus sophocles and euripides the three tragic poets unequalld yet by any and the best rule to all who endeavour to write tragedy the circumscription of time wherein the whole drama begins and ends is

festival day in the general cessation from labour comes forth into the open air to a place nigh somewhat retird there to sit a while and bemoan his condition where he happens at length to be visited by certain friends and equals of his tribe which make the chorus who seek to comfort him what they can then by his old father manoa who endeavours the like and withal tells him his purpose to procure his liberty by ransom lastly that this feast was proclaimd by the philistins as a day of thanksgiving for thir deliverance from the hands of samson which yet more troubles him manoa then departs to prosecute his endeavour with the philistian lords for samsons redemption who in the mean while is visited by other persons and lastly by a publick officer to require coming to the feast before the lords and people to play or shew his strength in thir presence he at first refuses dismissing the publick officer with absolute denyal to come at length perswaded inwardly that this was from god he yields to go along with him who came now the second time with great threatnings to fetch him the chorus yet remaining on the place manoa returns full of joyful hope to procure ere long his sons

perswade me god had not permitted   his strength again to grow up with his hair   garrisond round about him like a camp   of faithful souldiery were not his purpose   to use him further yet in some great service   not to sit idle with so great a gift                               1500   useless and thence ridiculous about him   and since his strength with eyesight was not lost   god will restore

be brought forth to shew the people   proof of his mighty strength in feats and games   i sorrowd at his captive state but minded   not to be absent at that spectacle   the building was a spacious theatre   half round on two main pillars vaulted high   with seats where all the lords and each degree   of sort might sit in order to behold   the other side was opn where the throng   on banks and scaffolds under skie might stand                     1610   i among these aloof obscurely stood   the feast and noon grew high and sacrifice   had filld thir hearts with mirth high chear  wine   when

thir dreadful enemy thir thrall   he patient but undaunted where they led him   came to the place and what was set before him   which without help of eye might be assayd   to heave pull draw or break

       1630   for so from such as nearer stood we heard   as overtird to let him lean a while   with both his arms on those two massie pillars   that to the arched roof gave main support   he unsuspitious led him which when samson   felt in his arms with head a while enclind   and eyes fast fixt he stood as one who prayd   or some great matter in his mind revolvd   at last with head erect thus cryed aloud   hitherto lords what your commands imposd                        1640   i have performd as reason was obeying   not without wonder or delight beheld   now of my own accord such other
