86771053	arms and the man  by george bernard shaw     introduction  to the irreverentand which of us will claim entire exemption from that comfortable classificationthere is something very amusing in the attitude of the orthodox criticism toward bernard shaw he so obviously disregards all the canons and unities and other things which every wellbred dramatist is bound to respect that his work is really unworthy of serious criticism orthodox indeed he knows no more about the dramatic art than according to his own story in the man of destiny napoleon at tavazzano knew of the art of war but both men were successes each in his waythe latter won victories and the former gained audiences in the very teeth of the accepted theories of war and the theatre shaw does not know that it is unpardonable sin to have his characters make long speeches at one another apparently thinking that this embargo applies only to long speeches which consist mainly of bombast and rhetoric there never was an author who showed less predilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his results he recognized early in his days many things awry in the world and he assumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit it seems such a small job at twenty to set the times aright he began as an essayist but who reads essays nowadayshe then turned novelist with no better success for no one would read such preposterous stuff as he chose to emit he only succeeded in proving that absolutely rational men and womenalthough he has created few of the lattercan be most extremely disagreeable to our conventional way of thinking  as a last resort he turned to the stage not that he cared for the dramatic art for no man seems to care less about art for arts sake being in this a perfect foil to his brilliant compatriot and contemporary wilde he cast his theories in dramatic forms merely because no other course except silence or physical revolt was open to him for a long time it seemed as if this resource too was doomed to fail him but finally he has attained a hearing and now attempts at suppression merely serve to advertise their victim  it will repay those who seek analogies in literature to compare shaw with cervantes after a life of heroic endeavor disappointment slavery and poverty the author of don quixote gave the world a serious work which caused to be laughed off the worlds stage forever the final vestiges of decadent chivalry  the institution had long been outgrown but its vernacular continued to be the speech and to express the thought of the world and among the vulgar as the quaint old novelist puts it just as today the novel intended for the consumption of the unenlightened must deal with peers and millionaires and be dressed in stilted language marvellously he succeeded but in a way he least intended we have not yet after so many years determined whether it is a work to laugh or cry over it is our joyfullest modern book says carlyle while landor thinks that readers who see nothing more than a burlesque in don quixote have but shallow appreciation of the work  shaw in like manner comes upon the scene when many of our social usages are outworn he sees the fact announces it and we burst into guffaws the continuous laughter which greets shaws plays arises from a real contrast in the point of view of the dramatist and his audiences when pinero or jones describes a whimsical situation we never doubt for a moment that the authors point of view is our own and that the abnormal predicament of his characters appeals to him in the same light as to his audience with shaw this sense of community of feeling is wholly lacking he describes things as he sees them and the house is in a roar who is right if we were really using our own senses and not gazing through the glasses of convention and romance and makebelieve should we see things as shaw does  must it not cause shaw to doubt his own or the publics sanity to hear audiences laughing boisterously over tragic situations and yet if they did not come to laugh they would not come at all mockery is the price he must pay for a hearing or has he calculated to a nicety the power of reaction does he seek to drive us to aspiration by the portrayal of sordidness to disinterestedness by the picture of selfishness to illusion by disillusionment it is impossible to believe that he is unconscious of the humor of his dramatic situations yet he stoically gives no sign he even dares the charge terrible in proportion to its truth which the most serious of us shrinks fromthe lack of a sense of humor men would rather have their integrity impugned  in arms and the man the subject which occupies the dramatists attention is that survival of barbaritymilitarismwhich raises its horrid head from time to time to cast a doubt on the reality of our civilization no more hoary superstition survives than that the donning of a uniform changes the nature of the wearer this notion pervades society to such an extent that when we find some soldiers placed upon the stage acting rationally our conventionalized senses are shocked the only men who have no illusions about war are those who have recently been there and of course mr shaw who has no illusions about anything  it is hard to speak too highly of candida no equally subtle and incisive study of domestic relations exists in the english drama one has to turn to george merediths the egoist to find such character dissection the central note of the play is that with the true woman weakness which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful than strength which offers protection candida is quite unpoetic as indeed with rare exceptions women are prone to be they have small delight in poetry but are the stuff of which poems and dreams are made the husband glorying in his strength but convicted of his weakness the poet pitiful in his physical impotence but strong in his perception of truth the hopelessly demoralized manufacturer the conventional and hence emotional typist make up a group which the drama of any language may be challenged to rival  in the man of destiny the object of the dramatist is not so much the destruction as the explanation of the napoleonic tradition which has so powerfully influenced generation after generation for a century however the man may be regarded he was a miracle shaw shows that he achieved his extraordinary career by suspending for himself the pressure of the moral and conventional atmosphere while leaving it operative for others those who study this playextravaganza that it iswill attain a clearer comprehension of napoleon than they can get from all the biographies  you never can tell offers an amusing study of the play of social conventions the twins illustrate the disconcerting effects of that perfect frankness which would make life intolerable gloria demonstrates the powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts the idea that parental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such knowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned crampton the father typifies the common superstition that among the privileges of parenthood are inflexibility tyranny and respect the last entirely regardless of whether it has been deserved  the waiter william is the best illustration of the man who knows his place that the stage has seen he is the most pathetic figure of the play one touch of verisimilitude is lacking none of the guests gives him a tip yet he maintains his urbanity as mr shaw has not yet visited america he may be unaware of the improbability of this situation  to those who regard literary men merely as purveyors of amusement for people who have not wit enough to entertain themselves ibsen and shaw maeterlinck and gorky must remain enigmas it is so much pleasanter to ignore than to face unpleasant realitiesto take riverside drive and not mulberry street as the exponent of our life and the expression of our civilization these men are the sappers and miners of the advancing army of justice the audience which demands the truth and despises the contemptible conventions that dominate alike our stage and our life is daily growing shaw and men like himif indeed he is not absolutely uniquewill not for the future lack a hearing  m       arms and the man  act i      night a ladys bedchamber in bulgaria in a small     town near the dragoman pass it is late in     november in the year 1885 and through an open     window with a little balcony on the left can be     seen a peak of the balkans wonderfully white and     beautiful in the starlit snow the interior of the     room is not like anything to be seen in the east     of europe it is half rich bulgarian half cheap     viennese the counterpane and hangings of the bed     the window curtains the little carpet and all     the ornamental textile fabrics in the room are     oriental and gorgeous the paper on the walls is     occidental and paltry above the head of the bed     which stands against a little wall cutting off the     right hand corner of the room diagonally is a     painted wooden shrine blue and gold with an     ivory image of christ and a light hanging before     it in a pierced metal ball suspended by three     chains on the left further forward is an     ottoman the washstand against the wall on the     left consists of an enamelled iron basin with a     pail beneath it in a painted metal frame and a     single towel on the rail at the side a chair near     it is austrian bent wood with cane seat the     dressing table between the bed and the window is     an ordinary pine table covered with a cloth of     many colors but with an expensive toilet mirror     on it the door is on the right and there is a     chest of drawers between the door and the bed     this chest of drawers is also covered by a     variegated native cloth and on it there is a pile     of paper backed novels a box of chocolate creams     and a miniature easel on which is a large     photograph of an extremely handsome officer whose     lofty bearing and magnetic glance can be felt even     from the portrait the room is lighted by a candle     on the chest of drawers and another on the     dressing table with a box of matches beside it      the window is hinged doorwise and stands wide     open folding back to the left outside a pair of     wooden shutters opening outwards also stand     open on the balcony a young lady intensely     conscious of the romantic beauty of the night and     of the fact that her own youth and beauty is a part     of it is on the balcony gazing at the snowy     balkans she is covered by a long mantle of furs     worth on a moderate estimate about three times     the furniture of her room      her reverie is interrupted by her mother     catherine petkoff a woman over forty imperiously     energetic with magnificent black hair and eyes     who might be a very splendid specimen of the wife     of a mountain farmer but is determined to be a     viennese lady and to that end wears a fashionable     tea gown on all occasions  catherine entering hastily full of good news rainashe pronounces it raheena with the stress on the ee rainashe goes to the bed expecting to find raina there why whereraina looks into the room heavens child are you out in the night air instead of in your bed youll catch your death louka told me you were asleep  raina coming in i sent her away i wanted to be alone the stars are so beautiful what is the matter  catherine such news there has been a battle  raina her eyes dilating ah she throws the cloak on the ottoman and comes eagerly to catherine in her nightgown a pretty garment but evidently the only one she has on  catherine a great battle at slivnitza a victory and it was won by sergius  raina with a cry of delight ah rapturously oh mother then with sudden anxiety is father safe  catherine of course he sent me the news sergius is the hero of the hour the idol of the regiment  raina tell me tell me how was it ecstatically oh mother mother mother raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman and they kiss one another frantically  catherine with surging enthusiasm you cant guess how splendid it is a cavalry chargethink of that he defied our russian commandersacted without ordersled a charge on his own responsibilityheaded it himselfwas the first man to sweep through their guns cant you see it raina our gallant splendid bulgarians with their swords and eyes flashing thundering down like an avalanche and scattering the wretched servian dandies like chaff and youyou kept sergius waiting a year before you would be betrothed to him oh if you have a drop of bulgarian blood in your veins you will worship him when he comes back  raina what will he care for my poor little worship after the acclamations of a whole army of heroes but no matter i am so happyso proud she rises and walks about excitedly it proves that all our ideas were real after all  catherine indignantly our ideas real what do you mean  raina our ideas of what sergius would doour patriotismour heroic ideals oh what faithless little creatures girls arei sometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams when i buckled on sergiuss sword he looked so noble it was treason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure and yetand yetquickly promise me youll never tell him  catherine dont ask me for promises until i know what i am promising  raina well it came into my head just as he was holding me in his arms and looking into my eyes that perhaps we only had our heroic ideas because we are so fond of reading byron and pushkin and because we were so delighted with the opera that season at bucharest real life is so seldom like thatindeed never as far as i knew it then remorsefully only think mother i doubted him i wondered whether all his heroic qualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination when he went into a real battle i had an uneasy fear that he might cut a poor figure there beside all those clever russian officers  catherine a poor figure shame on you the servians have austrian officers who are just as clever as our russians but we have beaten them in every battle for all that  raina laughing and sitting down again yes i was only a prosaic little coward oh to think that it was all truethat sergius is just as splendid and noble as he looksthat the world is really a glorious world for women who can see its glory and men who can act its romance what happiness what unspeakable fulfilment ah she throws herself on her knees beside her mother and flings her arms passionately round her they are interrupted by the entry of louka a handsome proud girl in a pretty bulgarian peasants dress with double apron so defiant that her servility to raina is almost insolent she is afraid of catherine but even with her goes as far as she dares she is just now excited like the others but she has no sympathy for rainas raptures and looks contemptuously at the ecstasies of the two before she addresses them  louka if you please madam all the windows are to be closed and the shutters made fast they say there may be shooting in the streets raina and catherine rise together alarmed the servians are being chased right back through the pass and they say they may run into the town our cavalry will be after them and our people will be ready for them you may be sure now that they are running away she goes out on the balcony and pulls the outside shutters to then steps back into the room  raina i wish our people were not so cruel what glory is there in killing wretched fugitives  catherine businesslike her housekeeping instincts aroused i must see that everything is made safe downstairs  raina to louka leave the shutters so that i can just close them if i hear any noise  catherine authoritatively turning on her way to the door oh no dear you must keep them fastened you would be sure to drop off to sleep and leave them open make them fast louka  louka yes madam she fastens them  raina dont be anxious about me the moment i hear a shot i shall blow out the candles and roll myself up in bed with my ears well covered  catherine quite the wisest thing you can do my love goodnight  raina goodnight they kiss one another and rainas emotion comes back for a moment wish me joy of the happiest night of my lifeif only there are no fugitives  catherine go to bed dear and dont think of them she goes out  louka secretly to raina if you would like the shutters open just give them a push like this she pushes them they open she pulls them to again one of them ought to be bolted at the bottom but the bolts gone  raina with dignity reproving her thanks louka but we must do what we are told louka makes a grimace goodnight  louka carelessly goodnight she goes out swaggering     raina left alone goes to the chest of drawers     and adores the portrait there with feelings that     are beyond all expression she does not kiss it or     press it to her breast or shew it any mark of     bodily affection but she takes it in her hands     and elevates it like a priestess  raina looking up at the picture with worship oh i shall never be unworthy of you any more my heronever never never      she replaces it reverently and selects a novel     from the little pile of books she turns over the     leaves dreamily finds her page turns the book     inside out at it and then with a happy sigh     gets into bed and prepares to read herself to     sleep but before abandoning herself to fiction     she raises her eyes once more thinking of the     blessed reality and murmurs  my hero my hero      a distant shot breaks the quiet of the night     outside she starts listening and two more     shots much nearer follow startling her so that     she scrambles out of bed and hastily blows out     the candle on the chest of drawers then putting     her fingers in her ears she runs to the     dressingtable and blows out the light there and     hurries back to bed the room is now in darkness     nothing is visible but the glimmer of the light in     the pierced ball before the image and the     starlight seen through the slits at the top of the     shutters the firing breaks out again there is a     startling fusillade quite close at hand whilst it     is still echoing the shutters disappear pulled     open from without and for an instant the     rectangle of snowy starlight flashes out with the     figure of a man in black upon it the shutters     close immediately and the room is dark again but     the silence is now broken by the sound of panting     then there is a scrape and the flame of a match     is seen in the middle of the room  raina crouching on the bed whos there the match is out instantly whos there who is that  a mans voice in the darkness subduedly but threateningly shsh dont call out or youll be shot be good and no harm will happen to you she is heard leaving her bed and making for the door take care theres no use in trying to run away remember if you raise your voice my pistol will go off commandingly strike a light and let me see you do you hear another moment of silence and darkness then she is heard retreating to the dressingtable she lights a candle and the mystery is at an end a man of about 35 in a deplorable plight bespattered with mud and blood and snow his belt and the strap of his revolver case keeping together the torn ruins of the blue coat of a servian artillery officer as far as the candlelight and his unwashed unkempt condition make it possible to judge he is a man of middling stature and undistinguished appearance with strong neck and shoulders a roundish obstinate looking head covered with short crisp bronze curls clear quick blue eyes and good brows and mouth a hopelessly prosaic nose like that of a strongminded baby trim soldierlike carriage and energetic manner and with all his wits about him in spite of his desperate predicamenteven with a sense of humor of it without however the least intention of trifling with it or throwing away a chance he reckons up what he can guess about rainaher age her social position her character the extent to which she is frightenedat a glance and continues more politely but still most determinedly excuse my disturbing you but you recognise my uniformservian if im caught i shall be killed determinedly do you understand that  raina yes  man well i dont intend to get killed if i can help it still more determinedly do you understand that he locks the door with a snap  raina disdainfully i suppose not she draws herself up superbly and looks him straight in the face saying with emphasis some soldiers i know are afraid of death  man with grim goodhumor all of them dear lady all of them believe me it is our duty to live as long as we can and kill as many of the enemy as we can now if you raise an alarm  raina cutting him short you will shoot me how do you know that i am afraid to die  man cunningly ah but suppose i dont shoot you what will happen then why a lot of your cavalrythe greatest blackguards in your armywill burst into this pretty room of yours and slaughter me here like a pig for ill fight like a demon they shant get me into the street to amuse themselves with i know what they are are you prepared to receive that sort of company in your present undress raina suddenly conscious of her nightgown instinctively shrinks and gathers it more closely about her he watches her and adds pitilessly its rather scanty eh she turns to the ottoman he raises his pistol instantly and cries stop she stops where are you going  raina with dignified patience only to get my cloak  man darting to the ottoman and snatching the cloak a good idea no ill keep the cloak and you will take care that nobody comes in and sees you without it this is a better weapon than the pistol he throws the pistol down on the ottoman  raina revolted it is not the weapon of a gentleman  man its good enough for a man with only you to stand between him and death as they look at one another for a moment raina hardly able to believe that even a servian officer can be so cynically and selfishly unchivalrous they are startled by a sharp fusillade in the street the chill of imminent death hushes the mans voice as he adds do you hear if you are going to bring those scoundrels in on me you shall receive them as you are raina meets his eye with unflinching scorn suddenly he starts listening there is a step outside someone tries the door and then knocks hurriedly and urgently at it raina looks at the man breathless he throws up his head with the gesture of a man who sees that it is all over with him and dropping the manner which he has been assuming to intimidate her flings the cloak to her exclaiming sincerely and kindly no use im done for quick wrap yourself up theyre coming  raina catching the cloak eagerly oh thank you she wraps herself up with great relief he draws his sabre and turns to the door waiting  louka outside knocking my lady my lady get up quick and open the door  raina anxiously what will you do  man grimly never mind keep out of the way it will not last long  raina impulsively ill help you hide yourself oh hide yourself quick behind the curtain she seizes him by a torn strip of his sleeve and pulls him towards the window  man yielding to her there is just half a chance if you keep your head remember nine soldiers out of ten are born fools he hides behind the curtain looking out for a moment to say finally if they find me i promise you a fighta devil of a fight he disappears raina takes of the cloak and throws it across the foot of the bed then with a sleepy disturbed air she opens the door louka enters excitedly  louka a man has been seen climbing up the waterpipe to your balconya servian the soldiers want to search for him and they are so wild and drunk and furious my lady says you are to dress at once  raina as if annoyed at being disturbed they shall not search here why have they been let in  catherine coming in hastily raina darling are you safe have you seen anyone or heard anything  raina i heard the shooting surely the soldiers will not dare come in here  catherine i have found a russian officer thank heaven he knows sergius speaking through the door to someone outside sir will you come in now my daughter is ready      a young russian officer in bulgarian uniform      enters sword in hand  the officer with soft feline politeness and stiff military carriage good evening gracious lady i am sorry to intrude but there is a fugitive hiding on the balcony will you and the gracious lady your mother please to withdraw whilst we search  raina petulantly nonsense sir you can see that there is no one on the balcony she throws the shutters wide open and stands with her back to the curtain where the man is hidden pointing to the moonlit balcony a couple of shots are fired right under the window and a bullet shatters the glass opposite raina who winks and gasps but stands her ground whilst catherine screams and the officer rushes to the balcony  the officer on the balcony shouting savagely down to the street cease firing there you fools do you hear cease firing damn you he glares down for a moment then turns to raina trying to resume his polite manner could anyone have got in without your knowledge were you asleep  raina no i have not been to bed  the officer impatiently coming back into the room your neighbours have their heads so full of runaway servians that they see them everywhere politely gracious lady a thousand pardons goodnight military bow which raina returns coldly another to catherine who follows him out raina closes the shutters she turns and sees louka who has been watching the scene curiously  raina dont leave my mother louka whilst the soldiers are here louka glances at raina at the ottoman at the curtain then purses her lips secretively laughs to herself and goes out raina follows her to the door shuts it behind her with a slam and locks it violently the man immediately steps out from behind the curtain sheathing his sabre and dismissing the danger from his mind in a businesslike way  man a narrow shave but a miss is as good as a mile dear young lady your servant until death i wish for your sake i had joined the bulgarian army instead of the servian i am not a native servian  raina haughtily no you are one of the austrians who set the servians on to rob us of our national liberty and who officer their army for them we hate them  man austrian not i dont hate me dear young lady i am only a swiss fighting merely as a professional soldier i joined servia because it was nearest to me be generous youve beaten us hollow  raina have i not been generous  man nobleheroic but im not saved yet this particular rush will soon pass through but the pursuit will go on all night by fits and starts i must take my chance to get off during a quiet interval you dont mind my waiting just a minute or two do you  raina oh no i am sorry you will have to go into danger again motioning towards ottoman wont you sitshe breaks off with an irrepressible cry of alarm as she catches sight of the pistol the man all nerves shies like a frightened horse  man irritably dont frighten me like that what is it  raina your pistol it was staring that officer in the face all the time what an escape  man vexed at being unnecessarily terrified oh is that all  raina staring at him rather superciliously conceiving a poorer and poorer opinion of him and feeling proportionately more and more at her ease with him i am sorry i frightened you she takes up the pistol and hands it to him pray take it to protect yourself against me  man grinning wearily at the sarcasm as he takes the pistol no use dear young lady theres nothing in it its not loaded he makes a grimace at it and drops it disparagingly into his revolver case  raina load it by all means  man ive no ammunition what use are cartridges in battle i always carry chocolate instead and i finished the last cake of that yesterday  raina outraged in her most cherished ideals of manhood chocolate do you stuff your pockets with sweetslike a schoolboyeven in the field  man yes isnt it contemptible     raina stares at him unable to utter her     feelings then she sails away scornfully to the     chest of drawers and returns with the box of     confectionery in her hand  raina allow me i am sorry i have eaten them all except these she offers him the box  man ravenously youre an angel he gobbles the comfits creams delicious he looks anxiously to see whether there are any more there are none he accepts the inevitable with pathetic goodhumor and says with grateful emotion bless you dear lady you can always tell an old soldier by the inside of his holsters and cartridge boxes the young ones carry pistols and cartridges the old ones grub thank you he hands back the box she snatches it contemptuously from him and throws it away this impatient action is so sudden that he shies again ugh dont do things so suddenly gracious lady dont revenge yourself because i frightened you just now  raina superbly frighten me do you know sir that though i am only a woman i think i am at heart as brave as you  man i should think so you havent been under fire for three days as i have i can stand two days without shewing it much but no man can stand three days im as nervous as a mouse he sits down on the ottoman and takes his head in his hands would you like to see me cry  raina quickly no  man if you would all you have to do is to scold me just as if i were a little boy and you my nurse if i were in camp now theyd play all sorts of tricks on me  raina a little moved im sorry i wont scold you touched by the sympathy in her tone he raises his head and looks gratefully at her she immediately draws hack and says stiffly you must excuse me our soldiers are not like that she moves away from the ottoman  man oh yes they are there are only two sorts of soldiers old ones and young ones ive served fourteen years half of your fellows never smelt powder before why how is it that youve just beaten us sheer ignorance of the art of war nothing else indignantly i never saw anything so unprofessional  raina ironically oh was it unprofessional to beat you  man well come is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of machine guns with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw it  raina eagerly turning to him as all her enthusiasm and her dream of glory rush back on her did you see the great cavalry charge oh tell me about it describe it to me  man you never saw a cavalry charge did you  raina how could i  man ah perhaps notof course well its a funny sight its like slinging a handful of peas against a window pane first one comes then two or three close behind him and then all the rest in a lump  raina her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands ecstatically yes first onethe bravest of the brave  man prosaically hm you should see the poor devil pulling at his horse  raina why should he pull at his horse  man impatient of so stupid a question its running away with him of course do you suppose the fellow wants to get there before the others and be killed then they all come you can tell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing the old ones come bunched up under the number one guard they know that they are mere projectiles and that its no use trying to fight the wounds are mostly broken knees from the horses cannoning together  raina ugh but i dont believe the first man is a coward i believe he is a hero  man goodhumoredly thats what youd have said if youd seen the first man in the charge today  raina breathless ah i knew it tell metell me about him  man he did it like an operatic tenora regular handsome fellow with flashing eyes and lovely moustache shouting a warcry and charging like don quixote at the windmills we nearly burst with laughter at him but when the sergeant ran up as white as a sheet and told us theyd sent us the wrong cartridges and that we couldnt fire a shot for the next ten minutes we laughed at the other side of our mouths i never felt so sick in my life though ive been in one or two very tight places and i hadnt even a revolver cartridgenothing but chocolate wed no bayonetsnothing of course they just cut us to bits and there was don quixote flourishing like a drum major thinking hed done the cleverest thing ever known whereas he ought to be courtmartialled for it of all the fools ever let loose on a field of battle that man must be the very maddest he and his regiment simply committed suicideonly the pistol missed fire thats all  raina deeply wounded but steadfastly loyal to her ideals indeed would you know him again if you saw him  man shall i ever forget him she again goes to the chest of drawers he watches her with a vague hope that she may have something else for him to eat she takes the portrait from its stand and brings it to him  raina that is a photograph of the gentlemanthe patriot and heroto whom i am betrothed  man looking at it im really very sorry looking at her was it fair to lead me on he looks at the portrait again yes thats him not a doubt of it he stifles a laugh  raina quickly why do you laugh  man shamefacedly but still greatly tickled i didnt laugh i assure you at least i didnt mean to but when i think of him charging the windmills and thinking he was doing the finest thingchokes with suppressed laughter  raina sternly give me back the portrait sir  man with sincere remorse of course certainly im really very sorry she deliberately kisses it and looks him straight in the face before returning to the chest of drawers to replace it he follows her apologizing perhaps im quite wrong you know no doubt i am most likely he had got wind of the cartridge business somehow and knew it was a safe job  raina that is to say he was a pretender and a coward you did not dare say that before  man with a comic gesture of despair its no use dear lady i cant make you see it from the professional point of view as he turns away to get back to the ottoman the firing begins again in the distance  raina sternly as she sees him listening to the shots so much the better for you  man turning how  raina you are my enemy and you are at my mercy what would i do if i were a professional soldier  man ah true dear young lady youre always right i know how good you have been to me to my last hour i shall remember those three chocolate creams it was unsoldierly but it was angelic  raina coldly thank you and now i will do a soldierly thing you cannot stay here after what you have just said about my future husband but i will go out on the balcony and see whether it is safe for you to climb down into the street she turns to the window  man changing countenance down that waterpipe stop wait i cant i darent the very thought of it makes me giddy i came up it fast enough with death behind me but to face it now in cold bloodhe sinks on the ottoman its no use i give up im beaten give the alarm he drops his head in his hands in the deepest dejection  raina disarmed by pity come dont be disheartened she stoops over him almost maternally he shakes his head oh you are a very poor soldiera chocolate cream soldier come cheer up it takes less courage to climb down than to face captureremember that  man dreamily lulled by her voice no capture only means death and death is sleepoh sleep sleep sleep undisturbed sleep climbing down the pipe means doing somethingexerting myselfthinking death ten times over first  raina softly and wonderingly catching the rhythm of his weariness are you so sleepy as that  man ive not had two hours undisturbed sleep since the war began im on the staff you dont know what that means i havent closed my eyes for thirtysix hours  raina desperately but what am i to do with you  man staggering up of course i must do something he shakes himself pulls himself together and speaks with rallied vigour and courage you see sleep or no sleep hunger or no hunger tired or not tired you can always do a thing when you know it must be done well that pipe must be got downhe hits himself on the chest and addsdo you hear that you chocolate cream soldier he turns to the window  raina anxiously but if you fall  man i shall sleep as if the stones were a feather bed goodbye he makes boldly for the window and his hand is on the shutter when there is a terrible burst of firing in the street beneath  raina rushing to him

quite seriously she pouts and then resumes her patronizing tone i must tell you that my father holds the highest command of any bulgarian in our army he is proudly a major  man pretending to be deeply impressed a major bless me think of that  raina you shewed great ignorance in thinking that it was necessary to climb up to the balcony because ours is the only private house that has two rows of windows there is a flight of stairs inside to get up and down by  man stairs how grand you live in great luxury indeed dear young lady  raina do you know what a library is  man a library a roomful of books  raina yes we have one the only one in bulgaria  man actually a real library i should like to see that  raina affectedly i tell you these things to shew you that you are not in the house of ignorant country folk who would kill you the moment they saw your servian uniform but among civilized people we go to bucharest every year for the opera season and i have spent a whole month in vienna

contemptuously no  man stifling a heavy sigh of weariness then i dont know it  raina i thought you might have remembered the great scene where ernani flying from his foes just as you are tonight takes refuge in the castle of his bitterest enemy an old castilian noble the noble refuses to give him up his guest is sacred to him  man quickly waking up a little have your people got that notion  raina with dignity my mother and i can understand that notion as you call it and if instead of threatening me with your pistol as you did you had simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our hospitality you would have been as safe as in your fathers house  man quite sure  raina turning her back on him in disgust oh it is useless to try and make you understand  man dont be angry you see how awkward it would be for me if there was any mistake my father is a very hospitable man he keeps six hotels but i couldnt trust him as far as that what about your father  raina he is away at slivnitza fighting for his country i answer for your safety there is my hand in pledge of it will that reassure you she offers him her hand  man looking dubiously at his own hand better not touch my hand dear young lady

act of yawning she goes out  man drowsily sleep sleep sleep sleep sleethe words trail off into a murmur he wakes again with a shock on the point of falling where am i thats what i want to know where

looking for sleepdangerdont know he stumbles against the bed ah yes now i know all right now im to go to bed but not to sleepbe sure not to sleepbecause of danger not to lie down either only sit down he sits on the bed a blissful expression comes into his face ah with a happy sigh he sinks back at full length lifts his boots into the bed with a final effort and falls fast asleep instantly      catherine comes in followed by raina  raina looking at the ottoman hes gone i left him here  catherine here then he must have climbed down from the  raina seeing him oh she points  catherine

she looks sternly at her daughter the man sleeps profoundly     act ii      the sixth of march 1886 in the garden of major     petkoffs house it is a fine spring morning and     the garden looks fresh and pretty beyond the     paling the tops of a couple of minarets can be     seen shewing that there is a valley there with     the little town in it a few miles further the     balkan mountains rise and shut in the view within     the garden the side of the house is seen on the     right with a garden door reached by a little     flight of steps on the left the stable yard with     its gateway encroaches on the garden there are     fruit bushes along the paling and house covered     with washing hung out to dry a path runs by the     house and rises by two steps at the corner where     it turns out of the right along the front in the     middle a small table with two bent wood chairs at     it is laid for breakfast with turkish coffee pot     cups rolls etc but the cups have been used and     the bread broken there is a wooden garden seat     against the wall on the left      louka smoking a cigaret is standing between the     table and the house turning her back with angry     disdain on a manservant who is lecturing her he     is a middleaged man of cool temperament and low     but clear and keen intelligence with the     complacency of the servant who values himself on     his rank in servility and the imperturbability of     the accurate calculator who has no illusions he     wears a white bulgarian costume jacket with     decorated harder sash wide knickerbockers and     decorated gaiters his head is shaved up to the     crown giving him a high japanese forehead his     name is nicola  nicola be warned in time louka mend your manners i know the mistress she is so grand that she never dreams that any servant could dare to be disrespectful to her but if she once suspects that you are defying her out you go  louka i do defy her i will defy her what do i care for her  nicola if you quarrel with the family i never can marry you its the same as if you quarrelled with me  louka you take her part against me do you  nicola sedately i shall always be dependent on the good will of the family when i leave their service and start a shop in sofia their custom will be half my capital their bad word would ruin me  louka you have no spirit i should like to see them dare say a word against me  nicola pityingly i should have expected more sense from you louka but youre young youre young  louka yes and you like me the better for it dont you but i know some family secrets they wouldnt care to have told young as i am let them quarrel with me if they dare  nicola with compassionate superiority do you know what they would do if they heard you talk like that  louka what could they do  nicola discharge you for untruthfulness who would believe any stories you told after that who would give you another situation who in this house would dare be seen speaking to you ever again how long would your father be left on his little farm she impatiently throws away the end of her cigaret and stamps on it child you dont know the power such high people have over the like of you and me when we try to rise out of our poverty against them he goes close to her and lowers his voice look at me ten years in their service do you think i know no secrets i know things about the mistress that she wouldnt have the master know for a thousand levas i know things about him that she wouldnt let him hear the last of for six months if i blabbed them to her i know things about raina that would break off her match with sergius if  louka turning on him quickly how do you know i never told you  nicola opening his eyes cunningly so thats your little secret is it i thought it might be something like that well you take my advice and be respectful and make the mistress feel that no matter what you know or dont know they can depend on you to hold your tongue and serve the family faithfully thats what they like and thats how youll make most out of them  louka with searching scorn you have the soul of a servant nicola  nicola complacently yes thats the secret of success in service      a loud knocking with a whip handle on a wooden      door outside on the left is heard  male voice outside hollo hollo there nicola  louka master back from the war  nicola quickly my word for it louka the wars over off with you and get some fresh coffee he runs out into the stable yard  louka as she puts the coffee pot and the cups upon the tray and carries it into the house youll never put the soul of a servant into me     major petkoff comes from the stable yard     followed by nicola he is a cheerful excitable     insignificant unpolished man of about 50     naturally unambitious except as to his income and     his importance in local society but just now     greatly pleased with the military rank which the     war has thrust on him as a man of consequence in     his town the fever of plucky patriotism which the     servian attack roused in all the bulgarians has     pulled him through the war but he is obviously     glad to be home again  petkoff pointing to the table with his whip breakfast out here eh  nicola yes sir the mistress and miss raina have just gone in  petkoff fitting down and taking a roll go in and say ive come and get me some fresh coffee  nicola its coming sir he goes to the house door louka with fresh coffee a clean cup and a brandy bottle on her tray meets him have you told the mistress  louka yes shes coming      nicola goes into the house louka brings the      coffee to the table  petkoff well the servians havent run away with you have they  louka no sir  petkoff thats right have you brought me some cognac  louka putting the bottle on the table here sir  petkoff thats right he pours some into his coffee     catherine who has at this early hour made only a     very perfunctory toilet and wears a bulgarian     apron over a once brilliant but now half worn out     red dressing gown and a colored handkerchief tied     over her thick black hair with turkish slippers     on her bare feet comes from the house looking     astonishingly handsome and stately under all the     circumstances louka goes into the house  catherine my dear paul what a surprise for us she stoops over the back of his chair to kiss him have they brought you fresh coffee  petkoff yes loukas been looking after me the wars over the treaty was signed three days ago at bucharest and the decree for our army to demobilize was issued yesterday  catherine springing erect with flashing eyes the war over paul have you let the austrians force you to make peace  petkoff submissively my dear they didnt consult me what could i do she sits down and turns away from him but of course we saw to it that the treaty was an honorable one it declares peace  catherine outraged peace  petkoff appeasing herbut not friendly relations remember that they wanted to put that in but i insisted on its being struck out what more could i do  catherine you could have annexed servia and made prince alexander emperor of the balkans thats what i would have done  petkoff i dont doubt it in the least my dear but i should have had to subdue the whole austrian empire first and that would have kept me too long away from you i missed you greatly  catherine relenting ah stretches her hand affectionately across the table to squeeze his  petkoff and how have you been my dear  catherine oh my usual sore throats thats all  petkoff with conviction that comes from washing your neck every day ive often told you so  catherine nonsense paul  petkoff over his coffee and cigaret i dont believe in going too far with these modern customs all this washing cant be good for the health its not natural there was an englishman at phillipopolis who used to wet himself all over with cold water every morning when he got up disgusting it all comes from the english their climate makes them so dirty that they have to be perpetually washing themselves look at my father he never had a bath in his life and he lived to be ninetyeight the healthiest man in bulgaria i dont mind a good wash once a week to keep up my position but once a day is carrying the thing to a ridiculous extreme  catherine you are a barbarian at heart still paul i hope you behaved yourself before all those russian officers  petkoff i did my best i took care to let them know that we had a library  catherine ah but you didnt tell them that we have an electric bell in it i have had one put up  petkoff whats an electric bell  catherine you touch a button something tinkles in the kitchen and then nicola comes up  petkoff why not shout for him  catherine civilized people never shout for their servants ive learnt that while you were away  petkoff well ill tell you something ive learnt too civilized people dont hang out their washing to dry where visitors can see it so youd better have all that indicating the clothes on the bushes put somewhere else  catherine oh thats absurd paul i dont believe really refined people notice such things      someone is heard knocking at the stable gates  petkoff theres sergius shouting hollo nicola  catherine oh dont shout paul it really isnt nice  petkoff bosh he shouts louder than before nicola  nicola appearing at the house door yes sir  petkoff if that is major saranoff bring him round this way he pronounces the name with the stress on the second syllablesarahnoff  nicola yes sir he goes into the stable yard  petkoff you must talk to him my dear until raina takes him off our hands he bores my life out about our not promoting himover my head mind you  catherine he certainly ought to be promoted when he marries raina besides the country should insist on having at least one native general  petkoff yes so that he could throw away whole brigades instead of regiments its no use my dear he has not the slightest chance of promotion until we are quite sure that the peace will be a lasting one  nicola at the gate announcing major sergius saranoff he goes into the house and returns presently with a third chair which he places at the table he then withdraws     major sergius saranoff the original of the     portrait in rainas room is a tall romantically     handsome man with the physical hardihood the     high spirit and the susceptible imagination of an     untamed mountaineer chieftain but his remarkable     personal distinction is of a characteristically     civilized type the ridges of his eyebrows     curving with a ramshorn twist round the marked     projections at the outer corners his jealously     observant eye his nose thin keen and     apprehensive in spite of the pugnacious high     bridge and large nostril his assertive chin     would not be out of place in a paris salon in     short the clever imaginative barbarian has an     acute critical faculty which has been thrown into     intense activity by the arrival of western     civilization in the balkans and the result is     precisely what the advent of nineteenthcentury     thought first produced in england towit     byronism by his brooding on the perpetual     failure not only of others but of himself to     live up to his imaginative ideals his consequent     cynical scorn for humanity the jejune credulity     as to the absolute validity of his ideals and the     unworthiness of the world in disregarding them     his wincings and mockeries under the sting of the     petty disillusions which every hour spent among     men brings to his infallibly quick observation he     has acquired the half tragic half ironic air the     mysterious moodiness the suggestion of a strange     and terrible history that has left him nothing but     undying remorse by which childe harold fascinated     the grandmothers of his english contemporaries     altogether it is clear that here or nowhere is     rainas ideal hero catherine is hardly less     enthusiastic and much less reserved in shewing     her enthusiasm as he enters from the stable gate     she rises effusively to greet him petkoff is     distinctly less disposed to make a fuss about     him  petkoff here already sergius glad to see you  catherine my dear sergiusshe holds out both her hands  sergius kissing them with scrupulous gallantry my dear mother if i may call you so  petkoff drily motherinlaw sergius motherinlaw sit down and have some coffee  sergius thank you none for me he gets away from the table with a certain distaste for petkoffs enjoyment of it and posts himself with conscious grace against the rail of the steps leading to the house  catherine you look superbsplendid the campaign has improved you everybody here is mad about you we were all wild with enthusiasm about that magnificent cavalry charge  sergius with grave irony madam it was the cradle and the grave of my military reputation  catherine how so  sergius i won the battle the wrong way when our worthy russian generals were losing it the right way that upset their plans and wounded their selfesteem two of their colonels got their regiments driven back on the correct principles of scientific warfare two majorgenerals got killed strictly according to military etiquette those two colonels are now majorgenerals and i am still a simple major  catherine you shall not remain so sergius the women are on your side and they will see that justice is done you  sergius it is too late i have only waited for the peace to send in my resignation  petkoff dropping his cup in his amazement your resignation  catherine oh you must withdraw it  sergius with resolute measured emphasis folding his arms i never withdraw  petkoff vexed now who could have supposed you were going to do such a thing  sergius with fire everyone that knew me but enough of myself and my affairs how is raina and where is raina  raina suddenly coming round the corner of the house and standing at the top of the steps in the path raina is here she makes a charming picture as they all turn to look at her she wears an underdress of pale green silk draped with an overdress of thin ecru canvas embroidered with gold on her head she wears a pretty phrygian cap of gold tinsel sergius with an exclamation of pleasure goes impulsively to meet her she stretches out her hand he drops chivalrously on one knee and kisses it  petkoff aside to catherine beaming with parental pride pretty isnt it she always appears at the right moment  catherine impatiently yes she listens for it it is an abominable habit      sergius leads raina forward with splendid gallantry      as if she were a queen when they come to the      table she turns to him with a bend of the head      he bows and thus they separate he coming to his      place and she going behind her fathers chair  raina stooping and kissing her father dear father welcome home  petkoff patting her cheek my little pet girl he kisses her she goes to the chair left by nicola for sergius and sits down  catherine and so youre no longer a soldier sergius  sergius i am no longer a soldier soldiering my dear madam is the cowards art of attacking mercilessly when you are strong and keeping out of harms way when you are weak that is the whole secret of successful fighting get your enemy at a disadvantage and never on any account fight him on equal terms eh major  petkoff they wouldnt let us make a fair standup fight of it however i suppose soldiering has to be a trade like any other trade  sergius precisely but i have no ambition to succeed as a tradesman so i have taken the advice of that bagman of a captain that settled the exchange of prisoners with us at peerot and given it up  petkoff what that swiss fellow sergius ive often thought of that exchange since he overreached us about those horses  sergius of course he overreached us his father was a hotel and livery stable keeper and he owed his first step to his knowledge of horsedealing with mock enthusiasm ah he was a soldierevery inch a soldier if only i had bought the horses for my regiment instead of foolishly leading it into danger i should have been a fieldmarshal now  catherine a swiss what was he doing in the servian army  petkoff a volunteer of coursekeen on picking up his profession chuckling we shouldnt have been able to begin fighting if these foreigners hadnt shewn us how to do it we knew nothing about it and neither did the servians egad thered have been no war without them  raina are there many swiss officers in the servian army  petkoff noall austrians just as our officers were all russians this was the only swiss i came across ill never trust a swiss again he cheated ushumbugged us into giving him fifty able bodied men for two hundred confounded worn out chargers they werent even eatable  sergius we were two children in the hands of that consummate soldier major simply two innocent little children  raina what was he like  catherine oh raina what a silly question  sergius he was like a commercial traveller in uniform bourgeois to his boots  petkoff grinning sergius tell catherine that queer story his friend told us about himhow he escaped after slivnitza you rememberabout his being hid by two women  sergius with bitter irony oh yes quite a romance he was serving in the very battery i so unprofessionally charged being a thorough soldier he ran away like the rest of them with our cavalry at his heels to escape their attentions he had the good taste to take refuge in the chamber of some patriotic young bulgarian lady the young lady was enchanted by his persuasive commercial travellers manners she very modestly entertained him for an hour or so and then called in her mother lest her conduct should appear unmaidenly the old lady was equally fascinated and the fugitive was sent on his way in the morning disguised in an old coat belonging to the master of the house who was away at the war  raina rising with marked stateliness your life in the camp has made you coarse sergius i did not think you would have repeated such a story before me she turns away coldly  catherine also rising she is right sergius if such women exist we should be spared the knowledge of them  petkoff pooh nonsense what does it matter  sergius ashamed no petkoff i was wrong to raina with earnest humility i beg your pardon i have behaved abominably forgive me raina she bows reservedly and you too madam catherine bows graciously and sits down he proceeds solemnly again addressing raina the glimpses i have had of the seamy side of life during the last few months have made me cynical but i should not have brought my cynicism hereleast of all into your presence raina ihere turning to the others he is evidently about to begin a long speech when the major interrupts him  petkoff stuff and nonsense sergius thats quite enough fuss about nothing a soldiers daughter should be able to stand up without flinching to a little strong conversation he rises come its time for us to get to business we have to make up our minds how those three regiments are to get back to phillipopolistheres no forage for them on the sofia route he goes towards the house come along sergius is about to follow him when catherine rises and intervenes  catherine oh paul cant you spare sergius for a few moments raina has hardly seen him yet perhaps i can help you to settle about the regiments  sergius protesting my dear madam impossible you  catherine stopping him playfully you stay here my dear sergius theres no hurry i have a word or two to say to paul sergius instantly bows and steps back now dear taking petkoffs arm come and see the electric bell  petkoff oh very well very well they go into the house together affectionately sergius left alone with raina looks anxiously at her fearing that she may be still offended she smiles and stretches out her arms to him      exit r into house followed by catherine  sergius hastening to her but refraining from touching her without express permission am i forgiven  raina placing her hands on his shoulder as she looks up at him with admiration and worship my hero my king  sergius my queen he kisses her on the forehead with holy awe  raina how i have envied you sergius you have been out in the world on the field of battle able to prove yourself there worthy of any woman in the world whilst i have had to sit at home inactivedreaminguselessdoing nothing that could give me the right to call myself worthy of any man  sergius dearest all my deeds have been yours you inspired me i have gone through the war like a knight in a tournament with his lady looking on at him  raina and you have never been absent from my thoughts for a moment very solemnly sergius i think we two have found the higher love when i think of you i feel that i could never do a base deed or think an ignoble thought  sergius my lady and my saint clasping her reverently  raina returning his embrace my lord and my g  sergius shsh let me be the worshipper dear you little know how unworthy even the best man is of a girls pure passion  raina i trust you i love you you will never disappoint me sergius louka is heard singing within the house they quickly release each other hush i cant pretend to talk indifferently before her my heart is too full louka comes from the house with her tray she goes to the table and begins to clear it with her back turned to them i will go and get my hat and then we can go out until lunch time wouldnt you like that  sergius be quick if you are away five minutes it will seem five hours raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there to exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands he looks after her with emotion for a moment then turns slowly away his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which has just passed the movement shifts his field of vision into the corner of which there now comes the tail of loukas double apron his eye gleams at once he takes a stealthy look at her and begins to twirl his moustache nervously with his left hand akimbo on his hip finally striking the ground with his heels in something of a cavalry swagger he strolls over to the left of the table opposite her and says louka do you know what the higher love is  louka astonished no sir  sergius very fatiguing thing to keep up for any length of time louka one feels the need of some relief after it  louka innocently perhaps you would like some coffee sir she stretches her hand across the table for the coffee pot  sergius taking her hand thank you louka  louka pretending to pull oh sir you know i didnt mean that im surprised at you  sergius coming clear of the table and drawing her with him i am surprised at myself louka what would sergius the hero of slivnitza say if he saw me now what would sergius the apostle of the higher love say if he saw me now what would the half dozen sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome figure of mine say if they caught us here letting go her hand and slipping his arm dexterously round her waist do you consider my figure handsome louka  louka let me go sir i shall be disgraced she struggles he holds her inexorably oh will you let go  sergius looking straight into her eyes no  louka then stand back where we cant be seen have you no common sense  sergius ah thats reasonable he takes her into the stableyard gateway where they are hidden from the house  louka complaining i may have been seen from the windows miss raina is sure to be spying about after you  sergius stungletting her go take care louka i may be worthless enough to betray the higher love but do not you insult it  louka demurely not for the world sir im sure may i go on with my work please now  sergius again putting his arm round her you are a provoking little witch louka if you were in love with me would you spy out of windows on me  louka well you see sir since you say you are half a dozen different gentlemen all at once i should have a great deal to look after  sergius charmed witty as well as pretty he tries to kiss her  louka avoiding him no i dont want your kisses gentlefolk are all alikeyou making love to me behind miss rainas back and she doing the same behind yours  sergius recoiling a step louka  louka it shews how little you really care  sergius dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing politeness if our conversation is to continue louka you will please remember that a gentleman does not discuss the conduct of the lady he is engaged to with her maid  louka its so hard to know what a gentleman considers right i thought from your trying to kiss me that you had given up being so particular  sergius turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes back into the garden from the gateway devil devil  louka ha ha i expect one of the six of you is very like me sir though i am only miss rainas maid she goes back to her work at the table taking no further notice of him  sergius speaking to himself which of the six is the real manthats the question that torments me one of them is a hero another a buffoon another a humbug another perhaps a bit of a blackguard he pauses and looks furtively at louka as he adds with deep bitterness and one at least is a cowardjealous like all cowards he goes to the table louka  louka yes  sergius who is my rival  louka you shall never get that out of me for love or money  sergius why  louka never mind why besides you would tell that i told you and i should lose my place  sergius holding out his right hand in affirmation no on the honor of ahe checks himself and his hand drops nerveless as he concludes sardonicallyof a man capable of behaving as i have been behaving for the last five minutes who is he  louka i dont know i never saw him i only heard his voice through the door of her room  sergius damnation how dare you  louka retreating oh i mean no harm youve no right to take up my words like that the mistress knows all about it and i tell you that if that gentleman ever comes here again miss raina will marry him whether he likes it or not i know the difference between the sort of manner you and she put on before one another and the real manner sergius shivers as if she had stabbed him then setting his face like iron he strides grimly to her and grips her above the elbows with both bands  sergius now listen you to me  louka wincing not so tight youre hurting me  sergius that doesnt matter you have stained my honor by making me a party to your eavesdropping and you have betrayed your mistress  louka writhing please  sergius that shews that you are an abominable little clod of common clay with the soul of a servant he lets her go as if she were an unclean thing and turns away dusting his hands of her to the bench by the wall where he sits down with averted head meditating gloomily  louka whimpering angrily with her hands up her sleeves feeling her bruised arms you know how to hurt with your tongue as well as with your hands but i dont care now ive found out that whatever clay im made of youre made of the same as for her shes a liar and her fine airs are a cheat and im worth six of her she shakes the pain off hardily tosses her head and sets to work to put the things on the tray he looks doubtfully at her once or twice she finishes packing the tray and laps the cloth over the edges so as to carry all out together as she stoops to lift it he rises  sergius louka she stops and looks defiantly at him with the tray in her hands a gentleman has no right to hurt a woman under any circumstances with profound humility uncovering his head i beg your pardon  louka that sort of apology may satisfy a lady of what use is it to a servant  sergius thus rudely crossed in his chivalry throws it off with a bitter laugh and says slightingly oh you wish to be paid for the hurt he puts on his shako and takes some money from his pocket  louka her eyes filling with tears in spite of herself no i want my hurt made well  sergius sobered by her tone how     she rolls up her left sleeve clasps her arm with     the thumb and fingers of her right hand and looks     down at the bruise then she raises her head and     looks straight at him finally with a superb     gesture she presents her arm to be kissed amazed     he looks at her at the arm at her again     hesitates and then with shuddering intensity     exclaims  sergius never and gets away as far as possible from her     her arm drops without a word and with unaffected     dignity she takes her tray and is approaching     the house when raina returns wearing a hat and     jacket in the height of the vienna fashion of the     previous year 1885 louka makes way proudly for     her and then goes into the house  raina im ready whats the matter gaily have you been flirting with louka  sergius hastily no no how can you think such a thing  raina ashamed of herself forgive me dear it was only a jest i am so happy today      he goes quickly to her and kisses her hand      remorsefully catherine comes out and calls      to them from the top of the steps  catherine coming down to them i am sorry to disturb you children but paul is distracted over those three regiments he does not know how to get them to phillipopolis and he objects to every suggestion of mine you must go and help him sergius he is in the library  raina disappointed but we are just going out for a walk  sergius i shall not be long wait for me just five minutes he runs up the steps to the door  raina following him to the foot of the steps and looking up at him with timid coquetry i shall go round and wait in full view of the library windows be sure you draw fathers attention to me if you are a moment longer than five minutes i shall go in and fetch you regiments or no regiments  sergius laughing very well he goes in raina watches him until he is out of her sight then with a perceptible relaxation of manner she begins to pace up and down about the garden in a brown study  catherine imagine their meeting that swiss and hearing the whole story the very first thing your father asked for was the old coat we sent him off in a nice mess you have got us into  raina gazing thoughtfully at the gravel as she walks the little beast  catherine little beast what little beast  raina to go and tell oh if i had him here id stuff him with chocolate creams till he couldnt ever speak again  catherine dont talk nonsense tell me the truth raina how long was he in your room before you came to me  raina whisking round and recommencing her march in the opposite direction oh i forget  catherine you cannot forget did he really climb up after the soldiers were gone or was he there when that officer searched the room  raina no yes i think he must have been there then  catherine you think oh raina raina will anything ever make you straightforward if sergius finds out it is all over between you  raina with cool impertinence oh i know sergius is your pet i sometimes wish you could marry him instead of me you would just suit him you would pet him and spoil him and mother him to perfection  catherine opening her eyes very widely indeed well upon my word  raina capriciouslyhalf to herself i always feel a longing to do or say something dreadful to himto shock his proprietyto scandalize the five senses out of him to catherine perversely i dont care whether he finds out about the chocolate cream soldier or not i half hope he may she again turns flippantly away and strolls up the path to the corner of the house  catherine and what should i be able to say to your father pray  raina over her shoulder from the top of the two steps oh poor father as if he could help himself she turns the corner and passes out of sight  catherine looking after her her fingers itching oh if you were only ten years younger louka comes from the house with a salver which she carries hanging down by her side well  louka theres a gentleman just called madama servian officer  catherine flaming a servian how dare hechecking herself bitterly oh i forgot we are at peace now i suppose we shall have them calling every day to pay their compliments well if he is an officer why dont you tell your master he is in the library with major saranoff why do you come to me  louka but he asks for you madam and i dont think he knows who you are he said the lady of the house he gave me this little ticket for you she takes a card out of her bosom puts it on the salver and offers it to catherine  catherine reading captain bluntschli thats a german name  louka swiss madam i think  catherine with a bound that makes louka jump back swiss what is he like  louka timidly he has a big carpet bag madam  catherine oh heavens hes come to return the coat send him awaysay were not at homeask him to leave his address and ill write to himoh stop that will never do wait she throws herself into a chair to think it out louka waits the master and major saranoff are busy in the library arent they  louka yes madam  catherine decisively bring the gentleman out here at once imperatively and be very polite to him dont delay here impatiently snatching the salver from her leave that here and go straight back to him  louka yes madam going  catherine louka  louka stopping yes madam  catherine is the library door shut  louka i think so madam  catherine if not shut it as you pass through  louka yes madam going  catherine stop louka stops he will have to go out that way indicating the gate of the stable yard tell nicola to bring his bag here after him dont forget  louka surprised his bag  catherine yes here as soon as possible vehemently be quick louka runs into the house catherine snatches her apron off and throws it behind a bush she then takes up the salver and uses it as a mirror with the result that the handkerchief tied round her head follows the apron a touch to her hair and a shake to her dressing gown makes her presentable oh howhowhow can a man be such a fool such a moment to select louka appears at the door of the house announcing captain bluntschli and standing aside at the top of the steps to let him pass before she goes in again he is the man of the adventure in rainas room he is now clean well brushed smartly uniformed and out of trouble but still unmistakably the same man the moment loukas back is turned catherine swoops on him with hurried urgent coaxing appeal captain bluntschli i am very glad to see you but you must leave this house at once he raises his eyebrows my husband has just returned with my future soninlaw and they know nothing if they did the consequences would be terrible you are a foreigner you do not feel our national animosities as we do we still hate the servians the only effect of the peace on my husband is to make him feel like a lion baulked of his prey if he discovered our secret he would never forgive me and my daughters life would hardly be safe will you like the chivalrous gentleman and soldier you are leave at once before he finds you here  bluntschli disappointed but philosophical at once gracious lady i only came to thank you and return the coat you lent me if you will allow me to take it out of my bag and leave it with your servant as i pass out i need detain you no further he turns to go into the house  catherine catching him by the sleeve oh you must not think of going back that way coaxing him across to the stable gates this is the shortest way out many thanks so glad to have been of service to you goodbye  bluntschli but my bag  catherine it will be sent on you will leave me your address  bluntschli true allow me he takes out his cardcase and stops to write his address keeping catherine in an agony of impatience as he hands her the card petkoff hatless rushes from the house in a fluster of hospitality followed by sergius  petkoff as he hurries down the steps my dear captain bluntschli  catherine oh heavens she sinks on the seat against the wall  petkoff too preoccupied to notice her as he shakes bluntschlis hand heartily those stupid people of mine thought i was out here instead of in thehawlibrary he cannot mention the library without betraying how proud he is of it i saw you through the window i was wondering why you didnt come in saranoff is with me you remember him dont you  sergius saluting humorously and then offering his hand with great charm of manner welcome our friend the enemy  petkoff no longer the enemy happily rather anxiously i hope youve come as a friend and not on business  catherine oh quite as a friend paul i was just asking captain bluntschli to stay to lunch but he declares he must go at once  sergius sardonically impossible bluntschli we want you here badly we have to send on three cavalry regiments to phillipopolis and we dont in the least know how to do it  bluntschli suddenly attentive and businesslike phillipopolis the forage is the trouble eh  petkoff eagerly yes thats it to sergius he sees the whole thing at once  bluntschli i think i can shew you how to manage that  sergius invaluable man come along towering over bluntschli he puts his hand on his shoulder and takes him to the steps petkoff following as bluntschli puts his foot on the first step raina comes out of the house  raina completely losing her presence of mind oh the chocolate cream soldier      bluntschli stands rigid sergius amazed looks      at raina then at petkoff who looks back at him      and then at his wife  catherine with commanding presence of mind my dear raina dont you see that we have a guest herecaptain bluntschli one of our new servian friends      raina bows bluntschli bows  raina how silly of me she comes down into the centre of the group between bluntschli and petkoff i made a beautiful ornament this morning for the ice pudding and that stupid nicola has just put down a pile of plates on it and spoiled it to bluntschli winningly i hope you didnt think that you were the chocolate cream soldier captain bluntschli  bluntschli laughing i assure you i did stealing a whimsical glance at her your explanation was a relief  petkoff suspiciously to raina and since when pray have you taken to cooking  catherine oh whilst you were away it is her latest fancy  petkoff testily and has nicola taken to drinking he used to be careful enough first he shews captain bluntschli out here when he knew quite well i was in thehumlibrary and then he goes downstairs and breaks rainas chocolate soldier he mustat this moment nicola appears at the top of the steps r with a carpet bag he descends places it respectfully before bluntschli and waits for further orders general amazement nicola unconscious of the effect he is producing looks perfectly satisfied with himself when petkoff recovers his power of speech he breaks out at him with are you mad nicola  nicola taken aback sir  petkoff what have you brought that for  nicola my ladys orders sir louka told me that  catherine interrupting him my orders why should i order you to bring captain bluntschlis luggage out here what are you thinking of nicola  nicola after a moments bewilderment picking up the bag as he addresses bluntschli with the very perfection of servile discretion i beg your pardon sir i am sure to catherine my fault madam i hope youll overlook it he bows and is going to the steps with the bag when petkoff addresses him angrily  petkoff youd better go and slam that bag too down on miss rainas ice pudding this is too much for nicola the bag drops from his hands on petkoffs corns eliciting a roar of anguish from him begone you butterfingered donkey  nicola snatching up the bag and escaping into the house yes sir  catherine oh never mind paul dont be angry  petkoff muttering scoundrel hes got out of hand while i was away ill teach him recollecting his guest oh well never mind come bluntschli lets have no more nonsense about you having to go away you know very well youre not going back to switzerland yet until you do go back youll stay with us  raina oh do captain bluntschli  petkoff to catherine now catherine its of you that hes afraid press him and hell stay  catherine of course i shall be only too delighted if appealingly captain bluntschli really wishes to stay he knows my wishes  bluntschli in his driest military manner i am at madames orders  sergius cordially that settles it  petkoff heartily of course  raina you see you must stay  bluntschli smiling well if i must i must gesture of despair from catherine     act iii      in the library after lunch it is not much of a     library its literary equipment consisting of a     single fixed shelf stocked with old papercovered     novels broken backed coffee stained torn and     thumbed and a couple of little hanging shelves     with a few gift books on them the rest of the     wall space being occupied by trophies of war and     the chase but it is a most comfortable     sittingroom a row of three large windows in the     front of the house shew a mountain panorama which     is just now seen in one of its softest aspects in     the mellowing afternoon light in the left hand     corner a square earthenware stove a perfect     tower of colored pottery rises nearly to the     ceiling and guarantees plenty of warmth the     ottoman in the middle is a circular bank of     decorated cushions and the window seats are well     upholstered divans little turkish tables one of     them with an elaborate hookah on it and a screen     to match them complete the handsome effect of the     furnishing there is one object however which is     hopelessly out of keeping with its surroundings     this is a small kitchen table much the worse for     wear fitted as a writing table with an old     canister full of pens an eggcup filled with ink     and a deplorable scrap of severely used pink     blotting paper      at the side of this table which stands on the     right bluntschli is hard at work with a couple     of maps before him writing orders at the head of     it sits sergius who is also supposed to be at     work but who is actually gnawing the feather of a     pen and contemplating bluntschlis quick sure     businesslike progress with a mixture of envious     irritation at his own incapacity and awestruck     wonder at an ability which seems to him almost     miraculous though its prosaic character forbids     him to esteem it the major is comfortably     established on the ottoman with a newspaper in     his hand and the tube of the hookah within his     reach catherine sits at the stove with her back     to them embroidering raina reclining on the     divan under the left hand window is gazing in a     daydream out at the balkan landscape with a     neglected novel in her lap      the door is on the left the button of the     electric bell is between the door and the     fireplace  petkoff looking up from his paper to watch how they are getting on at the table are you sure i cant help you in any way bluntschli  bluntschli without interrupting his writing or looking up quite sure thank you saranoff and i will manage it  sergius grimly yes well manage it he finds out what to do draws up the orders and i sign em division of labour major bluntschli passes him a paper another one thank you he plants the papers squarely before him sets his chair carefully parallel to them and signs with the air of a man resolutely performing a difficult and dangerous feat this hand is more accustomed to the sword than to the pen  petkoff its very good of you bluntschli it is indeed to let yourself be put upon in this way now are you quite sure i can do nothing  catherine in a low warning tone you can stop interrupting paul  petkoff starting and looking round at her eh oh quite right my love quite right he takes his newspaper up but lets it drop again ah you havent been campaigning catherine you dont know how pleasant it is for us to sit here after a good lunch with nothing to do but enjoy ourselves theres only one thing i want to make me thoroughly comfortable  catherine what is that  petkoff my old coat im not at home in this one i feel as if i were on parade  catherine my dear paul how absurd you are about that old coat it must be hanging in the blue closet where you left it  petkoff my dear catherine i tell you ive looked there am i to believe my own eyes or not catherine quietly rises and presses the button of the electric bell by the fireplace what are you shewing off that bell for she looks at him majestically and silently resumes her chair and her needlework my dear if you think the obstinacy of your sex can make a coat out of two old dressing gowns of rainas your waterproof and my mackintosh youre mistaken thats exactly what the blue closet contains at present nicola presents himself  catherine unmoved by petkoffs sally nicola go to the blue closet and bring your masters old coat herethe braided one he usually wears in the house  nicola yes madam nicola goes out  petkoff catherine  catherine yes paul  petkoff i bet you any piece of jewellery you like to order from sofia against a weeks housekeeping money that the coat isnt there  catherine done paul  petkoff excited by the prospect of a gamble come heres an opportunity for some sport wholl bet on it bluntschli ill give you six to one  bluntschli imperturbably it would be robbing you major madame is sure to be right without looking up he passes another batch of papers to sergius  sergius also excited bravo switzerland major i bet my best charger against an arab mare for raina that nicola finds the coat in the blue closet  petkoff eagerly your best char  catherine hastily interrupting him dont be foolish paul an arabian mare will cost you 50000 levas  raina suddenly coming out of her picturesque revery really mother if you are going to take the jewellery i dont see why you should grudge me my arab     nicola comes back with the coat and brings it     to petkoff who can hardly believe his eyes  catherine where was it nicola  nicola hanging in the blue closet madam  petkoff well i am d  catherine stopping him paul  petkoff i could have sworn it wasnt there age is beginning to tell on me im getting hallucinations to nicola here help me to change excuse me bluntschli he begins changing coats nicola acting as valet remember i didnt take that bet of yours sergius youd better give raina that arab steed yourself since youve roused her expectations eh raina he looks round at her but she is again rapt in the landscape with a little gush of paternal affection and pride he points her out to them and says shes dreaming as usual  sergius assuredly she shall not be the loser  petkoff so much the better for her i shant come off so cheap i expect the change is now complete nicola goes out with the discarded coat ah now i feel at home at last he sits down and takes his newspaper with a grunt of relief  bluntschli to sergius handing a paper thats the last order  petkoff jumping up what finished  bluntschli finished petkoff goes beside sergius looks curiously over his left shoulder as he signs and says with childlike envy havent you anything for me to sign  bluntschli not necessary his signature will do  petkoff ah well i think weve done a thundering good days work he goes away from the table can i do anything more  bluntschli you had better both see the fellows that are to take these to sergius pack them off at once and shew them that ive marked on the orders the time they should hand them in by tell them that if they stop to drink or tell storiesif theyre five minutes late theyll have the skin taken off their backs  sergius rising indignantly ill say so and if one of them is man enough to spit in my face for insulting him ill buy his discharge and give him a pension he strides out his humanity deeply outraged  bluntschli confidentially just see that he talks to them properly major will you  petkoff officiously quite right bluntschli quite right ill see to it he goes to the door importantly but hesitates on the threshold by the bye catherine you may as well come too theyll be far more frightened of you than of me  catherine putting down her embroidery i daresay i had better you will only splutter at them she goes out petkoff holding the door for her and following her  bluntschli what a country they make cannons out of cherry trees and the officers send for their wives to keep discipline he begins to fold and docket the papers raina who has risen from the divan strolls down the room with her hands clasped behind her and looks mischievously at him  raina you look ever so much nicer than when we last met he looks up surprised what have you done to yourself  bluntschli washed brushed good nights sleep and breakfast thats all  raina did you get back safely that morning  bluntschli quite thanks  raina were they angry with you for running away from sergiuss charge  bluntschli no they were glad because theyd all just run away themselves  raina going to the table and leaning over it towards him it must have made a lovely story for themall that about me and my room  bluntschli capital story but i only told it to one of thema particular friend  raina on whose discretion you could absolutely rely  bluntschli absolutely  raina hm he told it all to my father and sergius the day you exchanged the prisoners she turns away and strolls carelessly across to the other side of the room  bluntschli deeply concerned and half incredulous no you dont mean that do you  raina turning with sudden earnestness i do indeed but they dont know that it was in this house that you hid if sergius knew he would challenge you and kill you in a duel  bluntschli bless me then dont tell him  raina full of reproach for his levity can you realize what it is to me to deceive him i want to be quite perfect with sergiusno meanness no smallness no deceit my relation to him is the one really beautiful and noble part of my life i hope you can understand that  bluntschli sceptically you mean that you wouldnt like him to find out that the story about the ice pudding was aaayou know  raina wincing ah dont talk of it in that flippant way i lied i know it but i did it to save your life he would have killed you that was the second time i ever uttered a falsehood bluntschli rises quickly and looks doubtfully and somewhat severely at her do you remember the first time  bluntschli i no was i present  raina yes and i told the officer who was searching for you that you were not present  bluntschli true i should have remembered it  raina greatly encouraged ah it is natural that you should forget it first it cost you nothing it cost me a liea lie she sits down on the ottoman looking straight before her with her hands clasped on her knee bluntschli quite touched goes to the ottoman with a particularly reassuring and considerate air and sits down beside her  bluntschli my dear young lady dont let this worry you remember im a soldier now what are the two things that happen to a soldier so often that he comes to think nothing of them one is hearing people tell lies raina recoils the other is getting his life saved in all sorts of ways by all sorts of people  raina rising in indignant protest and so he becomes a creature incapable of faith and of gratitude  bluntschli making a wry face do you like gratitude i dont if pity is akin to love gratitude is akin to the other thing  raina gratitude turning on him if you are incapable of gratitude you are incapable of any noble sentiment even animals are grateful oh i see now exactly what you think of me you were not surprised to hear me lie to you it was something i probably did every dayevery hour that is how men think of women she walks up the room melodramatically  bluntschli dubiously theres reason in everything you said youd told only two lies in your whole life dear young lady isnt that rather a short allowance im quite a straightforward man myself but it wouldnt last me a whole morning  raina staring haughtily at him do you know sir that you are insulting me  bluntschli i cant help it when you get into that noble attitude and speak in that thrilling voice i admire you but i find it impossible to believe a single word you say  raina superbly captain bluntschli  bluntschli unmoved yes  raina coming a little towards him as if she could not believe her senses do you mean what you said just now do you know what you said just now  bluntschli i do  raina gasping i i she points to herself incredulously meaning i raina petkoff tell lies he meets her gaze unflinchingly she suddenly sits down beside him and adds with a complete change of manner from the heroic to the familiar how did you find me out  bluntschli promptly instinct dear young lady instinct and experience of the world  raina wonderingly do you know you are the first man i ever met who did not take me seriously  bluntschli you mean dont you that i am the first man that has ever taken you quite seriously  raina yes i suppose i do mean that cosily quite at her ease with him how strange it is to be talked to in such a way you know ive always gone on like thati mean the noble attitude and the thrilling voice i did it when i was a tiny child to my nurse she believed in it i do it before my parents they believe in it i do it before sergius he believes in it  bluntschli yes hes a little in that line himself isnt he  raina startled do you think so  bluntschli you know him better than i do  raina i wonderi wonder is he if i thought that discouraged ah well what does it matter i suppose now that youve found me out you despise me  bluntschli warmly rising no my dear young lady no no no a thousand times its part of your youthpart of your charm im like all the rest of themthe nurseyour parentssergius im your infatuated admirer  raina pleased really  bluntschli slapping his breast smartly with his hand german fashion hand aufs herz really and truly  raina very happy but what did you think of me for giving you my portrait  bluntschli astonished your portrait you never gave me your portrait  raina quickly do you mean to say you never got it  bluntschli no he sits down beside her with renewed interest and says with some complacency when did you send it to me  raina indignantly i did not send it to you she turns her head away and adds reluctantly it was in the pocket of that coat  bluntschli pursing his lips and rounding his eyes ohooh i never found it it must be there still  raina springing up there stillfor my father to find the first time he puts his hand in his pocket oh how could you be so stupid  bluntschli rising also it doesnt matter its only a photograph how can he tell who it was intended for tell him he put it there himself  raina impatiently yes that is so cleverso clever what shall i do  bluntschli ah i see you wrote something on it that was rash  raina annoyed almost to tears oh to have done such a thing for you who care no moreexcept to laugh at meoh are you sure nobody has touched it  bluntschli well i cant be quite sure you see i couldnt carry it about with me all the time one cant take much luggage on active service  raina what did you do with it  bluntschli when i got through to peerot i had to put it in safe keeping somehow i thought of the railway cloak room but thats the surest place to get looted in modern warfare so i pawned it  raina pawned it  bluntschli i know it doesnt sound nice but it was much the safest plan i redeemed it the day before yesterday heaven only knows whether the pawnbroker cleared out the pockets or not  raina furiousthrowing the words right into his face you have a low shopkeeping mind you think of things that would never come into a gentlemans head  bluntschli phlegmatically thats the swiss national character dear lady  raina oh i wish i had never met you she flounces away and sits at the window fuming     louka comes in with a heap of letters and     telegrams on her salver and crosses with her     bold free gait to the table her left sleeve is     looped up to the shoulder with a brooch shewing     her naked arm with a broad gilt bracelet covering     the bruise  louka to bluntschli for you she empties the salver recklessly on the table the messenger is waiting she is determined not to be civil to a servian even if she must bring him his letters  bluntschli to raina will you excuse me the last postal delivery that reached me was three weeks ago these are the subsequent accumulations four telegramsa week old he opens one oho bad news  raina rising and advancing a little remorsefully bad news  bluntschli my fathers dead he looks at the telegram with his lips pursed musing on the unexpected change in his arrangements  raina oh how very sad  bluntschli yes i shall have to start for home in an hour he has left a lot of big hotels behind him to be looked after takes up a heavy letter in a long blue envelope heres a whacking letter from the family solicitor he pulls out the enclosures and glances over them great heavens seventy two hundred in a crescendo of dismay four hundred four thousand nine thousand six hundred what on earth shall i do with them all  raina timidly nine thousand hotels  bluntschli hotels nonsense if you only knewoh its too ridiculous excuse me i must give my fellow orders about starting he leaves the room hastily with the documents in his hand  louka tauntingly he has not much heart that swiss though he is so fond of the servians he has not a word of grief for his poor father  raina bitterly griefa man who has been doing nothing but killing people for years what does he care what does any soldier care she goes to the door evidently restraining her tears with difficulty  louka major saranoff has been fighting too and he has plenty of heart left raina at the door looks haughtily at her and goes out aha i thought you wouldnt get much feeling out of your soldier she is following raina when nicola enters with an armful of logs for the fire  nicola grinning amorously at her ive been trying all the afternoon to get a minute alone with you my girl his countenance changes as he notices her arm why what fashion is that of wearing your sleeve child  louka proudly my own fashion  nicola indeed if the mistress catches you shell talk to you he throws the logs down on the ottoman and sits comfortably beside them  louka is that any reason why you should take it on yourself to talk to me  nicola come dont be so contrary with me ive some good news for you he takes out some paper money louka with an eager gleam in her eyes comes close to look at it see a twenty leva bill sergius gave me that out of pure swagger a fool and his money are soon parted theres ten levas more the swiss gave me that for backing up the mistresss and rainas lies about him hes no fool he isnt you should have heard old catherine downstairs as polite as you please to me telling me not to mind the major being a little impatient for they knew what a good servant i wasafter making a fool and a liar of me before them all the twenty will go to our savings and you shall have the ten to spend if youll only talk to me so as to remind me im a human being i get tired of being a servant occasionally  louka scornfully yes sell your manhood for thirty levas and buy me for ten keep your money you were born to be a servant i was not when you set up your shop you will only be everybodys servant instead of somebodys servant  nicola picking up his logs and going to the stove ah wait till you see we shall have our evenings to ourselves and i shall be master in my own house i promise you he throws the logs down and kneels at the stove  louka you shall never be master in mine she sits down on sergiuss chair  nicola turning still on his knees and squatting down rather forlornly on his calves daunted by her implacable disdain you have a great ambition in you louka remember if any luck comes to you it was i that made a woman of you  louka you  nicola with dogged selfassertion yes me who was it made you give up wearing a couple of pounds of false black hair on your head and reddening your lips and cheeks like any other bulgarian girl i did who taught you to trim your nails and keep your hands clean and be dainty about yourself like a fine russian lady me do you hear that me she tosses her head defiantly and he rises illhumoredly adding more coolly ive often thought that if raina were out of the way and you just a little less of a fool and sergius just a little more of one you might come to be one of my grandest customers instead of only being my wife and costing me money  louka i believe you would rather be my servant than my husband you would make more out of me oh i know that soul of yours  nicola going up close to her for greater emphasis never you mind my soul but just listen to my advice if you want to be a lady your present behaviour to me wont do at all unless when were alone its too sharp and imprudent and impudence is a sort of familiarity it shews affection for me and dont you try being high and mighty with me either youre like all country girls you think its genteel to treat a servant the way i treat a stableboy thats only your ignorance and dont you forget it and dont be so ready to defy everybody act as if you expected to have your own way not as if you expected to be ordered about the way to get on as a lady is the same as the way to get on as a servant youve got to know your place thats the secret of it and you may depend on me to know my place if you get promoted think over it my girl ill stand by you one servant should always stand by another  louka rising impatiently oh i must behave in my own way you take all the courage out of me with your coldblooded wisdom go and put those logs on the fire thats the sort of thing you understand before nicola can retort sergius comes in he checks himself a moment on seeing louka then goes to the stove  sergius to nicola i am not in the way of your work i hope  nicola in a smooth elderly manner oh no sir thank you kindly i was only speaking to this foolish girl about her habit of running up here to the library whenever she gets a chance to look at the books thats the worst of her education sir it gives her habits above her station to louka make that table tidy louka for the major he goes out sedately      louka without looking at sergius begins to      arrange the papers on the table he crosses slowly      to her and studies the arrangement of her sleeve      reflectively  sergius let me see is there a mark there he turns up the bracelet and sees the bruise made by his grasp she stands motionless not looking at him fascinated but on her guard ffff does it hurt  louka yes  sergius shall i cure it  louka instantly withdrawing herself proudly but still not looking at him no you cannot cure it now  sergius masterfully quite sure he makes a movement as if to take her in his arms  louka dont trifle with me please an officer should not trifle with a servant  sergius touching the arm with a merciless stroke of his forefinger that was no trifle louka  louka no looking at him for the first time are you sorry  sergius with measured emphasis folding his arms i am never sorry  louka wistfully i wish i could believe a man could be so unlike a woman as that i wonder are you really a brave man  sergius unaffectedly relaxing his attitude yes i am a brave man my heart jumped like a womans at the first shot but in the charge i found that i was brave yes that at least is real about me  louka did you find in the charge that the men whose fathers are poor like mine were any less brave than the men who are rich like you  sergius with bitter levity not a bit they all slashed and cursed and yelled like heroes psha the courage to rage and kill is cheap i have an english bull terrier who has as much of that sort of courage as the whole bulgarian nation and the whole russian nation at its back but he lets my groom thrash him all the same thats your soldier all over no louka your poor men can cut throats but they are afraid of their officers they put up with insults and blows they stand by and see one another punished like childrenaye and help to do it when they are ordered and the officerswell with a short bitter laugh i am an officer oh fervently give me the man who will defy to the death any power on earth or in heaven that sets itself up against his own will and conscience he alone is the brave man  louka how easy it is to talk men never seem to me to grow up they all have schoolboys ideas you dont know what true courage is  sergius ironically indeed i am willing to be instructed  louka look at me how much am i allowed to have my own will i have to get your room ready for youto sweep and dust to fetch and carry how could that degrade me if it did not degrade you to have it done for you

you do most noble empress  louka i would marry the man i loved which no other queen in europe has the courage to do if i loved you though you would be as far beneath me as i am beneath you i would dare to be the equal of my inferior would you dare as much if you loved me no if you felt the beginnings of love for me you would not let it grow you dare not you would marry a rich mans daughter because you would be afraid of what other people would say of you  sergius carried away you lie it is not so by all the stars if i loved you and i were the czar himself i would set you on the throne by my side you know that i love another woman a woman as high above you as heaven is above earth and you are jealous of her  louka i have no reason to be she will never marry you now the man i told

door  sergius springing after her and catching her fiercely in his arms i will kill the swiss and afterwards i will do as i please with you  louka in his arms passive and steadfast the swiss will kill you perhaps he has beaten you in love he may beat you in war  sergius tormentedly do you think i believe that sheshe whose worst thoughts are higher than your best ones is capable of trifling with another man behind my back  louka do you think she would believe the swiss if he told her now that i am in your arms  sergius releasing her in despair damnation oh damnation mockery mockery everywhere everything i think is mocked by everything i do he strikes himself frantically on the breast coward liar fool shall i kill myself like a man or live and pretend to laugh at myself she again turns to go louka she stops near the door remember you belong to me  louka quietly what does that meanan insult  sergius commandingly it means that you love me and that i have had you here in my arms and will perhaps have you there again whether that is an insult i neither know nor care take it as you please but vehemently i will not be a coward and a trifler if i choose to love you i dare marry you in spite of all bulgaria if these hands ever touch you again they shall touch my affianced bride  louka we shall see whether you dare keep your word but take care i will not wait long  sergius again folding his arms and standing motionless in the middle of the room yes we shall see and you shall wait my pleasure     bluntschli much preoccupied with his papers     still in his hand enters leaving the door open     for louka to go out he goes across to the table     glancing at her as he passes sergius without     altering his resolute attitude watches him     steadily louka goes out leaving the door open  bluntschli absently sitting at the table as before and putting down his papers thats a remarkable looking young woman  sergius gravely without moving captain bluntschli  bluntschli eh  sergius you have deceived me you are my rival i brook no rivals at six oclock i shall be in the drillingground on the klissoura road alone on horseback with my sabre do you understand  bluntschli staring but sitting quite at his ease oh thank you thats a cavalry mans proposal im in the artillery and i have the choice of weapons if i go i shall take a machine gun and there shall be no mistake about the cartridges this time  sergius flushing but with deadly coldness take care sir it is not our custom in bulgaria to allow invitations of that kind to be trifled with  bluntschli warmly pooh dont talk to me about bulgaria you dont know what fighting is but have it your own way bring your sabre along ill meet you  sergius fiercely delighted to find his opponent a man of spirit well said switzer shall i lend you my best horse  bluntschli no damn your horsethank you all the same my dear fellow raina comes in and hears the next sentence i shall fight you on foot horsebacks too dangerous i dont want to kill you if i can help it  raina hurrying forward anxiously i have heard what captain bluntschli said sergius you are going to fight why sergius turns away in silence and goes to the stove where he stands watching her as she continues to bluntschli what about  bluntschli i dont know he hasnt told me better not interfere dear young lady no harm will be done ive often acted as sword instructor he wont be able to touch me and ill not hurt him it will save explanations in the morning i shall be off home and youll never see me or hear of me again you and he will then make it up and live happily ever after  raina turning away deeply hurt almost with a sob in her voice i never said i wanted to see you again  sergius striding forward ha that is a confession  raina haughtily what do you mean  sergius you love that man  raina scandalized sergius  sergius you allow him to make love to you behind my back just as you accept me as your affianced husband behind his bluntschli you knew our relations and you deceived me it is for that that i call you to account not for having received favours that i never enjoyed  bluntschli jumping up indignantly stuff rubbish i have received no favours why the young lady doesnt even know whether im married or not  raina forgetting herself oh collapsing on the ottoman are you  sergius you see the young ladys concern captain bluntschli denial is useless you have enjoyed the privilege of being received in her own room late at night  bluntschli interrupting him pepperily yes you blockhead she received me with a pistol at her head your cavalry were at my heels id have blown out her brains if shed uttered a cry  sergius taken aback bluntschli raina is this true  raina rising in wrathful majesty oh how dare you how dare you  bluntschli apologize man apologize he resumes his seat at the table  sergius with the old measured emphasis folding his arms i never apologize  raina passionately this is the doing of that friend of yours captain bluntschli it is he who is spreading this horrible story about me she walks about excitedly  bluntschli no hes deadburnt alive  raina stopping shocked burnt alive  bluntschli shot in the hip in a wood yard couldnt drag himself out your fellows shells set the timber on fire and burnt him with half a dozen other poor devils in the same predicament  raina how horrible  sergius and how ridiculous oh war war the dream of patriots and heroes a fraud bluntschli a hollow sham like love  raina outraged like love you say that before me  bluntschli come saranoff that matter is explained  sergius a hollow sham i say would you have come back here if nothing had passed between you except at the muzzle of your pistol raina is mistaken about our friend who was burnt he was not my informant  raina who then suddenly guessing the truth ah louka my maid my servant you were with her this morning all that time afterafteroh what sort of god is this i have been worshipping he meets her gaze with sardonic enjoyment of her disenchantment angered all the more she goes closer to him and says in a lower intenser tone do you know that i looked out of the window as i went upstairs to have another sight of my hero and i saw something that i did not understand then i know now that you were making love to her  sergius with grim humor you saw that  raina only too well she turns away and throws herself on the divan under the centre window quite overcome  sergius cynically raina our romance is shattered lifes a farce  bluntschli to raina goodhumoredly you see hes found himself out now  sergius bluntschli i have allowed you to call me a blockhead you may now call me a coward as well i refuse to fight you do you know why  bluntschli no but it doesnt matter i didnt ask the reason when you cried on and i dont ask the reason now that you cry off im a professional soldier i fight when i have to and am very glad to get out of it when i havent to youre only an amateur you think fightings an amusement  sergius you shall hear the reason all the same my professional the reason is that it takes two menreal menmen of heart blood and honorto make a genuine combat i could no more fight with you than i could make love to an ugly woman youve no magnetism youre not a man youre a machine  bluntschli apologetically quite true quite true i always was that sort of chap im very sorry but now that youve found that life isnt a farce but something quite sensible and serious what further obstacle is there to your happiness  raina riling you are very solicitous about my happiness and his do you forget his new lovelouka it is not you that he must fight now but his rival nicola  sergius rival striking his forehead  raina did you not know that they are engaged  sergius nicola are fresh abysses opening nicola  raina sarcastically a shocking sacrifice isnt it such beauty such intellect such modesty wasted on a middleaged servant man really sergius you cannot stand by and allow such a thing it would be unworthy of your chivalry  sergius losing all selfcontrol viper viper he rushes to and fro raging  bluntschli look here saranoff youre getting the worst of this  raina getting angrier do you realize what he has done captain bluntschli he has set this girl as a spy on us and her reward is that he makes love to her  sergius false monstrous  raina monstrous confronting him do you deny that she told you about captain bluntschli being in my room  sergius no but  raina interrupting do you deny that you were making love to her when she told you  sergius no but i tell you  raina cutting him short contemptuously it is unnecessary to tell us anything more that is quite enough for us she turns her back on him and sweeps majestically back to the window  bluntschli quietly as sergius in an agony of mortification rinks on the ottoman clutching his averted head between his fists i told you you were getting the worst of it saranoff  sergius tiger cat  raina running excitedly to bluntschli you hear this man calling me names captain bluntschli  bluntschli what else can he do dear lady he must defend himself somehow come very persuasively dont quarrel what good does it do raina with a gasp sits down on the ottoman and after a vain effort to look vexedly at bluntschli she falls a victim to her sense of humor and is attacked with a disposition to laugh  sergius engaged to nicola he rises ha ha going to the stove and standing with his back to it ah well bluntschli you are right to take this huge imposture of a world coolly  raina to bluntschli with an intuitive guess at his state of mind i daresay you think us a couple of grown up babies dont you  sergius grinning a little he does he does swiss civilization nursetending bulgarian barbarism eh  bluntschli blushing not at all i assure you im only very glad to get you two quieted there now lets be pleasant and talk it over in a friendly way where is this other young lady  raina listening at the door probably  sergius shivering as if a bullet had struck him and speaking with quiet but deep indignation i will prove that that at least is a calumny he goes with dignity to the door and opens it a yell of fury bursts from him as he looks out he darts into the passage and returns dragging in louka whom he flings against the table r as he cries judge her bluntschliyou the moderate cautious man judge the eavesdropper      louka stands her ground proud and silent  bluntschli shaking his head i mustnt judge her i once listened myself outside a tent when there was a mutiny brewing its all a question of the degree of provocation my life was at stake  louka my love was at stake sergius flinches ashamed of her in spite of himself i am not ashamed  raina contemptuously your love your curiosity you mean  louka facing her and retorting her contempt with interest my love stronger than anything you can feel even for your chocolate cream soldier  sergius with quick suspicionto louka what does that mean  louka fiercely it means  sergius interrupting her slightingly oh i remember the ice pudding a paltry taunt girl      major petkoff enters in his shirtsleeves  petkoff excuse my shirtsleeves gentlemen raina somebody has been wearing that coat of mine ill swear itsomebody with bigger shoulders than mine its all burst open at the back your mother is mending it i wish shed make haste i shall catch cold he looks more attentively at them is anything the matter  raina no she sits down at the stove with a tranquil air  sergius oh no he sits down at the end of the table as at

thats all right he sneezes go and ask your mistress for my coat like a good girl will you she turns to obey but nicola enters with the coat and she makes a pretence of having business in the room by taking the little table with the hookah away to the wall near the windows  raina rising quickly as she sees the coat on nicolas arm here it is papa give it to me nicola and do you put some more wood on the fire she takes the coat and brings it to the major who stands up to put it on nicola attends to the fire  petkoff to raina teasing her affectionately aha going to be very good to poor old papa

give me the coat  raina now i am going to put it on for you turn your back he turns his back and feels behind him with his arms for the sleeves she dexterously takes the photograph from the pocket and throws it on the table before bluntschli who covers it with a sheet of paper under the very nose of sergius who looks on amazed with his suspicions roused in the highest degree she then helps petkoff on with his coat there dear now are you comfortable  petkoff quite little love thanks he sits down and raina returns to her seat near the stove oh by the bye ive found something funny whats the meaning of this he put his hand into the picked pocket eh hallo he tries the other pocket well i could have swornmuch puzzled he tries the breast pocket i wondertries the original pocket where can ita light flashes on him he rises exclaiming your mothers taken it  raina very red taken what  petkoff your photograph with the inscription raina to her chocolate cream soldiera souvenir now you know

turning to the others come do you think i dont see it all goes to sergius and slaps him on the shoulder sergius youre the chocolate cream soldier arent you  sergius starting up i a chocolate cream soldier certainly not  petkoff not he looks at them they are all very serious and very conscious do you mean to tell me that raina sends photographic souvenirs to other men  sergius enigmatically the world is not such an innocent place as we used to think petkoff  bluntschli rising its all right major im the chocolate cream soldier petkoff and sergius are equally astonished the gracious young lady saved my life by giving me chocolate creams when i was starvingshall i ever forget their flavour my late friend stolz told you the story at peerot i was the fugitive  petkoff you he gasps sergius do you remember how those two women went on this morning when we mentioned it sergius smiles cynically petkoff confronts raina severely youre a nice young woman arent you  raina bitterly major saranoff has changed his mind and when i wrote that on the photograph i did not know that captain bluntschli was married  bluntschli much startled protesting vehemently im not married  raina with deep reproach you said you were  bluntschli i did not i positively did not i never was married in my life  petkoff exasperated raina will you kindly inform me if i am not asking too much which gentleman you are engaged to  raina to neither of them this young lady introducing louka who faces them all proudly is the object of major saranoffs affections at present  petkoff louka are you mad sergius why this girls engaged to nicola  nicola coming forward  i beg your pardon sir there is a mistake louka is not engaged to me  petkoff not engaged to you you scoundrel why you had twentyfive levas from me on the day of your betrothal and she had that gilt bracelet from miss raina  nicola with cool unction we gave it out so sir but it was only to give louka protection she had a soul above her station and i have been no more than her confidential servant i intend as you know sir to set up a shop later on in sofia and i look forward to her custom and recommendation should she marry into the nobility he goes out with impressive discretion leaving them all staring after him  petkoff breaking the silence well i amhm  sergius this is either the finest heroism or the most crawling baseness which is it bluntschli  bluntschli never mind whether its heroism or baseness nicolas the ablest man ive met in bulgaria ill make him manager of a hotel if he can speak french and german  louka suddenly breaking out at sergius i have been insulted by everyone here you set them the example you owe me an apology sergius immediately like a repeating clock of which the spring has been touched begins to fold his arms  bluntschli before he can speak its no use he never apologizes  louka not to you his equal and his enemy to me his poor servant he will not refuse to apologize  sergius approvingly you are right he bends his knee in his grandest manner forgive me  louka i forgive you she timidly gives him her hand which he kisses that touch makes me your affianced wife  sergius springing up ah i forgot that  louka coldly you can withdraw if you like  sergius withdraw never you belong to me he puts his arm about her and draws her to him catherine comes in and finds louka in sergiuss arms and all the rest gazing at them in bewildered astonishment  catherine what does this mean sergius releases louka  petkoff well my dear it appears that sergius is going to marry louka instead of raina she is about to break out indignantly at him he stops her by exclaiming testily dont blame me ive nothing to do with it he retreats to the stove  catherine marry louka sergius you are bound by your word to us  sergius folding his arms nothing binds me  bluntschli much pleased by this piece of common sense saranoff your hand my congratulations these heroics of yours have their practical side after all to louka gracious young lady the best wishes of a good republican he kisses her hand to rainas great disgust  catherine threateningly louka you have been telling stories  louka i have done raina no harm  catherine haughtily raina raina is equally indignant at the liberty  louka i have a right to call her raina she calls me louka i told major saranoff she would never marry him if the swiss gentleman came back  bluntschli surprised hallo  louka turning to raina i thought you were fonder of him than of sergius you know best whether i was right  bluntschli what nonsense i assure you my dear major my dear madame the gracious young lady simply saved my life nothing else she never cared two straws for me why bless my heart and soul look at the young lady and look at me she rich young beautiful with her imagination full of fairy princes and noble natures and cavalry charges and goodness knows what and i a commonplace swiss soldier who hardly knows what a decent life is after fifteen years of barracks and battlesa vagabonda man who has spoiled all his chances in life through an incurably romantic dispositiona man  sergius starting as if a needle had pricked him and interrupting bluntschli in incredulous amazement excuse me bluntschli what did you say had spoiled your chances in life  bluntschli promptly an incurably romantic disposition i ran away from home twice when i was a boy i went into the army instead of into my fathers business i climbed the balcony of this house when a man of sense would have dived into the nearest cellar i came sneaking back here to have another look at the young lady when any other man of my age would have sent the coat back  petkoff my coat  bluntschliyes thats the coat i meanwould have sent it back and gone quietly home do you suppose i am the sort of fellow a young girl falls in love with why look at our ages im thirtyfour i dont suppose the young lady is much over seventeen this estimate produces a marked sensation all the rest turning and staring at one another he proceeds innocently all that adventure which was life or death to me was only a schoolgirls game to herchocolate creams and hide and seek heres the proof he takes the photograph from the table now i ask you would a woman who took the affair seriously have sent me this and written on it raina to her chocolate cream soldiera souvenir he exhibits the photograph triumphantly as if it settled the matter beyond all possibility of refutation  petkoff thats what i was looking for how the deuce did it get there  bluntschli to raina complacently i have put everything right i hope gracious young lady  raina in uncontrollable vexation i quite agree with your account of yourself you are a romantic idiot bluntschli is unspeakably taken aback next time i hope you will know the difference between a schoolgirl of seventeen and a woman of twentythree  bluntschli stupefied twentythree she snaps the photograph contemptuously from his hand tears it across and throws the pieces at his feet  sergius with grim enjoyment of bluntschlis discomfiture bluntschli my one last belief is gone your sagacity is a fraud like all the other things you have less sense than even i have  bluntschli overwhelmed twentythree twentythree he considers hm swiftly making up his mind in that case major petkoff i beg to propose formally to become a suitor for your daughters hand in place of major saranoff retired  raina you dare  bluntschli if you were twentythree when you said those things to me this afternoon i shall take them seriously  catherine loftily polite i doubt sir whether you quite realize either my daughters position or that of major sergius saranoff whose place you propose to take the petkoffs and the saranoffs are known as the richest and most important families in the country our position is almost historical we can go back for nearly twenty years  petkoff oh never mind that catherine to bluntschli we should be most happy bluntschli if it were only a question of your position but hang it you know raina is accustomed to a very comfortable establishment sergius keeps twenty horses  bluntschli but what on earth is the use of twenty horses why its a circus  catherine severely my daughter sir is accustomed to a firstrate stable  raina hush mother youre making me ridiculous  bluntschli oh well if it comes to a question of an establishment here goes he goes impetuously to the table and seizes the papers in the blue envelope how many horses did you say  sergius twenty noble switzer  bluntschli i have two hundred horses they are amazed

raina pretending to sulk the lady says that he can keep his tablecloths and his omnibuses i am not here to be sold to the highest bidder  bluntschli i wont take that answer i appealed to you as a fugitive a beggar and a starving man you accepted me you gave me your hand to kiss your bed to sleep in and your roof to shelter me  raina interrupting him i did not give them to the emperor of switzerland  bluntschli thats just what i say he catches her hand quickly and looks her straight in the face as he adds with confident mastery now tell us who you did give them to  raina succumbing with a shy smile to my chocolate cream soldier  bluntschli with a boyish laugh of delight thatll do thank you looks at his watch and suddenly becomes businesslike times up major youve managed those
