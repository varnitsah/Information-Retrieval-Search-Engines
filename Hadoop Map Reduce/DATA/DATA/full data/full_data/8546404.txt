surprised he forgot to close it     mother west winds children   i  danny meadow mouse learns why his tail is short  danny meadow mouse sat in his doorway and looked down the lone little path across the green meadows  way way over near the smiling pool he could see old mother west winds children the merry little breezes at play  sammy jay was sitting on a fence post  he pretended to be taking a sun bath but really he was planning mischief  you never see sammy jay that he isnt in mischief or planning it  reddy fox had trotted past an hour before in a great hurry  up on the hill danny meadow mouse could just see jimmy skunk pulling over every old stick and stone he could find no matter whose house it might be and excusing himself because he was hungry and was looking for beetles  jolly round red mr sun was playing at hide and seek behind some fleecy white clouds  all the birds were singing and singing and the world was happyall but danny meadow mouse  no danny meadow mouse was not happy  indeed he was very far from happy and all because his tail was short  by and by up came old mr toad  it was a warm day and mr toad was very hot and very very thirsty  he stopped to rest beside the house of danny meadow mouse  good morning danny meadow mouse said old mr toad its a fine morning  morning said danny meadow mouse grumpily  i hope your health is good this morning continued old mr toad just as if he hadnt noticed how short and cross danny meadow mouse had answered  now old mr toad is very ugly to look upon but the ugliness is all in his looks  he has the sunniest of hearts and always he is looking for a chance to help someone  danny meadow mouse said old mr toad you make me think of your grandfather a thousand times removed  you do indeed  you look just as he did when he lost the half of his tail and realized that he never never could get it back again  danny meadow mouse sat up suddenly  what are you talking about old mr toad  what are you talking about he asked  did my grandfather a thousand times removed lose the half of his tail and was it shorter then than mine is now  was it old mr toad  and how did he come to lose the half of it  old mr toad laughed a funny silent laugh  its a long story said old mr toad and im afraid i cant tell it  go down to the smiling pool and ask greatgrandfather frog who is my first cousin how it happened your grandfather a thousand times removed lost the half of his tail  but before you go catch three fat foolish green flies and take them with you as a present to grandfather frog  danny meadow mouse could hardly wait for old mr toad to stop speaking in fact he was in such a hurry that he almost forgot his manners  not quite however for he shouted thank you mr toad thank you over his shoulder as he rushed off down the lone little path  you see his short tail had always been a matter of mortification to danny meadow mouse  all his cousins in the mouse family and the rat family have long smooth tapering tails and they have always been a source of envy to danny meadow mouse  he had felt his queer short tail to be a sort of disgrace  so when he would meet one of his cousins dancing down the lone little path with his long slim tapering tail behind him danny meadow mouse would slip out of sight under the long grass he was so ashamed of his own little tail  it looked so mean and small  he had wondered and wondered if the meadow mice had always had short tails  he used to ask everyone who came his way if they had ever seen a meadow mouse with a long tail but he had never found any one who had  perhaps thought danny meadow mouse as he hurried down the lone little path perhaps grandfather frog who is very wise will know why my tail is short  so he hurried this way and he hurried that way over the green meadows in search of fat foolish green flies  and when he had caught three he caught one more for good measure  then he started for the smiling pool as fast as his short legs would take him  when finally he reached the edge of the smiling pool he was quite out of breath  there sat greatgrandfather frog on his big green lily pad  he was blinking his great goggle eyes at jolly round red mr sun  oh grandfather frog said danny meadow mouse in a very small voice for you know he was quite out of breath with running oh grandfather frog ive brought you four fat foolish green flies  grandfather frog put a hand behind an ear and listened  did i hear someone say foolish green flies asked grandfather frog  yes grandfather frog here they are said danny meadow mouse still in a very small voice  then he gave grandfather frog the four fat foolish green flies  what is it that you want me to do for you danny meadow mouse asked grandfather frog as he smacked his lips for he knew that danny meadow mouse must want something to bring him four fat foolish green flies  if you please said danny meadow mouse very politely if you please grandfather frog old mr toad told me that you could tell me how grandfather meadow mouse a thousand times removed lost half of his tail  will you grandfather frogwill you  chugarum said grandfather frog  my cousin mr toad talks too much  but he settled himself comfortably on the big lily pad and this is what he told danny meadow mouse  once upon a time when the world was young mr meadow mouse your grandfather a thousand times removed was a very fine gentleman  he took a great deal of pride in his appearance did mr meadow mouse and they used to say on the green meadows that he spent an hour a full hour every day combing his whiskers and brushing his coat  anyway he was very fine to look upon was mr meadow mouse and not the least attractive thing about him was his beautiful long slim tail of which he was very proud  now about this time there was a great deal of trouble on the green meadows and in the green forest for some one was stealingyes stealing  mr rabbit complained first  to be sure mr rabbit was lazy and his cabbage patch had grown little more than weeds while he had been minding other folks affairs rather than his own but then that was no reason why he should lose half of the little which he did raise  and that is just what he said had happened  no one really believed what mr rabbit said for he had such a bad name for telling things which were not so that when he did tell the truth no one could be quite sure of it  so no one paid much heed to what mr rabbit said until happy jack squirrel one day went to his snug little hollow in the big chestnut tree where he stores his nuts and discovered half had been stolen then striped chipmunk lost the greater part of his winter store of corn  a fat trout was stolen from billy mink  it was a terrible time for every one suspected every one else and no one on the green meadows was happy  one evening mr meadow mouse went for a stroll along the crooked little path up the hill  it was dark very dark indeed  but just as he passed striped chipmunks granary the place where he stores his supply of corn and acorns for the winter mr meadow mouse met his cousin mr wharf rat  now mr wharf rat was very big and strong and mr meadow mouse had for a long time looked up to and admired him  good evening cousin meadow mouse said mr wharf rat swinging a bag down from his shoulder  will you do a favor for me  now mr meadow mouse felt very much flattered and as he was a very obliging fellow anyway he promptly said he would  all right said mr wharf rat  im going to get you to tote this bag down the crooked little path to the hollow chestnut tree  ive got an errand back on top of the hill  so mr meadow mouse picked up the bag which was very heavy and swung it over his shoulder  then he started down the crooked little path half way down he met striped chipmunk  good evening mr meadow mouse said striped chipmunk  what are you toting in the bag across your shoulder  now of course mr meadow mouse didnt know what was in the bag and he didnt like to admit that he was working for another for he was very proud was mr meadow mouse  so he said just a planting of potatoes i begged from jimmy skunk just a planting of potatoes striped chipmunk  now no one had ever suspected mr meadow mouse of stealingno indeed striped chipmunk would have gone his way and thought no more about it had it not happened that there was a hole in the bag and from it something dropped at his feet  striped chipmunk picked it up and it wasnt a potato  it was a fat acorn  striped chipmunk said nothing but slipped it into his pocket  good night said mr meadow mouse once more shouldering the bag  good night said striped chipmunk  no sooner had mr meadow mouse disappeared in the darkness down the crooked little path than striped chipmunk hurried to his granary  some one had been there and stolen all his acorns  then striped chipmunk ran to the house of his cousin happy jack squirrel and told him how the acorns had been stolen from his granary and how he had met mr meadow mouse with a bag over his shoulder and how mr meadow mouse had said that he was toting home a planting of potatoes he had begged from jimmy skunk  and this said striped chipmunk holding out the fat acorn is what fell out of the bag  then striped chipmunk and happy jack squirrel hurried over to jimmy skunks house and just as they expected they found that mr meadow mouse had not begged a planting of potatoes of jimmy skunk  so striped chipmunk and happy jack squirrel and jimmy skunk hurried over to mr rabbits and told him all about mr meadow mouse and the bag of potatoes that dropped acorns  mr rabbit looked very grave very grave indeed  then striped chipmunk and happy jack squirrel and jimmy skunk and mr rabbit started to tell mr coon who was cousin to old king bear  on the way they met hooty the owl and because he could fly softly and quickly they sent hooty the owl to tell all the meadow people who were awake to come to the hollow chestnut tree  so hooty the owl flew away to tell all the little meadow people who were awake to meet at the hollow chestnut tree  when they reached the hollow chestnut tree whom should they find there but mr meadow mouse fast asleep beside the bag he had brought for mr wharf rat who had wisely stayed away  very softly striped chipmunk stole up and opened the bag  out fell his store of fat acorns  then they waked mr meadow mouse and marched him off to old mother nature where they charged him with being a thief  old mother nature listened to all they had to say  she saw the bag of acorns and she heard how mr meadow mouse had said that he had a planting of potatoes  then she asked him if he had stolen the acorns yes sir she asked him right out if he had stolen the acorns  of course mr meadow mouse said that he had not stolen the acorns  then where did you get the bag of acorns asked old mother nature  when she asked this mr wharf rat who was sitting in the crowd of meadow people got up and softly tiptoed away when he thought no one was looking  but old mother nature saw him  you cant fool old mother nature  no sir you cant fool old mother nature and its of no use to try  mr meadow mouse didnt know what to say  he knew now that mr wharf rat must be the thief but mr wharf rat was his cousin and he had always looked up to him as a very fine gentleman  he couldnt tell the world that mr wharf rat was a thief  so mr meadow mouse said nothing  three times old mother nature asked mr meadow mouse where he got the bag of acorns and each time mr meadow mouse said nothing  mr meadow mouse said old mother nature and her voice was very stern i know that you did not steal the acorns of striped chipmunk i know that you did not even guess that there were stolen acorns in that bag  everyone else thinks that you are the thief who caused so much trouble on the green meadows and in the green forest  but i know who the real thief is and he is stealing away as fast as he can go down the lone little path this very minute  all of the little meadow people and forest folks turned to look down the lone little path but it was so dark none could see none but hooty the owl whose eyes are made to see in the dark  i see him cried hooty the owl  its mr wharf rat  yes said old mother nature its mr wharf rathe is the thief and this shall be his punishment always hereafter he will be driven out wherever he is found  he shall no longer live in the green meadows or the green forest  everyone will turn their backs upon him  he will live on what others throw away  he will live in filth and there will be no one to say a good word for him  he will become an outcast instead of a fine gentleman  and you mr meadow mouse in order that you may remember always to avoid bad company and that while it is a splendid thing to be loyal to your friends and not to tell tales it is also a very very wrong thing to shield those who have done wrong when by so doing you simply help them to keep on doing wrongyou shall no longer have the splendid long tail of which you are so proud but it shall be short and stubby  even while old mother nature was speaking mr meadow mouse felt his tail grow shorter and shorter and when she had finished he had just a little mean stub of a tail  of course he felt terribly  and while striped chipmunk hurried to tell him how sorry he felt and while all the other little meadow people also hurried to tell him how sorry they felt he could not be comforted  so he slipped away as quickly as he could and because he was so ashamed he crept along underneath the long grass that no one should see his short tail  and ever since that long ago time when the world was young concluded grandfather frog the meadow mice have had short tails and have always scurried along under cover of the long grass where no one will see them  and the wharf rats have never again lived in the green meadows or in the green forest but have lived on filth and garbage around the homes of men with every mans hand against them  thank you grandfather frog said danny meadow mouse very soberly now i understand why my tail is short and i shall not forget  but it isnt your fault at all danny meadow mouse cried the merry little breezes who had been listening and we love you just as much as if your tail was long  then they played tag with him all the way up the lone little path to his house till danny meadow mouse quite forgot that he had wished that his tail was long     ii  why reddy fox has no friends  the green meadows lay peaceful and still  mother moon sailing high overhead looked down upon them and smiled and smiled flooding them with her silvery light  all day long the merry little breezes of old mother west wind had romped there among the asters and goldenrod  they had played tag through the cat rushes around the smiling pool  for very mischief they had rubbed the fur of the field mice babies the wrong way and had blown a fat green fly right out of grandfather frogs mouth just as his lips came together with a smack  now they were safely tucked in bed behind the purple hills and so they missed the midnight feast at the foot of the lone pine  but reddy fox was there  you can always count on reddy fox to be about when mischief or good times are afoot especially after mr sun has pulled his nightcap on  jimmy skunk was there  if there is any mischief reddy fox does not think of jimmy skunk will be sure to discover it  billy mink was there  yes indeed billy mink was there  billy mink is another mischief maker  when reddy fox and jimmy skunk are playing pranks or in trouble of any kind you are certain to find billy mink close by  that is you are certain to find him if you look sharp enough  but billy mink is so slim he moves so quickly and his wits are so sharp that he is not seen half so often as the others  with billy mink came his cousin shadow the weasel who is sly and cruel  no one likes shadow the weasel  little joe otter and jerry muskrat came  they were late for the legs of little joe otter are so short that he is a slow traveler on land while jerry muskrat feels much more at home in the water than on the dry ground  of course peter rabbit was there  without him no party on the green meadows would be complete and peter likes to be abroad at night even better than by day  with peter came his cousin jumper the hare who had come down from the pine forest for a visit  boomer the nighthawk and hooty the owl completed the party though hooty had not been invited and no one knew that he was there  each was to contribute something to the feastthe thing that he liked best  such an array as mother moon looked down upon  reddy fox had brought a plump tender chicken stolen from farmer browns dooryard  very quietly like a thin brown shadow billy mink had slipped up to the duck pond andalas  now mother quack had one less in her pretty little flock than when as jolly round red mr sun went to bed behind the purple hills she had counted her babies as they tucked their heads under their wings  little joe otter had been fishing and he brought a great fat brother of the lamented tommy trout who didnt mind  jerry muskrat brought up from the mud of the river bottom some fine fresh water clams of which he is very fond  jimmy skunk stole three big eggs from the nest of old gray goose  peter rabbit and jumper the hare rolled up a great tender fresh cabbage  boomer the nighthawk said that he was very sorry but he was on a diet of insects which he must swallow one at a time so to save trouble he had swallowed them as he caught them  now hooty the owl is a glutton and is lazy  reddy fox and jimmy skunk and billy mink are sure to bring somethink transcribers note something i like so what is the use of spending my time hunting for what someone else will get for me said he to himself  so hooty the owl went very early to the lone pine and hid among the thick branches where no one could see him  shadow the weasel is sly and a thief and lives by his wits  so because he had rather steal than be honest he too went to the midnight spread with nothing but his appetite  now reddy fox is also a glutton and very very crafty  when he saw the plump duck brought by billy mink his mouth watered for reddy fox is very very fond of young spring ducks  so straightway he began to plan how he could get possession of billy minks duck  and when billy mink saw the fat trout little joe otter had brought his eyes danced and his heart swelled with envy for billy mink is very very fond of fish  at once he began to plan how he could secure that particular fat trout little joe otter guarded so carefully  jimmy skunk was quite contented with the eggs he had stolen from old gray goosethat is he was until he saw the plump chicken reddy fox had brought from farmer browns dooryard  then suddenly his stomach became very empty very empty indeed for chicken and jimmy skunk began to think of a way to add the chicken of reddy fox to his own stolen eggs  because reddy fox is the largest he was given the place of honor at the head of the table under the lone pine  on his right sat little joe otter and on his left jerry muskrat  shadow the weasel was next to little joe otter while right across from him was jimmy skunk  peter rabbit was next sitting opposite his cousin jumper the hare  at the extreme end facing reddy fox sat billy mink with the plump duck right under his sharp little nose  boomer the nighthawk excused himself on the plea that he needed exercise to aid digestion and as he had brought nothing to the feast his excuse was politely accepted  reddy fox is very very cunning and his crafty brain had been busily working out a plan to get all these good things for himself  little brothers of the green meadows began reddy fox we have met here tonight for a feast of brotherly love  reddy fox paused a moment to look hungrily at billy minks duck  billy mink cast a longing eye at little joe otters trout while jimmy skunk stole an envious glance at reddy foxs chicken  but there is one missing to make our joy complete continued reddy fox  who has seen bobby coon  no one had seen bobby coon  somehow happygolucky bobby coon had been overlooked when the invitations were sent out  i move continued reddy fox that because billy mink runs swiftly and because he knows where bobby coon usually is to be found he be appointed a committee of one to find bobby coon and bring him to the feast  now nothing could have been less to the liking of billy mink but there was nothing for him to do but to yield as gracefully as he could and go in search of bobby coon  no sooner had billy mink disappeared down the lone little path than reddy fox recalled a nest of grouse eggs he had seen that day under a big hemlock and he proposed that inasmuch as jimmy skunk already wore stripes for having stolen a nest of eggs from mrs grouse he was just the one to go steal these eggs and bring them to the feast  of course there was nothing for jimmy skunk to do but to yield as gracefully as he could and go in search of the nest of eggs under the big hemlock  no sooner had jimmy skunk started off than reddy fox remembered a big shining sucker farmer browns boy had caught that afternoon and tossed among the rushes beside the smiling pool  little joe otter listened and his mouth watered and watered until he could sit still no longer if you please said little joe otter ill run down to the smiling pool and get that sucker to add to the feast  no sooner was little joe otter out of sight than reddy fox was reminded of a field of carrots on the other side of the green meadows  now peter rabbit and jumper the hare are very fond of tender young carrots and they volunteered to bring a supply for the feast  so away they hurried with big jumps down the lone little path and out across the green meadows  no sooner were peter rabbit and jumper the hare fairly started than reddy fox began to tell of some luscious sweet apples he had noticed under a wild apple tree a little way back on the hill  now jerry muskrat is quite as fond of luscious sweet apples as of freshwater clams so quietly slipping away he set out in quest of the wild apple tree a little way back on the hill  no sooner was jerry muskrat lost in the black shadows than reddy fox turned to speak to shadow the weasel  but shadow the weasel believes that a feast in the stomach is worth two banquets untasted so while the others had been talking he had quietly sucked dry the three big eggs stolen by jimmy skunk from old gray goose and then because he is so slim and so quick and so sly he slipped away without anyone seeing him  so when reddy fox turned to speak to shadow the weasel he found himself alone  at least he thought himself alone and he smiled a wicked selfish smile as he walked over to billy minks duck  he was thinking how smart he had been to get rid of all the others and of how he would enjoy the feast all by himself  as reddy fox stooped to pick up billy minks duck a great shadow dropped softly oh so softly out of the lone pine down onto the plump chicken  then without the teeniest weeniest bit of noise it floated back into the lone pine and with it went the plump chicken  reddy fox still with his wicked selfish smile trotted back with billy minks duck but he dropped it in sheer surprise when he discovered that his plump chicken had disappeared  now reddy fox is very suspicious as people who are not honest themselves are very apt to be  so he left billy minks duck where he had dropped it and trotted very very softly up the lone little path to try to catch the thief who had stolen his plump chicken  no sooner was his back turned than down out of the lone pine floated the great shadow and when a minute later reddy fox returned billy minks duck had also disappeared  reddy fox could hardly believe his eyes  he didnt smile now  he was too angry and too frightened  yes reddy fox was frightened  he walked in a big circle round and round the place where the plump chicken and the duck had been and the more he walked the more suspicious he became  he wrinkled and wrinkled his little black nose in an effort to smell the intruder but not a whiff could he get  all was as still and peaceful as could be  little joe otters trout lay shining in the moonlight  the big head of cabbage lay just where peter rabbit and jumper the hare had left it  reddy fox rubbed his eyes to make sure that he was not dreaming and that the plump chicken and the duck were not there too  just then bowser the hound over at farmer browns bayed at the moon reddy fox always is nervous and by this time he was so fidgety that he couldnt stand still  when bowser the hound bayed at the moon reddy fox jumped a foot off the ground and whirled about in the direction of farmer browns house  then he remembered that bowser the hound is always chained up at night so that he had nothing to fear from him  after listening and looking a moment reddy fox decided that all was safe  well said he to himself ill have that fat trout anyway and turned to get it  but the fat trout he had seen a minute before shining in the moonlight had also disappeared  reddy fox looked and looked until his eyes nearly popped out of his head  then he did what all cowards doran home as fast as his legs could carry him  now of course billy mink didnt find bobby coon and when he came back up the lone little path he was very tired very hungry and very cross and of course jimmy skunk failed to find the nest of mrs grouse and little joe otter could find no trace of the shining big sucker among the rushes beside the smiling pool  they also were very tired very hungry and very cross  when the three returned to the lone pine and found nothing there but the big head of cabbage which none of them liked the empty egg shells of old gray goose and jerry muskrats clams they straightway fell to accusing each other of having stolen the duck and the fat trout and the eggs and began to quarrel dreadfully  pretty soon up came peter rabbit and jumper the hare who had failed to find the tender young carrots  and up came jerry muskrat who had found no luscious sweet apples  where is reddy fox asked peter rabbit  sure enough where was reddy fox  billy mink and little joe otter and jimmy skunk stopped quarreling and looked at each other  reddy fox is the thief they cried all together  peter rabbit and jumper the hare and jerry muskrat agreed that reddy fox must be the thief and had sent them all away on false errands that he might have the feast all to himself  so because there was nothing else to do billy mink and little joe otter tired and hungry and angry started for their homes beside the laughing brook  and jimmy skunk also tired and hungry and angry started off up the crooked little path to look for some beetles  but peter rabbit and jumper the hare sat down to enjoy the big head of cabbage while close beside them sat jerry muskrat smacking his lips over his clams they tasted so good  mother moon looked down and smiled and smiled for she knew that each had a clear conscience for they had done no harm to anyone  and up in the thick top of the great pine hooty the owl nodded sleepily for his stomach was very full of chicken and duck and trout although he had not been invited to the party  and this is why reddy fox has no true friends on the green meadows     iii  why peter rabbits ears are long  the merry little breezes of old mother west wind were tired  ever since she had turned them out of her big bag onto the green meadows early that morning they had romped and played tag and chased butterflies while old mother west wind herself went to hunt for a raincloud which had wandered away before it had watered the thirsty little plants who were bravely trying to keep the green meadows lovely and truly green  jolly round red mr sun wore his broadest smile and the more he smiled the warmer it grew  mr sun is never thirsty himself never the least little bit or perhaps he would have helped old mother west wind find the wandering raincloud  the merry little breezes threw themselves down on the edge of the smiling pool where the rushes grow tall and there they took turns rocking the cradle which held mrs redwings four babies  pretty soon one of the merry little breezes peeping through the rushes spied peter rabbit sitting up very straight on the edge of the green meadows  his long ears were pointed straight up his big eyes were very wide open and he seemed to be looking and listening with a great deal of curiosity  i wonder why it is that peter rabbit has such long ears said the merry little breeze  chugarum replied a great deep voice right behind him  all the merry little breezes jumped up and ran through the rushes to the very edge of the smiling pool  there on a great green lily pad sat greatgrandfather frog his hands folded across his white and yellow waistcoat and his green coat shining spick and span  chugarum said grandfather frog  oh grandfather frog cried the merry little breezes all together do tell us why it is that peter rabbit has such long ears  grandfather frog cleared his throat  he looked to the east and cleared his throat again  then he looked to the west and cleared his throat he looked north and he looked south and each time he cleared his throat but said nothing  finally he folded his hands once more over his white and yellow waistcoat and looking straight up at jolly round red mr sun he remarked in his very deepest voice and to no one in particular  if i had four fat foolish green flies it is just possible that i might remember how it happens that peter rabbit has such long ears  then up jumped all the merry little breezes and away they raced  some of them went east some of them went west some of them went north some of them went south all looking for fat foolish green flies for grandfather frog  by and by they came skipping back one by one to the edge of the smiling pool each with a fat foolish green fly and each stopping to give mrs redwings cradle a gentle push  when grandfather frog had swallowed all the fat foolish green flies brought by the merry little breezes he settled himself comfortably on his big lily pad once more and began  once upon a time very long ago when the world was young mr rabbitnot our peter rabbit but his grandfather a thousand times removedhad short ears like all the other meadow people and also his four legs were all of the same length just exactly the same length  now mr rabbit had a great deal of curiosity a very great deal indeed  he was forever pushing his prying little nose into other peoples affairs which you know is a most unpleasant habit  in fact mr rabbit had become a nuisance  illustration mr rabbit had a great deal of curiosity a very great deal indeed  whenever billy mink stopped to pass the time of day with jerry muskrat they were sure to find mr rabbit standing close by listening to all they said  if johnny chucks mother ran over to have a few minutes chat with jimmy skunks mother the first thing they knew mr rabbit would be squatting down in the grass right behind them  the older he grew the worse mr rabbit became  he would spend his evenings going from house to house tiptoeing softly up to the windows to listen to what the folks inside were saying  and the more he heard the more mr rabbits curiosity grew  now like most people who meddle in other folks affairs mr rabbit had no time to tend to his own business  his cabbage patch grew up to weeds  his house leaked his fences fell to pieces and altogether his was the worst looking place on the green meadows  worse still mr rabbit was a trouble maker  he just couldnt keep his tongue still  and like most gossips he never could tell the exact truth  dear me dear me said grandfather frog shaking his head solemnly things had come to a dreadful pass on the green meadows  reddy fox and bobby coon never met without fighting  jimmy skunk and johnny chuck turned their backs on each other  jerry muskrat little joe otter and billy mink called each other bad names  all because mr rabbit had told so many stories that were not true  now when old mother nature visited the green meadows she soon saw what a dreadful state all the meadow people were in and she began to inquire how it all came about  its all because of mr rabbit said reddy fox  no one is to blame but mr rabbit said striped chipmunk  everywhere old mother nature inquired it was the samemr rabbit mr rabbit mr rabbit  so then old mother nature sent for blustering great mr north wind who is very strong  and she sent for mr rabbit  mr rabbit trembled in his shoes when he got old mother natures message  he would have liked to run away and hide  but he did not dare do that for he knew that there was nowhere he could hide that mother nature would not find him sooner or later  and besides his curiosity would give him no peace  he just had to know what old mother nature wanted  so peter rabbit put on his best suit which was very shabby and set out for the lone pine to see what old mother nature wanted  when he got there he found all the little people of the green meadows and all the little folks of the green forest there before him  there were reddy fox johnny chuck striped chipmunk happy jack squirrel mr black snake old mr crow sammy jay billy mink little joe otter jerry muskrat spotty the turtle old king bear his cousin mr coon and all the other little people  when he saw all who had gathered under the lone pine and how they all looked crossly at him mr rabbit was so frightened that his heart went pitapat pitapat pitapat and he wanted more than ever to run away  but he didnt dare to  no sir he didnt dare to  and then he was so curious to know what it all meant that he wouldnt have run if he had dared  old mother nature made mr rabbit sit up on an old log where all could see him  then in turn she asked each present who was the cause of all the trouble on the green meadows  and each in turn answered mr rabbit  mr rabbit said old mother nature you are lazy for your cabbage patch has all gone to weeds  you are shiftless for your house leaks you are a sneak for you creep up where you are not wanted and listen to things which do not concern you  you are a thief for you steal the secrets of others  you are a prevaricator for you tell things which are not so  mr rabbit you are all thesea lazy shiftless sneak thief and prevaricator  it was dreadful  mother nature paused and mr rabbit felt oh so ashamed  he did not look up but he felt he just felt all the eyes of all the little meadow people and forest folk burning right into him so he hung his head and two great tears fell splash right at his feet you see mr rabbit wasnt altogether bad  it was just this dreadful curiosity  old mother nature knew this and down in her heart she loved mr rabbit and was oh so sorry for him  mr rabbit continued old mother nature because your curiosity is so great your ears shall be made long that every one who sees you may know that it is not safe to talk when you are near  because you are a sneak and steal up to people unseen yourhind legs shall be made long so that whenever you sit up straight you will be tall and every one can see you and whenever you run you will go with great jumps and every one will know who it is running away  and because you are shiftless and your house leaks you will hereafter live in a hole in the ground  then old mother nature took mr rabbit by his two ears and big strong mr north wind took peter rabbit by his hind legs and they both pulled  and when they put him down peter rabbits ears and his hind legs were long many times longer than they used to be  when he tried to run away to hide his shame he found that the only way he could go was with great jumps and you may be sure he jumped as fast as he could  and ever since that long ago time when the world was young rabbits have had long ears and long hind legs all because of the curiosity of their grandfather a thousand times removed  and now you know why peter rabbits ears are long and why he is always sitting up and listening concluded greatgrandfather frog  thank you thank you grandfather frog shouted all the merry little breezes and raced away to help old mother west wind drive up the wandering raincloud which she had found at last     iv  reddy fox disobeys  on the brow of the hill by the lone pine sat reddy fox  every few moments he pointed his little black nose up at the round yellow moon and barked  way over across the broad white meadows which in summer time are green you know in the dooryard of farmer browns house bowser the hound sat and barked at the moon too  yapyapyap barked reddy fox as loud as he could  bowwowwow said bowser the hound in his deepest voice  then both would listen and watch the million little stars twinkle and twinkle in the frosty sky  now just why reddy fox should bark at the moon he did not know  he just had to  every night for a week he had sat at the foot of the lone pine and barked and barked until his throat was sore  every night old mother fox had warned him that noisy children would come to no good end and every night reddy had promised that he would bark no more  but every night when the first silver flood of witching light crept over the hill and cast strange shadows from the naked branches of the trees reddy forgot all about his promise  deep down under his little red coat was a strange feeling which he could not explain  he simply must bark so up to the lone pine he would go and yap and yap and yap until all the little meadow people who were not asleep knew just where reddy fox was  bowser the hound knew too and he made up his mind that reddy fox was making fun of him  now bowser did not like to be made fun of any more than little boys and girls do and he made up his mind that if ever he could break his chain or that if ever farmer brown forgot to chain him up he would teach reddy fox a lesson that reddy would never forget  yapyapyap barked reddy fox and then listened to hear bowsers deep voice reply  but this time there was no reply  reddy listened and listened and then tried it again  way off on a distant hill he could hear hooty the owl  close by him jack frost was busy snapping sticks  down on the white meadows he could see jimmy skunk prowling about  once he heard a rooster crow sleepily in farmer browns henhouse but he thought of bowser the hound and though his mouth watered he did not dare risk a closer acquaintance with the big dog so he sat still and barked and pretty soon he forgot all else but the moon and the sound of his own voice  now bowser the hound had managed to slip his collar  aha thought bowser now ill teach reddy fox to make fun of me and like a shadow he slipped through the fence and across the white meadows towards the lone pine  reddy fox had just barked for the hundreth time when he heard a twig crack just back of him  it had a different sound from the noisy crack of jack frost and reddy stopped a yap right in the middle and whirled about to see what it might be  there was bowser the hound almost upon him his eyes flashing fire his great red jaws wide open and every hair on his back bristling with rage  reddy fox didnt wait to say good evening or to see more  oh no he turned a back somersault and away he sped over the hard snowy crust as fast as his legs could carry him  bowser baying at the moon he liked to hear but bowser baying at his heels was another matter and reddy ran as he had never run before  down across the white meadows he sped bowser frightening all the echoes with the roar of his big voice as he followed in full cry  how reddy did wish that he had minded mother fox  how safe and snug and warm was his home under the roots of the old hickory tree and how he did wish that he was safely there  but it would never do to go there now for that would tell bowser where he lived and bowser would take farmer brown there and that would be the end of reddy fox and of mother fox and of all the brother and sister foxes  so reddy twisted and turned and ran this way and ran that way and the longer he ran the shorter his breath grew  it was coming in great pants now  his bushy tail of which he was so proud had become very heavy  how reddy fox did wish and wish that he had minded mother fox he twisted and turned and doubled this way and that way and all the time bowser the hound got closer and closer  now way off on the hill behind the white meadows mother fox had been hunting for her supper  she had heard the yapyapyap of reddy fox as he barked at the moon and she had heard bowser baying over in the barnyard of farmer brown  then she had heard the yap of reddy fox cut short in the middle and the roar of bowsers big voice as he started to chase reddy fox  she knew that reddy could run fast but she also knew that bowser the hound had a wonderful nose and that bowser would never give up  so mother fox pattered down the crooked little path onto the white meadows where she could see the chase when she got near enough she barked twice to tell reddy that she would help him  now reddy fox was so tired that he was almost in despair when he heard mother fox bark  but he knew that mother fox was so wise and she had so often fooled bowser the hound that if he could hold out just a little longer she would help him  so for a few minutes he ran faster than ever and he gained a long way on bowser the hound  as he passed a shock of corn that had been left standing on the white meadows mother fox stepped out from behind it  go home reddy fox said she sharply go home and stay there until i come  then she deliberately sat down in front of the shock of corn to wait until bowser the hound should come in sight  now bowser the hound kept his eyes and nose on the track of reddy fox looking up only once in a while to see where he was going so he did not see reddy fox slip behind the corn shock and when he did look up he saw only mother fox sitting there waiting for him  now bowser the hound thinks slowly  when he saw old mother fox sitting there he did not stop to think that it was not reddy fox whom he had been following or he would have known better than to waste his time following old mother fox  he would have just hunted around until he had found where reddy had gone to  but bowser the hound thinks slowly when he saw old mother fox sitting there he thought it was reddy fox and that now he had him  with a great roar of his big voice he sprang forward  mother fox waited until he was almost upon her then springing to one side she trotted off a little way  at once bowser the hound started after her she pretended to be very tired  every time he rushed forward she managed to just slip out of his grasp  little by little she led him across the white meadows back towards farmer browns barnyard  pretty soon old mother fox began to run as fast as she could and that is very fast indeed  she left bowser the hound a long long way behind  when she came to a stone wall she jumped up on the stone wall and ran along it just like a squirrel every once in a while she would make a long jump and then trot along a little way again  she knew that stones do not carry the scent well and that bowser the hound would have hard work to smell her on the stone wall  way down at the end of the pasture an old apple tree stretched a long limb out towards the stone wall  when she got opposite to this she jumped onto this long limb and ran up into the tree  there in the crotch close to the trunk she sat and watched  bowser the hound making a tremendous noise followed her trail up to the stone wall  then he was puzzled  he sniffed this way and he sniffed that way but he could not tell where mother fox had disappeared to  he looked up at old mother moon and bayed and bayed but old mother moon did not help him a bit  then he jumped over the stone wall and looked and looked and smelled and smelled but no track of mother fox could he find  then he ran up along the stone wall a little way and then down along the stone wall a little way but still he could not find a track of mother fox  the longer he hunted the angrier he grew  old mother fox sitting in the apple tree watched him and laughed and laughed to herself  then when she grew tired of watching him she made a long jump out into the field and trotted off home to punish reddy fox for his disobedience  when she got there she found reddy fox very much ashamed very tired and very sorrowful and since that time reddy fox has never barked at the moon     v  striped chipmunks pockets  it was one of striped chipmunks busy days  every day is a busy day with striped chipmunk at this season of the year for the sweet acorns are ripe and the hickory nuts rattle down whenever old mother west wind shakes the trees while every night jack frost opens chestnut burrs just to see the squirrels scamper for the plump brown nuts the next morning  so striped chipmunk was very busy very busy indeed  he whisked in and out of the old stone wall along one edge of the green meadows  back and forth back and forth sometimes to the old hickory tree sometimes to the hollow chestnut tree sometimes to the great oak on the edge of the green forest striped chipmunk scampered  old mother west wind coming down from the purple hills very early in the morning had found striped chipmunk up before her and hard at work later when jolly round red mr sun had climbed up into the sky the merry little breezes had spied striped chipmunk whisking along the old stone wall and had raced over to play with him for the merry little breezes are very fond of striped chipmunk  they got there just in time to see him disappear under a great stone in the old wall  in a minute he was out again and off as fast as he could go to the old hickory tree  oh striped chipmunk come play with us shouted the merry little breezes running after him  but striped chipmunk just flirted his funny little tail and winked with both his bright eyes at them  busy  busy  busy said striped chipmunk hurrying along as fast as his short legs could take him  the merry little breezes laughed and one of them dancing ahead pulled the funny little tail of striped chipmunk  its a beautiful day do come and play with us cried the merry little breeze  but striped chipmunk flirted his tail over his back once more  busy busy busy he shouted over his shoulder and ran faster than ever  in a few minutes he was back again but such a queerlooking fellow as he was  his head was twice as big as it had been before and you would hardly have known that it was striped chipmunk but for the saucy way he twitched his funny little tail and the spry way he scampered along the old stone wall  oh striped chipmunks got the mumps shouted the merry little breezes  but striped chipmunk said never a word  he couldnt  he ran faster than ever until he disappeared under the big stone  when he popped his head out again he was just his usual saucy little self  say striped chipmunk cried the merry little breezes rushing over to him tell us how you happen to have pockets in your cheeks  but striped chipmunk just snapped his bright eyes at them and said busy busy busy as he scuttled over to the hollow chestnut tree  the merry little breezes saw that it was no use at all to try to tempt striped chipmunk to play with them or to answer questions  i tell you what cried one lets go ask greatgrandfather frog how striped chipmunk happens to have pockets in his cheeks  hell know  so away they started after they had raced over to the big hollow chestnut tree and sent a shower of brown nuts rattling down to striped chipmunk from the burrs that jack frost had opened the night before  goodbye striped chipmunk they shouted as they romped across the green meadows  and striped chipmunk stopped long enough to shout goodbye before he filled his pockets with the brown nuts  old grandfather frog sat on his big green lily pad blinking in the sun it was very still very very still indeed  suddenly out of the brown bulrushes burst the merry little breezes and surrounded old grandfather frog  and every one of them had brought to him a fat foolish green fly  grandfathers big goggly eyes sparkled and he gave a funny little hop up into the air as he caught each foolish green fly  when the last one was safely inside his white and yellow waistcoat he settled himself comfortably on the big green lily pad and folded his hands over the foolish green flies  chugarum  said  grandfather frog  what is it you want this morning  oh grandfather frog cried the merry little breezes tell us how it happens that striped chipmunk has pockets in his cheeks  do tell us grandfather frog  please do  chugarum said grandfather frog  how should i know  but you do know grandfather frog you know you do  please tell us cried the merry little breezes as they settled themselves among the rushes  and presently grandfather frog began  once upon a timea long long while ago  when the world was young asked a mischievous little breeze  grandfather frog pretended to be very much put out by the interruption and tried to look very severe  but the merry little breezes were all giggling so that presently he had to smile too  yes said he it was when the world was young before old king bear became king  mr chipmunk striped chipmunks greatgreatgreatgrandfather a thousand times removed was the smallest of the squirrels just as striped chipmunk is now  but he didnt mind that not the least little bit  mr gray squirrel was four times as big and had a handsome tail mr fox squirrel was four times as big and he also had a handsome tail mr red squirrel was twice as big and he thought his tail was very good to see  but mr chipmunk didnt envy his big cousins their fine tails not he  you see he had himself a beautiful striped coat of which he was very proud and which he thought much more to be desired than a big tail  so mr chipmunk went his way happy and contented and he was such a merry little fellow and so full of fun and cut such funny capers that everybody loved mr chipmunk  one day when the nights were cool and all the trees had put on their brilliant colors old mother nature sent word down across the green meadows that every squirrel should gather for her and store away until she came a thousand nuts  now the squirrels had grown fat and lazy through the long summer all but mr chipmunk who frisked about so much that he had no chance to grow fat  mr gray squirrel grumbled  mr fox squirrel grumbled  mr red squirrel grumbled  but they didnt dare disobey old mother nature so they all set out each to gather a thousand nuts  and mr chipmunk alone was pleasant and cheerful  when they reached the nut trees what do you suppose they discovered why that they had been so greedy that they had eaten most of the nuts and it was going to be hard work to find and store a thousand nuts for old mother nature  then they began to hurry did mr gray squirrel and mr fox squirrel and mr red squirrel each trying to make sure of his thousand nuts  they quarreled and they fought over the nuts on the ground and even up in the trees  and because they were so big and so strong they pushed mr chipmunk this way and they pushed him that way and often just as he was going to pick up a fat nut one of them would knock him over and make off with the prize  poor mr chipmunk kept his temper and was as polite as ever but how he did work  his cousins are great climbers and could get the nuts still left on the trees but mr chipmunk is a poor climber so he had to be content with those on the ground  of course he could carry only one nut at a time and his legs were so short that he had to run as fast as ever he could to store each nut in his secret storehouse and get back for another  and while the others quarreled and fought he hurried back and forth back and forth from early morning until jolly round red mr sun pulled his night cap on behind the purple hills hunting for nuts and putting them away in his secret storehouse  but the nuts grew scarcer and scarcer on the ground and harder to find for the other squirrels were picking them up too and then they did not have so far to carry them  sometimes one of his cousins up in the trees would drop a nut but mr chipmunk never would take it not even when he was having hard work to find any for said he to himself if my cousin drops a nut it is his nut just the same  finally mr gray squirrel announced that he had got his thousand nuts then mr fox squirrel announced that he had got his thousand nuts  the next day mr red squirrel stopped hunting because he had his thousand nuts  but mr chipmunk had hardly more than half as many  and that night he made a dreadful discoverysome one had found his secret storehouse and had stolen some of his precious nuts  its of no use to cry over what cant be helped said mr chipmunk and the next morning he bravely started out again  he had worked so hard that he had grown thinner and thinner until now he was only a shadow of his old self  but he was as cheerful as ever and kept right on hunting and hunting for stray nuts  mr gray squirrel and mr fox squirrel and mr red squirrel sat around and rested and made fun of him  way up in the tops of the tallest trees a few nuts still clung but his cousins did not once offer to go up and shake them down for mr chipmunk  and then old mother nature came down across the green meadows  first mr gray squirrel took her to his storehouse and she counted his thousand nuts  then mr fox squirrel led her to his storehouse and she counted his thousand nuts  then mr red squirrel showed her his storehouse and she counted his thousand nuts  last of all mr chipmunk led her to his secret storehouse and showed her the pile of nuts he had worked so hard to get  old mother nature didnt need to count them to see that there were not a thousand there  ive done the best i could said mr chipmunk bravely and he trembled all over he was so tired  old mother nature said never a word but went out on the green meadows and sent the merry little breezes to call together all the little meadow people and all the little forest folks  when they had all gathered before her she suddenly turned to mr gray squirrel  go bring me a hundred nuts from your storehouse said she  then she turned to mr fox squirrel  go bring me a hundred nuts from your storehouse said she  last of all she called mr red squirrel out where all could see him mr red squirrel crept out very slowly  his teeth chattered and his tail of which he was so proud dragged on the ground for you see mr red squirrel had something on his mind  then old mother nature told how she had ordered each squirrel to get and store for her a thousand nuts  she told just how selfish mr gray squirrel and mr fox squirrel had been  she told just how hard mr chipmunk had worked and then she told how part of his precious store had been stolen  and there said old mother nature in a loud voice so that every one should hear there is the thief  then she commanded mr red squirrel to go to his storehouse and bring her half of the biggest and best nuts he had there  mr red squirrel sneaked off with his head hanging and began to bring the nuts  and as he tramped back and forth back and forth all the little meadow people and all the little forest folks pointed their fingers at him and cried thief  thief  thief  when all the nuts had been brought to her by mr gray squirrel and mr fox squirrel and mr red squirrel old mother nature gathered them all up and put them in the secret storehouse of mr chipmunk  then she set mr chipmunk up on an old stump where all could see him and she said  mr chipmunk because you have been faithful because you have been cheerful because you have done your best henceforth you shall have two pockets one in each cheek so that you can carry two nuts at once that you may not have to work so hard the next time i tell you to store a thousand nuts  and all the little meadow people and all the little forest folks shouted hurrah for mr chipmunk  all but his cousins mr gray squirrel and mr fox squirrel and mr red squirrel who hid themselves for shame  and ever since that time long ago when the world was young the chipmunks have had pockets in their cheeks  you cant fool old mother nature concluded greatgrandfather frog no sir you cant fool old mother nature and its no use to try  thank you thank you cried the merry little breezes clapping their hands  then they all raced across the green meadows to shake down some more nuts for striped chipmunk     vi  reddy fox the boaster  johnny chuck waddled down the lone little path across the green meadows  johnny chuck was very fat and rollypoly  his yellow brown coat fitted him so snugly that it seemed as if it must burst  johnny chuck was feeling very happyvery happy indeed for you see johnny chuck long ago found the best thing in the world which is contentment  jolly round red mr sun looking down from the sky smiled and smiled to see johnny chuck waddling down the lone little path for he loved the merryhearted little fellow as do all the little meadow peopleall but reddy fox for reddy fox has not forgotten the surprise johnny chuck once gave him and how he called him a fraid cat  once in a while johnny chuck stopped to brush his coat carefully for he is very particular about his appearance is johnny chuck  by and by he came to the old butternut tree down by the smiling pool  he could see it a long time before he reached it and up in the top of it he could see blacky the crow flapping his wings and cawing at the top of his voice  there must be something going on said johnny chuck to himself and began to waddle faster  he looked so very queer when he tried to hurry that jolly round red mr sun smiled more than ever  when he was almost to the old butternut tree johnny chuck sat up very straight so that his head came just above the tall meadow grasses beside the lone little path  he could see the merry little breezes dancing and racing under the old butternut tree and having such a good time  and he could see the long ears of peter rabbit standing up straight above the tall meadow grasses  one of the merry little breezes spied johnny chuck  hurry up johnny chuck he shouted and johnny chuck hurried  when he reached the old butternut tree he was all out of breath  he was puffing and blowing and he was so warm that he wished just for a minute a single little minute that he could swim like billy mink and jerry muskrat and little joe otter so that he could jump into the smiling pool and cool off  hello johnny chuck shouted peter rabbit  hello yourself and see how you like it replied johnny chuck  hello myself said peter rabbit  and then because it was so very foolish everybody laughed  it is a good thing to feel foolishly happy on a beautiful sunshiny day especially down on the green meadows  jimmy skunk was there  he was feeling very very good indeed was jimmy skunk for he had found some very fine beetles for his breakfast  little joe otter was there and billy mink and jerry muskrat and happy jack squirrel and of course reddy fox was there  oh my yes of course reddy fox was there  reddy fox never misses a chance to show off  he was wearing his very newest red coat and his whitest waistcoat  he had brushed his tail till it looked very handsome and every few minutes he would turn and admire it  reddy fox thought himself a very fine gentleman  he admired himself and he wanted every one else to admire him  lets do stunts said peter rabbit  i can jump farther than anybody here  then peter rabbit jumped a tremendously long jump  then everybody jumped everybody but reddy fox  even johnny chuck jumped and because he was so rollypoly he tumbled over and over and everybody laughed and johnny chuck laughed loudest of all  and because his hind legs are long and meant for jumping peter rabbit had jumped farther than any one else  i can climb to the top of the old butternut tree quicker than anybody else cried happy jack squirrel and away he started with bobby coon and billy mink after him for though billy mink is a famous swimmer and can run swiftly he can also climb when he has to  but happy jack squirrel was at the top of the old butternut tree almost before the others had started  the merry little breezes clapped their hands and everybody shouted for happy jack squirrel everybody but reddy fox  i can swim faster than anybody here shouted little joe otter  in a flash three little brown coats splashed into the smiling pool so suddenly that they almost upset greatgrandfather frog watching from his big green lily pad  they belonged to little joe otter billy mink and jerry muskrat  across the smiling pool and back again they raced and little joe otter was first out on the bank  hurrah for little joe otter shouted blacky the crow  and everybody shouted hurrah  everybody but reddy fox  what can you do jimmy skunk asked peter rabbit dancing up and down he was so excited  jimmy skunk yawned lazily  i can throw a wonderful perfume farther than anybody here said jimmy skunk  we know it  we know it shouted the merry little breezes as everybody tumbled heels over head away from jimmy skunk even reddy fox  but please dont  and jimmy skunk didnt  then they all came back reddy fox carefully brushing his handsome red coat which had become sadly mussed he had fled in such a hurry  now for the first time in his life johnny chuck began to feel just a wee wee bit discontented  what was there he could do better than any one else  he couldnt jump and he couldnt climb and he couldnt swim he couldnt even run fast because he was so fat and round and rollypoly  he quite forgot that he was so sunnyhearted and goodnatured that everybody loved him everybody but reddy fox  just then reddy fox began to boast for reddy fox is a great boaster pooh said reddy fox pooh  anybody could jump if their legs were made for jumping  and whats the good of climbing trees anyway  now i can run faster than anybody herefaster than anybody in the whole world said reddy fox puffing himself out  chugarum said grandfather frog  you cant beat spotty the turtle  then everyone shouted and rolled over and over in the grass they were so tickled for every one remembered how spotty the turtle had once won a race from reddy fox  for a minute reddy fox looked very foolish  then he lost his temper which is a very unwise thing to do for it is hard to find again  he swelled himself out until every hair stood on end and he looked twice as big as he did before  he strutted up and down and glared at each in turn  and im not afraid of any living thing on the green meadows boasted reddy fox  chugarum said grandfather frog  do i see bowser the hound  every hair on reddy fox suddenly fell back into place  he whirled about nervously and anxiously looked over the green meadows  then everybody shouted again and rolled over and over in the grass and held on to their sides for you see bowser the hound wasnt there at all  but everybody took good care to keep away from reddy fox everybody but johnny chuck  he just sat still and chuckled and chuckled till his fat sides shook  what are you laughing at demanded reddy fox  i was just thinking said johnny chuck that though you can run so fast you cant even catch me  reddy fox just glared at him for a minute he was so mad  then he sprang straight at johnny chuck  ill show you he snarled  now johnny chuck had been sitting close beside a hole that grandfather chuck had dug a long time before and which was empty  in a flash johnny chuck disappeared head first in the hole  now the hole was too small for reddy fox to enter but he was so angry that he straightway began to dig it larger  my how the sand did fly  it poured out behind reddy fox in a stream of shining yellow  johnny chuck ran down the long tunnel underground until he reached the end  then when he heard reddy fox digging and knew that he was really coming johnny chuck began to dig too only instead of digging down he dug up towards the sunshine and the blue sky  my how his short legs did fly and his stout little claws dug into the soft earth  his little forepaws flew so fast that if you had been there you could hardly have seen them at all  and with his strong hind legs he kicked the sand right back into the face of reddy fox  all the little meadow people gathered around the hole where johnny chuck and reddy fox had disappeared  they were very anxious very anxious indeed  would reddy fox catch johnny chuck  and what would he do to him  was all their fun to end in something terrible to sunnyhearted merry johnny chuck whom everybody loved  all of a sudden pop right out of the solid earth among the daisies and buttercups just like a jackinthebox came johnny chuck  he looked very warm and a little tired but he was still chuckling as he scampered across to another hole of grandfather chucks  by and by something else crawled out of the hole johnny chuck had made could it be reddy fox  where were his white waistcoat and beautiful red coat  and was that thing dragging behind him his splendid tail  he crept out of the hole and then just lay down and panted for breath he was almost too tired to move  then he began to spit sand out of his mouth and blow it out of his nose and try to wipe it out of his eyes the long hair of his fine coat was filled full of sand and no one would ever have guessed that this was reddy fox  haw haw haw shouted blacky the crow  then everybody shouted haw haw haw and began to roll in the grass and hold on to their sides once more everybody but reddy fox  when he could get his breath he didnt look this way or that way but just sneaked off to his home under the big hickory  illustration then everybody shouted haw haw haw  and when old mother west wind came with her big bag to take the merry little breezes to their home behind the purple hills johnny chuck waddled back up the lone little path chuckling to himself for that little feeling of discontent was all gone  he had found that after all he could do something better than anybody else on the green meadows for in his heart he knew that none could dig so fast as he     vii  johnny chucks secret  johnny chuck pushed up the last bit of gravel from the hole he had dug between the roots of the old apple tree in a corner of the green meadows  he smoothed it down on the big yellow mound he had made in front of his door  then he sat up very straight on top of the mound brushed his coat shook the sand from his trousers and carefully cleaned his hands  after he had rested a bit he turned around and looked at his new home for that is what it was although he had not come there to live yet and no one knew of it no one but jolly round red mr sun who peeping between the branches of the old apple tree had caught johnny chuck at work  but he wouldnt tell not jolly mr sun  looking down from the blue sky every day he sees all sorts of queer things and he learns all kinds of secrets does mr sun but he never never tells  no sir  mr sun never tells one of them not even to old mother west wind when at night they go down together behind the purple hills  so jolly round red mr sun just smiled and smiled when he discovered johnny chucks secret for that is just what the new home under the apple tree wasa secret  not even the merry little breezes who find out almost everything had discovered it  johnny chuck chuckled to himself as he planned a back door a beautiful back door hidden behind a tall clump of meadow grass where no one would think to look for a door  when he had satisfied himself as to just where he would put it he once more sat up very straight on his nice new mound and looked this way and looked that way to be sure that no one was near  then he started for his old home along a secret little path he had made for himself  pretty soon he came to the lone little path that went past his own home  he danced and he skipped along the lone little path and because he was so happy he tried to turn a somersault  but johnny chuck was so round and fat and rollypoly that he just tumbled over in a heap  well well well  whats the matter with you said a voice close beside him before he could pick himself up  it was jimmy skunk who was out looking for some beetles for his dinner  johnny chuck scrambled to his feet and looked foolish very foolish indeed  theres nothing the matter with me jimmy skunk said johnny theres nothing the matter with me  its just because ive got a secret  a secret cried jimmy skunk  what is it  yes a secret a really truly secret said johnny chuck and looked very important  tell me johnny chuck  come on tell just me and then well have the secret together begged jimmy skunk  now johnny chuck was so tickled with his secret that it seemed as if he must share it with some one  he just couldnt keep it to himself any longer  you wont tell any one said johnny chuck  jimmy skunk promised that he wouldnt tell a soul  cross your heart commanded johnny chuck  jimmy skunk crossed his heart  then johnny chuck looked this way and looked that way to be sure that no one was listening  finally he whispered in jimmy skunks ear  ive got a new home under the old apple tree in a corner of the green meadows said johnny chuck  of course jimmy skunk was very much surprised and very much interested so johnny chuck told him all about it  now remember its a secret said johnny chuck as jimmy skunk started off down the lone little path across the green meadows to look for some beetles  ill remember said jimmy skunk  and dont tell called johnny chuck  jimmy skunk promised that he wouldnt tell  then johnny chuck started off up the lone little path whistling and jimmy skunk trotted down the lone little path onto the green meadows  jimmy skunk was thinking so much about johnny chucks new home that he quite forgot to look for beetles and he almost ran into peter rabbit  hello jimmy skunk said peter rabbit cant you see where you are going  it must be you have something on your mind what is it  i was thinking of johnny chucks new home said jimmy skunk  johnny chucks new home exclaimed peter rabbit  has johnny chuck got a new home  where is it  under the roots of the old apple tree in a corner of the green meadows said jimmy skunk and then he clapped both hands over his mouth  you see he hadnt really meant to tell  it just slipped out  oh but its a secret cried jimmy skunk  its a secret and you mustnt tell  i guess johnny chuck wont mind if you know peter rabbit but you mustnt tell any one else  peter rabbit promised he wouldnt  now peter rabbit is very inquisitive very inquisitive indeed  so as soon as he had parted from jimmy skunk he made up his mind that he must see the new home of johnny chuck  so off he started as fast as he could go towards the old apple tree in a corner of the green meadows half way there he met reddy fox  hello peter rabbit  where are you going in such a hurry asked reddy fox  over to the old apple tree to see johnny chucks new home replied peter rabbit as he tried to dodge past reddy fox  then of a sudden he remembered and clapped both hands over his mouth  oh but its a secret reddy fox  its a secret and you mustnt tell cried peter rabbit  but reddy fox wouldnt promise that he wouldnt tell for in spite of his handsome coat and fine manners reddy fox is a scamp  and besides he has no love for johnny chuck for he has not forgotten how johnny chuck once made him run and called him a fraid cat  so when reddy fox left peter rabbit he grinned a wicked grin and hurried off to find bobby coon  he met him on his way to the laughing brook  reddy fox told bobby coon all about johnny chucks secret and then hurried away after peter rabbit for reddy fox also is very inquisitive  bobby coon went on down to the laughing brook  there he met billy mink and told him about the new home johnny chuck had made under the old apple tree in a corner of the green meadows  pretty soon billy mink met little joe otter and told him  then little joe otter met jerry muskrat and told him  jerry muskrat saw blacky the crow and told him and greatgrandfather frog heard him  blacky the crow met his first cousin sammy jay and told him  sammy jay met happy jack squirrel and told him  happy jack met his cousin striped chipmunk and told him  striped chipmunk passed the house of old mr toad and told him  the next morning very early before old mother west wind had come down from the purple hills johnny chuck stole over to his new home to begin work on his new back door  he had hardly begun to dig when he heard some one cough right behind him  he whirled around and there sat peter rabbit looking as innocent and surprised as if he had really just discovered the new home for the first time  what a splendid new home you have johnny chuck said peter rabbit  yes said johnny chuck slowly  its a secret he added suddenly  you wont tell will you peter rabbit  peter rabbit promised that he wouldnt tell  then johnny chuck felt better and went back to work as soon as peter rabbit left  he had hardly begun however when some one just above him said good morning johnny chuck  johnny chuck looked up and there in the old apple tree sat blacky the crow and his cousin sammy jay  just then there was a rustle in the grass and out popped billy mink and little joe otter and jerry muskrat and happy jack squirrel and striped chipmunk and bobby coon  when johnny chuck had recovered from his surprise and looked over to the doorway of his new home there sat reddy fox on johnny chucks precious new mound  it seemed as if all the little meadow people were there all but jimmy skunk who wisely stayed away  weve come to see your new home said striped chipmunk and we think its the nicest home weve seen for a long time  its so nicely hidden away its really quite secret said reddy fox grinning wickedly  just then up raced the merry little breezes and one of them had a message for johnny chuck from greatgrandfather frog  it was this  whisper a secret to a friend and you shout it in the ear of the whole world  after every one had admired the new home they said goodbye and scattered over the green meadows  then johnny chuck began to dig again but this time he wasnt making his new back door  no indeed johnny chuck was digging at that new mound of yellow gravel of which he had been so proud  jolly round red mr sun blinked to be sure that he saw aright for johnny chuck was filling up his new home between the roots of the old apple tree  when he got through there wasnt any new home  then johnny chuck brushed his coat carefully shook the sand out of his trousers wiped his hands and started off for his old home  and this time he didnt take his special hidden path for johnny chuck didnt care who saw him go  late that afternoon johnny chuck sat on his old doorstep with his chin in his hands watching old mother west wind gathering her merry little breezes into the big bag in which she carries them to their home behind the purple hills  whisper a secret to a friend and you shout it in the ear of the whole world  now what did grandfather frog mean by that thought johnny chuck  now i didnt tell anybody but jimmy skunk and jimmy skunk didnt tell anyone but peter rabbit andand  then johnny chuck began to chuckle and finally to laugh  whisper a secret to a friend and you shout it in the ear of the whole world  my gracious what a loud voice i must have had and didnt know it said johnny chuck wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes  and the next day johnny chuck started to make a new home  where  oh thats johnny chucks secret  and no one but jolly round red mr sun has found it out yet     viii  johnny chucks great fight  johnny chuck sat on the doorstep of his new home looking away across the green meadows  johnny chuck felt very well satisfied with himself and with all the world  he yawned lazily and stretched and stretched and then settled himself comfortably to watch the merry little breezes playing down by the smiling pool  by and by he saw peter rabbit go bobbing along down the lone little path  lipperty lipperty lip went peter rabbit and every other jump he looked behind him  now what is peter rabbit up to said johnny chuck to himself and what does he keep looking behind him for  johnny chuck sat up a little straighter to watch peter rabbit hop down the lone little path  then of a sudden he caught sight of something that made him sit up straighter than ever and open his eyes very wide something was following peter rabbit  yes sir something was bobbing along right at peter rabbits heels  johnny chuck forgot the merry little breezes  he forgot how warm it was and how lazy he felt  he forgot everything else in his curiosity to learn what it could be following so closely at peter rabbits heels  presently peter rabbit stopped and sat up very straight and thenjohnny chuck nearly tumbled over in sheer surprise  he rubbed his eyes to make sure that he saw aright for there were two peter rabbits  yes sir there were two peter rabbits only one was very small very small indeed  oh said johnny chuck that must be peter rabbits baby brother  then he began to chuckle till his fat sides shook  there sat peter rabbit with his funny long ears standing straight up and there right behind him dressed exactly like him sat peter rabbits baby brother with his funny little long ears standing straight up  when peter rabbit wiggled his right ear his baby brother wiggled his right ear when peter rabbit scratched his left ear his baby brother scratched his left ear  whatever peter rabbit did his baby brother did too  presently peter rabbit started on down the lone little pathlipperty lipperty lip and right at his heels went his baby brotherlipperty lipperty lip  johnny chuck watched them out of sight and then he settled himself on his doorstep once more to enjoy a sun bath  every once in a while he chuckled to himself as he remembered how funny peter rabbits baby brother had looked  presently johnny chuck fell asleep  jolly round red mr sun had climbed quite high in the sky when johnny chuck awoke  he yawned and stretched and stretched and yawned and then he sat up to look over the green meadows  then he became wide awake very wide awake indeed  way down on the green meadows he caught a glimpse of something red jumping about in the long meadow grass  that must be reddy fox thought johnny chuck  yes it surely is reddy fox  now i wonder what mischief he is up to  then he saw all the merry little breezes racing towards reddy fox as fast as they could go  and there was sammy jay screaming at the top of his voice and his cousin blacky the crow  happy jack squirrel was dancing up and down excitedly on the branch of an old elm close by  johnny chuck waited to see no more but started down the lone little path to find out what it all was about  half way down the lone little path he met peter rabbit running as hard as he could  his long ears were laid flat back his big eyes seemed to pop right out of his head and he was running as johnny chuck had never seen him run before  what are you running so for peter rabbit asked johnny chuck  to get bowser the hound shouted peter rabbit over his shoulder as he tried to run faster  now what can be the matter said johnny chuck to himself to send peter rabbit after bowser the hound  he knew that like all the other little meadow people there was nothing of which peter rabbit was so afraid as farmer browns great dog bowser the hound  johnny chuck hurried down the lone little path as fast as his short legs could take his fat rollypoly self  presently he came out onto the green meadows and there he saw a sight that set every nerve in his round little body atingle with rage  reddy fox had found peter rabbits baby brother and was doing his best to frighten him to death  im going to eat you now shouted reddy fox and then he sprang on peter rabbits baby brother and gave him a cuff that sent him heels over head sprawling in the grass  coward  coward reddy fox shrieked sammy jay  shame  shame shouted the merry little breezes  youre nothing but a great big bully yelled blacky the crow  but no one did anything to help peter rabbits baby brother for reddy fox is so much bigger than any of the rest of them except bobby coon that all the little meadow people are afraid of him  but reddy fox just laughed at them and nipped the long ears of peter rabbits little brother so hard that he cried with the pain  now all were so intent watching reddy fox torment the baby brother of peter rabbit that no one had seen johnny chuck coming down the lone little path  and for a few minutes no one recognized the furious little yellowbrown bundle that suddenly knocked reddy fox over and seized him by the throat  you see it didnt look a bit like johnny chuck  every hair was standing on end he was so mad and this made him appear twice as big as they had ever seen him before  coward  coward  coward shrieked johnny chuck as he shook reddy fox by the throat  and then began the greatest fight that the green meadows had ever seen  now johnny chuck is not naturally a fighter  oh my no  he is so goodnatured and so sunnyhearted that he seldom quarrels with any one but when he has to fight there isnt a cowardly hair on him not the teeniest weeniest one  no one ever has a chance to cry fraid cat cry baby after johnny chuck  so though like all the other little meadow people he was usually just a little afraid of reddy fox because reddy is so much bigger he forgot all about it as soon as he caught sight of reddy fox tormenting peter rabbits little brother  he didnt stop to think of what might happen to himself  he didnt stop to think at all  he just gritted his teeth and in a flash had reddy fox on his back  such a fight was never seen before on the green meadows  reddy fox is a bully and a coward for he never fights with any one of his own size if he can help it but when he has to fight he fights hard  and he certainly had to fight now  bully hissed johnny chuck as with his stout little hind feet he ripped the bright red coat of reddy fox  you great big bully  over and over they rolled johnny chuck on top then reddy fox on top then johnny chuck up again clawing and snarling  it seemed as if news of the fight had gone over all the green meadows for the little meadow people came running from every directionbilly mink little joe otter jerry muskrat striped chipmunk jimmy skunk old mr toad  even greatgrandfather frog who left his big lily pad and came hurrying with great jumps across the green meadows  they formed a ring around reddy fox and johnny chuck and danced with excitement  and all wanted johnny chuck to win  peter rabbits poor little brother so sore and lame from the knocking about from reddy fox and so frightened that he hardly dared breathe lay flat on the ground under a little bush and was forgotten by all but the merry little breezes who covered him up with some dead grass and kissed him and whispered to him not to be afraid now  how peter rabbits little brother did hope that johnny chuck would win  his great big round soft eyes were wide with terror as he thought of what might happen to him if reddy fox should whip johnny chuck  but reddy fox wasnt whipping johnny chuck  try as he would he could not get a good hold on that round fat little body  and johnny chucks stout claws were ripping his red coat and white vest and johnny chucks sharp teeth were gripping him so that they could not be shaken loose  pretty soon reddy fox began to think of nothing but getting away  every one was shouting for johnny chuck  every time reddy fox was underneath he would hear a great shout from all the little meadow people and he knew that they were glad  now johnny chuck was round and fat and rollypoly and when one is round and fat and rollypoly ones breath is apt to be short  so it was with johnny chuck  he had fought so hard that his breath was nearly gone  finally he loosed his hold on reddy fox for just a second to draw in a good breath  reddy fox saw his chance and with a quick pull and spring he broke away  how all the little meadow people did scatter  you see they were very brave very brave indeed so long as johnny chuck had reddy fox down but now that reddy fox was free each one was suddenly afraid and thought only of himself  jimmy skunk knocked jerry muskrat flat in his hurry to get away  billy mink trod on greatgrandfather frogs big feet and didnt even say excuse me  striped chipmunk ran head first into a big thistle and squealed as much from fear as pain  but reddy fox paid no attention to any of them  he just wanted to get away and off he started limping as fast as he could go up the lone little path  such a looking sight  his beautiful red coat was in tatters  his face was scratched  he hobbled as he ran  and just as he broke away johnny chuck made a grab and pulled a great mouthful of hair out of the splendid tail reddy fox was so proud of  when the little meadow people saw that reddy fox was actually running away they stopped running themselves and all began to shout reddy fox is a coward and a bully  coward  coward  then they crowded around johnny chuck and all began talking at once about his great fight  just then they heard a great noise up on the hill  they saw reddy fox coming back down the lone little path and he was using his legs just as well as he knew how  right behind him his great mouth open and waking all the echoes with his big voice was bowser the hound  you see although peter rabbit couldnt fight for his little baby brother and is usually very very timid he isnt altogether a coward indeed he had been very brave very brave indeed  he had gone up to farmer browns and had jumped right under the nose of bowser the hound now that is something that bowser the hound never can stand  so off he had started after peter rabbit  and peter rabbit had started back for the green meadows as fast as his long legs could take him for he knew that if once bowser the hound caught sight of reddy fox he would forget all about such a little thing as a saucy rabbit  sure enough half way down the lone little path they met reddy fox sneaking off home and when bowser the hound saw him he straightway forgot all about peter rabbit and with a great roar started after reddy fox  when johnny chuck had carefully brushed his coat and all the little meadow people had wished him good luck he started off up the lone little path for home the merry little breezes dancing ahead and peter rabbit coming lipperty lipperty lip behind and right between them hopped peter rabbits little brother who thought johnny chuck the greatest hero in the world  when they reached johnny chucks old home peter rabbit and peter rabbits little brother tried to tell him how thankful they were to him but johnny chuck just laughed and said it was nothing at all just nothing at all  when at last all had gone even the merry little breezes johnny chuck slipped away to his new home which is his secret you know which no one knows but jolly round red mr sun who wont tell  i hope said johnny chuck as he stretched himself out on the mound of warm sand by his doorway for he was very tired i hope said johnny chuck sighing contentedly that reddy fox got away from bowser the hound  and reddy fox did     ix  mr toads old suit  peter rabbit was tired and very sleepy as he hopped along the crooked little path down the hill  he could see old mother west wind just emptying her merry little breezes out of her big bag onto the green meadows to play all the bright summer day  peter rabbit yawned and yawned again as he watched them dance over to the smiling pool  then he hopped on down the crooked little path towards home  sammy jay sitting on a fence post saw him coming    peter rabbit out all night   oh my goodness what a sight   peter rabbit reprobate   no good end will be your fate  shouted sammy jay  peter rabbit ran out his tongue at sammy jay  who stole happy jacks nuts  thief  thief  thief shouted peter rabbit at sammy jay and kept on down the crooked little path  it was truepeter rabbit had been out all night playing in the moonlight stealing a midnight feast in farmer browns cabbage patch and getting into mischief with bobby coon  now when most of the little meadow people were just waking up peter rabbit was thinking of bed  presently he came to a big piece of bark which is the roof of mr toads house  mr toad was sitting in his doorway blinking at jolly round red mr sun who had just begun to climb up the sky  good morning mr toad said peter rabbit  good morning said mr toad  youre looking very fine this morning mr toad said peter rabbit  im feeling very fine this morning said mr toad  why my gracious you have on a new suit mr toad exclaimed peter rabbit  well what if i have peter rabbit demanded mr toad  oh nothing nothing nothing at all mr toad nothing at all said peter rabbit hastily only i didnt know you ever had a new suit what have you done with your old suit mr toad  swallowed it said mr toad shortly turning his back on peter rabbit  and that was all peter rabbit could get out of mr toad so he started on down the crooked little path  now peter rabbit has a great deal of curiosity and is forever poking into other peoples affairs  the more he thought about it the more he wondered what mr toad could have done with his old suit  of course he hadnt swallowed it  who ever heard of such a thing  the more he thought of it the more peter rabbit felt that he must know what mr toad had done with his old suit  by this time he had forgotten that he had been out all night  he had forgotten that he was sleepy  he had got to find out about mr toads old suit  ill just run over to the smiling pool and ask grandfather frog hell surely know what mr toad does with his old suits said peter rabbit and began to hop faster  when he reached the smiling pool there sat greatgrandfather frog on his big green lily pad as usual  there was a hungry look in his big goggly eyes for it was so early that no foolish green flies had come his way yet  but peter rabbit was too full of curiosity in mr toads affairs to notice this  good morning grandfather frog said peter rabbit  good morning replied grandfather frog a wee bit gruffly  youre looking very fine this morning grandfather frog said peter rabbit  not so fine as id feel if i had a few fat foolish green flies said grandfather frog  ive just met your cousin mr toad and he has on a new suit said peter rabbit  indeed replied grandfather frog  well i think its high time  what does mr toad do with his old suit grandfather frog asked peter rabbit  chugarum  its none of my business  maybe he swallows it replied grandfather frog crossly and turned his back on peter rabbit  peter rabbit saw that his curiosity must remain unsatisfied  he suddenly remembered that he had been out all night and was very very sleepy so he started off home across the green meadows  now the merry little breezes had heard all that peter rabbit and grandfather frog had said and they made up their minds that they would find out from grandfather frog what mr toad really did do with his old suit  first of all they scattered over the green meadows  presently back they all came each blowing ahead of him a fat foolish green fly  right over to the big green lily pad they blew the green flies  chugarum  chugarum  chugarum said grandfather frog as each fat foolish green fly disappeared inside his white and yellow waistcoat  when the last one was out of sight all but a leg which was left sticking out of a corner of grandfather frogs big mouth one of the merry little breezes ventured to ask him what became of mr toads old suit  grandfather frog settled himself comfortably on the big green lily pad and folded his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat  chugarum began grandfather frog  once upon a time  the merry little breezes clapped their hands and settled themselves among the buttercups and daisies for they knew that soon they would know what mr toad did with his old suit  once upon a time began grandfather frog again when the world was young old king bear received word that old mother nature would visit the green meadows and the green forest  of course old king bear wanted his kingdom and his subjects to look their very best so he issued a royal order that every one of the little meadow people and every one of the little forest folk should wear a new suit on the day that old mother nature was to pay her visit  now like old king bear every one wanted to appear his very best before old mother nature but as no one knew the exact day she was to come every one began at once to wear his best suit and to take the greatest care of it  old king bear appeared every day in a suit of glossy black  lightfoot the deer threw away his dingy gray suit and put on a coat of beautiful red and fawn  mr mink mr otter mr muskrat mr rabbit mr woodchuck mr coon who you know was first cousin to old king bear mr gray squirrel mr fox squirrel mr red squirrel all put on brand new suits  mr skunk changed his black and white stripes for a suit of all black very handsome very handsome indeed  mr chipmunk took care to see that his new suit had the most beautiful stripes to be obtained  mr jay who was something of a dandy had a wonderful new coat that looked for all the world as it if had been cut from the bluest patch of sky and trimmed with edging taken from the whitest clouds  even mr crow and mr owl took pains to look their very best  but mr toad couldnt see the need of such a fuss  he thought his neighbors spent altogether too much time and thought on dress  to be sure he was anxious to look his best when old mother nature came so he got a new suit all ready  but mr toad couldnt afford to sit around in idleness admiring his new clothes  no indeed  mr toad had too much to do  he was altogether too busy  he had a large garden to take care of had mr toad and work in a garden is very hard on clothes so mr toad just wore his old suit over his new one and went on about his business  by and by the great day came when old mother nature arrived to inspect the kingdom of old king bear  all the little meadow people and all the little forest folk hastened to pay their respects to old mother nature and to strut about in their fine clothesall but mr toad  he was so busy that he didnt even know that old mother nature had arrived  late in the afternoon mr toad stopped to rest  he had just cleared his cabbage patch of the slugs which threatened to eat up his crop and he was very tired  presently he happened to look up the road and who should he see but old mother nature herself coming to visit his garden and to find out why mr toad had not been to pay her his respects  suddenly mr toad remembered that he had on his working clothes which were very old very dirty and very ragged  for just a minute he didnt know what to do  then he dived under a cabbage leaf and began to pull off his old suit  but the old suit stuck  he was in such a hurry and so excited that he couldnt find the buttons  finally he got his trousers off  then he reached over and got hold of the back of his coat and tugged and hauled until finally he pulled his old coat off right over his head just as if it were a shirt  mr toad gave a great sigh of relief as he stepped out in his new suit for you remember that he had been wearing that new suit underneath the old one all the time  mr toad was very well pleased with himself until he thought how terribly untidy that ragged old suit looked lying on the ground  what should he do with it  he couldnt hide it in the garden for old mother natures eyes are so sharp that she would be sure to see it what should he do  then mr toad had a happy thought  every one made fun of his big mouth  but what was a big mouth for if not to use  he would swallow his old suit  in a flash mr toad dived under the cabbage leaf and crammed his old suit into his mouth  when old mother nature came into the garden mr toad was waiting in the path to receive her  very fine he looked in his new suit and you would have thought he had been waiting all day to receive old mother nature but for one thingswallow as much and as hard as he would he couldnt get down quite all of his old suit and a leg of his trousers hung out of a corner of his big mouth  of course old mother nature saw it right away  and how she did laugh and of course mr toad felt very much mortified  but mother nature was so pleased with mr toads garden and with mr toads industry that she quite overlooked the ragged trousers leg hanging from the corner of mr toads mouth  fine clothes arc not to be compared with fine work said old mother nature  i herewith appoint you my chief gardener mr toad  and as a sign that all may know that this is so hereafter you shall always swallow your old suit whenever you change your clothes  and from that day to this the toads have been the very best of gardeners  and in memory of their great great greatgrandfather a thousand times removed they have always swallowed their old suits  now you know what my cousin old mr toad did with his old suit just before peter rabbit passed his house this morning concluded greatgrandfather frog  oh cried the merry little breezes thank you thank you grandfather frog  then they raced away across the green meadows and up the crooked little path to see if old mr toad was gardening  and peter rabbit still wonders what old mr toad did with his old suit     x  grandfather frog gets even  old grandfather frog sat on his big green lily pad in the smiling pool dreaming of the days when the world was young and the frogs ruled the world  his hands were folded across his white and yellow waistcoat round red smiling mr sun sent down his warmest rays on the back of grandfather frogs green coat  very early that morning old mother west wind hurrying down from the purple hills on her way to help the whitesailed ships across the great ocean had stopped long enough to blow three or four fat foolish green flies over to the big lily pad and they were now safely inside the white and yellow waistcoat  a thousand little tadpoles the great greatgrandchildren of grandfather frog were playing in the smiling pool and every once in a while wriggling up to the big lily pad to look with awe at grandfather frog and wonder if they would ever be as handsome and big and wise as he  and still old grandfather frog sat dreaming and dreaming of the days when all the frogs had tails and ruled the world  presently billy mink came hopping and skipping down the laughing brook sometimes he swam a little way and sometimes he ran a little way along the bank and sometimes he jumped from stone to stone  billy mink was feeling very goodvery good indeed  he had caught a fine fat trout for breakfast  he had hidden two more away for dinner in a snug little hole no one knew of but himself  now he had nothing to do but get into mischief  you can always depend upon billy mink to get into mischief he just cant help it  so billy mink came hopping and skipping down the laughing brook to the smiling pool  then he stopped as still as the rock he was standing on and peeped through the bulrushes  billy mink is very cautious very cautious indeed  he always looks well before he shows himself that nothing may surprise him  so billy mink looked all over the smiling pool and the grassy banks he saw the sunbeams dancing on the water  he saw the tadpoles having such a good time in the smiling pool  he saw the merry little breezes kissing the buttercups and daisies on the bank and he saw old grandfather frog with his hands folded across his white and yellow waistcoat sitting on the green lily pad dreaming of the days when the world was young  then billy mink took a long breath a very long breath and dived into the smiling pool  now billy mink can swim very fast very fast indeed  for a little way he can swim even faster than mr trout  and he can stay under water a long time  straight across the smiling pool with not even the tip of his nose out of water swam billy mink  the thousand little tadpoles saw him coming and fled in all directions to bury themselves in the mud at the bottom of the smiling pool for when he thinks no one is looking billy mink sometimes gobbles up a fat tadpole for breakfast  straight across the smiling pool swam billy mink toward the big green lily pad where grandfather frog sat dreaming of the days when the world was young  when he was right under the big green lily pad he suddenly kicked up hard with his hind feet  up went the big green lily pad and of course up went grandfather frogup and over flat on his back with a great splash into the smiling pool  now grandfather frogs mouth is very big  indeed no one else has so big a mouth unless it be his cousin old mr toad  and when grandfather frog went over flat on his back splash in the smiling pool his mouth was wide open  you see he was so surprised he forgot to close it  so of course grandfather frog swallowed a great deal of water and he choked and spluttered and swam around in foolish little circles trying to find himself  finally he climbed out on his big green lily pad  illustration he was so surprised he forgot to close it  chugarum  said  grandfather frog and looked this way and looked that way  then he gave a funny hop and turned about in the opposite direction and looked this way and looked that way but all he saw was the smiling pool dimpling and smiling mrs redwing bringing a fat worm to her hungry little babies in their snug nest in the bulrushes and the merry little breezes hurrying over to see what the trouble might be  chugarum said grandfather frog  it is very strange  i must have fallen asleep and had a bad dream  then he once more settled himself comfortably on the big green lily pad folded his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat and seemed to be dreaming again only his big goggly eyes were not dreaming  no indeed  they were very much awake and they saw all that was going on in the smiling pool  greatgrandfather frog was just pretending  you may fool him once but grandfather frog has lived so long that he has become very wise and though billy mink is very smart it takes some one a great deal smarter than billy mink to fool grandfather frog twice in the same way  billy mink hiding behind the big rock had laughed and laughed till he had to hold his sides when grandfather frog had choked and spluttered and hopped about on the big lily pad trying to find out what it all meant  he thought it such a good joke that he couldnt keep it to himself so when he saw little joe otter coming to try his slippery slide he swam across to tell him all about it  little joe otter laughed and laughed until he had to hold his sides  then they both swam back to hide behind the big rock to watch until grandfather frog should forget all about it and they could play the trick over again  now out of the corner of one of his big goggly eyes grandfather frog had seen billy mink and little joe otter with their heads close together laughing and holding their sides and he saw them swim over behind the big rock  pretty soon one of the merry little breezes danced over to see if grandfather frog had really gone to sleep grandfather frog didnt move not the teeniest weeniest bit but he whispered something to the merry little breeze and the merry little breeze flew away shaking with laughter to where the other merry little breezes were playing with the buttercups and daisies  then all the merry little breezes clapped their hands and laughed too they left the buttercups and daisies and began to play tag across the smiling pool  now right on the edge of the big rock lay a big stick  pretty soon the merry little breezes danced over to the big rock and then suddenly all together they gave the big stick a push  off it went and then such a splashing and squealing as there was behind the big rock  in a few moments little joe otter crept out beside his slippery slide and slipped away holding on to his head  and sneaking through the bulrushes so as not to be seen crawled billy mink back towards his home on the laughing brook  billy mink wasnt laughing now  oh no he was limping and he was holding on to his head  little joe otter and billy mink had been sitting right underneath the big stick  chugarum said grandfather frog and held on to his sides and opened his mouth very wide in a noiseless laugh for grandfather frog never makes a sound when he laughs  chugarum said grandfather frog once more  then he folded his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat and began again to dream of the days when the frogs had long tails and ruled the world     xi  the disappointed bush  way down beside the laughing brook grew a little bush  it looked a whole lot like other little bushes all around it  but really it was quite different as you shall see  when in the spring warm jolly round mr sun brought back the birds and set them singing when the little flowers popped their heads out of the ground to have a look around then all the little bushes put out their green leaves  this little bush of which i am telling you put out its green leaves with the rest  the little leaves grew bigger and bigger on all the little bushes  by and by on some of the other little bushes little brown buds began to appear and grow and grow  then on more and more of the little bushes the little brown buds came and grew and grew  but on this little bush of which i am telling you no little brown buds appeared  the little bush felt very sad indeed  pretty soon all the little brown buds on the other little brown bushes burst their brown coats and then all the little bushes were covered with little flowers  some were white and some were yellow and some were pink and the air was filled with the sweet odor of all the little flowers  it brought the bees from far far away to gather the honey and all the little bushes were very happy indeed  but the little bush of which i am telling you had no little flowers for you see it had had no little buds and it felt lonely and shut away from the other little bushes and very sad indeed  but it bravely kept on growing and growing and growing  its little leaves grew bigger and bigger and bigger and it tried its best not to mind because it had no little flowers  then one by one and two by two and three by three and finally in whole showers the little flowers of all the other little bushes fell off and they looked very much like the little bush of which i am telling you so that the little bush no longer felt sad  all summer long all the little bushes grew and grew and grew  the birds came and built their nests among them  peter rabbit and his brothers and sisters scampered under them  the butterflies flew over them  by and by came the fall and with the fall came jack frost  he went about among the little bushes pinching the leaves  then the little green leaves turned to brown and red and yellow and pretty soon they fluttered down to the ground the merry little breezes blew them about and all the little bushes were bare  they had no leaves at all to cover their little naked brown limbs  the little bush of which i am telling you lost its leaves with the rest  but all the summer long this little bush had been growing some of those little brown buds which the other bushes had had in the spring and now when all the other little bushes had lost all the green leaves and had nothing at all upon their little brown twigs behold one beautiful day the little bush of which i am telling you was covered with gold for each little brown bud had burst its little brown coat and there was a beautiful little yellow flower  such a multitude of these little yellow flowers  they covered the little bush from top to bottom  then the little bush felt very happy indeed for it was the only bush which had any flowers  and every one who passed that way stopped to look at it and to praise it  colder grew the weather and colder  johnny chuck tucked himself away to sleep all winter  grandfather frog went deep deep down in the mud not to come out again until spring  by and by the little yellow flowers dropped off the little bush just as the other little flowers in spring had dropped off the other bushes  but they left behind them tiny little packages one for every little flower that had been on the bush  all winter long these little packages clung to the little bush in the spring when the little leaves burst forth in all the little bushes these little packages on the little bush of which i am telling you grew and grew and grew  while the other little bushes had a lot of little flowers as they had had the year before these little brown packages on the little bush of which i am telling you kept on growing and they comforted the little bush because it felt that it really had something worth while  all the summer long the little brown packages grew and grew until they looked like little nuts  when the fall came again and all the little leaves dropped off all the little bushes and the little bush of which i am telling you was covered with another lot of little yellow flowers and was very happy then these little brown nuts one bright autumn day suddenly popped open  and out of each one flew two brown shiny little seeds  you never saw such a popping and a snapping and a jumping  pop pop snap snap hippetty hop they went faster than the corn pops in the corn popper  reddy fox who always is suspicious thought some one was shooting at him  down on the ground fell the little brown shining seeds and tucked themselves into the warm earth under the warm leaves there to stay all winter long  and when the third spring came with all its little birds and all its little flowers and the warm sunshine every one of these little brown seeds which had tucked themselves into the warm earth burst its little brown skin and up into the sunshine came a little green plant which would grow and grow and grow and by and by become just like the little bush i am telling you about  when the little bush looked down and saw all these little green children popping out of the ground it was very happy indeed for it knew that it would no longer be lonely  it no longer felt bad when all the other bushes were covered with flowers for it knew that by and by when all the other little bushes had lost all their leaves and all their flowers then would come its turn and it knew that for a whole year its little brown children would be held safe on its branches  now what do you think is the name of this little bush  why it is the witch hazel  and sometime when you fall down and bump yourself hard grandma will go to the medicine closet and will bring out a bottle and from that bottle she will pour something on that little sore place and it will make it feel better  do you know what it is  it is the gift of the witch hazel bush to little boys and big men to make them feel better when they are hurt     xii  why bobby coon washes his food  happygolucky bobby coon sat on the edge of the laughing brook just as round red mr sun popped up from behind the purple hills and old mother west wind turned all her merry little breezes out to romp on the green meadows  bobby coon had been out all night  you see bobby coon is very apt to get into mischief and because usually it is safer to get into mischief under cover of the darkness bobby coon prefers the night wherein to go abroad  not that bobby coon is really bad  oh my no  everybody likes bobby coon  but he can no more keep out of mischief than a duck can keep out of water  so bobby coon sat on the edge of the laughing brook and he was very busy very busy indeed  he was washing his breakfast  really it was his dinner for turning night into day just turns everything topsyturvy  so bobby coon eats dinner when most of the little meadow people are eating breakfast  this morning he was very busy washing a luscious ear of sweet corn just in the milk  he dipped it in the water and with one little black paw rubbed it thoroughly  then he looked it over carefully before with a sigh of contentment he sat down to put it in his empty little stomach when he had finished it to the last sweet juicy kernel he ambled sleepily up the lone little path to the big hollow chestnut tree where he lives and in its great hollow in a soft bed of leaves bobby coon curled himself up in a tight little ball to sleep the long bright day away  one of the merry little breezes softly followed him  when he had crawled into the hollow chestnut and only his funny ringed tail hung out the merry little breezes tweaked it sharply just for fun and then danced away down the lone little path to join the other merry little breezes around the smiling pool  oh  grandfather frog cried a merry little breeze tell us why it is that bobby coon always washes his food  he never eats it where he gets it or takes it home to his hollow in the big chestnut but always comes to the laughing brook to wash it  none of the other meadow people do that  now greatgrandfather frog is counted very wise  he is very very old and he knows the history of all the tribes of little meadow people way back to the time when the frogs ruled the world  when the merry little breeze asked him why bobby coon always washes his food grandfather frog stopped to snap up a particularly fat foolish green fly that came his way  then while all the merry little breezes gathered around him he settled himself on his big green lily pad and began  once upon a time when the world was young old king bear ruled in the green forest  of course old mother nature who was even more beautiful then than she is now was the real ruler but she let old king bear think he ruled so long as he ruled wisely  all the little green forest folk and all the little people of the green meadows used to take presents of food to old king bear so that he never had to hunt for things to eat  he grew fatter and fatter and fatter until it seemed as if his skin must burst  and the fatter he grew the lazier he grew  grandfather frog paused with an expectant faraway look in his great bulging eyes  then he leaped into the air so far that when he came down it was with a great splash in the smiling pool  but as he swam back to his big lily pad the leg of a foolish green fly could be seen sticking out of one corner of his big mouth and he settled himself with a sigh of great contentment  old king bear continued grandfather frog just as if there had been no interruption grew fatter and lazier every day and like a great many other fat and lazy people who have nothing to do for themselves but are always waited on by others he grew shorter and shorter in temper and harder and harder to please  now perhaps you dont know it but the bear family and the coon family are very closely related  in fact they are second cousins  old mr coon bobby coons father with a thousand greats tacked on before was young then and he was very very proud of being related to old king bear  he began to pass some of his old playfellows on the green meadows without seeing them  he spent a great deal of time brushing his coat and combing his whiskers and caring for his big ringed tail he held his head very high and he put on such airs that pretty soon he could see no one at all but members of his own family and of the royal family of bear  now as old king bear grew fat and lazy he grew fussy so that he was no longer content to take everything brought him but picked out the choicest portions for himself and left the rest  mr coon took charge of all the things brought as tribute to old king bear and of course where there were so many goodies left he got all he wanted without working  so just as old king bear had grown fat and lazy and selfish mr coon grew fat and lazy and selfish  pretty soon he began to pick out the best things for himself and hide them before old king bear saw them when old king bear was asleep he would go get them and stuff himself like a greedy pig  and because he was stealing and wanted no one to see him he always ate his stolen feasts at night  now old mother nature is as you all know very very wise oh very wise indeed  one of the first laws she made when the world was young is that every living thing shall work for what it has and the harder it works the stronger it shall grow  so when old mother nature saw how fat and lazy and selfish old king bear was getting and how fat and lazy and dishonest his cousin mr coon was becoming she determined that they should be taught a lesson which they would remember for ever and ever and ever  first she proclaimed that old king bear should be king no longer and no more need the little folks of the green forest and the little people of the green meadows bring him tribute  now when old mother nature made this proclamation old king bear was fast asleep  it was just on the edge of winter and he had picked out a nice warm cave with a great pile of leaves for a bed  old mother nature peeped in at him  he was snoring and probably dreaming of more good things to eat  if he is to be king no longer there is no use in waking him now said old mother nature to herself he is so fat and so stupid  he shall sleep until gentle sister south wind comes in the spring to kiss away the snow and ice  then he shall waken with a lean stomach and a great appetite and there shall be none to feed him  now old mother nature always has a warm heart and she was very fond of bobby coons grandfather a thousand times removed  so when she saw what a selfish glutton and thief he had become she decided to put him to sleep just as she had old king bear  but first she would teach mr coon that stolen food is not the sweetest  so old mother nature found some tender juicy corn just in the milk which mr coon had stolen from old king bear  then she went down on the green meadows where the wild mustard grows and gathering a lot of this she rubbed the juice into the corn and then put it back where mr coon had left it  now i have told you that it was night when mr coon had his stolen feasts for he wanted no one to see him  so no one was there when he took a great bite of the tender juicy corn old mother nature had put back for him  being greedy and a glutton he swallowed the first mouthful before he had fairly tasted it and took a second and then such a time as there was on the edge of the green forest  mr coon rolled over and over with both of his forepaws clasped over his stomach and groaned and groaned and groaned  he had rubbed his eyes and of course had got mustard into them and could not see  he waked up all the little green forest folk who sleep through the night as good people should and they all gathered around to see what was the matter with mr coon  finally old mother nature came to his relief and brought him some water  then she led him to his home in the great hollow in the big chestnut tree and when she had seen him curled up in a tight little ball among the dried leaves she put him into the long sleep as she had old king bear  in the spring when gentle sister south wind kissed away all the snow and ice old king bear who was king no longer and mr coon awoke and both were very thin and both were very hungry oh very very hungry indeed  old king bear who was king no longer wasnt the least mite fussy about what he had to eat but ate gladly any food he could find  but mr coon remembered the burning of his stomach and mouth and could not forget it  so whenever he found anything to eat he first took it to the laughing brook or the smiling pool and washed it very carefully lest there be some mustard on it  and ever since that long ago time when the world was young the coon family has remembered that experience of mr coon who was second cousin to old king bear and that is why bobby coon washes his food travels about at night and sleeps all winter concluded grandfather frog fixing his great goggle eyes on a foolish green fly headed his way  oh thank you thank you grandfather frog cried the merry little breezes as they danced away over the green meadows  but one of them slipped back long enough to get behind the foolish green fly and blow him right up to grandfather frogs big lily pad  chugarum said grandfather frog smacking his lips     xiii  the merry little breezes have a busy day  old mother west wind came down from the purple hills in the shadowy coolness of the early morning before even jolly round red mr sun had thrown off his rosy coverlids for his daily climb up through the blue sky  the last little star was blinking sleepily as old mother west wind turned her big bag upside down on the green meadows and all her children the merry little breezes tumbled out on the soft green grass  then old mother west wind kissed them all around and hurried away to hunt for a rain cloud which had gone astray  the merry little breezes watched her go  then they played hide and seek until jolly round red mr sun had climbed out of bed and was smiling down on the green meadows  pretty soon along came peter rabbit lippertylippertylip  hello peter rabbit shouted the merry little breezes  come play with us  cant said peter rabbit  i have to go find some tender young carrots for my breakfast and away be hurried lippertylippertylip  in a few minutes jimmy skunk came in sight and he seemed to be almost hurrying along the crooked little path down the hill  the merry little breezes danced over to meet him  hello jimmy skunk they cried  come play with us  jimmy skunk shook his head  cant said he  i have to go look for some beetles for my breakfast and off he went looking under every old stick and pulling over every stone not too big for his strength  the merry little breezes watched him for a few minutes and then raced over to the laughing brook  there they found billy mink stealing softly down towards the smiling pool  oh billy mink come play with us begged the merry little breezes  cant said billy mink  i have to catch a trout for grandfather minks breakfast and he crept on towards the smiling pool  just then along came bumble the bee  now bumble the bee is a lazy fellow who always makes a great fuss as if he was the busiest and most important fellow in the world  good morning bumble cried the merry little breezes  come play with us  buzz buzz buzz grumbled bumble the bee  cant for i have to get a sack of honey and off he hurried to the nearest dandelion  then the merry little breezes hunted up johnny chuck  but johnny chuck was busy too busy to play  bobby coon was asleep for he had been out all night  reddy fox also was asleep  striped chipmunk was in such a hurry to fill the pockets in his cheeks that he could hardly stop to say good morning  happy jack squirrel just flirted his big tail and rushed away as if he had many important things to attend to  finally the merry little breezes gave it up and sat down among the buttercups and daisies to talk it over  every one seemed to have something to do every one but themselves  it was such a busy world that sunshiny morning  pretty soon one of the merry little breezes hopped up very suddenly and began the maddest little dance among the buttercups  as we havent anything to do for ourselves lets do something for somebody else he shouted  up jumped all the little breezes clapping their hands  oh lets they shouted  way over across the green meadows they could see two long ears above the nodding daisies  theres peter rabbit cried one  lets help him find those tender young carrots  no sooner proposed than off they all raced to see who could reach peter first  peter was sitting up very straight looking this way and looking that way for some tender young carrots but not one had he found and his stomach was empty  the merry little breezes stopped just long enough to tickle his long ears and pull his whiskers then away they raced scattering in all directions to see who could first find a tender young carrot for peter rabbit  by and by when one of them did find a field of tender young carrots he rushed off taking the smell of them with him to tickle the nose of peter rabbit  peter wriggled his nose his funny little nose very fast when it was tickled with the smell of tender young carrots and the merry little breeze laughed to see him  come on peter rabbit for this is my busy day he cried  peter rabbit didnt have to be invited twice  away he went lippertylippertylip as fast as his long legs could take him after the merry little breeze  and presently they came to the field of tender young carrots  oh thank you merry little breeze cried peter rabbit and straightway began to eat his breakfast  another merry little breeze slipping up the crooked little path on the hill spied the hind legs of a fat beetle sticking out from under a flat stone  at once the little breeze remembered jimmy skunk who was hunting for beetles for his breakfast  off rushed the little breeze in merry whirls that made the grasses sway and bend and the daisies nod  when after a long long hunt he found jimmy skunk jimmy was very much out of sorts  in fact jimmy skunk was positively cross  you see he hadnt had any breakfast for hunt as he would he couldnt find a single beetle  when the merry little breeze danced up behind jimmy skunk and just in fun rumpled up his black and white coat jimmy quite lost his temper in fact he said some things not at all nice to the merry little breeze but the merry little breeze just laughed  the more he laughed the crosser jimmy skunk grew and the crosser jimmy skunk grew the more the merry little breeze laughed  it was such a jolly laugh that pretty soon jimmy skunk began to grin a little sheepishly then to really smile and finally to laugh outright in spite of his empty stomach  you see it is very hard very hard indeed and very foolish to remain cross when someone else is perfectly good natured  suddenly the merry little breeze danced up to jimmy skunk and whispered in his right ear  then he danced around and whispered in his left ear jimmy skunks eyes snapped and his mouth began to water  where little breeze where he begged  follow me cried the merry little breeze racing off up the crooked little path so fast that jimmy skunk lost his breath trying to keep up for you know jimmy skunk seldom hurries  when they came to the big flat stone jimmy skunk grasped it with both hands and pulled and pulled  up came the stone so suddenly that jimmy skunk fell over flat on his back  when he had scrambled to his feet there were beetles and beetles running in every direction to find a place to hide  thank you thank you little breeze shouted jimmy skunk as he started to catch beetles for his breakfast  and the little breeze laughed happily as he danced away to join the other merry little breezes on the green meadows  there he found them very very busy very busy indeed so busy that they could hardly find time to nod to him  what do you think they were doing  they were toting gold  yes sir toting gold  and this is how it happened  while the first little breeze was showing peter rabbit the field of tender young carrots and while the second little breeze was leading jimmy skunk to the flat stone and the beetles the other merry little breezes had found bumble the bee  now bumble the bee is a lazy fellow though he pretends to be the busiest fellow in the world and they found him grumbling as he buzzed with a great deal of fuss from one flower to another  whats the matter bumble cried the merry little breezes  matter enough grumbled bumble the bee  ive got to make a sack of honey and as if that isnt enough old mother nature has ordered me to carry a sack of gold from each flower i visit to the next flower i visit  if i dont i can get no honey  buzzbuzzbuzz grumbled bumble the bee  the merry little breezes looked at the million little flowers on the green meadows each waiting a sack of gold to give and a sack of gold to receive  then they looked at each other and shouted happily for they too would now be able to cry busy busy busy  from flower to flower they hurried each with a bag of gold over his shoulder  wherever they left a bag they took a bag and all the little flowers nodded happily to see the merry little breezes at work  jolly round red mr sun climbed higher and higher and higher in the blue sky where he can look down and see all things great and small his smile was broader than ever as he watched the hurrying scurrying little breezes working instead of playing  yet after all it was a kind of play for they danced from flower to flower and ran races across bare places where no flowers grew  by and by the merry little breezes met peter rabbit  now peter rabbit had made a good breakfast of tender young carrots so he felt very good very good indeed  hi shouted peter rabbit come play with me  cant cried the merry little breezes all together we have work to do  off they hurried while peter rabbit stretched himself out full length in a sunny spot for peter rabbit also is a lazy fellow  down the crooked little path onto the green meadows came jimmy skunk  ho shouted jimmy skunk as soon as he saw the little breezes come play with me  cant cried the little breezes for we are busy busy busy and they laughed happily  when they reached the laughing brook they found billy mink curled up in a round ball fast asleep  it isnt often that billy mink is caught napping but he had had a good breakfast of trout he had found no one to play with and as he never works and the day was so bright and warm he had first looked for a place where he thought no one would find him and had then curled himself up to sleep one of the little breezes laid down the bag of gold he was carrying and creeping ever so softly over to billy mink began to tickle one of billys ears with a straw  at first billy mink didnt open his eyes but rubbed his ear with a little black hand  finally he jumped to his feet wide awake and ready to fight whoever was bothering him  but all he saw was a laughing little breeze running away with a bag of gold on his back  so all day long till old mother west wind came with her big bag to carry them to their home behind the purple hills the merry little breezes hurried this way and that way over the green meadows  no wee flower was too tiny to give and receive its share of gold and not one was overlooked by the merry little breezes  old mother nature who knows everything heard of the busy day of the merry little breezes  nobody knows how she heard of it  perhaps jolly round red mr sun told her  perhapsbut never mind  you cant fool old mother nature anyway and its of no use to try  so old mother nature visited the green meadows to see for herself and when she found how the merry little breezes had distributed the gold she was so pleased that straightway she announced to all the world that thenceforth and for all time the merry little breezes of old mother west wind should have charge of the distribution of the gold of the flowers on the green meadows which they have to this day  and since that day the merry little breezes have been merrier than ever for they have found that it is not nearly so much fun to play all the time but that to work for some good in the world is the greatest fun of all  so every year when the gold of the flowers which some people do not know is gold at all but call pollen is ready you will find the merry little breezes of old mother west wind very very busy among the flowers on the green meadows  and this is the happiest time of all     xiv  why hooty the owl does not play on the green meadows  the merry little breezes of old mother west wind were having a goodnight game of tag down on the green meadows  they were having such a jolly time while they waited for old mother west wind and her big bag to take them to their home behind the purple hills  jolly round red mr sun had already put his nightcap on  black shadows crept softly out from the purple hills onto the green meadows  the merry little breezes grew sleepy almost too sleepy to play for old mother west wind was very very late  farther and farther and farther out onto the green meadows crept the black shadows  suddenly one seemed to separate from the others softly oh so softly yet swiftly it floated over towards the merry little breezes  one of them happened to look up and saw it coming  it was the same little breeze who one time stayed out all night  when he looked up and saw this seeming shadow moving so swiftly he knew that it was no shadow at all  here comes hooty the owl cried the little breeze  then all the merry little breezes stopped their game of tag to look at hooty the owl  it is seldom they have a chance to see him for usually hooty the owl does not come out on the green meadows until after the merry little breezes are snugly tucked in bed behind the purple hills  perhaps hooty the owl will tell us why it is that he never comes out to play with us said one of the little breezes  but just as hooty the owl floated over to them up came old mother west wind and she was in a great hurry for she was late and she was tired  she had had a busy day a very busy day indeed hunting for a rain cloud which had gone astray  so now she just opened her big bag and tumbled all the merry little breezes into it as fast as she could without giving them so much as a chance to say good evening to hooty the owl  then she took them off home behind the purple hills  of course the merry little breezes were disappointed very much disappointed  but they were also very sleepy for they had played hard all day  never mind said one of them drowsily tomorrow well ask greatgrandfather frog why it is that hooty the owl never comes out to play with us on the green meadows  hell know  the next morning old mother west wind was late in coming down from the purple hills  when she finally did turn the merry little breezes out of her big bag onto the green meadows jolly round red mr sun was already quite high in the blue sky  the merry little breezes waited just long enough to say goodby to old mother west wind and then started a mad race to see who could reach the smiling pool first  there they found greatgrandfather frog sitting on his big green lily pad as usual  he was very contented with the world was grandfather frog for fat green flies had been more foolish than usual that morning and already he had all that he could safely tuck inside his white and yellow waistcoat  good morning grandfather frog shouted the merry little breezes will you tell us why it is that hooty the owl never comes out to play with us on the green meadows  chugarum said greatgrandfather frog gruffly how should i know  you see grandfather frog likes to be teased a little  oh but you do know for you are so old and so very wise cried the merry little breezes all together  grandfather frog smiled for he likes to be thought very wise and also he was feeling very good very good indeed that morning  chugarum said grandfather frog  if youll sit perfectly still ill tell you what i know about hooty the owl  but remember you must sit perfectly still perfectly still  the merry little breezes sighed for it is the hardest thing in the world for them to keep perfectly still unless they are asleep  but they promised that they would and when they had settled down each one in the heart of a great white water lily grandfather frog began  once upon a time when the world was young hooty the owls grandfather a thousand times removed used to fly about in daylight with the other birds  he was very big and very strong and very fierce was mr owl  he had great big claws and a hooked bill just as hooty the owl has now and he was afraid of nothing and nobody  now when people are very big and very strong and afraid of nothing and nobody they are very apt to care for nothing and nobody but themselves so it was with mr owl  whatever he saw that he wanted he took no matter to whom it belonged for there was no one to stop him  as i have already told you mr owl was very big and very strong and very fierce and he was a very great glutton  it took a great many little birds and little animals to satisfy his appetite  but he didnt stop there  no sir he didnt stop there  he used to kill harmless little meadow people just for the fun of killing and because he could every day he grew more savage  finally no one smaller than himself dared stir on the green meadows when he was around  the little birds no longer sang  the fieldmice children no longer played among the meadow grasses  those were sad days very sad days indeed on the green meadows said grandfather frog with a sigh  at last old mother nature came to visit the green meadows and she soon saw what a terrible state things were in  no one came to meet her for you see no one dared to show himself for fear of fierce old mr owl  now i have told you that mr owl was afraid of nothing and nobody but this is not quite true for he was afraid very much afraid of old mother nature  when he saw her coming he was sitting on top of a tall dead stump and he at once tried to look very meek and very innocent  old mother nature wasted no time  where are all my little meadow people and why do they not come to give me greeting demanded old mother nature of mr owl  mr owl bowed very low  im sure i dont know  i think they must all be taking a nap said he  now you cant fool old mother nature and its of no use to try  no sir you cant fool old mother nature  she just looked at mr owl and she looked at the feathers and fur scattered about the foot of the dead stump  mr owl stood first on one foot and then on the other  he tried to look old mother nature in the face but he couldnt  you see mr owl had a guilty conscience and a guilty conscience never looks anyone straight in the face  he did wish that mother nature would say something did mr owl  but she didnt  she just looked and looked and looked and looked straight at mr owl  the longer she looked the uneasier he got and the faster he shifted from one foot to the other finally he shifted so fast that he seemed to be dancing on top of the old stump  gradually a few at a time the little meadow people crept out from their hiding places and formed a great circle around the old dead stump  with old mother nature there they felt sure that no harm could come to them  then they began to laugh at the funny sight of fierce old mr owl hopping from one foot to the other on top of the old dead stump  it was the first laugh on the green meadows for a long long long time  of course mr owl saw them laughing at him but he could think of nothing but the sharp eyes of old mother nature boring straight through him and he danced faster than ever  the faster he danced the funnier he looked and the funnier he looked the harder the little meadow people laughed  finally old mother nature slowly raised a hand and pointed a long forefinger at mr owl  all the little meadow people stopped laughing to hear what she would say  mr owl she began i know and you know why none of my little meadow people were here to give me greeting  and this shall be your punishment from now on your eyes shall become so tender that they cannot stand the light of day so that hereafter you shall fly about only after round red mr sun has gone to bed behind the purple hills no more shall my little people who play on the green meadows all the day long have cause to fear you for no more shall you see to do them harm  when she ceased speaking all the little meadow people gave a great shout for they knew that it would be even as mother nature had said then began such a frolic as the green meadows had not known for many a long day  but mr owl flew slowly and with difficulty over to the darkest part of the deep wood for the light hurt his eyes dreadfully and he could hardly see  and as he flew the little birds flew around him in a great cloud and plucked out his feathers and tormented him for he could not see to harm them  grandfather frog paused and looked dreamily across the smiling pool suddenly he opened his big mouth and then closed it with a snap  one more foolish green fly had disappeared inside the white and yellow waistcoat  chugarum said grandfather frog those were sad days sad days indeed for mr owl  he couldnt hunt for his meals by day for the light blinded him  at night he could see but little in the darkness so he got little to eat and he grew thinner and thinner and thinner until he was but a shadow of his former self  he was always hungry was mr owl always hungry  no one was afraid of him now for it was the easiest thing in the world to keep out of his way  at last old mother nature came again to visit the green meadows and the green forest  far far in the darkest part of the deep wood she found mr owl  when she saw how very thin and how very very miserable he was her heart was moved to pity for old mother nature loves all her subjects even the worst of them  all the fierceness was gone from mr owl  he was so weak that he just sat huddled in the thickest part of the great pine  you see he had been able to catch very little to eat  mr owl said old mother nature gently you now know something of the misery and the suffering which you have caused others and i think you have been punished enough  no more may you fly abroad over the green meadows while the day is bright for still is the fear of you in the hearts of all my little meadow people but hereafter you shall not find it so difficult to get enough to eat  your eyes shall grow big bigger than the eyes of any other bird so that you shall be able to see in the dusk and even in the dark  your ears shall grow large larger than the ears of any of the little forest or meadow people so that you can hear the very least sound  your feathers shall become as soft as down so that when you fly none shall hear you  and from that day it was even so  mr owls eyes grew big and bigger until he could see as well in the dusk as he used to see in the full light of day  his ears grew large and larger until his hearing became so keen that he could hear the least rustle even at a long distance and when he flew he made no sound but floated like a great shadow  the little meadow people no longer feared him by day but when the shadows began to creep out from the purple hills each night and they heard his voice whootoowhoohoohoo they felt all the old fear of him  if they were wise they did not stir but if they were foolish and so much as shivered mr owl was sure to hear them and silently pounce upon them  so once more mr owl grew strong and fierce  but only at night had anyone cause to fear him and then only the foolish and timid  and now you know concluded grandfather frog why it is that hooty the owl never comes out to play with you on the green meadows and why his eyes are so big and his ears so large  thank you thank you grandfather frog cried the merry little breezes springing up from the white water lilies and stretching themselves  well bring you the first foolish green fly we can find  then away they rushed to hunt for it     xv  danny meadow mouse learns to laugh  danny meadow mouse sat on his doorstep and sulked  the merry little breezes of old mother west wind ran past one after another and pointing their fingers at him cried    fie danny meadow mouse   better go inside the house   babies cryoh my oh my   youre a babygo and cry   pretty soon along the lone little path came peter rabbit  peter rabbit looked at danny meadow mouse  then he pointed a finger at him and said    cry danny cry   mammyll whip you by and by   then well all come round to see   how big a baby you can be   cry danny cry   danny meadow mouse began to snivel  he cried softly to himself as peter rabbit hopped off down the lone little path  soon along came reddy fox  he saw danny meadow mouse sitting on his doorstep crying all by himself  reddy fox crept up behind a tall bunch of grass  then suddenly he jumped out right in front of danny meadow mouse  boo cried reddy fox  it frightened danny meadow mouse  he jumped almost out of his skin and ran into the house crying at the top of his voice  ha ha ha laughed reddy fox    danny danny crying dan   boohoohooed and off he ran   then reddy fox chased his tail all the way down the lone little path onto the green meadows  by and by danny meadow mouse came out again and sat on his doorstep he had stopped crying but he looked very unhappy and cross and sulky hopping and skipping down the lone little path came striped chipmunk  come play with me called danny meadow mouse  striped chipmunk kept right on hopping and skipping down the lone little path  dont want to said striped chipmunk sticking his tongue in his cheek    crybaby danny   neverll be a manny   run to mamma danny dear   and she will wipe away your tear   striped chipmunk hopped and skipped out of sight and danny meadow mouse began to cry again because striped chipmunk would not play with him  it was true dreadfully true  danny meadow mouse was a crybaby and no one wanted to play with him  if he stubbed his toe he cried  if striped chipmunk beat him in a race he cried  if the merry little breezes pulled his whiskers just in fun he cried  it had come to such a pass that all the little meadow people delighted to tease him just to make him cry  nowhere on all the green meadows was there such a crybaby as danny meadow mouse  so danny sat on his doorstep and cried because no one would play with him and he was lonely  the more he thought how lonely he was the more he cried  presently along came old mr toad  now mr toad looks very grumpy and out of sorts but that is because you do not know old mr toad  when he reached the house of danny meadow mouse he stopped right in front of danny  he put his right hand behind his right ear and listened  then he put his left hand behind his left ear and listened some more finally he put both hands on his hips and began to laugh  now mr toads mouth is very big indeed and when he opens it to laugh he opens it very wide indeed  ha ha ha  ha ha ha laughed mr toad  danny meadow mouse cried harder than ever and the harder he cried the harder old mr toad laughed  by and by danny meadow mouse stopped crying long enough to say to mr toad  what are you laughing for mr toad  mr toad stopped laughing long enough to reply  im laughing danny meadow mouse because you are crying at me  what are you crying for  im crying said danny meadow mouse because you are laughing at me  then danny began to cry again and mr toad began to laugh again  whats all this about demanded some one right behind them  it was jimmy skunk  its a new kind of game said old mr toad  danny meadow mouse is trying to see if he can cry longer than i can laugh  then old mr toad once more opened his big mouth and began to laugh harder than ever  jimmy skunk looked at him for just a minute and he looked so funny that jimmy skunk began to laugh too  now a good honest laugh is like whooping coughit is catching  the first thing danny meadow mouse knew his tears would not come  its a fact danny meadow mouse had run short of tears  the next thing he knew he wasnt crying at allhe was laughing  yes sir he actually was laughing  he tried to cry but it was of no use at all he just had to laugh  the more he laughed the harder old mr toad laughed  and the harder mr toad laughed the funnier he looked  pretty soon all three of them danny meadow mouse old mr toad and jimmy skunk were holding their sides and rolling over and over in the grass they were laughing so hard  by and by mr toad stopped laughing  dear me dear me this will never do said mr toad  i must get busy in my garden    the little slugs they creep and crawl   and eat and eat from spring to fall   they never stop to laugh nor cry   and really couldnt if theyd try  so if youll excuse me ill hurry along to get them out of my garden  mr toad started down the lone little path  after a few hops he paused and turned around  danny meadow mouse said old mr toad an honest laugh is like sunshine it brightens the whole world  dont forget it  jimmy skunk remembered that he had started out to find some beetles so still chuckling he started for the crooked little path up the hill danny meadow mouse once more alone sat down on his doorstep  his sides were sore he had laughed so hard and somehow the whole world had changed  the grass seemed greener than he had ever seen it before the sunshine was brighter and the songs of the birds were sweeter altogether it was a very nice world a very nice world indeed to live in  somehow he felt as if he never wanted to cry again  pretty soon along came the merry little breezes again chasing butterflies  when they saw danny meadow mouse sitting on his doorstep they pointed their fingers at him just as before and shouted    fie danny meadow mouse   better go inside the house   babies cryoh my oh my   youre a babygo and cry   for just a little minute danny meadow mouse wanted to cry  then he remembered old mr toad and instead began to laugh  the merry little breezes didnt know just what to make of it  they stopped chasing butterflies and crowded around danny meadow mouse they began to tease him  they pulled his whiskers and rumpled his hair  the more they teased the more danny meadow mouse laughed  when they found that danny meadow mouse really wasnt going to cry they stopped teasing and invited him to come play with them in the long meadow grass  such a good frolic as they did have  when it was over danny meadow mouse once more sat down on his doorstep to rest  hopping and skipping back up the lone little path came striped chipmunk  when he saw danny meadow mouse he stuck his tongue in his cheek and cried    crybaby danny   neverll be a manny   run to mamma danny dear   and she will wipe away your tear   instead of crying danny meadow mouse began to laugh  striped chipmunk stopped and took his tongue out of his cheek  then he began to laugh too  do you want me to play with you asked striped chipmunk suddenly  of course danny did and soon they were having the merriest kind of a game of hide and seek  right in the midst of it danny meadow mouse caught his left foot in a root and twisted his ankle  my how it did hurt  in spite of himself tears did come into his eyes  but he winked them back and bravely began to laugh  striped chipmunk helped him back to his doorstep and cut funny capers while mother meadow mouse bound up the hurt foot and all the time danny meadow mouse laughed until pretty soon he forgot that his foot ached at all  when peter rabbit came jumping along up the lone little path he began to shout as soon as he saw danny meadow mouse    cry danny cry   mammyll whip you by and by   then well all come round to see   how big a baby you can be   cry danny cry  but danny didnt cry  my no  he laughed instead  peter rabbit was so surprised that he stopped to see what had come over danny meadow mouse  when he saw the bandaged foot and heard how danny had twisted his ankle peter rabbit sat right down on the doorstep beside danny meadow mouse and told him how sorry he was for happygolucky peter rabbit is very tenderhearted  then he told danny all about the wonderful things he had seen in his travels and of all the scrapes he had gotten into  when peter rabbit finally started off home danny meadow mouse still sat on his doorstep  but no longer was he lonely he watched old mother west wind trying to gather her merry little breezes into her big bag to take to their home behind the purple hills and he laughed right out when he saw her catch the last mischievous little breeze and tumble him heels over head in with the others  old mr toad was right just exactly right thought danny meadow mouse as he rocked to and fro on his doorstep  it is much better oh very much better to laugh than to cry  and since that day when danny meadow mouse learned to laugh no one has had a chance to point a finger at him and call him a crybaby  instead every one has learned to love merry little danny meadow mouse and now they call him laughing dan
