the leaves away         and wait to watch the water clear i may         i shant be gone longyou come too         im going out to fetch the little calf         thats standing by the mother its so young         it totters when she licks it with her tongue         i shant be gone longyou come too   contents           mending wall          the death of the hired man          the mountain          a hundred collars          home burial          the black cottage          blueberries          a servant to servants          after applepicking          the code          the generations of men          the housekeeper          the fear          the selfseeker          the woodpile          good hours     mending wall      something there is that doesnt love a wall     that sends the frozengroundswell under it     and spills the upper boulders in the sun     and makes gaps even two can pass abreast     the work of hunters is another thing     i have come after them and made repair     where they have left not one stone on a stone     but they would have the rabbit out of hiding     to please the yelping dogs the gaps i mean     no one has seen them made or heard them made     but at spring mendingtime we find them there     i let my neighbour know beyond the hill     and on a day we meet to walk the line     and set the wall between us once again     we keep the wall between us as we go     to each the boulders that have fallen to each     and some are loaves and some so nearly balls     we have to use a spell to make them balance     stay where you are until our backs are turned     we wear our fingers rough with handling them     oh just another kind of outdoor game     one on a side it comes to little more     there where it is we do not need the wall     he is all pine and i am apple orchard     my apple trees will never get across     and eat the cones under his pines i tell him     he only says good fences make good neighbours     spring is the mischief in me and i wonder     if i could put a notion in his head     why do they make good neighbours isnt it     where there are cows but here there are no cows     before i built a wall id ask to know     what i was walling in or walling out     and to whom i was like to give offence     something there is that doesnt love a wall     that wants it down i could say elves to him     but its not elves exactly and id rather     he said it for himself i see him there     bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top     in each hand like an oldstone savage armed     he moves in darkness as it seems to me     not of woods only and the shade of trees     he will not go behind his fathers saying     and he likes having thought of it so well     he says again good fences make good neighbours     the death of the hired man      mary sat musing on the lampflame at the table     waiting for warren when she heard his step     she ran on tiptoe down the darkened passage     to meet him in the doorway with the news     and put him on his guard silas is back     she pushed him outward with her through the door     and shut it after her be kind she said     she took the market things from warrens arms     and set them on the porch then drew him down     to sit beside her on the wooden steps     when was i ever anything but kind to him     but ill not have the fellow back he said     i told him so last haying didnt i     if he left then i said that ended it     what good is he who else will harbour him     at his age for the little he can do     what help he is theres no depending on     off he goes always when i need him most     he thinks he ought to earn a little pay     enough at least to buy tobacco with     so he wont have to beg and be beholden     all right i say i cant afford to pay     any fixed wages though i wish i could     someone else can then someone else will have to     i shouldnt mind his bettering himself     if that was what it was you can be certain     when he begins like that theres someone at him     trying to coax him off with pocketmoney     in haying time when any help is scarce     in winter he comes back to us im done     sh not so loud hell hear you mary said     i want him to hell have to soon or late     hes worn out hes asleep beside the stove     when i came up from rowes i found him here     huddled against the barndoor fast asleep     a miserable sight and frightening too     you neednt smilei didnt recognise him     i wasnt looking for himand hes changed     wait till you see     where did you say hed been     he didnt say i dragged him to the house     and gave him tea and tried to make him smoke     i tried to make him talk about his travels     nothing would do he just kept nodding off     what did he say did he say anything     but little     anything mary confess     he said hed come to ditch the meadow for me     warren     but did he i just want to know     of course he did what would you have him say     surely you wouldnt grudge the poor old man     some humble way to save his selfrespect     he added if you really care to know     he meant to clear the upper pasture too     that sounds like something you have heard before     warren i wish you could have heard the way     he jumbled everything i stopped to look     two or three timeshe made me feel so queer     to see if he was talking in his sleep     he ran on harold wilsonyou remember     the boy you had in haying four years since     hes finished school and teaching in his college     silas declares youll have to get him back     he says they two will make a team for work     between them they will lay this farm as smooth     the way he mixed that in with other things     he thinks young wilson a likely lad though daft     on educationyou know how they fought     all through july under the blazing sun     silas up on the cart to build the load     harold along beside to pitch it on     yes i took care to keep well out of earshot     well those days trouble silas like a dream     you wouldnt think they would how some things linger     harolds young college boys assurance piqued him     after so many years he still keeps finding     good arguments he sees he might have used     i sympathise i know just how it feels     to think of the right thing to say too late     harolds associated in his mind with latin     he asked me what i thought of harolds saying     he studied latin like the violin     because he liked itthat an argument     he said he couldnt make the boy believe     he could find water with a hazel prong     which showed how much good school had ever done him     he wanted to go over that but most of all     he thinks if he could have another chance     to teach him how to build a load of hay     i know thats silas one accomplishment     he bundles every forkful in its place     and tags and numbers it for future reference     so he can find and easily dislodge it     in the unloading silas does that well     he takes it out in bunches like big birds nests     you never see him standing on the hay     hes trying to lift straining to lift himself     he thinks if he could teach him that hed be     some good perhaps to someone in the world     he hates to see a boy the fool of books     poor silas so concerned for other folk     and nothing to look backward to with pride     and nothing to look forward to with hope     so now and never any different     part of a moon was falling down the west     dragging the whole sky with it to the hills     its light poured softly in her lap she saw     and spread her apron to it she put out her hand     among the harplike morningglory strings     taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves     as if she played unheard the tenderness     that wrought on him beside her in the night     warren she said he has come home to die     you neednt be afraid hell leave you this time     home he mocked gently     yes what else but home     it all depends on what you mean by home     of course hes nothing to us any more     than was the hound that came a stranger to us     out of the woods worn out upon the trail     home is the place where when you have to go there     they have to take you in     i should have called it     something you somehow havent to deserve     warren leaned out and took a step or two     picked up a little stick and brought it back     and broke it in his hand and tossed it by     silas has better claim on us you think     than on his brother thirteen little miles     as the road winds would bring him to his door     silas has walked that far no doubt today     why didnt he go there his brothers rich     a somebodydirector in the bank     he never told us that     we know it though     i think his brother ought to help of course     ill see to that if there is need he ought of right     to take him in and might be willing to     he may be better than appearances     but have some pity on silas do you think     if hed had any pride in claiming kin     or anything he looked for from his brother     hed keep so still about him all this time     i wonder whats between them     i can tell you     silas is what he iswe wouldnt mind him     but just the kind that kinsfolk cant abide     he never did a thing so very bad     he dont know why he isnt quite as good     as anyone he wont be made ashamed     to please his brother worthless though he is     i cant think si ever hurt anyone     no but he hurt my heart the way he lay     and rolled his old head on that sharpedged chairback     he wouldnt let me put him on the lounge     you must go in and see what you can do     i made the bed up for him there tonight     youll be surprised at himhow much hes broken     his working days are done im sure of it     id not be in a hurry to say that     i havent been go look see for yourself     but warren please remember how it is     hes come to help you ditch the meadow     he has a plan you mustnt laugh at him     he may not speak of it and then he may     ill sit and see if that small sailing cloud     will hit or miss the moon     it hit the moon     then there were three there making a dim row     the moon the little silver cloud and she     warren returnedtoo soon it seemed to her     slipped to her side caught up her hand and waited     warren she questioned     dead was all he answered     the mountain      the mountain held the town as in a shadow     i saw so much before i slept there once     i noticed that i missed stars in the west     where its black body cut into the sky     near me it seemed i felt it like a wall     behind which i was sheltered from a wind     and yet between the town and it i found     when i walked forth at dawn to see new things     were fields a river and beyond more fields     the river at the time was fallen away     and made a widespread brawl on cobblestones     but the signs showed what it had done in spring     good grassland gullied out and in the grass     ridges of sand and driftwood stripped of bark     i crossed the river and swung round the mountain     and there i met a man who moved so slow     with whitefaced oxen in a heavy cart     it seemed no hand to stop him altogether     what town is this i asked     this lunenburg     then i was wrong the town of my sojourn     beyond the bridge was not that of the mountain     but only felt at night its shadowy presence     where is your village very far from here     there is no villageonly scattered farms     we were but sixty voters last election     we cant in nature grow to many more     that thing takes all the room he moved his goad     the mountain stood there to be pointed at     pasture ran up the side a little way     and then there was a wall of trees with trunks     after that only tops of trees and cliffs     imperfectly concealed among the leaves     a dry ravine emerged from under boughs     into the pasture     that looks like a path     is that the way to reach the top from here     not for this morning but some other time     i must be getting back to breakfast now     i dont advise your trying from this side     there is no proper path but those that have     been up i understand have climbed from ladds     thats five miles back you cant mistake the place     they logged it there last winter some way up     id take you but im bound the other way     youve never climbed it     ive been on the sides     deerhunting and troutfishing theres a brook     that starts up on it somewhereive heard say     right on the top tiptopa curious thing     but what would interest you about the brook     its always cold in summer warm in winter     one of the great sights going is to see     it steam in winter like an oxs breath     until the bushes all along its banks     are inchdeep with the frosty spines and bristles     you know the kind then let the sun shine on it     there ought to be a view around the world     from such a mountainif it isnt wooded     clear to the top i saw through leafy screens     great granite terraces in sun and shadow     shelves one could rest a knee on getting up     with depths behind him sheer a hundred feet     or turn and sit on and look out and down     with little ferns in crevices at his elbow     as to that i cant say but theres the spring     right on the summit almost like a fountain     that ought to be worth seeing     if its there     you never saw it     i guess theres no doubt     about its being there i never saw it     it may not be right on the very top     it wouldnt have to be a long way down     to have some head of water from above     and a good distance down might not be noticed     by anyone whod come a long way up     one time i asked a fellow climbing it     to look and tell me later how it was     what did he say     he said there was a lake     somewhere in ireland on a mountain top     but a lakes different what about the spring     he never got up high enough to see     thats why i dont advise your trying this side     he tried this side ive always meant to go     and look myself but you know how it is     it doesnt seem so much to climb a mountain     youve worked around the foot of all your life     what would i do go in my overalls     with a big stick the same as when the cows     havent come down to the bars at milking time     or with a shotgun for a stray black bear     twouldnt seem real to climb for climbing it     i shouldnt climb it if i didnt want to     not for the sake of climbing whats its name     we call it hor i dont know if thats right     can one walk around it would it be too far     you can drive round and keep in lunenburg     but its as much as ever you can do     the boundary lines keep in so close to it     hor is the township and the townships hor     and a few houses sprinkled round the foot     like boulders broken off the upper cliff     rolled out a little farther than the rest     warm in december cold in june you say     i dont suppose the waters changed at all     you and i know enough to know its warm     compared with cold and cold compared with warm     but all the funs in how you say a thing     youve lived here all your life     ever since hor     was no bigger than a what i did not hear     he drew the oxen toward him with light touches     of his slim goad on nose and offside flank     gave them their marching orders and was moving     a hundred collars      lancaster bore himsuch a little town     such a great man it doesnt see him often     of late years though he keeps the old homestead     and sends the children down there with their mother     to run wild in the summera little wild     sometimes he joins them for a day or two     and sees old friends he somehow cant get near     they meet him in the general store at night     preoccupied with formidable mail     rifling a printed letter as he talks     they seem afraid he wouldnt have it so     though a great scholar hes a democrat     if not at heart at least on principle     lately when coming up to lancaster     his train being late he missed another train     and had four hours to wait at woodsville junction     after eleven oclock at night too tired     to think of sitting such an ordeal out     he turned to the hotel to find a bed     no room the night clerk said unless     woodsvilles a place of shrieks and wandering lamps     and cars that shook and rattleand one hotel     you say unless     unless you wouldnt mind     sharing a room with someone else     who is it     a man     so i should hope what kind of man     i know him hes all right a mans a man     separate beds of course you understand     the night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on     whos that man sleeping in the office chair     has he had the refusal of my chance     he was afraid of being robbed or murdered     what do you say     ill have to have a bed     the night clerk led him up three flights of stairs     and down a narrow passage full of doors     at the last one of which he knocked and entered     lafe heres a fellow wants to share your room     show him this way im not afraid of him     im not so drunk i cant take care of myself     the night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot     this will be yours goodnight he said and went     lafe was the name i think     yes layfayette     you got it the first time and yours     magoon     doctor magoon     a doctor     well a teacher     professor squarethecircletillyouretired     hold on theres something i dont think of

naked above the waist     he sat there creased and shining in the light     fumbling the buttons in a wellstarched shirt     im moving into a sizelarger shirt     ive felt mean lately means no name

act as if you wished you hadnt come     sit down or lie down friend you make me nervous     the doctor made a subdued dash for it     and propped himself at bay against a pillow     not that way with your shoes on kikes white bed     you cant rest that way let me pull your shoes off     dont touch me pleasei say dont touch me please     ill not be put to bed by you my man     just as you say have

coming out on them from a stretch of woods     or over a hill or round a sudden corner     i like to find folks getting out in spring     raking the dooryard working near the house     later they get out further in the fields     everythings shut sometimes except the barn     the familys all away in some back meadow     theres a hay load acomingwhen it comes     and later still they all get driven in     the fields are stripped to lawn the garden patches     stripped to bare ground the apple trees     to whips and poles theres nobody about     the chimney though keeps up a good brisk smoking     and i lie back and ride i take the reins     only when someones coming and the mare     stops when she likes i tell her when to go     ive spoiled jemima in more ways than one     shes got so she

doing carrying off this bottle     there now you get some sleep     he shut the door     the doctor slid a little down the pillow     home burial      he saw her from the bottom of the stairs     before she saw him she was starting down     looking back over her shoulder at some fear     she took a doubtful step and then undid it     to raise herself and look again he spoke     advancing toward her what is it you see     from up there alwaysfor i want to know     she turned and sank upon her skirts at that     and her face changed from terrified to dull     he said to gain time what is it you see     mounting until she cowered under him     i will find out nowyou must tell me dear     she in her place refused him any help     with the least stiffening of her neck and silence     she let him look sure that he wouldnt see     blind creature and a while he didnt see     but at last he murmured oh and again oh     what is itwhat she said     just that i see     you dont she challenged tell me what it is     the wonder is i didnt see at once     i never noticed it from here before     i must be wonted to itthats the reason     the little graveyard where my people are     so small the window frames the whole of it     not so much larger than a bedroom is it     there are three stones of slate and one of marble     broadshouldered little slabs there in the sunlight     on the sidehill we havent to mind those     but i understand it is not the stones     but the childs mound     dont dont dont dont she cried     she withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm     that rested on the banister and slid downstairs     and turned on him with such a daunting look     he said twice over before he knew himself     cant a man speak of his own child hes lost     not you oh wheres my hat oh i dont need it     i must get out of here i must get air     i dont know rightly whether any man can     amy dont go to someone else this time     listen to me i wont come down the stairs     he sat and fixed his chin between his fists     theres something i should like to ask you dear     you dont know how to ask it     help me then     her fingers moved the latch for all reply     my words are nearly always an offence     i dont know how to speak of anything     so as to please you but i might be taught     i should suppose i cant say i see how     a man must partly give up being a man     with womenfolk we could have some arrangement     by which id bind myself to keep hands off     anything special youre amind to name     though i dont like such things twixt those that love     two that dont love cant live together without them     but two that do cant live together with them     she moved the latch a little dontdont go     dont carry it to someone else this time     tell me about it if its something human     let me into your grief im not so much     unlike other folks as your standing there     apart would make me out give me my chance     i do think though you overdo it a little     what was it brought you up to think it the thing     to take your motherloss of a first child     so inconsolablyin the face of love     youd think his memory might be satisfied     there you go sneering now     im not im not     you make me angry ill come down to you     god what a woman and its come to this     a man cant speak of his own child thats dead     you cant because you dont know how     if you had any feelings you that dug     with your own handhow could youhis little grave     i saw you from that very window there     making the gravel leap and leap in air     leap up like that like that and land so lightly     and roll back down the mound beside the hole     i thought who is that man i didnt know you     and i crept down the stairs and up the stairs     to look again and still your spade kept lifting     then you came in i heard your rumbling voice     out in the kitchen and i dont know why     but i went near to see with my own eyes     you could sit there with the stains on your shoes     of the fresh earth from your own babys grave     and talk about your everyday concerns     you had stood the spade up against the wall     outside there in the entry for i saw it     i shall laugh the worst laugh i ever laughed     im cursed god if i dont believe im cursed     i can repeat the very words you were saying     three foggy mornings and one rainy day     will rot the best birch fence a man can build     think of it talk like that at such a time     what had how long it takes a birch to rot     to do with what was in the darkened parlour     you couldnt care the nearest friends can go     with anyone to death comes so far short     they might as well not try to go at all     no from the time when one is sick to death     one is alone and he dies more alone     friends make pretence of following to the grave     but before one is in it their minds are turned     and making the best of their way back to life     and living people and things they understand     but the worlds evil i wont have grief so     if i can change it oh i wont i wont     there you have said it all and you feel better     you wont go now youre crying close the door     the hearts gone out of it why keep it up     amy theres someone coming down the road     youoh you think the talk is all i must go     somewhere out of this house how can i make you     ifyoudo she was opening the door wider     where do you mean to go first tell me that     ill follow and bring you back by force i will     the black cottage      we chanced in passing by that afternoon     to catch it in a sort of special picture     among tarbanded ancient cherry trees     set well back from the road in rank lodged grass     the little cottage we were speaking of     a front with just a door between two windows     fresh painted by the shower a velvet black     we paused the minister and i to look     he made as if to hold it at arms length     or put the leaves aside that framed it in     pretty he said come in no one will care     the path was a vague parting in the grass     that led us to a weathered windowsill     we pressed our faces to the pane you see he said     everythings as she left it when she died     her sons wont sell the house or the things in it     they say they mean to come and summer here     where they were boys they havent come this year     they live so far awayone is out west     it will be hard for them to keep their word     anyway they wont have the place disturbed     a buttoned haircloth lounge spread scrolling arms     under a crayon portrait on the wall     done sadly from an old daguerreotype     that was the father as he went to war     she always when she talked about war     sooner or later came and leaned half knelt     against the lounge beside it though i doubt     if such unlifelike lines kept power to stir     anything in her after all the years     he fell at gettysburg or fredericksburg     i ought to knowit makes a difference which     fredericksburg wasnt gettysburg of course     but what im getting to is how forsaken     a little cottage this has always seemed     since she went more than ever but before     i dont mean altogether by the lives     that had gone out of it the father first     then the two sons till she was left alone     nothing could draw her after those two sons     she valued the considerate neglect     she had at some cost taught them after years     i mean by the worlds having passed it by     as we almost got by this afternoon     it always seems to me a sort of mark     to measure how far fifty years have brought us     why not sit down if you are in no haste     these doorsteps seldom have a visitor     the warping boards pull out their own old nails     with none to tread and put them in their place     she had her own idea of things the old lady     and she liked talk she had seen garrison     and whittier and had her story of them     one wasnt long in learning that she thought     whatever else the civil war was for     it wasnt just to keep the states together     nor just to free the slaves though it did both     she wouldnt have believed those ends enough     to have given outright for them all she gave     her giving somehow touched the principle     that all men are created free and equal     and to hear her quaint phrasesso removed     from the worlds view today of all those things     thats a hard mystery of jeffersons     what did he mean of course the easy way     is to decide it simply isnt true     it may not be i heard a fellow say so     but never mind the welshman got it planted     where it will trouble us a thousand years     each age will have to reconsider it     you couldnt tell her what the west was saying     and what the south to her serene belief     she had some art of hearing and yet not     hearing the latter wisdom of the world     white was the only race she ever knew     black she had scarcely seen and yellow never     but how could they be made so very unlike     by the same hand working in the same stuff     she had supposed the war decided that     what are you going to do with such a person     strange how such innocence gets its own way     i shouldnt be surprised if in this world     it were the force that would at last prevail     do you know but for her there was a time     when to please younger members of the church     or rather say nonmembers in the church     whom we all have to think of nowadays     i would have changed the creed a very little     not that she ever had to ask me not to     it never got so far as that but the bare thought     of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew     and of her half asleep was too much for me     why i might wake her up and startle her     it was the words descended into hades     that seemed too pagan to our liberal youth     you know they suffered from a general onslaught     and well if they werent true why keep right on     saying them like the heathen we could drop them     onlythere was the bonnet in the pew     such a phrase couldnt have meant much to her     but suppose she had missed it from the creed     as a child misses the unsaid goodnight     and falls asleep with heartachehow should i feel     im just as glad she made me keep hands off     for dear me why abandon a belief     merely because it ceases to be true     cling to it long enough and not a doubt     it will turn true again for so it goes     most of the change we think we see in life     is due to truths being in and out of favour     as i sit here and oftentimes i wish     i could be monarch of a desert land     i could devote and dedicate forever     to the truths we keep coming back and back to     so desert it would have to be so walled     by mountain ranges half in summer snow     no one would covet it or think it worth     the pains of conquering to force change on     scattered oases where men dwelt but mostly     sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk     blown over and over themselves in idleness     sand grains should sugar in the natal dew     the babe born to the desert the sand storm     retard midwaste my cowering caravans     there are bees in this wall he struck the clapboards     fierce heads looked out small bodies pivoted     we rose to go sunset blazed on the windows     blueberries      you ought to have seen what i saw on my way     to the village through mortensons pasture today     blueberries as big as the end of your thumb     real skyblue and heavy and ready to drum     in the cavernous pail of the first one to come     and all ripe together not some of them green     and some of them ripe you ought to have seen     i dont know what part of the pasture you mean     you know where they cut off the woodslet me see     it was two years agoor nocan it be     no longer than thatand the following fall     the fire ran and burned it all up but the wall     why there hasnt been time for the bushes to grow     thats always the way with the blueberries though     there may not have been the ghost of a sign     of them anywhere under the shade of the pine     but get the pine out of the way you may burn     the pasture all over until not a fern     or grassblade is left not to mention a stick     and presto theyre up all around you as thick     and hard to explain as a conjurors trick     it must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit     i taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot     and after all really theyre ebony skinned     the blues but a mist from the breath of the wind     a tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand     and less than the tan with which pickers are tanned     does mortenson know what he has do you think     he may and not care and so leave the chewink     to gather them for himyou know what he is     he wont make the fact that theyre rightfully his     an excuse for keeping us other folk out     i wonder you didnt see loren about     the best of it was that i did do you know     i was just getting through what the field had to show     and over the wall and into the road     when who should come by with a democratload     of all the young chattering lorens alive     but loren the fatherly out for a drive     he saw you then what did he do did he frown     he just kept nodding his head up and down     you know how politely he always goes by     but he thought a big thoughti could tell by his eye     which being expressed might be this in effect     i have left those there berries i shrewdly suspect     to ripen too long i am greatly to blame     hes a thriftier person than some i could name     he seems to be thrifty and hasnt he need     with the mouths of all those young lorens to feed     he has brought them all up on wild berries they say     like birds they store a great many away     they eat them the year round and those they dont eat     they sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet     who cares what they say its a nice way to live     just taking what nature is willing to give     not forcing her hand with harrow and plow     i wish you had seen his perpetual bow     and the air of the youngsters not one of them turned     and they looked so solemnabsurdly concerned     i wish i knew half what the flock of them know     of where all the berries and other things grow     cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top     of the boulderstrewn mountain and when they will crop     i met them one day and each had a flower     stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower     some strange kindthey told me it hadnt a name     ive told you how once not long after we came     i almost provoked poor loren to mirth     by going to him of all people on earth     to ask if he knew any fruit to be had     for the picking the rascal he said hed be glad     to tell if he knew but the year had been bad     there had been some berriesbut those were all gone     he didnt say where they had been he went on     im sureim sureas polite as could be     he spoke to his wife in the door let me see     mame we dont know any good berrying place     it was all he could do to keep a straight face     if he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him     hell find hes mistaken see here for a whim     well pick in the mortensons pasture this year     well go in the morning that is if its clear     and the sun shines out warm the vines must be wet     its so long since i picked i almost forget     how we used to pick berries we took one look round     then sank out of sight like trolls underground     and saw nothing more of each other or heard     unless when you said i was keeping a bird     away from its nest and i said it was you     well one of us is for complaining it flew     around and around us and then for a while     we picked till i feared you had wandered a mile     and i thought i had lost you i lifted a shout     too loud for the distance you were it turned out     for when you made answer your voice was as low     as talkingyou stood up beside me you know     we shant have the place to ourselves to enjoy     not likely when all the young lorens deploy     theyll be there tomorrow or even tonight     they wont be too friendlythey may be polite     to people they look on as having no right     to pick where theyre picking but we wont complain     you ought to have seen how it looked in the rain     the fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves     like two kinds of jewels a vision for thieves     a servant to servants      i didnt make you know how glad i was     to have you come and camp here on our land     i promised myself to get down some day     and see the way you lived but i dont know     with a houseful of hungry men to feed     i guess youd find it seems to me     i cant express my feelings any more     than i can raise my voice or want to lift     my hand oh i can lift it when i have to     did ever you feel so i hope you never     its got so i dont even know for sure     whether i am glad sorry or anything     theres nothing but a voicelike left inside     that seems to tell me how i ought to feel     and would feel if i wasnt all gone wrong     you take the lake i look and look at it     i see its a fair pretty sheet of water     i stand and make myself repeat out loud     the advantages it has so long and narrow     like a deep piece of some old running river     cut short off at both ends it lies five miles     straight away through the mountain notch     from the sink window where i wash the plates     and all our storms come up toward the house     drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter     it took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit     to step outdoors and take the water dazzle     a sunny morning or take the rising wind     about my face and body and through my wrapper     when a storm threatened from the dragons den     and a cold chill shivered across the lake     i see its a fair pretty sheet of water     our willoughby how did you hear of it     i expect though everyones heard of it     in a book about ferns listen to that     you let things more like feathers regulate     your going and coming and you like it here     i can see how you might but i dont know     it would be different if more people came     for then there would be business as it is     the cottages len built sometimes we rent them     sometimes we dont weve a good piece of shore     that ought to be worth something and may yet     but i dont count on it as much as len     he looks on the bright side of everything     including me he thinks ill be all right     with doctoring but its not medicine     lowe is the only doctors dared to say so     its rest i wantthere i have said it out     from cooking meals for hungry hired men     and washing dishes after themfrom doing     things over and over that just wont stay done     by good rights i ought not to have so much     put on me but there seems no other way     len says one steady pull more ought to do it     he says the best way out is always through     and i agree to that or in so far     as that i can see no way out but through     leastways for meand then theyll be convinced     its not that len dont want the best for me     it was his plan our moving over in     beside the lake from where that day i showed you     we used to liveten miles from anywhere     we didnt change without some sacrifice     but len went at it to make up the loss     his works a mans of course from sun to sun     but he works when he works as hard as i do     though theres small profit in comparisons     women and men will make them all the same     but work aint all len undertakes too much     hes into everything in town this year     its highways and hes got too many men     around him to look after that make waste     they take advantage of him shamefully     and proud too of themselves for doing so     we have four here to board great goodfornothings     sprawling about the kitchen with their talk     while i fry their bacon much they care     no more put out in what they do or say     than if i wasnt in the room at all     coming and going all the time they are     i dont learn what their names are let alone     their characters or whether they are safe     to have inside the house with doors unlocked     im not afraid of them though if theyre not     afraid of me theres two can play at that     i have my fancies it runs in the family     my fathers brother wasnt right they kept him     locked up for years back there at the old farm     ive been away onceyes ive been away     the state asylum i was prejudiced     i wouldnt have sent anyone of mine there     you know the old ideathe only asylum     was the poorhouse and those who could afford     rather than send their folks to such a place     kept them at home and it does seem more human     but its not so the place is the asylum     there they have every means proper to do with     and you arent darkening other peoples lives     worse than no good to them and they no good     to you in your condition you cant know     affection or the want of it in that state     ive heard too much of the oldfashioned way     my fathers brother he went mad quite young     some thought he had been bitten by a dog     because his violence took on the form     of carrying his pillow in his teeth     but its more likely he was crossed in love     or so the story goes it was some girl     anyway all he talked about was love     they soon saw he would do someone a mischief     if he want kept strict watch of and it ended     in fathers building him a sort of cage     or room within a room of hickory poles     like stanchions in the barn from floor to ceiling     a narrow passage all the way around     anything they put in for furniture     hed tear to pieces even a bed to lie on     so they made the place comfortable with straw     like a beasts stall to ease their consciences     of course they had to feed him without dishes     they tried to keep him clothed but he paraded     with his clothes on his armall of his clothes     cruelit sounds i spose they did the best     they knew and just when he was at the height     father and mother married and mother came     a bride to help take care of such a creature     and accommodate her young life to his     that was what marrying father meant to her     she had to lie and hear love things made dreadful     by his shouts in the night hed shout and shout     until the strength was shouted out of him     and his voice died down slowly from exhaustion     hed pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring     and let them go and make them twang until     his hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow     and then hed crow as if he thought that childs play     the only fun he had ive heard them say though     they found a way to put a stop to it     he was before my timei never saw him     but the pen stayed exactly as it was     there in the upper chamber in the ell     a sort of catchall full of attic clutter     i often think of the smooth hickory bars     it got so i would sayyou know half fooling     its time i took my turn upstairs in jail     just as you will till it becomes a habit     no wonder i was glad to get away     mind you i waited till len said the word     i didnt want the blame if things went wrong     i was glad though no end when we moved out     and i looked to be happy and i was     as i said for a whilebut i dont know     somehow the change wore out like a prescription     and theres more to it than just windowviews     and living by a lake im past such help     unless len took the notion which he wont     and i wont ask himits not sure enough     i spose ive got to go the road im going     other folks have to and why shouldnt i     i almost think if i could do like you     drop everything and live out on the ground     but it might be come night i shouldnt like it     or a long rain i should soon get enough     and be glad of a good roof overhead     ive lain awake thinking of you ill warrant     more than you have yourself some of these nights     the wonder was the tents werent snatched away     from over you as you lay in your beds     i havent courage for a risk like that     bless you of course youre keeping me from work     but the thing of it is i need to be kept     theres work enough to dotheres always that     but behinds behind the worst that you can do     is set me back a little more behind     i shant catch up in this world anyway     id rather youd not go unless you must     after applepicking      my long twopointed ladders sticking through a tree     toward heaven still     and theres a barrel that i didnt fill     beside it and there may be two or three     apples i didnt pick upon some bough     but i am done with applepicking now     essence of winter sleep is on the night     the scent of apples i am drowsing off     i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight     i got from looking through a pane of glass     i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough     and held against the world of hoary grass     it melted and i let it fall and break     but i was well     upon my way to sleep before it fell     and i could tell     what form my dreaming was about to take     magnified apples appear and disappear     stem end and blossom end     and every fleck of russet showing clear     my instep arch not only keeps the ache     it keeps the pressure of a ladderround     i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend     and i keep hearing from the cellar bin     the rumbling sound     of load on load of apples coming in     for i have had too much     of applepicking i am overtired     of the great harvest i myself desired     there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch     cherish in hand lift down and not let fall     for all     that struck the earth     no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble     went surely to the ciderapple heap     as of no worth     one can see what will trouble     this sleep of mine whatever sleep it is     were he not gone     the woodchuck could say whether its like his     long sleep as i describe its coming on     or just some human sleep     the code      there were three in the meadow by the brook     gathering up windrows piling cocks of hay     with an eye always lifted toward the west     where an irregular sunbordered cloud     darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger     flickering across its bosom suddenly     one helper thrusting pitchfork in the ground     marched himself off the field and home one stayed     the townbred farmer failed to understand     what is there wrong     something you just now said     what did i say     about our taking pains     to cock the haybecause its going to shower     i said that more than half an hour ago     i said it to myself as much as you     you didnt know but james is one big fool     he thought you meant to find fault with his work     thats what the average farmer would have meant     james would take time of course to chew it over     before he acted hes just got round to act     he is a fool if thats the way he takes me     dont let it bother you youve found out something     the hand that knows his business wont be told     to do work better or fasterthose two things     im as particular as anyone     most likely id have served you just the same     but i know you dont understand our ways     you were just talking what was in your mind     what was in all our minds and you werent hinting     tell you a story of what happened once     i was up here in salem at a mans     named sanders with a gang of four or five     doing the haying no one liked the boss     he was one of the kind sports call a spider     all wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy     from a humped body nigh as bigs a biscuit     but work that man could work especially     if by so doing he could get more work     out of his hired help im not denying     he was hard on himself i couldnt find     that he kept any hoursnot for himself     daylight and lanternlight were one to him     ive heard him pounding in the barn all night     but what he liked was someone to encourage     them that he couldnt lead hed get behind     and drive the way you can you know in mowing     keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off     id seen about enough of his bulling tricks     we call that bulling id been watching him     so when he paired off with me in the hayfield     to load the load thinks i look out for trouble     i built the load and topped it off old sanders     combed it down with a rake and says o k     everything went well till we reached the barn     with a big catch to empty in a bay     you understand that meant the easy job     for the man up on top of throwing down     the hay and rolling it off wholesale     where on a mow it would have been slow lifting     you wouldnt think a fellowd need much urging     under these circumstances would you now     but the old fool seizes his fork in both hands     and looking up bewhiskered out of the pit     shouts like an army captain let her come     thinks i dye mean it what was that you said     i asked out loud sos thered be no mistake     did you say let her come yes let her come     he said it over but he said it softer     never you say a thing like that to a man     not if he values what he is god id as soon     murdered him as left out his middle name     id built the load and knew right where to find it     two or three forkfuls i picked lightly round for     like meditating and then i just dug in     and dumped the rackful on him in ten lots     i looked over the side once in the dust     and caught sight of him treadingwaterlike     keeping his head above damn ye i says     that gets ye he squeaked like a squeezed rat     that was the last i saw or heard of him     i cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off     as i sat mopping hayseed from my neck     and sort of waiting to be asked about it     one of the boys sings out wheres the old man     i left him in the barn under the hay     if ye want him ye can go and dig him out     they realized from the way i swobbed my neck     more than was needed something must be up     they headed for the barn i stayed where i was     they told me afterward first they forked hay     a lot of it out into the barn floor     nothing they listened for him not a rustle     i guess they thought id spiked him in the temple     before i buried him or i couldnt have managed     they excavated more go keep his wife     out of the barn someone looked in a window     and curse me if he wasnt in the kitchen     slumped way down in a chair with both his feet     stuck in the oven the hottest day that summer     he looked so clean disgusted from behind     there was no one that dared to stir him up     or let him know that he was being looked at     apparently i hadnt buried him     i may have knocked him down but my just trying     to bury him had hurt his dignity     he had gone to the house sos not to meet me     he kept away from us all afternoon     we tended to his hay we saw him out     after a while picking peas in his garden     he couldnt keep away from doing something     werent you relieved to find he wasnt dead     no and yet i dont knowits hard to say     i went about to kill him fair enough     you took an awkward way did he discharge you     discharge me no he knew i did just right     the generations of men      a governor it was proclaimed this time     when all who would come seeking in new hampshire     ancestral memories might come together     and those of the name stark gathered in bow     a rockstrewn town where farming has fallen off     and sproutlands flourish where the axe has gone     someone had literally run to earth     in an old cellar hole in a byroad     the origin of all the family there     thence they were sprung so numerous a tribe     that now not all the houses left in town     made shift to shelter them without the help     of here and there a tent in grove and orchard     they were at bow but that was not enough     nothing would do but they must fix a day     to stand together on the craters verge     that turned them on the world and try to fathom     the past and get some strangeness out of it     but rain spoiled all the day began uncertain     with clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted     the young folk held some hope out to each other     till well toward noon when the storm settled down     with a swish in the grass what if the others     are there they said it isnt going to rain     only one from a farm not far away     strolled thither not expecting he would find     anyone else but out of idleness     one and one other yes for there were two     the second round the curving hillside road     was a girl and she halted some way off     to reconnoitre and then made up her mind     at least to pass by and see who he was     and perhaps hear some word about the weather     this was some stark she didnt know he nodded     no fête today he said     it looks that way     she swept the heavens turning on her heel     i only idled down     i idled down     provision there had been for just such meeting     of stranger cousins in a family tree     drawn on a sort of passport with the branch     of the one bearing it done in detail     some zealous ones laborious device     she made a sudden movement toward her bodice     as one who clasps her heart they laughed together     stark he inquired no matter for the proof     yes stark and you     im stark he drew his passport     you know we might not be and still be cousins     the town is full of chases lowes and baileys     all claiming some priority in starkness     my mother was a lane yet might have married     anyone upon earth and still her children     would have been starks and doubtless here today     you riddle with your genealogy     like a viola i dont follow you     i only mean my mother was a stark     several times over and by marrying father     no more than brought us back into the name     one ought not to be thrown into confusion     by a plain statement of relationship     but i own what you say makes my head spin     you take my cardyou seem so good at such things     and see if you can reckon our cousinship     why not take seats here on the cellar wall     and dangle feet among the raspberry vines     under the shelter of the family tree     just sothat ought to be enough protection     not from the rain i think its going to rain     its raining     no its misting lets be fair     does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes     the situation was like this the road     bowed outward on the mountain halfway up     and disappeared and ended not far off     no one went home that way the only house     beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod     and below roared a brook hidden in trees     the sound of which was silence for the place     this he sat listening to till she gave judgment     on fathers side it seems werelet me see     dont be too technicalyou have three cards     four cards one yours three mine one for each branch     of the stark family im a member of     dyou know a person so related to herself     is supposed to be mad     i may be mad     you look so sitting out here in the rain     studying genealogy with me     you never saw before what will we come to     with all this pride of ancestry we yankees     i think were all mad tell me why were here     drawn into town about this cellar hole     like wild geese on a lake before a storm     what do we see in such a hole i wonder     the indians had a myth of chicamoztoc     which means the seven caves that we came out of     this is the pit from which we starks were digged     you must be learned thats what you see in it     and what do you see     yes what do i see     first let me look i see raspberry vines     oh if youre going to use your eyes just hear     what i see its a little little boy     as pale and dim as a match flame in the sun     hes groping in the cellar after jam     he thinks its dark and its flooded with daylight     hes nothing listen when i lean like this     i can make out old grandsir stark distinctly     with his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug     bless you it isnt grandsir stark its granny     but the pipes there and smoking and the jug     shes after cider the old girl shes thirsty     heres hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely     tell me about her does she look like me     she should shouldnt she youre so many times     over descended from her i believe     she does look like you stay the way you are     the nose is just the same and sos the chin     making allowance making due allowance     you poor dear great great great great granny     see that you get her greatness right dont stint her     yes its important though you think it isnt     i wont be teased but see how wet i am     yes you must go we cant stay here for ever     but wait until i give you a hand up     a bead of silver water more or less     strung on your hair wont hurt your summer looks     i wanted to try something with the noise     that the brook raises in the empty valley     we have seen visionsnow consult the voices     something i must have learned riding in trains     when i was young i used the roar     to set the voices speaking out of it     speaking or singing and the bandmusic playing     perhaps you have the art of what i mean     ive never listened in among the sounds     that a brook makes in such a wild descent     it ought to give a purer oracle     its as you throw a picture on a screen     the meaning of it all is out of you     the voices give you what you wish to hear     strangely its anything they wish to give     then i dont know it must be strange enough     i wonder if its not your makebelieve     what do you think youre like to hear today     from the sense of our having been together     but why take time for what im like to hear     ill tell you what the voices really say     you will do very well right where you are     a little longer i mustnt feel too hurried     or i cant give myself to hear the voices     is this some trance you are withdrawing into     you must be very still you mustnt talk     ill hardly breathe     the voices seem to say     im waiting     dont the voices seem to say     call her nausicaa the unafraid     of an acquaintance made adventurously     i let you say thaton consideration     i dont see very well how you can help it     you want the truth i speak but by the voices     you see they know i havent had your name     though what a name should matter between us     i shall suspect     be good the voices say     call her nausicaa and take a timber     that you shall find lies in the cellar charred     among the raspberries and hew and shape it     for a doorsill or other corner piece     in a new cottage on the ancient spot     the life is not yet all gone out of it     and come and make your summer dwelling here     and perhaps she will come still unafraid     and sit before you in the open door     with flowers in her lap until they fade     but not come in across the sacred sill     i wonder where your oracle is tending     you can see that theres something wrong with it     or it would speak in dialect whose voice     does it purport to speak in not old grandsirs     nor grannys surely call up one of them     they have best right to be heard in this place     you seem so partial to our greatgrandmother     nine times removed correct me if i err     you will be likely to regard as sacred     anything she may say but let me warn you     folks in her day were given to plain speaking     you think youd best tempt her at such a time     it rests with us always to cut her off     well then its granny speaking i dunnow     mebbe im wrong to take it as i do     there aint no names quite like the old ones though     nor never will be to my way of thinking     one mustnt bear too hard on the new comers     but theres a dite too many of them for comfort     i should feel easier if i could see     more of the salt wherewith theyre to be salted     son you do as youre told you take the timber     its as sound as the day when it was cut     and begin over there shed better stop     you can see what is troubling granny though     but dont you think we sometimes make too much     of the old stock what counts is the ideals     and those will bear some keeping still about     i can see we are going to be good friends     i like your going to be you said just now     its going to rain     i know and it was raining     i let you say all that but i must go now     you let me say it on consideration     how shall we say goodbye in such a case     how shall we     will you leave the way to me     no i dont trust your eyes youve said enough     now give me your hand uppick me that flower     where shall we meet again     nowhere but here     once more before we meet elsewhere     in rain     it ought to be in rain sometime in rain     in rain tomorrow shall we if it rains     but if we must in sunshine so she went     the housekeeper      i let myself in at the kitchen door     its you she said i cant get up forgive me     not answering your knock i can no more     let people in than i can

about when did she go     two weeks since     shes in earnest it appears     im sure she wont come back shes hiding somewhere     i dont know where myself john thinks i do     he thinks i only have to say the word     and shell come back but bless you im her mother     i cant talk to her and lord if i could     it will go hard with john what will he do     he cant find anyone to take her place     oh if you ask me that what will he do     he gets some sort of bakeshop meals together     with me to sit and tell him everything     whats wanted and how much and where it is     but when im goneof course i cant stay here     estelles to take me when shes settled down     he and i only hinder one another     i tell them they cant get me through the door though     ive been built in here like a big church organ     weve been here fifteen years     thats a long time     to live together and then pull apart     how do you see him living when youre gone     two of you out will leave an empty house     i dont just see him living many years     left here with nothing but the furniture     i hate to think of the old place when were gone     with the brook going by below the yard     and no one here but hens blowing about     if he could sell the place but then he cant     no one will ever live on it again     its too run down this is the last of it     what i think he will do is let things smash     hell sort of swear the time away hes awful     i never saw a man let family troubles     make so much difference in his mans affairs     hes just dropped everything hes like a child     i blame his being brought up by his mother     hes got hay down thats been rained on three times     he hoed a little yesterday for me     i thought the growing things would do him good     something went wrong i saw him throw the hoe     skyhigh with both hands i can see it now     come hereill show youin that apple tree     thats no way for a man to do at his age     hes fiftyfive you know if hes a day     arent you afraid of him whats that gun for     oh thats been there for hawks since chickentime     john hall touch me not if he knows his friends     ill say that for him johns no threatener     like some men folk no ones afraid of him     all is hes made up his mind not to stand     what he has got to stand     where is estelle     couldnt one talk to her what does she say     you say you dont know where she is     nor want to     she thinks if it was bad to live with him     it must be right to leave him     which is wrong     yes but he should have married her     i know     the strains been too much for her all these years     i cant explain it any other way     its different with a man at least with john     he knows hes kinder than the run of men     better than married ought to be as good     as marriedthats what he has always said     i know the way hes feltbut all the same     i wonder why he doesnt marry her     and end it     too late now she wouldnt have him     hes given her time to think of something else     thats his mistake the dear knows my interest     has been to keep the thing from breaking up     this is a good home i dont ask for better     but when ive said why shouldnt they be married     hed say why should they no more words than that     and after all why should they johns been fair     i take it what was his was always hers     there was no quarrel about property     reason enough there was no property     a friend or two as good as own the farm     such as it is it isnt worth the mortgage     i mean estelle has always held the purse     the rights of that are harder to get at     i guess estelle and i have filled the purse     twas we let him have money not he us     johns a bad farmer im not blaming him     take it year in year out he doesnt make much     we came here for a home for me you know     estelle to do the housework for the board     of both of us but look how it turns out     she seems to have the housework and besides     half of the outdoor work though as for that     hed say she does it more because she likes it     you see our pretty things are all outdoors     our hens and cows and pigs are always better     than folks like us have any business with     farmers around twice as well off as we     havent as good they dont go with the farm     one thing you cant help liking about john     hes fond of nice thingstoo fond some would say     but estelle dont complain shes like him there     she wants our hens to be the best there are     you never saw this room before a show     full of lank shivery halfdrowned birds     in separate coops having their plumage done     the smell of the wet feathers in the heat     you spoke of johns not being safe to stay with     you dont know what a gentle lot we are     we wouldnt hurt a hen you ought to see us     moving a flock of hens from place to place     were not allowed to take them upside down     all we can hold together by the legs     two at a times the rule one on each arm     no matter how far and how many times     we have to go     you mean thats johns idea     and we live up to it or i dont know     what childishness he wouldnt give way to     he manages to keep the upper hand     on his own farm hes boss but as to hens     we fence our flowers in and the hens range     nothings too good for them we say it pays     john likes to tell the offers he has had     twenty for this cock twentyfive for that     he never takes the money if theyre worth     that much to sell theyre worth as much to keep     bless you its all expense though reach me down     the little tin box on the cupboard shelf     the upper shelf the tin box thats the one     ill show you here you are     whats this     a bill     for fifty dollars for one langshang cock     receipted and the cock is in the yard     not in a glass case then     hed need a tall one     he can eat off a barrel from the ground     hes been in a glass case as you may say     the crystal palace london hes imported     john bought him and we paid the bill with beads     wampum i call it mind we dont complain     but you see dont you we take care of him     and like it too it makes it all the worse     it seems as if and thats not all hes helpless     in ways that i can hardly tell you of     sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts     to see where all the money goes so fast     you know how men will be ridiculous     but its just fun the way he gets bedeviled     if hes untidy now what will he be     it makes it all the worse you must be blind     estelles the one you neednt talk to me     cant you and i get to the root of it     whats the real trouble what will satisfy her     its as i say shes turned from him thats all     but why when shes well off is it the neighbours     being cut off from friends     we have our friends     that isnt it folks arent afraid of us     shes let it worry her you stood the strain     and youre her mother     but i didnt always     i didnt relish it along at first     but i got wonted to it and besides     john said i was too old to have grandchildren     but whats the use of talking when its done     she wont come backits worse than thatshe cant     why do you speak like that what do you know     what do you meanshes done harm to herself     i mean shes marriedmarried someone else     oho oho     you dont believe me     yes i do     only too well i knew there must be something     so that was what was back shes bad thats all     bad to get married when she had the chance     nonsense see whats she done but who who     whod marry her straight out of such a mess     say it right outno matter for her mother     the man was found id better name no names     john himself wont imagine who he is     then its all up i think ill get away     youll be expecting john i pity estelle     i suppose she deserves some pity too     you ought to have the kitchen to yourself     to break it to him you may have the job     you neednt think youre going to get away     johns almost here ive had my eye on someone     coming down ryans hill i thought twas him     here he is now this box put it away     and this bill     whats the hurry hell unhitch     no he wont either hell just drop the reins     and turn doll out to pasture rig and all     she wont get far before the wheels hang up     on somethingtheres no harm see there he is     my but he looks as if he must have heard     john threw the door wide but he didnt enter     how are you neighbour just the man im after

me these two     do go along with him and stop his shouting     she raised her voice against the closing door     who wants to hear your news youdreadful fool     the fear      a lantern light from deeper in the barn     shone on a man and woman in the door     and threw their lurching shadows on a house     near by all dark in every glossy window     a horses hoof pawed once the hollow floor     and the back of the gig they stood beside     moved in a little the man grasped a wheel     the woman spoke out sharply whoa stand still     i saw it just as plain as a white plate     she said as the light on the dashboard ran     along the bushes at the roadsidea mans face     you must have seen it too     i didnt see it     are you sure     yes im sure     it was a face     joel ill have to look i cant go in     i cant and leave a thing like that unsettled     doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference     i always have felt strange when we came home     to the dark house after so long an absence     and the key rattled loudly into place     seemed to warn someone to be getting out     at one door as we entered at another     what if im right and someone all the time     dont hold my arm     i say its someone passing     you speak as if this were a travelled road     you forget where we are what is beyond     that hed be going to or coming from     at such an hour of night and on foot too     what was he standing still for in the bushes     its not so very lateits only dark     theres more in it than youre inclined to say     did he look like     he looked like anyone     ill never rest tonight unless i know     give me the lantern     you dont want the lantern     she pushed past him and got it for herself     youre not to come she said this is my business     if the times come to face it im the one     to put it the right way hed never dare     listen he kicked a stone hear that hear that     hes coming towards us joel go inplease     harki dont hear him now but please go in     in the first place you cant make me believe its     it isor someone else hes sent to watch     and nows the time to have it out with him     while we know definitely where he is     let him get off and hell be everywhere     around us looking out of trees and bushes     till i shant dare to set a foot outdoors     and i cant stand it joel let me go     but its nonsense to think hed care enough     you mean you couldnt understand his caring     oh but you see he hadnt had enough     joel i wonti wonti promise you     we mustnt say hard things you mustnt either     ill be the one if anybody goes     but you give him the advantage with this light     what couldnt he do to us standing here     and if to see was what he wanted why     he has seen all there was to see and gone     he appeared to forget to keep his hold     but advanced with her as she crossed the grass     what do you want she cried to all the dark     she stretched up tall to overlook the light     that hung in both hands hot against her skirt     theres no one so youre wrong he said     there is     what do you want she cried and then herself     was startled when an answer really came     nothing it came from well along the road     she reached a hand to joel for support     the smell of scorching woollen made her faint     what are you doing round this house at night     nothing a pause there seemed no more to say     and then the voice again you seem afraid     i saw by the way you whipped up the horse     ill just come forward in the lantern light     and let you see     yes dojoel go back     she stood her ground against the noisy steps     that came on but her body rocked a little     you see the voice said     oh she looked and looked     you dont seeive a child here by the hand     whats a child doing at this time of night     out walking every child should have the memory     of at least one longafterbedtime walk     what son     then i should think

 you understand that we have to be careful     this is a very very lonely place     joel she spoke as if she couldnt turn     the swinging lantern lengthened to the ground     it touched it struck it clattered and went out     the selfseeker      willis i didnt want you here today     the lawyers coming for the company     im going to sell my soul or rather feet     five hundred dollars for the pair you know     with you the feet have nearly been the soul     and if youre going to sell them to the devil     i want to see you do it whens he coming     i half suspect you knew and came on

head     its hard to tell you how i managed it     when i saw the shaft had me by the coat     i didnt try too long to pull away     or fumble for my knife to cut away     i just embraced the shaft and rode it out     till weiss shut off the water in the wheelpit     thats how i think i didnt lose my head     but my legs got their knocks against the ceiling     awful why didnt they throw off the belt     instead of going clear down in the wheelpit     they say some time was wasted on the belt     old streak of leatherdoesnt love me much     because i make him spit fire at my knuckles     the way ben franklin used to make the kitestring     that must be it some days he wont stay on     that day a woman couldnt coax him off     hes on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth     snatched right and left across the silver pulleys     everything goes the same without me there     you can hear the small buzz saws whine the big saw     caterwaul to the hills around the village     as they both bite the wood its all our music     one ought as a good villager to like it     no doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound     and its our life     yes when its not our death     you make that sound as if it wasnt so     with everything what we live by we die by     i wonder where my lawyer is his trains in     i want this over with im hot and tired     youre getting ready to do something foolish     watch for him will you will you let him in     id rather mrs corbin didnt know     ive boarded here so long she thinks she owns me     youre bad enough to manage without her     and im

besides the boston lawyer     a little barefoot girl who in the noise     of heavy footsteps in the old frame house     and baritone importance of the lawyer     stood for a while unnoticed with her hands     shyly behind her     well and how is mister     the lawyer was already in his satchel     as if for papers that might bear the name     he hadnt at command you must excuse me     i dropped in at the mill and was detained     looking round i suppose said willis     yes     well yes     hear anything that might prove useful     the broken one saw anne why here is anne     what do you want

wouldnt youre the girl     you see anne has her lesson learned by heart     i wanted there should be some there next year     of course you did you left the rest for seed     and for the backwoods

had     in bushel lotsdoesnt come on the market     but anne im troubled have you told me all     youre hiding something thats as bad as lying     you ask this lawyer man and its not safe     with a lawyer at hand to find you out     nothing is hidden from some people anne     you dont tell me that where you found a rams horn     you didnt find a yellow ladys slipper     what did i tell you what

gathering bouquets     its not fair to the child it cant be helped though     pressed into service means pressed out of shape     somehow ill make it right with hershell see     shes going to do my scouting in the field     over stone walls and all along a wood     and by a river bank for water flowers     the floating heart with small leaf like a heart     and at the sinus under water a fist     of little fingers all kept down but one     and that thrust up to blossom in the sun     as if to say you youre the hearts desire     anne has a way with flowers to take the place     of that shes lost she goes down on one knee     and lifts their faces by the chin to hers     and says their names and leaves them where they are     the lawyer wore a watch the case of which     was cunningly devised to make a noise     like a small pistol when he snapped it shut     at such a time as this he snapped it now     well anne go dearie our affair will wait     the lawyer man is thinking of his train     he wants to give me lots and lots of money     before he goes because i hurt myself     and it may take him i dont know how long     but put our flowers in water first will help her     the pitchers too full for her theres no cup     just hook them on the inside of the pitcher     now runget out your documents you see     i have to keep on the good side of anne     im a great boy to

do you say will dont you be a fool     you crumpling folkses legal documents     out with it if youve any real objection     five hundred dollars     what would you think right     a thousand wouldnt be a cent too much     you know it mr lawyer the sin is     accepting anything before he knows     whether hes ever going to walk again     it smells to me like a dishonest trick     i thinki thinkfrom what i heard today     and saw myselfhe would be illadvised     what did you hear for instance willis said     now the place where the accident occurred     the broken one was twisted in his bed     this is between you two apparently     where i come in is what i want to know     you stand up to it like a pair of cocks     go outdoors if you want to fight spare me     when you come back

dont know what i mean about the flowers     dont stop to try to now youll miss your train     goodbye he flung his arms around his face     the woodpile      out walking in the frozen swamp one grey day     i paused and said i will turn back from here     no i will go on fartherand we shall see     the hard snow held me save where now and then     one foot went down the view was all in lines     straight up and down of tall slim trees     too much alike to mark or name a place by     so as to say for certain i was here     or somewhere else i was just far from home     a small bird flew before me he was careful     to put a tree between us when he lighted     and say no word to tell me who he was     who was so foolish as to think what he thought     he thought that i was after him for a feather     the white one in his tail like one who takes     everything said as personal to himself     one flight out sideways would have undeceived him     and then there was a pile of wood for which     i forgot him and let his little fear     carry him off the way i might have gone     without so much as wishing him goodnight     he went behind it to make his last stand     it was a cord of maple cut and split     and piledand measured four by four by eight     and not another like it could i see     no runner tracks in this years snow looped near it     and it was older sure than this years cutting     or even last years or the years before     the wood was grey and the bark warping off it     and the pile somewhat sunken clematis     had wound strings round and round it like a bundle     what held it though on one side was a tree     still growing and on one a stake and prop     these latter about to fall i thought that only     someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks     could so forget his handiwork on which     he spent himself the labour of his axe     and leave it there far from a useful fireplace     to warm the frozen swamp as best it could     with the slow smokeless burning of decay     good hours      i had for my winter evening walk     no one at all with whom to talk     but i had the cottages in a row     up to their shining eyes in snow     and i thought i had the folk within     i had the sound of a violin     i had a glimpse through curtain laces     of youthful forms and youthful faces     i had such company outward bound     i went till there were no cottages found     i turned and repented but coming back     i saw no window but that was black     over the snow my creaking feet     disturbed the slumbering village street     like profanation by your leave     at ten oclock of a winter eve
