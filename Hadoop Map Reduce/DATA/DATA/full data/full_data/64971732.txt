64971732	a foregone conclusion  by  w d howells  fifteenth edition     a foregone conclusion     i   as don ippolito passed down the long narrow calle or footway leading from the campo san stefano to the grand canal in venice he peered anxiously about him now turning for a backward look up the calle where there was no living thing in sight but a cat on a garden gate now running a quick eye along the palace walls that rose vast on either hand and notched the slender strip of blue sky visible overhead with the lines of their jutting balconies chimneys and cornices and now glancing toward the canal where he could see the noiseless black boats meeting and passing there was no sound in the calle save his own footfalls and the harsh scream of a parrot that hung in the sunshine in one of the loftiest windows but the note of a peasant crying pots of pinks and roses in the campo came softened to don ippolitos sense and he heard the gondoliers as they hoarsely jested together and gossiped with the canal between them at the next gondola station  the first tenderness of spring was in the air though down in that calle there was yet enough of the wintry rawness to chill the tip of don ippolitos sensitive nose which he rubbed for comfort with a handkerchief of dark blue calico and polished for ornament with a handkerchief of white linen he restored each to a different pocket in the sides of the ecclesiastical talare or gown reaching almost to his ankles and then clutched the pocket in which he had replaced the linen handkerchief as if to make sure that something he prized was safe within he paused abruptly and looking at the doors he had passed went back a few paces and stood before one over which hung slightly tilted forward an oval sign painted with the effigy of an eagle a bundle of arrows and certain thunderbolts and bearing the legend consulate of the united states in neat characters don ippolito gave a quick sigh hesitated a moment and then seized the bellpull and jerked it so sharply that it seemed to thrust out like a part of the mechanism the head of an old servingwoman at the window above him  who is there demanded this head  friends answered don ippolito in a rich sad voice  and what do you command further asked the old woman  don ippolito paused apparently searching for his voice before he inquired is it here that the consul of america lives  precisely  is he perhaps at home  i dont know i will go ask him  do me that pleasure dear said don ippolito and remained knotting his fingers before the closed door presently the old woman returned and looking out long enough to say the consul is at home drew some inner bolt by a wire running to the lock that let the door start open then waiting to hear don ippolito close it again she called out from her height favor me above he climbed the dim stairway to the point where she stood and followed her to a door which she flung open into an apartment so brightly lit by a window looking on the sunny canal that he blinked as he entered signor console said the old woman behold the gentleman who desired to see you and at the same time don ippolito having removed his broad stiff threecornered hat came forward and made a beautiful bow he had lost for the moment the trepidation which had marked his approach to the consulate and bore himself with graceful dignity  it was in the first year of the war and from a motive of patriotism common at that time mr ferris one of my many predecessors in office at venice had just been crossing his two silken gondola flags above the consular bookcase where with their gilt lanceheaded staves and their vivid stars and stripes they made a very pretty effect he filliped a little dust from his coat and begged don ippolito to be seated with the air of putting even a venetian priest on a footing of equality with other men under the folds of the national banner mr ferris had the prejudice of all italian sympathizers against the priests but for this he could hardly have found anything in don ippolito to alarm dislike his face was a little thin and the chin was delicate the nose had a fine dantesque curve but its final droop gave a melancholy cast to a countenance expressive of a gentle and kindly spirit the eyes were large and dark and full of a dreamy warmth don ippolitos prevailing tint was that transparent blueishness which comes from much shaving of a heavy black beard his forehead and temples were marble white he had a tonsure the size of a dollar he sat silent for a little space and softly questioned the consuls face with his dreamy eyes apparently he could not gather courage to speak of his business at once for he turned his gaze upon the window and said a beautiful position signor console  yes its a pretty place answered mr ferris warily  so much pleasanter here on the canalazzo than on the campos or the little canals  oh without doubt  here there must be constant amusement in watching the boats great stir great variety great life and now the fine season commences and the signor consoles countrymen will be coming to venice perhaps added don ippolito with a polite dismay and an air of sudden anxiety to escape from his own purpose i may be disturbing or detaining the signor console  no said mr ferris i am quite at leisure for the present in what can i have the honor of serving you  don ippolito heaved a long ineffectual sigh and taking his linen handkerchief from his pocket wiped his forehead with it and rolled it upon his knee he looked at the door and all round the room and then rose and drew near the consul who had officially seated himself at his desk  i suppose that the signor console gives passports he asked  sometimes replied mr ferris with a clouding face  don ippolito seemed to note the gathering distrust and to be helpless against it he continued hastily could the signor console give a passport for america  to me  are you an american citizen demanded the consul in the voice of a man whose suspicions are fully roused  american citizen  yes subject of the american republic  no surely i have not that happiness i am an austrian subject returned don ippolito a little bitterly as if the last words were an unpleasant morsel in the mouth  then i cant give you a passport said mr ferris somewhat more gently you know he explained that no government can give passports to foreign subjects that would be an unheardof thing  but i thought that to go to america an american passport would be needed  in america returned the consul with proud compassion they dont care a fig for passports you go and you come and nobody meddles to be sure he faltered just now on account of the secessionists they do require you to show a passport at new york but he continued more boldly american passports are usually for europe and besides all the american passports in the world wouldnt get you over the frontier at peschiera you must have a passport from the austrian lieutenancy of venice  don ippolito nodded his head softly several times and said precisely and then added with an indescribable weariness patience signor console i ask your pardon for the trouble i have given and he made the consul another low bow  whether mr ferriss curiosity was piqued and feeling himself on the safe side of his visitor he meant to know why he had come on such an errand or whether he had some kindlier motive he could hardly have told himself but he said im very sorry perhaps there is something else in which i could be of use to you  ah i hardly know cried don ippolito i really had a kind of hope in coming to your excellency  i am not an excellency interrupted mr ferris conscientiously  many excuses but now it seems a mere bestiality i was so ignorant about the other matter that doubtless i am also quite deluded in this  as to that of course i cant say answered mr ferris but i hope not  why listen signore said don ippolito placing his hand over that pocket in which he kept his linen handkerchief i had something that it had come into my head to offer your honored government for its advantage in this deplorable rebellion  oh responded mr ferris with a falling countenance he had received so many offers of help for his honored government from sympathizing foreigners hardly a week passed but a sabre came clanking up his dim staircase with a herr graf or a herr baron attached who appeared in the spotless panoply of his austrian captaincy or lieutenancy to accept from the consul a brigadiergeneralship in the federal armies on condition that the consul would pay his expenses to washington or at least assure him of an exalted post and reimbursement of all outlays from president lincoln as soon as he arrived they were beautiful men with the complexion of blonde girls their uniforms fitted like kid gloves the pale blue or pure white or huzzar black of their coats was ravishingly set off by their red or gold trimmings and they were hard to make understand that brigadiers of american birth swarmed at washington and that if they went thither they must go as soldiers of fortune at their own risk but they were very polite they begged pardon when they knocked their scabbards against the consuls furniture at the door they each made him a magnificent obeisance said servus in their great voices and were shown out by the old marina abhorrent of their uniforms and doubtful of the consuls political sympathies only yesterday she had called him up at an unwonted hour to receive the visit of a courtly gentleman who addressed him as monsieur le ministre and offered him at a bargain ten thousand stand of probably obsolescent muskets belonging to the late duke of parma shabby hungry incapable exiles of all nations religions and politics beset him for places of honor and emolument in the service of the union revolutionists out of business and the minions of banished despots were alike willing to be fed clothed and dispatched to washington with swords consecrated to the perpetuity of the republic  i have here said don ippolito too intent upon showing whatever it was he had to note the change in the consuls mood the model of a weapon of my contrivance which i thought the government of the north could employ successfully in cases where its batteries were in danger of capture by the spaniards  spaniards spaniards we have no war with spain cried the consul  yes yes i know don ippolito made haste to explain but those of south america being spanish by descent  but we are not fighting the south americans we are fighting our own southern states i am sorry to say  oh many excuses i am afraid i dont understand said don ippolito meekly whereupon mr ferris enlightened him in a formula of which he was beginning to be weary against european misconception of the american situation don ippolito nodded his head contritely and when mr ferris had ended he was so much abashed that he made no motion to show his invention till the other added but no matter i suppose the contrivance would work as well against the southerners as the south americans let me see it please and then don ippolito with a gratified smile drew from his pocket the neatly finished model of a breechloading cannon  you perceive signor console he said with new dignity that this is nothing very new as a breechloader though i ask you to observe this little improvement for restoring the breech to its place which is original the grand feature of my invention however is this secret chamber in the breech which is intended to hold an explosive of high potency with a fuse coming out below the gunner finding his piece in danger ignites this fuse and takes refuge in flight at the moment the enemy seizes the gun the contents of the secret chamber explode demolishing the piece and destroying its captors  the dreamy warmth in don ippolitos deep eyes kindled to a flame a dark red glowed in his thin cheeks he drew a box from the folds of his drapery and took snuff in a great whiff as if inhaling the sulphurous fumes of battle or titillating his nostrils with grains of gunpowder he was at least in full enjoyment of the poetic power of his invention and no doubt had before his eyes a vivid picture of a score of secessionists surprised and blown to atoms in the very moment of triumph behold signor console he said  its certainly very curious said mr ferris turning the fearful toy over in his hand and admiring the neat workmanship of it did you make this model yourself  surely answered the priest with a joyous pride i have no money to spend upon artisans and besides as you might infer signore i am not very well seen by my superiors and associates on account of these little amusements of mine so keep them as much as i can to myself don ippolito laughed nervously and then fell silent with his eyes intent upon the consuls face what do you think signore he presently resumed if this invention were brought to the notice of your generous government would it not patronize my labors i have read that america is the land of enterprises who knows but your government might invite me to take service under it in some capacity in which i could employ those little gifts that heaven he paused again apparently puzzled by the compassionate smile on the consuls lips but tell me signore how this invention appears to you have you had any practical experience in gunnery asked mr ferris  why certainly not  neither have i continued mr ferris but i was wondering whether the explosive in this secret chamber would not become so heated by the frequent discharges of the piece as to go off prematurely sometimes and kill our own artillerymen instead of waiting for the secessionists  don ippolitos countenance fell and a dull shame displaced the exultation that had glowed in it his head sunk on his breast and he made no attempt at reply so that it was again mr ferris who spoke you see i dont really know anything more of the matter than you do and i dont undertake to say whether your invention is disabled by the possibility i suggest or not havent you any acquaintances among the military to whom you could show your model  no answered don ippolito coldly i dont consort with the military besides what would be thought of a priest he asked with a bitter stress on the word who exhibited such an invention as that to an officer of our paternal government  i suppose it would certainly surprise the lieutenantgovernor somewhat said mr ferris with a laugh may i ask he pursued after an interval whether you have occupied yourself with other inventions  i have attempted a great many replied don ippolito in a tone of dejection  are they all of this warlike temper pursued the consul  no said don ippolito blushing a little they are nearly all of peaceful intention it was the wish to produce something of utility which set me about this cannon those good friends of mine who have done me the honor of looking at my attempts had blamed me for the uselessness of my inventions they allowed that they were ingenious but they said that even if they could be put in operation they would not be what the world cared for perhaps they were right i know very little of the world concluded the priest sadly he had risen to go yet seemed not quite able to do so there was no more to say but if he had come to the consul with high hopes it might well have unnerved him to have all end so blankly he drew a long sibilant breath between his shut teeth nodded to himself thrice and turning to mr ferris with a melancholy bow said signor console i thank you infinitely for your kindness i beg your pardon for the disturbance and i take my leave  i am sorry said mr ferris let us see each other again in regard to the inventionswell you must have patience he dropped into some proverbial phrases which the obliging latin tongues supply so abundantly for the races who must often talk when they do not feel like thinking and he gave a start when don ippolito replied in english yes but hope deferred maketh the heart sick  it was not that it was so uncommon to have italians innocently come out with their whole slender stock of english to him for the sake of practice as they told him but there were peculiarities in don ippolitos accent for which he could not account what he exclaimed do you know english  i have studied it a little by my myself answered don ippolito pleased to have his english recognized and then lapsing into the safety of italian he added and i had also the help of an english ecclesiastic who sojourned some months in venice last year for his health and who used to read with me and teach me the pronunciation he was from dublin this ecclesiastic  oh said mr ferris with relief i see and he perceived that what had puzzled him in don ippolitos english was a fine brogue superimposed upon his italian accent  for some time i have had this idea of going to america and i thought that the first thing to do was to equip myself with the language  um said mr ferris that was practical at any rate and he mused awhile by and by he continued more kindly than he had yet spoken i wish i could ask you to sit down again but i have an engagement which i must make haste to keep are you going out through the campo pray wait a minute and i will walk with you  mr ferris went into another room through the open door of which don ippolito saw the paraphernalia of a painters studio an easel with a halffinished picture on it a chair with a palette and brushes and crushed and twisted tubes of colors a lay figure in one corner on the walls scraps of stamped leather rags of tapestry desultory sketches on paper  mr ferris came out again brushing his hat  the signor console amuses himself with painting i see said don ippolito courteously  not at all replied mr ferris putting on his gloves i am a painter by profession and i amuse myself with consuling footnote since these words of mr ferris were first printed i have been told that a more eminent painter namely rubens made very much the same reply to very much the same remark when spanish ambassador in england the ambassador of his catholic majesty i see amuses himself by painting sometimes said a visitor who found him at his easel i amuse myself by playing the ambassador sometimes answered rubens in spite of the similarity of the speeches i let that of mr ferris stand for i am satisfied that he did not know how unhandsomely rubens had taken the words out of his mouth and as so open a matter needed no explanation he said no more about it nor is it quite necessary to tell how as he was one day painting in new york it occurred to him to make use of a congressional friend and ask for some italian consulate he did not care which that of venice happened to be vacant the income was a few hundred dollars as no one else wanted it no question was made of mr ferriss fitness for the post and he presently found himself possessed of a commission requesting the emperor of austria to permit him to enjoy and exercise the office of consul of the ports of the lombardovenetian kingdom to which the president of the united states appointed him from a special trust in his abilities and integrity he proceeded at once to his post of duty called upon the ships chandler with whom they had been left for the consular archives and began to paint some venetian subjects  he and don ippolito quitted the consulate together leaving marina to digest with her noonday porridge the wonder that he should be walking amicably forth with a priest the same spectacle was presented to the gaze of the campo where they paused in friendly converse and were seen to part with many politenesses by the doctors of the neighborhood lounging away their leisure as the venetian fashion is at the local pharmacy  the apothecary craned forward over his counter and peered through the open door what is that blessed consul of america doing with a priest  the consul of america with a priest demanded a grave old man a physician with a beautiful silvery beard and a most reverend and senatorial presence but one of the worst tongues in venice oh he added with a laugh after scrutiny of the two through his glasses its that crackbrain don ippolito rondinelli he isnt priest enough to hurt the consul perhaps hes been selling him a perpetual motion for the use of his government which needs something of the kind just now or maybe hes been posing to him for a picture he would make a very pretty joseph give him potiphars wife in the background said the doctor who if not maligned would have needed much more to make a joseph of him     ii   mr ferris took his way through the devious footways where the shadow was chill and through the broad campos where the sun was tenderly warm and the towers of the church rose against the speckless azure of the vernal heaven as he went along he frowned in a helpless perplexity with the case of don ippolito whom he had begun by doubting for a spy with some incomprehensible motive and had ended by pitying with a certain degree of amusement and a deep sense of the futility of his compassion he presently began to think of him with a little disgust as people commonly think of one whom they pity and yet cannot help and he made haste to cast off the hopeless burden he shrugged his shoulders struck his stick on the smooth pavingstones and let his eyes rove up and down the fronts of the houses for the sake of the pretty faces that glanced out of the casements he was a young man and it was spring and this was venice he made himself joyfully part of the city and the season he was glad of the narrowness of the streets of the goodhumored jostling and pushing he crouched into an arched doorway to let a watercarrier pass with her copper buckets dripping at the end of the yoke balanced on her shoulder and he returned her smiles and excuses with others as broad and gay he brushed by the swelling hoops of ladies and stooped before the unwieldy burdens of porters who as they staggered through the crowd with a thrust hero and a shove there forgave themselves laughing with we are in venice signori and he stood aside for the files of soldiers clanking heavily over the pavement then muskets kindling to a blaze in the sunlit campos and quenched again in the damp shadows of the calles his ear was taken by the vibrant jargoning of the boatmen as they pushed their craft under the bridges he crossed and the keen notes of the canaries and the songs of the goldenbilled blackbirds whose cages hung at lattices far overhead heaps of oranges topped by the fairest cut in halves gave their color at frequent intervals to the dusky corners and recesses and the longdrawn cry of the venders oranges of palermo rose above the clatter of feet and the clamor of other voices at a little shop where butter and eggs and milk abounded together with early flowers of various sorts he bought a bunch of hyacinths blue and white and yellow and he presently stood smelling these while he waited in the hotel parlor for the ladies to whom he had sent his card he turned at the sound of drifting drapery and could not forbear placing the hyacinths in the hand of miss florida vervain who had come into the room to receive him she was a girl of about seventeen years who looked older she was tall rather than short and rather fullthough it could not be said that she erred in point of solidity in the attitudes of shy hauteur into which she constantly fell there was a touch of defiant awkwardness which had a certain fascination she was blonde with a throat and hands of milky whiteness there was a suggestion of freckles on her regular face where a quick color came and went though her cheeks were habitually somewhat pale her eyes were very blue under their level brows and the lashes were even lighter in color than the masses of her fair gold hair the edges of the lids were touched with the faintest red the late colonel vervain of the united states army whose complexion his daughter had inherited was an officer whom it would not have been peaceable to cross in any purpose or pleasure and miss vervain seemed sometimes a little burdened by the passionate nature which he had left her together with the tropical name he had bestowed in honor of the state where he had fought the seminoles in his youth and where he chanced still to be stationed when she was born she had the air of being embarrassed in presence of herself and of having an anxious watch upon her impulses i do not know how otherwise to describe the effort of proud helpless femininity which would have struck the close observer in miss vervain  delicious she said in a deep voice which conveyed something of this anxiety in its guarded tones and yet was not wanting in a kind of frankness did you mean them for me mr ferris  i didnt but i do answered mr ferris i bought them in ignorance but i understand now what they were meant for by nature and in fact the hyacinths with their smooth textures and their pure colors harmonized well with miss vervain as she bent her face over them and inhaled their full rich perfume  i will put them in water she said if youll excuse me a moment mother will be down directly  before she could return her mother rustled into the parlor  mrs vervain was gracefully fragilely unlike her daughter she entered with a gentle and gliding step peering nearsightedly about through her glasses and laughing triumphantly when she had determined mr ferriss exact position where he stood with a smile shaping his full brown beard and glancing from his hazel eyes she was dressed in perfect taste with reference to her matronly years and the lingering evidences of her widowhood and she had an unaffected naturalness of manner which even at her age of fortyeight could not be called less than charming she spoke in a trusting caressing tone to which no man at least could respond unkindly  so very good of you to take all this trouble mr ferris she said giving him a friendly hand and i suppose you are letting us encroach upon very valuable time im quite ashamed to take it but isnt it a heavenly day what i call a perfect day just right every way none of those disagreeable extremes its so unpleasant to have it too hot for instance im the greatest person for moderation mr ferris and i carry the principle into everything but i do think the breakfasts at these italian hotels are too light altogether i like our american breakfasts dont you ive been telling florida i cant stand it we really must make some arrangement to be sure you oughtnt to think of such a thing as eating in a place like venice all poetry but a sound mind in a sound body i say were perfectly wild over it dont you think its a place that grows upon you very much mr ferris all those associationsit does seem too much and the gondolas everywhere but im always afraid the gondoliers cheat us and in the stores i never feel safe a momentnot a moment i do think the venetians are lacking in truthfulness a little i dont believe they understand our american fairdealing and sincerity i shouldnt want to do them injustice but i really think they take advantages in bargaining now such a thing even as corals florida is extremely fond of them and we bought a set yesterday in the piazza and i know we paid too much for them florida said mrs vervain for her daughter had reentered the room and stood with some shawls and wraps upon her arm patiently waiting for the conclusion of the elder ladys speech i wish you would bring down that set of corals id like mr ferris to give an unbiased opinion im sure we were cheated  i dont know anything about corals mrs vervain interposed mr ferris  well but you ought to see this set for the beauty of the color theyre really exquisite im sure it will gratify your artistic taste  miss vervain hesitated with a look of desire to obey and of doubt whether to force the pleasure upon mr ferris wont it do another time mother she asked faintly the gondola is waiting for us  mrs vervain gave a frailish start from the chair into which she had sunk oh do let us be off at once then she said and when they stood on the landingstairs of the hotel what gloomy things these gondolas are she added while the gondolier with one foot on the gunwale of the boat received the ladies shawls and then crooked his arm for them to rest a hand on in stepping aboard i wonder they dont paint them some cheerful color  blue or pink mrs vervain asked mr ferris i knew you were coming to that question they all do but we neednt have the top on at all if it depresses your spirits we shall be just warm enough in the open sunlight  well have it off then it sends the cold chills over me to look at it what did byron call it  yes its time for byron now it was very good of you not to mention him before mrs vervain bat i knew he had to come he called it a coffin clapped in a canoe  exactly said mrs vervain i always feel as if i were going to my own funeral when i get into it and ive certainly had enough of funerals never to want to have anything to do with another as long as i live  she settled herself luxuriously upon the featherstuffed leathern cushions when the cabin was removed death had indeed been near her very often father and mother had been early lost to her and the brothers and sisters orphaned with her had faded and perished one after another as they ripened to men and women she had seen four of her own children die her husband had been dead six years all these bereavements had left her what they had found her she had truly grieved and as she said she had hardly ever been out of black since she could remember  i never was in colors when i was a girl she went on indulging many obituary memories as the gondola dipped and darted down the canal and i was married in my mourning for my last sister it did seem a little too much when she went mr ferris i was too young to feel it so much about the others but we were nearly of the same age and that makes a difference dont you know first a brother and then a sister it was very strange how they kept going that way i seemed to break the charm when i got married though to be sure there was no brother left after marian  miss vervain heard her mothers mortuary prattle with a face from which no impatience of it could be inferred and mr ferris made no comment on what was oddly various in character and manner for mrs vervain touched upon the gloomiest facts of her history with a certain impersonal statistical interest they were rowing across the lagoon to the island of san lazzaro where for reasons of her own she intended to venerate the convent in which byron studied the armenian language preparatory to writing his great poem in it if her pilgrimage had no very earnest motive it was worthy of the fact which it was designed to honor the lagoon was of a perfect shining smoothness broken by the shallows over which the ebbing tide had left the seaweed trailed like long disheveled hair the fishermen as they waded about staking their nets or stooped to gather the small shellfish of the shallows showed legs as brown and tough as those of the apostles in titians assumption here and there was a boat with a boy or an old man asleep in the bottom of it the gulls sailed high white flakes against the illimitable blue of the heavens the air though it was of early spring and in the shade had a salty pungency was here almost languorously warm in the motionless splendors and rich colors of the scene there was a melancholy before which mrs vervain fell fitfully silent now and then ferris briefly spoke calling miss vervains notice to this or that and she briefly responded as they passed the madhouse of san servolo a maniac standing at an open window took his black velvet skullcap from his white hair bowed low three times and kissed his hand to the ladies the lido in front of them stretched a brown strip of sand with white villages shining out of it on their left the public gardens showed a mass of hovering green far beyond and above the ghostlike snows of the alpine heights haunted the misty horizon  it was chill in the shadow of the convent when they landed at san lazzaro and it was cool in the parlor where they waited for the monk who was to show them through the place but it was still and warm in the gardened court where the bees murmured among the crocuses and hyacinths under the noonday sun miss vervain stood looking out of the window upon the lagoon while her mother drifted about the room peering at the objects on the wall through her eyeglasses she was praising a chinese painting of fish on ricepaper when a young monk entered with a cordial greeting in english for mr ferris she turned and saw them shaking hands but at the same moment her eyeglasses abandoned her nose with a vigorous leap she gave an amiable laugh and groping for them over her dress bowed at random as mr ferris presented padre girolamo  ive been admiring this painting so much padre girolamo she said with instant goodwill and taking the monk into the easy familiarity of her friendship by the tone with which she spoke his name some of the brothers did it i suppose  oh no said the monk its a chinese painting we hung it up there because it was given to us and was curious  well now do you know returned mrs vervain i thought it was chinese their things are so odd but really in an armenian convent its very misleading i dont think you ought to leave it there it certainly does throw people off the track she added subduing the expression to something very ladylike by the winning appeal with which she used it  oh but if they put up armenian paintings in chinese convents said mr ferris  youre joking cried mrs vervain looking at him with a graciously amused air there are no chinese convents to be sure those rebels are a kind of christians she added thoughtfully but there cant be many of them left poor things hundreds of them executed at a time that way its perfectly sickening to read of it and you cant help it you know but they say they havent really so much feeling as we havenot so nervous  she walked by the side of the young friar as he led the way to such parts of the convent as are open to visitors and mr ferris came after with her daughter who he fancied met his attempts at talk with sudden and more than usual hauteur what a fool he said to himself is she afraid i shall be wanting to make love to her and he followed in rather a sulky silence the course of mrs vervain and her guide the library the chapel and the museum called out her friendliest praises and in the last she praised the mummy on show there at the expense of one she had seen in new york but when padre girolamo pointed out the desk in the refectory from which one of the brothers read while the rest were eating she took him to task oh but i cant think thats at all good for the digestion you knowusing the brain that way whilst youre at table i really hope you dont listen too attentively it would be better for you in the long run even in a religious point of view but nowbyron you must show me his cell the monk deprecated the nonexistence of such a cell and glanced in perplexity at mr ferris who came to his relief you couldnt have seen his cell if hed had one mrs vervain they dont admit ladies to the cloister  what nonsense answered mrs vervain apparently regarding this as another of mr ferriss pleasantries but padre girolamo silently confirmed his statement and she briskly assailed the rule as a disrespect to the sex which reflected even upon the virgin the object as he was forced to allow of their high veneration he smiled patiently and confessed that mrs vervain had all the reasons on her side at the polyglot printingoffice where she handsomely bought every kind of armenian book and pamphlet and thus repaid in the only way possible the trouble their visit had given he did not offer to take leave of them but after speaking with ferris of whom he seemed an old friend he led them through the garden environing the convent to a little pavilion perched on the wall that defends the island from the tides of the lagoon a laybrother presently followed them bearing a tray with coffee toasted rusk and a jar of that conserve of rose leaves which is the convents delicate hospitality to favored guests mrs vervain cried out over the poetic confection when padre girolamo told her what it was and her daughter suffered herself to express a guarded pleasure the amiable matron brushed the crumbs of the baicolo from her lap when the lunch was ended and fitting on her glasses leaned forward for a better look at the monks black bearded face im perfectly delighted she said you must be very happy here i suppose you are  yes answered the monk rapturously so happy that i should be content never to leave san lazzaro i came here when i was very young and the greater part of my life has been passed on this little island it is my homemy country  do you never go away  oh yes sometimes to constantinople sometimes to london and paris  and youve never been to america yet well now ill tell you you ought to go you would like it i know and our people would give you a very cordial reception  reception the monk appealed once more to ferris with a look  ferris broke into a laugh i dont believe padre girolamo would come in quality of distinguished foreigner mrs vervain and i dont think hed know what to do with one of our cordial receptions  well he ought to go to america any way he cant really know anything about us till hes been there just think how ignorant the english are of our country you will come wont you i should be delighted to welcome you at my house in providence rhode island is a small state but theres a great deal of wealth there and very good society in providence its quite newyorky you know said mrs vervain expressively she rose as she spoke and led the way back to the gondola she told padre girolamo that they were to be some weeks in venice and made him promise to breakfast with them at their hotel she smiled and nodded to him after the boat had pushed off and kept him bowing on the landingstairs  what a lovely place and what a perfectly heavenly morning you have given us mr ferris i we never can thank you enough for it and now do you know what im thinking of perhaps you can help me it was byrons studying there put me in mind of it how soon do the mosquitoes come  about the end of june responded ferris mechanically staring with helpless mystification at mrs vervain  very well then theres no reason why we shouldnt stay in venice till that time we are both very fond of the place and wed quite concluded this morning to stop here till the mosquitoes came you know mr ferris my daughter had to leave school much earlier than she ought for my health has obliged me to travel a great deal since i lost my husband and i must have her with me for were all that there is of us we havent a chick or a child thats related to us anywhere but wherever we stop even for a few weeks i contrive to get her some kind of instruction i feel the need of it so much in my own case for to tell you the truth mr ferris i married too young i suppose i should do the same thing over again if it was to be done over but dont you see my mind wasnt properly formed and then following my husband about from pillar to post and my first baby born when i was nineteen well it wasnt education at any rate whatever else it was and ive determined that florida though we are such a pair of wanderers shall not have my regrets i got teachers for her in englandthe english are not anything like so disagreeable at home as they are in traveling and we stayed there two yearsand i did in france and i did in germany and now italian here we are in italy and i think we ought to improve the time florida knows a good deal of italian already for her music teacher in france was an italian and he taught her the language as well as music what she wants now i should say is to perfect her accent and get facility i think she ought to have some one come every day and read and converse an hour or two with her  mrs vervain leaned back in her seat and looked at ferris who said feeling that the matter was referred to him i thinkwithout presuming to say what miss vervains need of instruction isthat your idea is a very good one he mused in silence his wonder that so much addlepatedness as was at once observable in mrs vervain should exist along with so much commonsense its certainly very good in the abstract he added with a glance at the daughter as if the sense must be hers she did not meet his glance at once but with an impatient recognition of the heat that was now great for the warmth with which she was dressed she pushed her sleeve from her wrist showing its delicious whiteness and letting her fingers trail through the cool water she dried them on her handkerchief and then bent her eyes full upon him as if challenging him to think this unladylike  no clearly the sense does not come from her said ferris to himself it is impossible to think well of the mind of a girl who treats one with tacit contempt  yes resumed mrs vervain its certainly very good in the abstract but oh dear me youve no idea of the difficulties in the way i may speak frankly with you mr ferris for you are here as the representative of the country and you naturally sympathize with the difficulties of americans abroad the teachers will fall in love with their pupils  mother began miss vervain and then she checked herself  ferris gave a vengeful laugh really mrs vervain though i sympathize with you in my official capacity i must own that as a man and a brother i cant help feeling a little sorry for those poor fellows too  to be sure they are to be pitied of course and i feel for them i did when i was a girl for the same thing used to happen then i dont know why florida should be subjected to such embarrassments too it does seem sometimes as if it were something in the blood they all get the idea that you have money you know  then i should say that it might be something in the pocket suggested ferris with a look at miss vervain in whose silent suffering as he imagined it he found a malicious consolation for her scorn  well whatever it is replied mrs vervain its too vexatious of course going to new places that way as were always doing and only going to stay for a limited time perhaps you cant pick and choose and even when you do get an elderly teacher theyre as bad as any it really is too trying now when i was talking with that nice monk of yours at the convent there i couldnt help thinking how perfectly delightful it would be if florida could have him for a teacher why couldnt she he told me that he would come to take breakfast or lunch with us but not dinner for he always had to be at the convent before nightfall well he might come to give the lessons sometime in the middle of the day  you couldnt manage it mrs vervain i know you couldnt answered ferris earnestly im sure the armenians never do anything of the kind theyre all very busy men engaged in ecclesiastical or literary work and they couldnt give the time  why not there was byron  but byron went to them and he studied armenian not italian with them padre girolamo speaks perfect italian for all that i can see but i doubt if hed undertake to impart the native accent which is what you want in fact the scheme is altogether impracticable  well said mrs vervain im exceedingly sorry i had quite set my heart on it i never took such a fancy to any one in such a short time before  it seemed to be a case of love at first sight on both sides said ferris padre girolamo doesnt shower those syruped roseleaves indiscriminately upon visitors  thanks returned mrs vervain its very good of you to say so mr ferris and its very gratifying all round but dont you see it doesnt serve the present purpose what teachers do you know of  she had been by marriage so long in the service of the united states that she still regarded its agents as part of her own domestic economy consuls she everywhere employed as functionaries specially appointed to look after the interests of american ladies traveling without protection in the week which had passed since her arrival in venice there had been no day on which she did not appeal to ferris for help or sympathy or advice she took amiable possession of him at once and she had established an amusing sort of intimacy with him to which the haughty trepidations of her daughter set certain bounds but in which the demand that he should find her a suitable italian teacher seemed trivially matter of course  yes i know several teachers he said after thinking awhile but theyre all open to the objection of being human and besides they all do things in a set kind of way and im afraid they wouldnt enter into the spirit of any scheme of instruction that departed very widely from ollendorff he paused and mrs vervain gave a sketch of the different professional masters whom she had employed in the various countries of her sojourn and a disquisition upon their several lives and characters fortifying her statements by reference of doubtful points to her daughter this occupied some time and ferris listened to it all with an abstracted air at last he said with a smile there was an italian priest came to see me this morning who astonished me by knowing englishwith a brogue that hed learned from an english priest straight from dublin perhaps he might do mrs vervain hes professionally pledged you know not to give the kind of annoyance youve suffered from in teachers he would do as well as padre girolamo i suppose  do you really are you in earnest  well no i believe im not i havent the least idea he would do he belongs to the church militant he came to me with the model of a breechloading cannon hes invented and he wanted a passport to go to america so that he might offer his cannon to our government  how curious said mrs vervain and her daughter looked frankly into ferriss face but i know its one of your jokes  you overpraise me mrs vervain if i could make such jokes as that priest was i should set up for a humorist at once he had the touch of pathos that they say all true pieces of humor ought to have he went on instinctively addressing himself to miss vervain who did not repulse him he made me melancholy and his face haunts me i should like to paint him priests are generally such a snuffy common lot and i dare say he concluded hes sufficiently commonplace too though he didnt look it spare your romance miss vervain  the young lady blushed resentfully i see as little romance as joke in it she said  it was a cannon returned ferris without taking any notice of her and with a sort of absent laugh that would make it very lively for the southernersif they had it poor fellow i suppose he came with high hopes of me and expected me to receive his invention with eloquent praises ive no doubt he figured himself furnished not only with a passport but with a letter from me to president lincoln and foresaw his own triumphal entry into washington and his honorable interviews with the admiring generals of the union forces to whom he should display his wonderful cannon too bad isnt it  and why didnt you give him the passport and the letter asked mrs vervain  oh thats a state secret returned ferris  and you think he wont do for our purpose  i dont indeed  well im not so sure of it tell me something more about him  i dont know anything more about him besides there isnt time  the gondola had already entered the canal and was swiftly approaching the hotel  oh yes there is pleaded mrs vervain laying her hand on his arm i want you to come in and dine with us we dine early  thank you i cant affairs of the nation you know rebel privateer on the canal of the brenta  really mrs vervain leaned towards ferris for sharper scrutiny of his face her glasses sprang from her nose and precipitated themselves into his bosom  allow me he said with burlesque politeness withdrawing them from the recesses of his waistcoat and gravely presenting them miss vervain burst into a helpless laugh then she turned toward her mother with a kind of indignant tenderness and gently arranged her shawl so that it should not drop off when she rose to leave the gondola she did not look again at ferris who resisted mrs vervains entreaties to remain and took leave as soon as the gondola landed  the ladies went to their room where florida lifted from the table a vase of diverscolored hyacinths and stepping out upon the balcony flung the flowers into the canal as she put down the empty vase the lingering perfume of the banished flowers haunted the air of the room  why florida said her mother those were the flowers that mr ferris gave you did you fancy they had begun to decay the smell of hyacinths when theyre a little old is dreadful but i cant imagine a gentlemans giving you flowers that were at all old  oh mother dont speak to me cried miss vervain passionately clasping her hands to her face  now i see that ive been saying something to vex you my darling and seating herself beside the young girl on the sofa she fondly took down her hands do tell me what it was was it about your teachers falling in love with you you know they did florida pestachiavi and schulze both and that horrid old fleuron  did you think i liked any better on that account to have you talk it over with a stranger asked florida still angrily  thats true my dear said mrs vervain penitently but if it worried you why didnt you do something to stop me give me a hint or just a little knock somewhere  no mother id rather not then youd have come out with the whole thing to prove that you were right its better to let it go said florida with a fierce laugh half sob but its strange that you cant remember how such things torment me  i suppose its my weak health dear answered the mother i didnt use to be so but now i dont really seem to have the strength to be sensible i know its silly as well as you the talk just seems to keep going on of itselfslipping out slipping out but you neednt mind mr ferris wont think you could ever have done anything out of the way im sure you dont act with him as if youd ever encouraged anybody i think youre too haughty with him florida and now his flowers  hes detestable hes conceited and presuming beyond all endurance i dont care what he thinks of me but its his manner towards you that i cant tolerate  i suppose its rather free said mrs vervain but then you know my dear i shall be soon getting to be an old lady and besides i always feel as if consuls were a kind of one of the family hes been very obliging since we came i dont know what we should have done without him and i dont object to a little ease of manner in the gentlemen i never did  he makes fun of you cried florida and there at the convent she said bursting into angry tears he kept exchanging glances with that monk as if he hes insulting and i hate him  do you mean that he thought your mother ridiculous florida asked mrs vervain gravely you must have misunderstood his looks indeed you must i cant imagine why he should i remember that i talked particularly well during our whole visit my mind was active for i felt unusually strong and i was interested in everything its nothing but a fancy of yours or your prejudice florida but its odd now ive sat down for a moment how worn out i feel and thirsty  mrs vervain fitted on her glasses but even then felt uncertainly about for the empty vase on the table before her  it isnt a goblet mother said florida ill get you some water  do and then throw a shawl over me im sleepy and a nap before dinner will do me good i dont see why im so drowsy of late i suppose its getting into the sea air here at venice though its mountain air that makes you drowsy but youre quite mistaken about mr ferris he isnt capable of anything really rude besides there wouldnt have been any sense in it  the young girl brought the water and then knelt beside the sofa on which she arranged the pillows under her mother and covered her with soft wraps she laid her cheek against the thinner face dont mind anything ive said mother lets talk of something else  the mother drew some loose threads of the daughters hair through her slender fingers but said little more and presently fell into a deep slumber florida gently lifted her head away and remained kneeling before the sofa looking into the sleeping face with an expression of strenuous compassionate devotion mixed with a vague alarm and self pity and a certain wondering anxiety     iii   don ippolito had slept upon his interview with ferris and now sat in his laboratory amidst the many witnesses of his inventive industry with the model of the breechloading cannon on the workbench before him he had neatly mounted it on wheels that its completeness might do him the greater credit with the consul when he should show it him but the carriage had been broken in his pocket on the way home by an unlucky thrust from the burden of a porter and the poor toy lay there disabled as if to dramatize that premature explosion in the secret chamber  his heart was in these inventions of his which had as yet so grudgingly repaid his affection for their sake he had stinted himself of many needful things the meagre stipend which he received from the patrimony of his church eked out with the money paid him for baptisms funerals and marriages and for masses by people who had friends to be prayed out of purgatory would at best have barely sufficed to support him but he denied himself everything save the necessary decorums of dress and lodging he fasted like a saint and slept hard as a hermit that he might spend upon these ungrateful creatures of his brain they were the work of his own hands and so he saved the expense of their construction but there were many little outlays for materials and for tools which he could not avoid and with him a little was all they not only famished him they isolated him his superiors in the church and his brother priests looked with doubt or ridicule upon the labors for which he shunned their company while he gave up the other social joys few and small which a priest might know in the venice of that day when all generous spirits regarded him with suspicion for his cloths sake and church and state were alert to detect disaffection or indifference in him but bearing these things willingly and living as frugally as he might he had still not enough and he had been fain to assume the instruction of a young girl of old and noble family in certain branches of polite learning which a young lady of that sort might fitly know the family was not so rich as it was old and noble and don ippolito was paid from its purse rather than its pride but the slender salary was a help these patricians were very good to him many a time he dined with them and so spared the cost of his own pottage at home they always gave him coffee when he came and that was a saving at the proper seasons little presents from them were not wanting in a word his condition was not privation he did his duty as a teacher faithfully and the only trouble with it was that the young girl was growing into a young woman and that he could not go on teaching her forever in an evil hour as it seemed to don ippolito that made the years she had been his pupil shrivel to a mere pinch of time there came from a young count of the friuli visiting venice an offer of marriage and don ippolito lost his place it was hard but he bade himself have patience and he composed an ode for the nuptials of his late pupil which together with a brief sketch of her ancestral history he had elegantly printed according to the italian usage and distributed among the family friends he also made a sonnet to the bridegroom and these literary tributes were handsomely acknowledged  he managed a whole year upon the proceeds and kept a cheerful spirit till the last soldo was spent inventing one thing after another and giving much time and money to a new principle of steam propulsion which as applied without steam to a small boat on the canal before his door failed to work though it had no logical excuse for its delinquency he tried to get other pupils but he got none and he began to dream of going to america he pinned his faith in all sorts of magnificent possibilities to the names of franklin fulton and morse he was so ignorant of our politics and geography as to suppose us at war with the south american spaniards but he knew that english was the language of the north and he applied himself to the study of it heaven only knows what kind of inventors utopia our poor patent ridden country appeared to him in these dreams of his and i can but dimly figure it to myself but he might very naturally desire to come to a land where the spirit of invention is recognized and fostered and where he could hope to find that comfort of incentive and companionship which our artists find in italy  the idea of the breechloading cannon had occurred to him suddenly one day in one of his newworldward reveries and he had made haste to realize it carefully studying the form and general effect of the austrian cannon under the gallery of the ducal palace to the high embarrassment of the croat sentry who paced up and down there and who did not feel free to order off a priest as he would a civilian don ippolitos model was of admirable finish he even painted the carriage yellow and black because that of the original was so and colored the piece to look like brass and he lost a day while the paint was drying after he was otherwise ready to show it to the consul  he had parted from ferris with some gleams of comfort caught chiefly from his kindly manner but they had died away before nightfall and this morning he could not rekindle them  he had had his coffee served to him on the bench as his frequent custom was but it stood untasted in the little copper pot beside the dismounted cannon though it was now ten oclock and it was full time he had breakfasted for he had risen early to perform the matin service for three peasant women two beggars a cat and a paralytic nobleman in the ancient and beautiful church to which he was attached he had tried to go about his wonted occupations but he was still sitting idle before his bench while his servant gossiped from her balcony to the mistress of the next house across a calle so deep and narrow that it opened like a mountain chasm beneath them it were well if the master read his breviary a little more instead of always maddening himself with those blessed inventions that eat more soldi than a christian and never come to anything there he sits before his table as if he were nailed to his chair and lets his coffee cooland god knows i was ready to drink it warm two hours agoand never looks at me if i open the door twenty times to see whether he has finished holy patience you have not even the advantage of fasting to the glory of god in this house though you keep lent the year round its the devils lent i say eh diana there goes the bell who now adieu lusetta to meet again dear farewell  she ran to another window and admitted the visitor it was ferris and she went to announce him to her master by the title he had given while he amused his leisure in the darkness below by falling over a cistern top with a loud clattering of his cane on the copper lid after which he heard the voice of the priest begging him to remain at his convenience a moment till he could descend and show him the way up stairs his eyes were not yet used to the obscurity of the narrow entry in which he stood when he felt a cold hand laid on his and passively yielded himself to its guidance he tried to excuse himself for intruding upon don ippolito so soon but the priest in far suppler italian overwhelmed him with lamentations that he should be so unworthy the honor done him and ushered his guest into his apartment he plainly took it for granted that ferris had come to see his inventions in compliance with the invitation he had given him the day before and he made no affectation of delay though after the excitement of the greetings was past it was with a quiet dejection that he rose and offered to lead his visitor to his laboratory  the whole place was an outgrowth of himself it was his history as well as his character it recorded his quaint and childish tastes his restless endeavors his partial and halting successes the anteroom in which he had paused with ferris was painted to look like a grapearbor where the vines sprang from the floor and flourishing up the trellised walls with many a wanton tendril and flaunting leaf displayed their lavish clusters of white and purple all over the ceiling it touched ferris when don ippolito confessed that this decoration had been the distraction of his own vacant moments to find that it was like certain grapearbors he had seen in remote corners of venice before the doors of degenerate palaces or forming the entrances of openair restaurants and did not seem at all to have been studied from grape arbors in the country he perceived the archaic striving for exact truth and he successfully praised the mechanical skill and love of reality with which it was done but he was silenced by a collection of paintings in don ippolitos parlor where he had been made to sit down a moment hard they were in line fixed in expression and opaque in color these copies of famous masterpiecessaints of either sex ascensions assumptions martyrdoms and what notand they were not quite comprehensible till don ippolito explained that he had made them from such prints of the subjects as he could get and had colored them after his own fancy all this in a city whose art had been the glory of the world for nigh half a thousand years struck ferris as yet more comically pathetic than the frescoed grapearbor he stared about him for some sort of escape from the pictures and his eye fell upon a piano and a melodeon placed end to end in a right angle don ippolito seeing his look of inquiry sat down and briefly played the same air with a hand upon each instrument  ferris smiled don ippolito you are another da vinci a universal genius  bagatelles bagatelles said the priest pensively but he rose with greater spirit than he had yet shown and preceded the consul into the little room that served him for a smithy it seemed from some peculiarities of shape to have once been an oratory but it was now begrimed with smoke and dust from the forge which don ippolito had set up in it the embers of a recent fire the bellows the pincers the hammers and the other implements of the trade gave it a sinister effect as if the place of prayer had been invaded by mocking imps or as if some hapless mortal in contract with the evil powers were here searching by the help of the adversary for the forbidden secrets of the metals and of fire in those days ferris was an uncompromising enemy of the theatricalization of italy or indeed of anything but the fancy of the blackrobed young priest at work in this place appealed to him all the more potently because of the sort of tragic innocence which seemed to characterize don ippolitos expression he longed intensely to sketch the picture then and there but he had strength to rebuke the fancy as something that could not make itself intelligible without the help of such accessories as he despised and he victoriously followed the priest into his larger workshop where his inventions complete and incomplete were stored and where he had been seated when his visitor arrived the high windows and the frescoed ceiling were festooned with dusty cobwebs litter of shavings and whittlings strewed the floor mechanical implements and contrivances were everywhere and don ippolitos listlessness seemed to return upon him again at the sight of the familiar disorder conspicuous among other objects lay the illogically unsuccessful model of the new principle of steam propulsion untouched since the day when he had lifted it out of the canal and carried it indoors through the ranks of grinning spectators from a shelf above it he took down models of a flyingmachine and a perpetual motion fantastic researches in the impossible i never expected results from these experiments with which i nevertheless once pleased myself he said and turned impatiently to various pieces of portable furniture chairs tables bedsteads which by folding up their legs and tops condensed themselves into flat boxes developing handles at the side for convenience in carrying they were painted and varnished and were in all respects complete they had indeed won favorable mention at an exposition of the provincial society of arts and industries and ferris could applaud their ingenuity sincerely though he had his tacit doubts of their usefulness he fell silent again when don ippolito called his notice to a photographic camera so contrived with straps and springs that you could snatch by its help whatever joy there might be in taking your own photograph and he did not know what to say of a submarine boat a fourwheeled water velocipede a movable bridge or the very many other principles and ideas to which don ippolitos cunning hand had given shape more or less imperfect it seemed to him that they all however perfect or imperfect had some fatal defect they were aspirations toward the impossible or realizations of the trivial and superfluous yet for all this they strongly appealed to the painter as the stunted fruit of a talent denied opportunity instruction and sympathy as he looked from them at last to the questioning face of the priest and considered out of what disheartened and solitary patience they must have come in this citydead hundreds of years to all such endeavorhe could not utter some glib phrases of compliment that he had on his tongue if don ippolito had been taken young he might perhaps have amounted to something though this was questionable but at thirtyas he looked nowwith his undisciplined purposes and his head full of vagaries of which these things were the tangible witness ferris let his eyes drop again they fell upon the ruin of the breechloading cannon and he said don ippolito its very good of you to take the trouble of showing me these matters and i hope youll pardon the ungrateful return if i cannot offer any definite opinion of them now they are rather out of my way i confess i wish with all my heart i could order an experimental lifesize copy of your breechloading cannon here for trial by my government but i cant and to tell you the truth it was not altogether the wish to see these inventions of yours that brought me here today  oh said don ippolito with a mortified air i am afraid that i have wearied the signor console  not at all not at all ferris made haste to answer with a frown at his own awkwardness but your speaking english yesterday  perhaps what i was thinking of is quite foreign to your tastes and possibilities he hesitated with a look of perplexity while don ippolito stood before him in an attitude of expectation pressing the points of his fingers together and looking curiously into his face the case is this resumed ferris desperately there are two american ladies friends of mine sojourning in venice who expect to be here till midsummer they are mother and daughter and the young lady wants to read and speak italian with somebody a few hours each day the question is whether it is quite out of your way or not to give her lessons of this kind i ask it quite at a venture i suppose no harm is done at any rate and he looked at don ippolito with apologetic perturbation  no said the priest there is no harm on the contrary i am at this moment in a position to consider it a great favor that you do me in offering me this employment i accept it with the greatest pleasure oh he cried breaking by a sudden impulse from the composure with which he had begun to speak you dont know what you do for me you lift me out of despair before you came i had reached one of those passes that seem the last bound of endeavor but you give me new life now i can go on with my experiment i can at test my gratitude by possessing your native country of the weapon i had designed for iti am sure of the principle some slight improvement perhaps the use of some different explosive would get over that difficulty you suggested he said eagerly yes something can be done god bless you my dear little soni meanperdonimy dear sir  waitnot so fast said ferris with a laugh yet a little annoyed that a question so purely tentative as his should have met at once such a definite response are you quite sure you can do what they want he unfolded to him as fully as he understood it mrs vervains scheme  don ippolito entered into it with perfect intelligence he said that he had already had charge of the education of a young girl of noble family and he could therefore the more confidently hope to be useful to this american lady a light of joyful hope shone in his dreamy eyes the whole man changed he assumed the hospitable and caressing host he conducted ferris back to his parlor and making him sit upon the hard sofa that was his hard bed by night he summoned his servant and bade her serve them coffee she closed her lips firmly and waved her finger before her face to signify that there was no more coffee then he bade her fetch it from the caffè and he listened with a sort of rapt inattention while ferris again returned to the subject and explained that he had approached him without first informing the ladies and that he must regard nothing as final it was at this point that don ippolito who had understood so clearly what mrs vervain wanted appeared a little slow to understand and ferris had a doubt whether it was from subtlety or from simplicity that the priest seemed not to comprehend the impulse on which he had acted he finished his coffee in this perplexity and when he rose to go don ippolito followed him down to the streetdoor and preserved him from a second encounter with the cisterntop  but don ippolitoremember i make no engagement for the ladies whom you must see before anything is settled said ferris  surelysurely answered the priest and he remained smiling at the door till the american turned the next corner then he went back to his workroom and took up the broken model from the bench but he could not work at it now he could not work at anything he began to walk up and down the floor  could he really have been so stupid because his mind was on his ridiculous cannon wondered ferris as he sauntered frowning away and he tried to prepare his own mind for his meeting with the vervains to whom he must now go at once he felt abused and victimized yet it was an amusing experience and he found himself able to interest both of the ladies in it the younger had received him as coldly as the forms of greeting would allow but as he talked she drew nearer him with a reluctant haughtiness which he noted he turned the more conspicuously towards mrs vervain well to make a long story short he said i couldnt discourage don ippolito he refused to be dismayedas i should have been at the notion of teaching miss vervain i didnt arrange with him not to fall in love with her as his secular predecessors have doneit seemed superfluous but you can mention it to him if you like in fact said ferris suddenly addressing the daughter you might make the stipulation yourself miss vervain  she looked at him a moment with a sort of defenseless pain that made him ashamed and then walked away from him towards the window with a frank resentment that made him smile as he continued but i suppose you would like to have some explanation of my motive in precipitating don ippolito upon you in this way when i told you only yesterday that he wouldnt do at all in fact i think myself that ive behaved rather ficklemindedlyfor a representative of the country but ill tell you and you wont be surprised to learn that i acted from mixed motives im not at all sure that hell do ive had awful misgivings about it since i left him and im glad of the chance to make a clean breast of it when i came to think the matter over last night the fact that he had taught himself englishwith the help of an irishman for the pronunciationseemed to promise that hed have the right sort of sympathy with your scheme and it showed that he must have something practical about him too and heres where the selfish admixture comes in i didnt have your interests solely in mind when i went to see don ippolito i hadnt been able to get rid of him he stuck in my thought i fancied he might be glad of the pay of a teacher andi had half a notion to ask him to let me paint him it was an even chance whether i should try to secure him for miss vervain or for artas they call it miss vervain won because she could pay him and i didnt see how art could i can bring him round any time and thats the whole inconsequent business my consolation is that ive left you perfectly free theres nothing decided  thanks said mrs vervain then its all settled you can bring him as soon as you like to our new place weve taken that apartment we looked at the other day and were going into it this afternoon heres the landlords letter she added drawing a paper out of her pocket if hes cheated us i suppose you can see justice done i didnt want to trouble you before  youre a woman of business mrs vervain said ferris the mans a perfect jewor a perfect christian one ought to say in venice we true believers do gouge so much more infamously hereand you let him get you in black and white before you come to me well he continued as he glanced at the paper youve done it he makes you pay one half too much however its cheap enough twice as cheap as your hotel  but i dont care for cheapness i hate to be imposed upon whats to be done about it  nothing if he has your letter as you have his its a bargain and you must stand to it  a bargain oh nonsense now mr ferris this is merely a note of mutual understanding  yes thats one way of looking at it the civil tribunal would call it a binding agreement of the closest tenureif you want to go to law about it  i will go to law about it  oh no you wontunless you mean to spend your remaining days and all your substance in venice come you havent done so badly mrs vervain i dont call four rooms completely furnished for housekeeping with that lovely garden at all dear at eleven francs a day besides the landlord is a man of excellent feeling sympathetic and obliging and a perfect gentleman though he is such an outrageous scoundrel hell cheat you of course in whatever he can you must look out for that but hell do you any sort of little neighborly kindness goodby said ferris getting to the door before mrs vervain could intercept him ill come to your new place this evening to see how you are pleased  florida said mrs vervain this is outrageous  i wouldnt mind it mother we pay very little after all  yes but we pay too much thats what i cant bear and as you said yesterday i dont think mr ferriss manners are quite respectful to me  he only told you the truth i think he advised you for the best the matter couldnt be helped now  but i call it a want of feeling to speak the truth so bluntly  we wont have to complain of that in our landlord it seems said florida perhaps not in our priest either she added  yes that was kind of mr ferris said mrs vervain it was thoroughly thoughtful and consideratewhat i call an instance of true delicacy im really quite curious to see him don ippolito how very odd to call a priest don i should have said padre don always makes you think of a spanish cavalier don rodrigo something like that  they went on to talk desultorily of don ippolito and what he might be like in speaking of him the day before ferris had hinted at some mysterious sadness in him and to hint of sadness in a man always interests women in him whether they are old or young the old have suffered the young forebode suffering their interest in don ippolito had not been diminished by what ferris had told them of his visit to the priests house and of the things he had seen there for there had always been the same strain of pity in his laughing account and he had imparted none of his doubts to them they did not talk as if it were strange that ferris should do today what he had yesterday said he would not do perhaps as women they could not find such a thing strange but it vexed him more and more as he went about all afternoon thinking of his inconsistency and wondering whether he had not acted rashly     iv   the palace in which mrs vervain had taken an apartment fronted on a broad campo and hung its empty marble balconies from gothic windows above a silence scarcely to be matched elsewhere in venice the local pharmacy the caffè the grocery the fruiterers the other shops with which every venetian campo is furnished had each a certain life about it but it was a silent life and at midday a frowsyheaded woman clacking across the flags in her woodenheeled shoes made echoes whose garrulity was interrupted by no other sound in the early morning when the lid of the public cistern in the centre of the campo was unlocked there was a clamor of voices and a clangor of copper vessels as the housewives of the neighborhood and the local force of strongbacked frinlan watergirls drew their days supply of water and on that sort of special parochial holiday called a sagra the campo hummed and clattered and shrieked with a multitude celebrating the day around the stands where pumpkin seeds and roast pumpkin and anisettewater were sold and before the movable kitchen where cakes were fried in caldrons of oil and uproariously offered to the crowd by the cook who did not suffer himself to be embarrassed by the rival drama of adjoining puppetshows but continued to bellow forth his bargains all day long and far into the night when the flames under his kettles painted his visage a fine crimson the sagra once over however the campo relapsed into its habitual silence and no one looking at the front of the palace would have thought of it as a place for distractionseeking foreign sojourners but it was not on this side that the landlord tempted his tenants his principal notice of lodgings to let was affixed to the watergate of the palace which opened on a smaller channel so near the grand canal that no wandering eye could fail to see it the portal was a tall arch of venetian gothic tipped with a carven flame steps of white istrian stone descended to the level of the lowest ebb irregularly embossed with barnacles and dabbling long fringes of soft green seamosses in the rising and falling tide swarms of waterbugs and beetles played over the edges of the steps and crabs scuttled sidewise into deeper water at the approach of a gondola a length of stonecapped brick wall to which patches of stucco still clung stretched from the gate on either hand under cover of an ivy that flung its mesh of shining green from within where there lurked a lovely garden stately spacious for venice and full of a delicious halfsad surprise for whoso opened upon it in the midst it had a broken fountain with a marble naiad standing on a shell and looking saucier than the sculptor meant from having lost the point of her nose nymphs and fauns and shepherds and shepherdesses her kinsfolk coquetted in and out among the greenery in flirtation not to be embarrassed by the fracture of an arm or the casting of a leg or so one lady had no head but she was the boldest of all in this garden there were some mulberry and pomegranate trees several of which hung about the fountain with seats in their shade and for the rest there seemed to be mostly roses and oleanders with other shrubs of a kind that made the greatest show of blossom and cost the least for tendance a wide terrace stretched across the rear of the palace dropping to the garden path by a flight of balustraded steps and upon this terrace opened the long windows of mrs vervains parlor and diningroom her landlord owned only the first story and the basement of the palace in some corner of which he cowered with his servants his taste for pictures and bricàbrac and his little branch of inquiry into venetian history whatever it was ready to let himself or anything he had for hire at a moments notice but very pleasant gentle and unobtrusive a cheat and a liar but of a kind heart and sympathetic manners under his protection mrs vervain set up her impermanent household gods the apartment was taken only from week to week and as she freely explained to the padrone hovering about with offers of service she knew herself too well ever to unpack anything that would not spoil by remaining packed she made her trunks yield all the appliances necessary for an invalids comfort and then left them in a state to be strapped and transported to the station within half a day after the desire of change or the exigencies of her feeble health caused her going everything for housekeeping was furnished with the rooms there was a gondolier and a sort of house servant in the employ of the landlord of whom mrs vervain hired them and she caressingly dismissed the padrone at an early moment after her arrival with the charge to find a maid for herself and daughter as if she had been waiting at the next door this maid appeared promptly and being venetian and in domestic service her name was of course nina mrs vervain now said to florida that everything was perfect and contentedly began her life in venice by telling mr ferris when he came in the evening that he could bring don ippolito the day after the morrow if he liked  she and florida sat on the terrace waiting for them on the morning named when ferris with the priest in his clerical best came up the garden path in the sunny light don ippolitos best was a little povertystricken he had faltered a while before leaving home over the sad choice between a shabby cylinder hat of obsolete fashion and his wellworn threecornered priestly beaver and had at last put on the latter with a sigh he had made his servant polish the buckles of his shoes and instead of a band of linen round his throat he wore a strip ot cloth covered with small white beads edged above and below with a single row of pale blue ones  as he mounted the steps with ferris mrs vervain came forward a little to meet them while florida rose and stood beside her chair in a sort of proud suspense and timidity the elder lady was in that black from which she had so seldom been able to escape but the daughter wore a dress of delicate green in which she seemed a part of the young season that everywhere clothed itself in the same tint the sunlight fell upon her blonde hair melting into its light gold her level brows frowned somewhat with the glance of scrutiny which she gave the dark young priest who was making his stately bow to her mother and trying to answer her english greetings in the same tongue  my daughter said mrs vervain and don ippolito made another low bow and then looked at the girl with a sort of frank and melancholy wonder as she turned and exchanged a few words with ferris who was assailing her seriousness and hauteur with unabashed levity of compliment a quick light flashed and fled in her cheek as she talked and the fringes of her serious asking eyes swept slowly up and down as she bent them upon him a moment before she broke abruptly not coquettishly away from him and moved towards her mother while ferris walked off to the other end of the terrace with a laugh mrs vervain and the priest were trying each other in french and not making great advance he explained to florida in italian and she answered him hesitatingly whereupon he praised her italian in set phrase  thank you said the girl sincerely i have tried to learn i hope she added as before you can make me see how little i know the deprecating wave of the hand with which don ippolito appealed to her from herself seemed arrested midway by his perception of some novel quality in her he said gravely that he should try to be of use and then the two stood silent  come mr ferris called out mrs vervain breakfast is ready and i want you to take me in  too much honor said the painter coming forward and offering his arm and mrs vervain led the way indoors  i suppose i ought to have taken don ippolitos arm she confided in undertone but the fact is our french is so unlike that we dont understand each other very well  oh returned ferris ive known italians and americans whom frenchmen themselves couldnt understand  you see its an american breakfast said mrs vervain with a critical glance at the table before she sat down all but hot bread that you cant have and don ippolito was for the first time in his life confronted by a breakfast of hot beefsteak eggs and toast fried potatoes and coffee with milk with a choice of tea he subdued all signs of the wonder he must have felt and beyond cutting his meat into little bits before eating it did nothing to betray his strangeness to the feast  the breakfast had passed off very pleasantly with occasional lapses we break down under the burden of so many languages said ferris it is an embarras de richesses let us fix upon a common maccheronic may i trouble you for a poco piú di sugar dans mon café mrs vervain what do you think of the bellazza de ce weather magnifique don ippolito  how ridiculous said mrs vervain in a tone of fond admiration aside to don ippolito who smiled but shrank from contributing to the new tongue  very well then said the painter i shall stick to my native bergamask for the future and don ippolito may translate for the foreign ladies  he ended by speaking english with everybody don ippolito eked out his speeches to mrs vervain in that tongue with a little french florida conscious of ferriss ironical observance used an embarrassed but defiant italian with the priest  im so pleased said mrs vervain rising when ferris said that he must go and florida shook hands with both guests  thank you mrs vervain i could have gone before if id thought you would have liked it answered the painter  oh nonsense now returned the lady you know what i mean im perfectly delighted with him she continued getting ferris to one side and i know he must have a good accent so very kind of you will you arrange with him about the paysuch a shame thanks then i neednt say anything to him about that im so glad i had him to breakfast the first day though florida thought not of course one neednt keep it up but seriously it isnt an ordinary case you know  ferris laughed at her with a sort of affectionate disrespect and said goodby don ippolito lingered for a while to talk over the proposed lessons and then went after more elaborate adieux mrs vervain remained thoughtful a moment before she said  that was rather droll florida  what mother  his cutting his meat into small bites before he began to eat but perhaps its the venetian custom at any rate my dear hes a gentleman in virtue of his profession and i couldnt do less than ask him to breakfast he has beautiful manners and if he must take snuff i suppose its neater to carry two handkerchiefs though it does look odd i wish he wouldnt take snuff  i dont see why we need care mother at any fate we cannot help it  thats true my dear and his nails now when theyre spread out on a book you know to keep it openwont it be unpleasant  they seem to have just such fingernails all over europeexcept in england  oh yes i know it i dare say we shouldnt care for it in him if he didnt seem so very nice otherwise how handsome he is     v   it was understood that don ippolito should come every morning at ten oclock and read and talk with miss vervain for an hour or two but mrs vervains hospitality was too aggressive for the letter of the agreement she oftener had him to breakfast at nine for as she explained to ferris she could not endure to have him feel that it was a mere mercenary transaction and there was no limit fixed for the lessons on these days when she could she had ferris come too and she missed him when he did not come i like that bluntness of his she professed to her daughter and i dont mind his making light of me you are so apt to be heavy if youre not made light of occasionally i certainly shouldnt want a son to be so respectful and obedient as you are my dear  the painter honestly returned her fondness and with not much greater reason he saw that she took pleasure in his talk and enjoyed it even when she did not understand it and this is a kind of flattery not easy to resist besides there was very little ladies society in venice in those times and ferris after trying the little he could get at had gladly denied himself its pleasures and consorted with the young men he met at the caffès or in the piazza but when the vervains came they recalled to him the younger days in which he had delighted in the companionship of women after so long disuse it was charming to be with a beautiful girl who neither regarded him with distrust nor expected him to ask her in marriage because he sat alone with her rode out with her in a gondola walked with her read with her all young men like a house in which no ado is made about their coming and going and mrs vervain perfectly understood the art of letting him make himself at home he perceived with amusement that this amiable lady who never did an ungraceful thing nor wittingly said an ungracious one was very much of a bohemian at heartthe gentlest and most blameless of the tribe but still lawlesswhether from her campaigning married life or the rovings of her widowhood or by natural disposition and that miss vervain was inclined to be conventionally strict but with her irregular training was at a loss for rules by which to check her mothers little waywardnesses her anxious perplexity at times together with her heroic obedience and unswerving loyalty to her mother had something pathetic as well as amusing in it he saw her tried almost to tears by her mothers helpless franknessfor mrs vervain was apparently one of those ladies whom the intolerable surprise of having anything come into their heads causes instantly to say or do itand he observed that she never tried to pass off her endurance with any feminine arts but seemed to defy him to think what he would of it perhaps she was not able to do otherwise he thought of her at times as a person wholly abandoned to the truth her pride was on the alert against him she may have imagined that he was covertly smiling at her and she no doubt tasted the ironical flavor of much of his talk and behavior for in those days he liked to qualify his devotion to the vervains with a certain nonchalant slight which while the mother openly enjoyed it filled the daughter with anger and apprehension quite at random she visited points of his informal manner with unmeasured reprisal others for which he might have blamed himself she passed over with strange caprice sometimes this attitude of hers provoked him and sometimes it disarmed him but whether they were at feud or keeping an armed truce or as now and then happened were in an entente cordiale which he found very charming the thing that he always contrived to treat with silent respect and forbearance in miss vervain was that sort of aggressive tenderness with which she hastened to shield the foibles of her mother that was something very good in her pride he finally decided at the same time he did not pretend to understand the curious filial selfsacrifice which it involved  another thing in her that puzzled him was her devoutness mrs vervain could with difficulty be got to church but her daughter missed no service of the english ritual in the old palace where the british and american tourists assembled once a week with their guidebooks in one pocket and their prayerbooks in the other and buried the tomahawk under the altar mr ferris was often sent with her and then his thoughts which were a young mans wandered from the service to the beautiful girl at his sidethe golden head that punctiliously bowed itself at the proper places in the liturgy the full lips that murmured the responses the silken lashes that swept her pale cheeks as she perused the morning lesson he knew that the vervains were not episcopalians when at home for mrs vervain had told him so and that florida went to the english service because there was no other he conjectured that perhaps her touch of ritualism came from mere love of any form she could make sure of  the servants in mrs vervains lightly ordered household with the sympathetic quickness of the italians learned to use him as the next friend of the family and though they may have had their decorous surprise at his untrammeled footing they probably excused the whole relation as a phase of that foreign eccentricity to which their nation is so amiable if they were not able to cast the same mantle of charity over don ippolitos allegianceand doubtless they had their reserves concerning such frankly familiar treatment of so dubious a character as prieststill as a priest they stood somewhat in awe of him they had the spontaneous loyalty of their race to the people they served and they never intimated by a look that they found it strange when don ippolito freely came and went mrs vervain had quite adopted him into her family while her daughter seemed more at ease with him than with ferris and treated him with a grave politeness which had something also of compassion and of childlike reverence in it ferris observed that she was always particularly careful of his supposable sensibilities as a roman catholic and that the priest was oddly indifferent to this deference as if it would have mattered very little to him whether his church was spared or not he had a way of lightly avoiding ferris fancied not only religious points on which they could disagree but all phases of religion as matters of indifference at such times miss vervain relaxed her reverential attitude and used him with something like rebuke as if it did not please her to have the representative of even an alien religion slight his office as if her respect were for his priesthood and her compassion for him personally that was rather hard for don ippolito ferris thought and waited to see him snubbed outright some day when he should behave without sufficient gravity  the blossoms came and went upon the pomegranate and almond trees in the garden and some of the earliest roses were in their prime everywhere was so full leaf that the wantonest of the strutting nymphs was forced into a sort of decent seclusion but the careless naiad of the fountain burnt in sunlight that subtly increased its fervors day by day and it was no longer beginning to be warm it was warm when one morning ferris and miss vervain sat on the steps of the terrace waiting for don ippolito to join them at breakfast  by this time the painter was well on with the picture of don ippolito which the first sight of the priest had given him a longing to paint and he had been just now talking of it with miss vervain  but why do you paint him simply as a priest she asked i should think you would want to make him the centre of some famous or romantic scene she added gravely looking into his eyes as he sat with his head thrown back against the balustrade  no i doubt if you think answered ferris or youd see that a venetian priest doesnt need any tawdry accessories what do you want somebody administering the extreme unction to a victim of the council of ten a priest stepping into a confessional at the frari tomb of canova in the distance perspective of one of the naves and so forthwith his eye on a pretty devotee coming up to unburden her conscience ive no patience with the follies people think and say about venice  florida stared in haughty question at the painter  youre no worse than the rest he continued with indifference to her anger at his bluntness you all think that there can be no picture of venice without a gondola or a bridge of sighs in it have you ever read the merchant of venice or othello there isnt a boat nor a bridge nor a canal mentioned in either of them and yet they breathe and pulsate with the very life of venice im going to try to paint a venetian priest so that youll know him without a bit of conventional venice near him  it was shakespeare who wrote those plays said florida ferris bowed in mock suffering from her sarcasm youd better have some sort of symbol in your picture of a venetian priest or people will wonder why you came so far to paint father obrien  i dont say i shall succeed ferris answered in fact ive made one failure already and im pretty well on with a second but the principle is right all the same i dont expect everybody to see the difference between don ippolito and father obrien at any rate what im going to paint at is the lingering pagan in the man the renunciation first of the inherited nature and then of a personality that would have enjoyed the world i want to show that baffled aspiration apathetic despair and rebellious longing which you caten in his face when hes off his guard and that suppressed look which is the characteristic expression of all austrian venice then said ferris laughing t must work in that small suspicion of jesuit which there is in every priest but its quite possible i may make a father obrien of him  you wont make a don ippolito of him said florida after serious consideration of his face to see whether he was quite in earnest if you put all that into him he has the simplest and openest look in the world she added warmly and theres neither pagan nor martyr nor rebel in it  ferris laughed again excuse me i dont think you know i can convince you  florida rose and looking down the garden path said hes coming and as don ippolito drew near his face lighting up with a joyous and innocent smile she continued absently hes got on new stockings and a different coat and hat  the stockings were indeed new and the hat was not the accustomed nicchio but a new silk cylinder with a very worldly curling brim don ippolitos coat also was of a more mundane cut than the talare he wore a waistcoat and smallclothes meeting the stockings at the knee with a sprightly buckle his person showed no traces of the snuff with which it used to be so plentifully dusted in fact he no longer took snuff in the presence of the ladies the first week he had noted an inexplicable uneasiness in them when he drew forth that blue cotton handkerchief after the solace of a pinch shortly afterwards being alone with florida he saw her give a nervous start at its appearance he blushed violently and put it back into the pocket from which he had half drawn it and whence it never emerged again in her presence the contessina his former pupil had not shown any aversion to don ippolitos snuff or his blue handkerchief but then the contessina had never rebuked his fingernails by the tints of rose and ivory with which miss vervains hands bewildered him it was a little droll how anxiously he studied the ways of these americans and conformed to them as far as he knew his english grew rapidly in their society and it happened sometimes that the only italian in the days lesson was what he read with florida for she always yielded to her mothers wish to talk and mrs vervain preferred the ease of her native tongue he was americanizing in that good ladys hands as fast as she could transform him and he listened to her with trustful reverence as to a woman of striking though eccentric mind yet he seemed finally to refer every point to florida as if with an intuition of steadier and stronger character in her and now as he ascended the terrace steps in his modified costume he looked intently at her she swept him from head to foot with a glance and then gravely welcomed him with unchanged countenance  at the same moment mrs vervain came out through one of the long windows and adjusting her glasses said with a start why my dear don ippolito i shouldnt have known you  indeed madama asked the priestwith a painful smile is it so great a change we can wear this dress as well as the other if we please  why of course its very becoming and all that but it does look so out of character mrs vervain said leading the way to the breakfast room its like seeing a military man in a civil coat  it must be a great relief to lay aside the uniform now and then mother said florida as they sat down i can remember that papa used to be glad to get out of his  perfectly wild assented mrs vervain but he never seemed the same person soldiers andclergymenare so much more stylish in their own dressnot stylish exactly but taking dont you know  there don ippolito interposed ferris you had better put on your talare and your nicchio again your abbates dress isnt acceptable you see  the painter spoke in italian but don ippolito answeredwith certain blunders which it would be tedious to reproducein his patient conscientious english half sadly half playfully and glancing at florida before he turned to mrs vervain you are as rigid as the rest of the world madama i thought you would like this dress but it seems that you think it a masquerade as madamigella says it is a relief to lay aside the uniform now and then for us who fight the spiritual enemies as well as for the other soldiers there was one time when i was younger and in the subdiaconate orders that i put off the priests dress altogether and wore citizens clothes not an abbates suit like this we were in padua another young priest and i my nearest and only friend and for a whole night we walked about the streets in that dress meeting the students as they strolled singing through the moonlight we went to the theatre and to the caffèwe smoked cigars all the time laughing and trembling to think of the tonsure under our hats but in the morning we had to put on the stockings and the talare and the nicchio again  don ippolito gave a melancholy laugh he had thrust the corner of his napkin into his collar seeing that ferris had not his so he twitched it out and made a feint of its having been all the time in his lap every one was silent as if something shocking had been said florida looked with grave rebuke at don ippolito whose story affected ferris like that of some girls adventure in mens clothes he was in terror lest mrs vervain should be going to say it was like that she was going to say something he made haste to forestall her and turn the talk on other things  the next day the priest came in his usual dress and he did not again try to escape from it     vi   one afternoon as don ippolito was posing to perris for his picture of a venetian priest the painter asked to make talk have you hit upon that new explosive yet which is to utilize your breechloading cannon or are you engaged upon something altogether new  no answered the other uneasily i have not touched the cannon since that day you saw it at my house and as for other things i have not been able to put my mind to them i have made a few trifles which i have ventured to offer the ladies  ferris had noticed the ingenious readingdesk which don ippolito had presented to florida and the footstool contrived with springs and hinges so that it would fold up into the compass of an ordinary portfolio which mrs vervain carried about with her  an odd look which the painter caught at and missed came into the priests face as he resumed i suppose it is the distraction of my new occupation and of the new acquaintancesso very strange to me in every waythat i have made in your amiable countrywomen which hinders me from going about anything in earnest now that their munificence has enabled me to pursue my aims with greater advantages than ever before but this idle mood will pass and in the mean time i am very happy they are real angels and madama is a true original  mrs vervain is rather peculiar said the painter retiring a few paces from his picture and quizzing it through his halfclosed eyes she is a woman who has had affliction enough to turn a stronger head than hers could ever have been he added kindly but she has the best heart in the world in fact he burst forth she is the most extraordinary combination of perfect fool and perfect lady i ever saw  excuse me i dont understand blankly faltered don ippolito  no and im afraid i couldnt explain to you answered ferris  there was a silence for a time broken at last by don ippolito who asked why do you not marry madamigella  he seemed not to feel that there was anything out of the way in the question and ferris was too well used to the childlike directness of the most maneuvering of races to be surprised yet he was displeased as he would not have been if don ippolito were not a priest he was not of the type of priests whom the american knew from the prejudice and distrust of the italians he was alienated from his clerical fellows by all the objects of his life and by a reciprocal dislike about other priests there were various scandals but don ippolito was like that pretty matchgirl of the piazza of whom it was venetianly answered when one asked if so sweet a face were not innocent oh yes she is mad he was of a purity so blameless that he was reputed crackbrained by the caffègossip that in venice turns its searching light upon whomever you mention and from his own association with the man ferris perceived in him an apparent singleheartedness such as no man can have but the rarest of italians he was the albino of his species a gray crow a white fly he was really this or he knew how to seem it with an art far beyond any common deceit it was the half expectation of coming sometime upon the lurking duplicity in don ippolito that continually enfeebled the painter in his attempts to portray his venetian priest and that gave its undecided unsatisfactory character to the picture before himits weak hardness its provoking superficiality he expressed the traits of melancholy and loss that he imagined in him yet he always was tempted to leave the picture with a touch of something sinister in it some airy and subtle shadow of selfish design  he stared hard at don ippolito while this perplexity filled his mind for the hundredth time then he said stiffly i dont know i dont want to marry anybody besides he added relaxing into a smile of helpless amusement its possible that miss vervain might not want to marry me  as to that replied don ippolito you never can tell all young girls desire to be married i suppose he continued with a sigh she is very beautiful is she not it is seldom that we see such a blonde in italy our blondes are dark they have auburn hair and blue eyes but their complexions are thick miss vervain is blonde as the morning light the suns gold is in her hair his noonday whiteness in her dazzling throat the flush of his coming is on her lips she might utter the dawn  youre a poet don ippolito laughed the painter what property of the sun is in her angrylooking eyes  his fire ah that is her greatest charm those strange eyes of hers they seem full of tragedies she looks made to be the heroine of some stormy romance and yet how simply patient and good she is  yes said ferris who often responded in english to the priests italian and he added half musingly in his own tongue after a moment but i dont think it would be safe to count upon her im afraid she has a bad temper at any rate i always expect to see smoke somewhere when i look at those eyes of hers she has wonderful selfcontrol however and i dont exactly understand why perhaps people of strong impulses have strong wills to overrule them it seems no more than fair  is it the custom asked don ippolito after a moment for the american young ladies always to address their mammas as mother  no that seems to be a peculiarity of miss vervains its a little formality that i should say served to hold mrs vervain in check  do you mean that it repulses her  not at all i dont think i could explain said ferris with a certain air of regretting to have gone so far in comment on the vervains he added recklessly dont you see that mrs vervain sometimes does and says things that embarrass her daughter and that miss vervain seems to try to restrain her  i thought returned don ippolito meditatively that the signorina was always very tenderly submissive to her mother  yes so she is said the painter dryly and looked in annoyance from the priest to the picture and from the picture to the priest  after a minute don ippolito said they must be very rich to live as they do  i dont know about that replied ferris americans spend and save in ways different from the italians i dare say the vervains find venice very cheap after london and paris and berlin  perhaps said don ippolito if they were rich you would be in a position to marry her  i should not marry miss vervain for her money answered the painter sharply  no but if you loved her the money would enable you to marry her  listen to me don ippolito i never said that i loved miss vervain and i dont know how you feel warranted in speaking to me about the matter why do you do so  i why i could not but imagine that you must love her is there anything wrong in speaking of such things is it contrary to the american custom i ask pardon from my heart if i have done anything amiss  there is no offense said the painter with a laugh and i dont wonder you thought i ought to be in love with miss vervain she is beautiful and i believe shes good but if men had to marry because women were beautiful and good there isnt one of us could live single a day besides im the victim of another passionim laboring under an unrequited affection for art  then you do not love her asked don ippolito eagerly  so far as im advised at present no i dont  it is strange said the priest absently but with a glowing face  he quitted the painters and walked swiftly homeward with a triumphant buoyancy of step a subtle content diffused itself over his face and a joyful light burnt in his deep eyes he sat down before the piano and organ as he had arranged them and began to strike their keys in unison this seemed to him for the first time childish then he played some lively bars on the piano alone they sounded too light and trivial and he turned to the other instrument as the plaint of the reeds arose it filled his sense like a solemn organmusic and transfigured the place the notes swelled to the ample vault of a church and at the high altar he was celebrating the mass in his sacerdotal robes he suddenly caught his fingers away from the keys his breast heaved he hid his face in his hands     vii   ferris stood cleaning his palette after don ippolito was gone scraping the colors together with his knife and neatly buttering them on the palettes edge while he wondered what the priest meant by pumping him in that way nothing he supposed and yet it was odd of course she had a bad temper  he put on his hat and coat and strolled vaguely forth and in an hour or two came by a roundabout course to the gondola station nearest his own house there he stopped and after an absent contemplation of the boats from which the gondoliers were clamoring for his custom he stepped into one and ordered the man to row him to a gate on a small canal opposite the gate opened at his ringing into the garden of the vervains  florida was sitting alone on a bench near the fountain it was no longer a ruined fountain the brokennosed naiad held a pipe above her head and from this rose a willowy spray high enough to catch some colors of the sunset then striking into the garden and fell again in a mist around her making her almost modest  what does this mean asked ferris carelessly taking the young girls hand i thought this ladys occupation was gone  don ippolito repaired the fountain for the landlord and he agreed to pay for filling the tank that feeds it said florida he seems to think it a hard bargain for he only lets it play about half an hour a day but he says its very ingeniously mended he didnt believe it could be done it is pretty  it is indeed said the painter with a singular desire going through him like a pang likewise to do something for miss vervain did you go to don ippolitos house the other day to see his traps  yes we were very much interested i was sorry that i knew so little about inventions do you think there are many practical ideas amongst his things i hope there arehe seemed so proud and pleased to show them shouldnt you think he had some real inventive talent  yes i think he has but i know as little about the matter as you do he sat down beside her and picking up a twig from the gravel pulled the bark off in silence then miss vervain he said knitting his brows as he always did when he had something on his conscience and meant to ease it at any cost im the dog that fetches a bone and carries a bone i talked don ippolito over with you the other day and now ive been talking you over with him but ive the grace to say that im ashamed of myself  why need you be ashamed asked florida you said no harm of him did you of us  not exactly but i dont think it was quite my business to discuss you at all i think you cant let people alone too much for my part if i try to characterize my friends i fail to do them perfect justice of course and yet the imperfect result remains representative of them in my mind it limits them and fixes them and i cant get them back again into the undefined and the ideal where they really belong one ought never to speak of the faults of ones friends it mutilates them they can never be the same afterwards  so you have been talking of my faults said florida breathing quickly perhaps you could tell me of them to my face  i should have to say that unfairness was one of them but that is common to the whole sex i never said i was talking of your faults i declared against doing so and you immediately infer that my motive is remorse i dont know that you have any faults they may be virtues in disguise there is a charm even in unfairness well i did bay that i thought you had a quick temper  florida colored violently  but now i see that i was mistaken said ferris with a laugh  may i ask what else you said demanded the young girl haughtily  oh that would be a betrayal of confidence said ferris unaffected by her hauteur  then why have you mentioned the matter to me at all  i wanted to clear my conscience i suppose and sin again i wanted to talk with you about don ippolito  florida looked with perplexity at ferriss face while her own slowly cooled and paled  what did you want to say of him she asked calmly  i hardly know how to put it that he puzzles me to begin with you know i feel somewhat responsible for him  yes  of course i never should have thought of him if it hadnt been for your mothers talk that morning coming back from san lazzaro  i know said florida with a faint blush  and yet dont you see it was as much a fancy of mine a weakness for the man himself as the desire to serve your mother that prompted me to bring him to you  yes i see answered the young girl  i acted in the teeth of a bitter venetian prejudice against priests all my friends heretheyre mostly young men with the modern italian ideas or old liberalshate and despise the priests they believe that priests are full of guile and deceit that they are spies for the austrians and altogether evil  don ippolito is welcome to report our most secret thoughts to the police said florida whose look of rising alarm relaxed into a smile  oh cried the painter how you leap to conclusions i never intimated that don ippolito was a spy on the contrary it was his difference from other priests that made me think of him for a moment he seems to be as much cut off from the church as from the world and yet he is a priest with a priests education what if i should have been altogether mistaken he is either one of the openest souls in the world as you have insisted or he is one of the closest  i should not be afraid of him in any case said florida but i cant believe any wrong of him  ferris frowned in annoyance i dont want you to i dont myself ive bungled the matter as i might have known i would i was trying to put into words an undefined uneasiness of mine a quite formless desire to have you possessed of the whole case as it had come up in my mind ive made a mess of it said ferris rising with a rueful air besides i ought to have spoken to mrs vervain  oh no cried florida eagerly springing to her feet beside him dont little things wear upon my mother so im glad you didnt speak to her i dont misunderstand you i think i expressed myself badly she added with an anxious face i thank you very much what do you want me to do  by ferriss impulse they both began to move down the garden path toward the watergate the sunset had faded out of the fountain but it still lit the whole heaven in whose vast blue depths hung light whiffs of pinkish cloud as ethereal as the draperies that floated after miss vervain as she walked with a splendid grace beside him no awkwardness now or selfconstraint in her as she turned to ferris and asked in her deep tones to which some latent feeling imparted a slight tremor what do you want me to do the sense of her willingness to be bidden by him gave him a delicious thrill he looked at the superb creature so proud so helpless so much a woman so much a child and he caught his breath before he answered her gauzes blew about his feet in the light breeze that lifted the foliage she was a little nearsighted and in her eagerness she drew closer to him fixing her eyes full upon his with a bold innocence good heavens miss vervain he cried with a sudden blush it isnt a serious matter im a fool to have spoken to you dont do anything let things go on as before it isnt for me to instruct you  i should have been very glad of your advice she said with a disappointed almost wounded manner keeping her eyes upon him it seems to me we are always going wrong  she stopped short with a flush and then a pallor  ferris returned her look with one of comical dismay this apparent readiness of miss vervains to be taken command of daunted him on second thoughts i wish youd dismiss all my stupid talk from your mind he said i feel as if id been guiltily trying to set you against a man whom i like very much and have no reason not to trust and who thinks me so much his friend that he couldnt dream of my making any sort of trouble for him it would break his heart im afraid if you treated him in a different way from that in which youve treated him till now its really touching to listen to his gratitude to you and your mother its only conceivable on the ground that he has never had friends before in the world he seems like another man or the same man come to life and it isnt his fault that hes a priest i suppose he added with a sort of final throe that a venetian family wouldnt use him with the frank hospitality youve shown not because they distrusted him at all perhaps but because they would be afraid of other venetian tongues  this ultimate drop of venom helplessly distilled did not seem to rankle in miss vervains mind she walked now with her face turned from his and she answered coldly we shall not be troubled we dont care for venetian tongues  they were at the gate goodby said ferris abruptly im going  wont you wait and see my mother asked florida with her awkward selfconstraint again upon her  no thanks said ferris gloomily i havent time i just dropped in for a moment to blast an innocent mans reputation and destroy a young ladys peace of mind  then you neednt go yet answered florida coldly for you havent succeeded  well ive done my worst returned ferris drawing the bolt  he went away hanging his head in amazement and disgust at himself for his clumsiness and bad taste it seemed to him a contemptible part first to embarrass them with don ippolitos acquaintance if it was an embarrassment and then try to sneak out of his responsibility by these tardy cautions and if it was not going to be an embarrassment it was folly to have approached the matter at all  what had he wanted to do and with what motive he hardly knew as he battled the ground over and over again nothing comforted him save the thought that bad as it was to have spoken to miss vervain it must have been infinitely worse to speak to her mother     viii   it was late before ferris forgot his chagrin in sleep and when he woke the next morning the sun was making the solid green blinds at his window odorous of their native pine woods with its heat and thrusting a golden spear at the heart of don ippolitos effigy where he had left it on the easel  marina brought a letter with his coffee the letter was from mrs vervain and it entreated him to come to lunch at twelve and then join them on an excursion of which they had all often talked up the canal of the brenta don ippolito has got his permissionthink of his not being able to go to the mainland without the patriarchs leave and can go with us today so i try to make this hasty arrangement you must comeit all depends upon you  yes so it seems groaned the painter and went  in the garden he found don ippolito and florida at the fountain where he had himself parted with her the evening before and he observed with a guilty relief that don ippolito was talking to her in the happy unconsciousness habitual with him  florida cast at the painter a swift glance of latent appeal and intelligence which he refused and in the same instant she met him with another look as if she now saw him for the first time and gave him her hand in greeting it was a beautiful hand he could not help worshipping its lovely forms and the lily whiteness and softness of the back the rose of the palm and fingertips  she idly resumed the great venetian fan which hung from her waist by a chain don ippolito has been talking about the vitteggiatura on the brenta in the old days she explained  oh yes said the painter they used to have merry times in the villas then and it was worth while being a priest or at least an abbate di casa i should think you would sigh for a return of those good old days don ippolito just imagine if you were abbate di casa with some patrician family about the close of the last century you might be the instructor companion and spiritual adviser of illustrissima at the theatres cardparties and masquerades all winter and at this season instead of going up the brenta for a days pleasure with us barbarous yankees you might be setting out with illustrissima and all the strissimi and strissime big and little for a spring villeggiatura there you would be going in a gilded barge with songs and fiddles and dancing instead of a common gondola and you would stay a month walking going to parties and caffès drinking chocolate and lemonade gaming sonneteering and butterflying about generally  it was doubtless a beautiful life answered the priest with simple indifference but i never have thought of it with regret because i have been preoccupied with other ideas than those of social pleasures though perhaps they were no wiser  florida had watched don ippolitos face while ferris was speaking and she now asked gravely but dont you think their life nowadays is more becoming to the clergy  why madamigella what harm was there in those gayeties i suppose the bad features of the old life are exaggerated to us  they couldnt have been worse than the amusements of the hard drinking hardriding hardswearing foxhunting english parsons about the same time said ferris besides the abbate di casa had a charm of his own the charm of all rococo things which whatever you may say of them are somehow elegant and refined or at least refer to elegance and refinement i dont say theyre ennobling but theyre fascinating i dont respect them but i love them when i think about the past of venice i dont care so much to see any of the heroically historical things but i should like immensely to have looked in at the ridotto when the place was at its gayest with wigs and masks hoops and smallclothes fans and rapiers bows and courtesies whispers and glances i dare say i should have found don ippolito there in some becoming disguise  florida looked from the painter to the priest and back to the painter as ferris spoke and then she turned a little anxiously toward the terrace and a shadow slipped from her face as her mother came rustling down the steps catching at her drapery and shaking it into place the young girl hurried to meet her lifted her arms for what promised an embrace and with firm hands set the elder ladys bonnet straight with her forehead  im always getting it on askew mrs vervain said for greeting to ferris how do you do don ippolito but i suppose you think ive kept you long enough to get it on straight for once so i have i am a fuss and i dont deny it at my time of life its much harder to make yourself shipshape than it is when youre younger i tell florida that anybody would take her for the old lady she does seem to give so little care to getting up an appearance  and yet she has the effect of a stylish young person in the bloom of youth observed ferris with a touch of caricature  we had better lunch with our things on said mrs vervain and then there neednt be any delay in starting i thought we would have it here she added as nina and the houseservant appeared with trays of dishes and cups so that we can start in a real picnicky spirit i knew youd think it a womanish lunch mr ferrisdon ippolito likes what we doand so ive provided you with a chicken salad and im going to ask you for a taste of it im really hungry  there was salad for all in fact and it was quite one oclock before the lunch was ended and wraps of just the right thickness and thinness were chosen and the party were comfortably placed under the striped linen canopy of the gondola which they had from a public station the housegondola being engaged that day they rowed through the narrow canal skirting the garden out into the expanse before the giudecca and then struck across the lagoon towards fusina past the islandchurch of san giorgio in alga whose beautiful tower has flushed and darkened in so many pictures of venetian sunsets and past the austrian lagoon forts with their coronets of guns threatening every point and the croatian sentinels pacing to and fro on their walls they stopped long enough at one of the customs barges to declare to the swarthy amiable officers the innocence of their freight and at the mouth of the canal of the brenta they paused before the station while a policeman came out and scanned them he bowed to don ippolitos cloth and then they began to push up the sluggish canal shallow and overrun with weeds and mosses into the heart of the land  the spring which in venice comes in the softening air and the perpetual azure of the heavens was renewed to their senses in all its miraculous loveliness the garden of the vervains had indeed confessed it in opulence of leaf and bloom but there it seemed somehow only like a novel effect of the artifice which had been able to create a garden in that city of stone and sea here a vernal world suddenly opened before them with widestretching fields of green under a dome of perfect blue against its walls only the soft curves of faroff hills were traced and near at hand the tender forms of fullfoliaged trees the long garland of vines that festoons all italy seemed to begin in the neighboring orchards the meadows waved their tall grasses in the sun and broke in poppies as the seawaves break in iridescent spray the wellgrown maize shook its gleaming blades in the light the poplars marched in stately procession on either side of the straight white road to padua till they vanished in the long perspective the blossoms had fallen from the trees many weeks before but the air was full of the vague sweetness of the perfect spring which here and there gathered and defined itself as the spicy odor of the grass cut on the shore of the canal and drying in the mellow heat of the sun  the voyagers spoke from time to time of some peculiarity of the villas that succeeded each other along the canal don ippolito knew a few of them the gondoliers knew others but after all their names were nothing these haunts of oldtime splendor and idleness weary of themselves and unable to escape are sadder than anything in venice and they belonged as far as the americans were concerned to a world as strange as any to which they should go in another lifethe world of a faded fashion and an alien history some of the villas were kept in a sort of repair some were even maintained in the state of old but the most showed marks of greater or less decay and here and there one was falling to ruin they had gardens about them tangled and wild grown a population of decrepit statues in the rococo taste strolled in their walks or simpered from their gates two or three houses seemed to be occupied the rest stood empty each    close latticed to the brooding heat   and silent in its dusty vines  the pleasureparty had no fixed plan for the day further than to ascend the canal and by and by take a carriage at some convenient village and drive to the famous villa pisani at strà  these houses are very well said don ippolito who had visited the villa once and with whom it had remained a memory almost as signal as that night in padua when he wore civil dress but it is at strà you see something really worthy of the royal splendor of the patricians of venice royal the villa is now one of the palaces of the exemperor of austria who does not find it less imperial than his other palaces don ippolito had celebrated the villa at strà in this strain ever since they had spoken of going up the brenta now it was the magnificent conservatories and orangeries that he sang now the vast garden with its statued walks between rows of clipt cedars and firs now the stables with their stalls for numberless horses now the palace itself with its frescoed halls and treasures of art and vertu his enthusiasm for the villa at strà had become an amiable jest with the americans ferris laughed at his fresh outburst he declared himself tired of the gondola and he asked florida to disembark with him and walk under the trees of a pleasant street running on one side between the villas and the canal we are going to find something much grander than the villa pisani he boasted with a look at don ippolito  as they sauntered along the path together they came now and then to a stately palace like that of the contarini where the lions that give their name to one branch of the family crouch in stone before the grand portal but most of the houses were interesting only from their unstoried possibilities to the imagination they were generally of stucco and glared with fresh whitewash through the foliage of their gardens when a peasants cottage broke their line it gave with its barns and strawstacks and its beds of potherbs a homely relief from the decaying gentility of the villas  what a pity miss vervain said the painter that the blessings of this world should be so unequally divided why should all this sketchable adversity be lavished upon the neighborhood of a city that is so rich as venice in picturesque dilapidation its pretty hard on us americans and forces people of sensibility into exile what wouldnt cultivated persons give for a stretch of this street in the suburbs of boston or of your own providence i suppose the new yorkers will be setting up something of the kind one of these days and giving it a french nametheyll call it aux bords du brenta there was one of them carried back a gondola the other day to put on a pond in their new park but the worst of it is you cant take home the sentiment of these things  i thought it was the business of painters to send home the sentiment of them in pictures said florida  ferris talked to her in this way because it was his way of talking it always surprised him a little that she entered into the spirit of it he was not quite sure that she did he sometimes thought she waited till she could seize upon a point to turn against him and so give herself the air of having comprehended the whole he laughed oh yes a poor little fragmentary fadedout reproduction of their sentiment which is as moonlight unto sunlight and as water unto wine when compared with the real thing suppose i made a picture of this very bit ourselves in the foreground looking at the garden over there where that amusing vandal of an owner has just had his statues painted white would our friends at home understand it a whole history must be left unexpressed i could only hint at an entire situation of course people with a taste for olives would get the flavor but even they would wonder that i chose such an unsuggestive bit why it is just the most maddeningly suggestive thing to be found here and if i may put it modestly for my share in it i think we two young americans looking on at this supreme excess of the rococo are the very essence of the sentiment of the scene but what would the honored connoisseursthe good folks who get themselves up on ruskin and try so honestly hard to have some little ideas about artmake of us to be sure they might justifiably praise the grace of your pose if i were so lucky as to catch it and your way of putting your hand under the elbow of the arm that holds your parasolflorida seemed disdainfully to keep her attitude and the painter smiledbut they wouldnt know what it all meant and couldnt imagine that we were inspired by this rascally little villa to sigh longingly over the wicked past  excuse me interrupted florida with a touch of trouble in her proud manner im not sighing over it for one and i dont want it back im glad that im american and that there is no past for me i cant understand how you and don ippolito can speak so tolerantly of what no one can respect she added in almost an aggrieved tone  if miss vervain wanted to turn the talk upon don ippolito ferris by no means did he had had enough of that subject yesterday he got as lightly away from it as he could  oh don ippolitos a pagan i tell you and im a painter and the rococo is my weakness i wish i could paint it but i cant im a hundred years too late i couldnt even paint myself in the act of sentimentalizing it  while he talked he had been making a few lines in a small pocket sketchbook with a furtive glance or two at florida when they returned to the boat he busied himself again with the book and presently he handed it to mrs vervain  why its florida cried the lady how very nicely you do sketch mr ferris  thanks mrs vervain youre always flattering me  no but seriously i wish that i had paid more attention to my drawing when i was a girl and now floridashe wont touch a pencil i wish youd talk to her mr ferris  oh people who are pictures neednt trouble themselves to be painters said ferris with a little burlesque  mrs vervain began to look at the sketch through her tubed hand the painter made a grimace but youve made her too proud mr ferris she doesnt look like that  yes she doesto those unworthy of her kindness i have taken miss vervain in the act of scorning the rococo and its humble admirer me with it  im sure i dont know what you mean mr ferris but i cant think that this proud look is habitual with florida and ive heard people sayvery good judgesthat an artist oughtnt to perpetuate a temporary expression something like that  it cant be helped now mrs vervain the sketch is irretrievably immortal im sorry but its too late  oh stuff as if you couldnt turn up the corners of the mouth a little or something  and give her the appearance of laughing at me never  don ippolito said mrs vervain turning to the priest who had been listening intently to all this trivial talk what do you think of this sketch  he took the book with an eager hand and perused the sketch as if trying to read some secret there after a minute he handed it back with a light sigh apparently of relief but said nothing  well asked mrs vervain  oh i ask pardon no it isnt my idea of madamigella it seems to me that her likeness must be sketched in color those lines are true but they need color to subdue them they go too far they are more than true  youre quite right don ippolito said ferris  then you dont think she always has this proud look pursued mrs vervain the painter fancied that florida quelled in herself a movement of impatience he looked at her with an amused smile  not always no answered don ippolito  sometimes her face expresses the greatest meekness in the world  but not at the present moment thought ferris fascinated by the stare of angry pride which the girl bent upon the unconscious priest  though i confess that i should hardly know how to characterize her habitual expression added don ippolito  thanks said florida peremptorily im tired of the subject it isnt an important one  oh yes it is my dear said mrs vervain at least its important to me if it isnt to you for im your mother and really if i thought you looked like this as a general thing to a casual observer i should consider it a reflection upon myself ferris gave a provoking laugh as she continued sweetly i must insist don ippolito now did you ever see florida look so  the girl leaned back and began to wave her fan slowly to and fro before her face  i never saw her look so with you dear madama said the priest with an anxious glance at florida who let her fan fall folded into her lap and sat still he went on with priestly smoothness and a touch of something like invoked authority such as a man might show who could dispense indulgences and inflict penances no one could help seeing her devotedness to you and i have admired from the first an obedience and tenderness that i have never known equaled in all her relations to you madamigella has seemed to me  florida started forward you are not asked to comment on my behavior to my mother you are not invited to speak of my conduct at all she burst out with sudden violence her visage flaming and her blue eyes burning upon don ippolito who shrank from the astonishing rudeness as from a blow in the face what is it to you how i treat my mother  she sank back again upon the cushions and opening the fan with a clash swept it swiftly before her  florida said her mother gravely  ferris turned away in cold disgust like one who has witnessed a cruelty done to some helpless thing don ippolitos speech was not fortunate at the best but it might have come from a foreigners misapprehension and at the worst it was goodnatured and wellmeant the girl is a perfect brute as i thought in the beginning the painter said to himself how could i have ever thought differently i shall have to tell don ippolito that im ashamed of her and disclaim all responsibility pah i wish i was out of this  the pleasure of the day was dead it could not rally from that stroke they went on to strà as they had planned but the glory of the villa pisani was eclipsed for don ippolito he plainly did not know what to do he did not address florida again whose savagery he would not probably have known how to resent if he had wished to resent it mrs vervain prattled away to him with unrelenting kindness ferris kept near him and with affectionate zeal tried to make him talk of the villa but neither the frescoes nor the orangeries nor the green houses nor the stables nor the gardens could rouse him from the listless daze in which he moved though ferris found them all as wonderful as he had said amidst this heavy embarrassment no one seemed at ease but the author of it she did not to be sure speak to don ippolito but she followed her mother as usual with her assiduous cares and she appeared tranquilly unconscious of the sarcastic civility with which ferris rendered her any service it was late in the afternoon when they got back to their boat and began to descend the canal towards venice and long before they reached fusina the day had passed a sunset of melancholy red streaked with level lines of murky cloud stretched across the flats behind them and faintly tinged with its reflected light the eastern horizon which the towers and domes of venice had not yet begun to break the twilight came and then through the overcast heavens the moon shone dim a light blossomed here and there in the villas distant voices called musically a cow lowed a dog barked the rich sweet breath of the vernal land mingled its odors with the sultry air of the neighboring lagoon the wayfarers spoke little the time hung heavy on all no doubt to ferris it was a burden almost intolerable to hear the creak of the oars and the breathing of the gondoliers keeping time together at last the boat stopped in front of the policestation in fusina a soldier with a sword at his side and a lantern in his hand came out and briefly parleyed with the gondoliers they stepped ashore and he marched them into the station before him  we have nothing left to wish for now said ferris breaking into an ironical laugh  what does it all mean asked mrs vervain  i think i had better go see  we will go with you said mrs vervain  pazienza replied ferris  the ladies rose but don ippolito remained seated arent you going too don ippolito asked mrs vervain  thanks madama but i prefer to stay here  lamentable cries and shrieks as if the prisoners had immediately been put to the torture came from the station as ferris opened the door a lamp of petroleum lighted the scene and shone upon the figures of two fishermen who bewailed themselves unintelligibly in the vibrant accents of chiozza and from time to time advanced upon the gondoliers and shook their heads and beat their breasts at them a few police guards reclined upon benches about the room and surveyed the spectacle with mild impassibility  ferris politely asked one of them the cause of the detention  why you see signore answered the guard amiably these honest men accuse your gondoliers of having stolen a rope out of their boat at dolo  it was my blood you know howled the elder of the fishermen tossing his arms wildly abroad it was my own heart he cried letting the last vowel die away and rise again in mournful refrain while he stared tragically into ferriss face  what is the matter asked mrs vervain putting up her glasses and trying with graceful futility to focus the melodrama  nothing said ferris our gondoliers have had the hearts blood of this respectable dervish that is to say they have stolen a rope belonging to him  our gondoliers i dont believe it theyve no right to keep us here all night tell them youre the american consul  id rather not try my dignity on these underlings mrs vervain theres no american squadron here that i could order to bombard fusina if they didnt mind me but ill see what i can do further in quality of courteous foreigner can you perhaps tell me how long you will be obliged to detain us here he asked of the guard again  i am very sorry to detain you at all signore but what can i do the commissary is unhappily absent he may be here soon  the guard renewed his apathetic contemplation of the gondoliers who did not speak a word the windy lamentation of the fishermen rose and fell fitfully presently they went out of doors and poured forth their wrongs to the moon  the room was close and with some trouble ferris persuaded mrs vervain to return to the gondola florida seconding his arguments with gentle good sense  it seemed a long time till the commissary came but his coming instantly simplified the situation perhaps because he had never been able to befriend a consul in trouble before he befriended ferris to the utmost he had met him with rather a browbeating air but after a glance at his card he gave a kind of roar of deprecation and apology he had the ladies and don ippolito in out of the gondola and led them to an upper chamber where he made them all repose their honored persons upon his sofas he ordered up his housekeeper to make them coffee which he served with his own hands excusing its hurried feebleness and he stood by rubbing his palms together and smiling while they refreshed themselves  they need never tell me again that the austrians are tyrants said mrs vervain in undertone to the consul  it was not easy for ferris to remind his host of the malefactors but he brought himself to this ungraciousness the commissary begged pardon and asked him to accompany him below where he confronted the accused and the accusers the tragedy was acted over again with blood curdling effectiveness by the chiozzotti the gondoliers maintaining the calm of conscious innocence  ferris felt outraged by the trumpedup charge against them  listen you others the prisoners said the commissary your padrone is anxious to return to venice and i wish to inflict no further displeasures upon him restore their rope to these honest men and go about your business  the injured gondoliers spoke in low tones together then one of them shrugged his shoulders and went out he came back in a moment and laid a rope before the commissary  is that the rope he asked we found it floating down the canal and picked it up that we might give it to the rightful owner but now i wish to heaven we had let it sink to the bottom of the sea  oh a beautiful story wailed the chiozzoti they flung themselves upon the rope and lugged it off to their boat and the gondoliers went out too  the commissary turned to ferris with an amiable smile i am sorry that those rogues should escape said the american  oh said the italian they are poor fellows it is a little matter i am glad to have served you  he took leave of his involuntary guests with effusion following them with a lantern to the gondola  mrs vervain to whom ferris gave an account of this trial as they set out again on their longhindered return had no mind save for the magical effect of his consular quality upon the commissary and accused him of a vain and culpable modesty  ah said the diplomatist theres nothing like knowing just when to produce your dignity there are some officials who know too little like those guards and there are some who know too muchlike the commissarys superiors but he is just in that golden mean of ignorance where he supposes a consul is a person of importance  mrs vervain disputed this and ferris submitted in silence presently as they skirted the shore to get their bearings for the route across the lagoon a fierce voice in venetian shouted from the darkness indrio indrio back back and a gleam of the moon through the pale watery clouds revealed the figure of a gendarme on the nearest point of land the gondoliers bent to their oars and sent the boat swiftly out into the lagoon  there for example is a person who would be quite insensible to my greatness even if i had the consular seal in my pocket to him we are possible smugglers footnote under the austrians venice was a free port but everything carried there to the mainland was liable to duty and i must say he continued taking out his watch and staring hard at it that if i were a disinterested person and heard his suspicion met with the explanation that we were a little party out here for pleasure at half past twelve p m i should say he was right at any rate we wont engage him in controversy quick quick he added to the gondoliers glancing at the receding shore and then at the first of the lagoon forts which they were approaching a dim shape moved along the top of the wall and seemed to linger and scrutinize them as they drew nearer the challenge wer da rang out  the gondoliers eagerly answered with the one word of german known to their craft freunde and struggled to urge the boat forward the oar of the gondolier in front slipped from the high rowlock and fell out of his hand into the water the gondola lurched and then suddenly ran aground on the shallow the sentry halted dropped his gun from his shoulder and ordered them to go on while the gondoliers clamored back in the high key of fear and one of them screamed out to his passengers to do something saying that a few weeks before a sentinel had fired upon a fisherman and killed him  whats that hes talking about demanded mrs vervain if we dont get on it will be that mans duty to fire on us he has no choice she said nerved and interested by the presence of this danger  the gondoliers leaped into the water and tried to push the boat off it would not move and without warning don ippolito who had sat silent since they left fusina stepped over the side of the gondola and thrusting an oar under its bottom lifted it free of the shallow  oh how very unnecessary cried mrs vervain as the priest and the gondoliers clambered back into the boat he will take his death of cold  its ridiculous said ferris you ought to have told these worthless rascals what to do don ippolito youve got yourself wet for nothing its too bad  its nothing said don ippolito taking his seat on the little prow deck and quietly dripping where the water would not incommode the others  oh here cried mrs vervain gathering some shawls together make him wrap those about him hell die i know he willwith that reeking skirt of his if you must go into the water i wish you had worn your abbates dress how could you don ippolito  the gondoliers set their oars but before they had given a stroke they were arrested by a sharp halt from the fort another figure had joined the sentry and stood looking at them  well said ferris now what i wonder thats an officer if i had a little german about me i might state the situation to him  he felt a light touch on his arm i can speak german said florida timidly  then you had better speak it now said ferris  she rose to her feet and in a steady voice briefly explained the whole affair the figures listened motionless then the last comer politely replied begging her to be in no uneasiness made her a shadowy salute and vanished the sentry resumed his walk and took no further notice of them  brava said ferris while mrs vervain babbled her satisfaction i will buy a german ollendorff tomorrow the language is indispensable to a pleasure excursion in the lagoon  florida made no reply but devoted herself to restoring her mother to that state of defense against the discomforts of the time and place which the common agitation had impaired she seemed to have no sense of the presence of any one else don ippolito did not speak again save to protect himself from the anxieties and reproaches of mrs vervain renewed and reiterated at intervals she drowsed after a while and whenever she woke she thought they had just touched her own landing by fits it was cloudy and moonlight they began to meet peasants boats going to the rialto market at last they entered the canal of the zattere then they slipped into a narrow way and presently stopped at mrs vervains gate this time she had not expected it don ippolito gave her his hand and entered the garden with her while ferris lingered behind with florida helping her put together the wraps strewn about the gondola  wait she commanded as they moved up the garden walk i want to speak with you about don ippolito what shall i do to him for my rudeness you must tell meyou shall she said in a fierce whisper gripping the arm which ferris had given to help her up the landingstairs you areolder than i am  thanks i was afraid you were going to say wiser i should think your own sense of justice your own sense of  decency say it say it cried the girl passionately it was indecent indecentthat was it  would tell you what to do concluded the painter dryly  she flung away the arm to which she had been clinging and ran to where the priest stood with her mother at the foot of the terrace stairs don ippolito she cried i want to tell you that i am sorry i want to ask your pardonhow can you ever forgive mefor what i said  she instinctively stretched her hand towards him  oh said the priest with an indescribable long trembling sigh he caught her hand in his held it tight and then pressed it for an instant against his breast  ferris made a little start forward  now thats right florida said her mother as the four stood in the pale estranging moonlight im sure don ippolito cant cherish any resentment if he does he must come in and wash it out with a glass of winethats a good old fashion i want you to have the wine at any rate don ippolito itll keep you from taking cold you really must  thanks madama i cannot lose more time now i must go home at once good night  before mrs vervain could frame a protest or lay hold of him he bowed and hurried out of the landgate  how perfectly absurd for him to get into the water in that way she said looking mechanically in the direction in which he had vanished  well mrs vervain it isnt best to be too grateful to people said ferris but i think we must allow that if we were in any danger sticking there in the mud don ippolito got us out of it by putting his shoulder to the oar  of course assented mrs vervain  in fact continued ferris i suppose we may say that under providence we probably owe our lives to don ippolitos selfsacrifice and miss vervains knowledge of german at any rate its what i shall always maintain  mother dont you think you had better go in asked florida gently her gentleness ignored the presence the existence of ferris im afraid you will be sick after all this fatigue  there mrs vervain itll be no use offering me a glass of wine im sent away you see said ferris and miss vervain is quite right good night  ohgood night mr ferris said mrs vervain giving her hand thank you so much  florida did not look towards him she gathered her mothers shawl about her shoulders for the twentieth time that day and softly urged her in doors while ferris let himself out into the campo     ix   florida began to prepare the bed for her mothers lying down  what are you doing that for my dear asked mrs vervain i cant go to bed at once  but mother  no florida and i mean it you are too headstrong i should think you would see yourself how you suffer in the end by giving way to your violent temper what a day you have made for us  i was very wrong murmured the proud girl meekly  and then the mortification of an apology you might have spared yourself that  it didnt mortify me i didnt care for it  no i really believe you are too haughty to mind humbling yourself and don ippolito had been so uniformly kind to us i begin to believe that mr ferris caught your true character in that sketch but your pride will be broken some day florida  wont you let me help you undress mother you can talk to me while youre undressing you must try to get some rest  yes i am all unstrung why couldnt you have let him come in and talk awhile it would have been the best way to get me quieted down but no you must always have your own way dont twitch me my dear id rather undress myself you pretend to be very careful of me i wonder if you really care for me  oh mother you are all i have in the world  mrs vervain began to whimper you talk as if i were any better off have i anybody besides you and i have lost so many  dont think of those things now mother  mrs vervain tenderly kissed the young girl you are good to your mother don ippolito was right no one ever saw you offer me disrespect or unkindness there there dont cry my darling i think i had better lie down and ill let you undress me  she suffered herself to be helped into bed and florida went softly about the room putting it in order and drawing the curtains closer to keep out the near dawn her mother talked a little while and presently fell from incoherence to silence and so to sleep  florida looked hesitatingly at her for a moment and then set her candle on the floor and sank wearily into an armchair beside the bed her hands fell into her lap her head drooped sadly forward the light flung the shadow of her face grotesquely exaggerated and foreshortened upon the ceiling  by and by a bird piped in the garden the shriek of a swallow made itself heard from a distance the vernal day was beginning to stir from the light brief drowse of the vernal night a crown of angry red formed upon the candle wick which toppled over in the socket and guttered out with a sharp hiss  florida started from her chair a streak of sunshine pierced shutter and curtain her mother was supporting herself on one elbow in the bed and looking at her as if she had just called to her  mother did you speak asked the girl  mrs vervain turned her face away she sighed deeply stretched her thin hands on the pillow and seemed to be sinking sinking down through the bed she ceased to breathe and lay in a dead faint  florida felt rather than saw it all she did not cry out nor call for help she brought water and cologne and bathed her mothers face and then chafed her hands mrs vervain slowly revived she opened her eyes then closed them she did not speak but after a while she began to fetch her breath with the long and even respirations of sleep  florida noiselessly opened the door and met the servant with a tray of coffee she put her finger to her lip and motioned her not to enter asking in a whisper what time is it nina i forgot to wind my watch  its nine oclock signorina and i thought you would be tired this morning and would like your coffee in bed oh misericordia cried the girl still in whisper with a glance through the doorway you havent been in bed at all  my mother doesnt seem well i sat down beside her and fell asleep in my chair without knowing it  ah poor little thing then you must drink your coffee at once it refreshes  yes yes said florida closing the door and pointing to a table in the next room put it down here i will serve myself nina go call the gondola please i am going out at once and i want you to go with me tell checa to come here and stay with my mother till i come back  she poured out a cup of coffee with a trembling hand and hastily drank it then bathing her eyes she went to the glass and bestowed a touch or two upon yesterdays toilet studied the effect a moment and turned away she ran back for another look and the next moment she was walking down to the watergate where she found nina waiting her in the gondola  a rapid course brought them to ferriss landing ring she said to the gondolier and say that one of the american ladies wishes to see the consul  ferris was standing on the balcony over her where he had been watching her approach in mute wonder why miss vervain he called down what in the world is the matter  i dont know i want to see you said florida looking up with a wistful face  ill come down  yes please or no i had better come up yes nina and i will come up  ferris met them at the lower door and led them to his apartment nina sat down in the outer room and florida followed the painter into his studio though her face was so wan it seemed to him that he had never seen it lovelier and he had a strange pride in her being there though the disorder of the place ought to have humbled him she looked over it with a certain childlike timid curiosity and something of that lofty compassion with which young ladies regard the haunts of men when they come into them by chance in doing this she had a haughty slow turn of the head that fascinated him  i hope he said you dont mind the smell which was a mingled one of oilcolors and tobaccosmoke the womans putting my office to rights and its all in a cloud of dust so i have to bring you in here  florida sat down on a chair fronting the easel and found herself looking into the sad eyes of don ippolito ferris brusquely turned the back of the canvas toward her i didnt mean you to see that it isnt ready to show yet he said and then he stood expectantly before her he waited for her to speak for he never knew how to take miss vervain he was willing enough to make light of her grand moods but now she was too evidently unhappy for mocking at the same time he did not care to invoke a snub by a prematurely sympathetic demeanor his mind ran on the events of the day before and he thought this visit probably related somehow to don ippolito but his visitor did not speak and at last he said i hope theres nothing wrong at home miss vervain its rather odd to have yesterday last night and next morning all run together as they have been for me in the last twentyfour hours i trust mrs vervain is turning the whole thing into a good solid oblivion  its aboutits abouti came to see yousaid florida hoarsely i mean she hurried on to say that i want to ask you who is the best doctor here  then it was not about don ippolito is your mother sick asked ferris eagerly she must have been fearfully tired by that unlucky expedition of ours i hope theres nothing serious  no no but she is not well she is very frail you know you must have noticed how frail she is said florida tremulously  ferris had noticed that all his countrywomen past their girlhood seemed to be sick he did not know how or why he supposed it was all right it was so common in mrs vervains case though she talked a great deal about her illhealth he had noticed it rather less than usual she had so great spirit he recalled now that he had thought her at times rather a shadowy presence and that occasionally it had amused him that so slight a structure should hang together as it didnot only successfully but triumphantly  he said yes he knew that mrs vervain was not strong and florida continued its only advice that i want for her but i think we had better see some oneor know some one that we could go to in need we are so far from any one we know or help of any kind she seemed to be trying to account to herself rather than to ferris for what she was doing we mustnt let anything pass unnoticed she looked at him entreatingly but a shadow as of some wounding memory passed over her face and she said no more  ill go with you to a doctors said ferris kindly  no please i wont trouble you  its no trouble  i dont want you to go with me please id rather go alone ferris looked at her perplexedly as she rose just give me the address and i shall manage best by myself im used to doing it  as you like wait a moment ferris wrote the address there he said giving it to her but isnt there anything i can do for you  yes answered florida with awkward hesitation and a halfdefiant halfimploring look at him you must have all sorts of people applying to you as a consul and you look after their affairsand try to forget them  well said ferris  i wish you wouldnt remember that ive asked this favor of you that youd consider it a  consular service with all my heart answered ferris thinking for the third or fourth time how very young miss vervain was  you are very good you are kinder than i have any right said florida smiling piteously i only mean dont speak of it to my mother not she added but what i want her to know everything i do but it would worry her if she thought i was anxious about her oh i wish i wouldnt  she began a hasty search for her handkerchief he saw her lips tremble and his soul trembled with them  in another moment goodmorning she said briskly with a sort of airy sob i dont want you to come down please  she drifted out of the room and down the stairs the servantmaid falling into her wake  ferris filled his pipe and went out on his balcony again and stood watching the gondola in its course toward the address he had given and smoking thoughtfully it was really the same girl who had given poor don ippolito that cruel slap in the face yesterday but that seemed no more out of reason than her sudden generous exaggerated remorse both were of a piece with her coming to him for help now holding him at a distance flinging herself upon his sympathy and then trying to snub him and breaking down in the effort it was all of a piece and the piece was bad yes she had an ugly temper and yet she had magnanimous traits too these contradictions which in his reverie he felt rather than formulated made him smile as he stood on his balcony bathed by the morning air and sunlight in fresh strong ignorance of the whole mystery of womens nerves these caprices even charmed him he reflected that he had gone on doing the vervains one favor after another in spite of floridas childish petulancies and he resolved that he would not stop now her whims should be nothing to him as they had been nothing hitherto it is flattering to a man to be indispensable to a woman so long as he is not obliged to it miss vervains dependent relation to himself in this visit gave her a grace in ferriss eyes which she had wanted before  in the mean time he saw her gondola stop turn round and come back to the canal that bordered the vervain garden  another change of mind thought ferris complacently and rising superior to the whole fitful sex he released himself from uneasiness on mrs vervains account but in the evening he went to ask after her he first sent his card to florida having written on it i hope mrs vervain is better dont let me come in if its any disturbance he looked for a moment at what he had written dimly conscious that it was patronizing and when he entered he saw that miss vervain stood on the defensive and from some willfulness meant to make him feel that he was presumptuous in coming it did not comfort him to consider that she was very young mother will be in directly said florida in a tone that relegated their mornings interview to the age of fable  mrs vervain came in smiling and cordial apparently better and not worse for yesterdays misadventures  oh i pick up quickly she explained im an old campaigner you know perhaps a little too old now years do make a difference and youll find it out as you get on mr ferris  i suppose so said ferris not caring to have mrs vervain treat him so much like a boy even at twentysix i found it pleasant to take a nap this afternoon how does one stand it at seventeen miss vervain he asked  i havent felt the need of sleep replied florida indifferently and he felt shelved as an old fellow  he had an empty frivolous visit to his thinking mrs vervain asked if he had seen don ippolito and wondered that the priest had not come about al day she told a long story and at the end tapped herself on the mouth with her fan to punish a yawn  ferris rose to go mrs vervain wondered again in the same words why don ippolito had not been near them all day  because hes a wise man said ferris with bitterness and knows when to time his visits mrs vervain did not notice his bitterness but something made florida follow him to the outer door  why its moonlight she exclaimed and she glanced at him as though she had some purpose of atonement in her mind  but he would not have it yes theres a moon he said moodily goodnight  good night answered florida and she impulsively offered him her hand he thought that it shook in his but it was probably the agitation of his own nerves  a soreness that had been lifted from his heart came back he walked home disappointed and defeated he hardly knew why or in what he did not laugh now to think how she had asked him that morning to forget her coming to him for help he was outraged that he should have been repaid in this sort and the rebuff with which his sympathy had just been met was vulgar there was no other name for it but vulgarity yet he could not relate this quality to the face of the young girl as he constantly beheld it in his homeward walk it did not defy him or repulse him it looked up at him wistfully as from the gondola that morning nevertheless he hardened his heart the vervains should see him next when they had sent for him after all one is not so very old at twentysix     x   don ippolito has come signorina said nina the next morning approaching florida where she sat in an attitude of listless patience in the garden  don ippolito echoed the young girl in a weary tone she rose and went into the house and they met with the constraint which was but too natural after the events of their last parting it is hard to tell which has most to overcome in such a case the forgiver or the forgiven pardon rankles even in a generous soul and the memory of having pardoned embarrasses the sensitive spirit before the object of its clemency humbling and making it ashamed it would be well i suppose if there need be nothing of the kind between human creatures who cannot sustain such a relation without mutual distrust it is not so ill with them when apart but when they meet they must be cold and shy at first  now i see what you two are thinking about said mrs vervain and a faint blush tinged the cheek of the priest as she thus paired him off with her daughter you are thinking about what happened the other day and you had better forget it there is no use brooding over these matters dear me if i had stopped to brood over every little unpleasant thing that happened i wonder where i should be now by the way where were you all day yesterday don ippolito  i did not come to disturb you because i thought you must be very tired besides i was quite busy  oh yes those inventions of yours i think you are so ingenious but you mustnt apply too closely now really yesterday after all you had been through it was too much for the brain she tapped herself on the forehead with her fan  i was not busy with my inventions madama answered don ippolito who sat in the womanish attitude priests get from their drapery and fingered the cord round his threecornered hat i have scarcely touched them of late but our parish takes part in the procession of corpus domini in the piazza and i had my share of the preparations  oh to be sure when is it to be we must all go our nina has been telling florida of the grand sightslittle children dressed up like john the baptist leading lambs i suppose its a great event with you  the priest shrugged his shoulders and opened both his hands so that his hat slid to the floor bumping and tumbling some distance away he recovered it and sat down again its an observance he said coldly  and shall you be in the procession  i shall be there with the other priests of my parish  delightful cried mrs vervain we shall be looking out for you i shall feel greatly honored to think i actually know some one in the procession im going to give you a little nod you wont think it very wrong  she saved him from the embarrassment he might have felt in replying by an abrupt lapse from all apparent interest in the subject she turned to her daughter and said with a querulous accent i wish you would throw the afghan over my feet florida and make me a little comfortable before you begin your reading this morning at the same time she feebly disposed herself among the sofa cushions on which she reclined and waited for some final touches from her daughter then she said im just going to close my eyes but i shall hear every word you are getting a beautiful accent my dear i know you are i should think goldoni must have a very smooth agreeable style hasnt he now in italian  they began to read the comedy after fifteen or twenty minutes mrs vervain opened her eyes and said but before you commence florida i wish youd play a little to get me quieted down i feel so very flighty i suppose its this sirocco and i believe ill lie down in the next room  florida followed her to repeat the arrangements for her comfort then she returned and sitting down at the piano struck with a sort of soft firmness a few low soothing chords out of which a lulling melody grew with her fingers still resting on the keys she turned her stately head and glanced through the open door at her mother  don ippolito she asked softly is there anything in the air of venice that makes people very drowsy  i have never heard that madamigella  i wonder continued the young girl absently why my mother wants to sleep so much  perhaps she has not recovered from the fatigues of the other night suggested the priest  perhaps said florida sadly looking toward her mothers door  she turned again to the instrument and let her fingers wander over the keys with a drooping head presently she lifted her face and smoothed back from her temples some straggling tendrils of hair without looking at the priest she asked with the childlike bluntness that characterized her why dont you like to walk in the procession of corpus domini  don ippolitos color came and went and he answered evasively i have not said that i did not like to do so  no that is true said florida letting her fingers drop again on the keys  don ippolito rose from the sofa where he had been sitting beside her while they read and walked the length of the room then he came towards her and said meekly madamigella i did not mean to repel any interest you feel in me but it was a strange question to ask a priest as i remembered i was when you asked it  dont you always remember that demanded the girl still without turning her head  no sometimes i am suffered to forget it he said with a tentative accent  she did not respond and he drew a long breath and walked away in silence she let her hands fall into her lap and sat in an attitude of expectation as don ippolito came near her again he paused a second time  it is in this house that i forget my priesthood he began and it is the first of your kindnesses that you suffer me to do so your good mother there and you how shall i repay you it cut me to the heart that you should ask forgiveness of me when you did though i was hurt by your rebuke oh had you not the right to rebuke me if i abused the delicate unreserve with which you had always treated me but believe me i meant no wrong then  his voice shook and florida broke in you did nothing wrong it was i who was cruel for no cause  no no you shall not say that he returned and why should i have cared for a few words when all your acts had expressed a trust of me that is like heaven to my soul  she turned now and looked at him and he went on ah i see you do not understand how could you know what it is to be a priest in this most unhappy city to be haunted by the strict espionage of all your own class to be shunned as a spy by all who are not of it but you two have not put up that barrier which everywhere shuts me out from my kind you have been willing to see the man in me and to let me forget the priest  i do not know what to say to you don ippolito i am only a foreigner a girl and i am very ignorant of these things said florida with a slight alarm i am afraid that you may be saying what you will be sorry for  oh never do not fear for me if i am frank with you it is my refuge from despair  the passionate vibration of his voice increased as if it must break in tears she glanced towards the other room with a little movement or stir  ah you neednt be afraid of listening to me cried the priest bitterly  i will not wake her said florida calmly after an instant  see how you speak the thing you mean always always always you could not deny that you meant to wake her for you have the lifelong habit of the truth do you know what it is to have the lifelong habit of a lie it is to be a priest do you know what it is to seem to say to do the thing you are not think not will not to leave what you believe unspoken what you will undone what you are unknown it is to be a priest  don ippolito spoke in italian and he uttered these words in a voice carefully guarded from every listener but the one before his face do you know what it is when such a moment as this comes and you would fling away the whole fabric of falsehood that has clothed your lifedo you know what it is to keep still so much of it as will help you to unmask silently and secretly it is to be a priest  his voice had lost its vehemence and his manner was strangely subdued and cold the sort of gentle apathy it expressed together with a certain sad impersonal surprise at the difference between his own and the happier fortune with which he contrasted it was more touching than any tragic demonstration  as if she felt the fascination of the pathos which she could not fully analyze the young girl sat silent after a time in which she seemed to be trying to think it all out she asked in a low deep murmur why did you become a priest then  it is a long story said don ippolito i will not trouble you with it now some other time  no now answered florida in english if you hate so to be a priest i cant understand why you should have allowed yourself to become one we should be very unhappy if we could not respect younot trust you as we have done and how could we if we knew you were not true to yourself in being what you are  madamigella said the priest i never dared believe that i was in the smallest thing necessary to your happiness is it true then that you care for my being rather this than that that you are in the least grieved by any wrong of mine  i scarcely know what you mean how could we help being grieved by what you have said to me  thanks but why do you care whether a priest of my church loves his calling or notyou a protestant it is that you are sorry for me as an unhappy man is it not  yes it is that and more i am no catholic but we are both christians  don ippolito gave the faintest movement of his shoulders  and i cannot endure to think of your doing the things you must do as a priest and yet hating to be a priest it is terrible  are all the priests of your faith devotees  they cannot be but are none of yours so  oh god forbid that i should say that i have known real saints among them that friend of mine in padua of whom i once told you became such and died an angel fit for paradise and i suppose that my poor uncle is a saint too in his way  your uncle a priest you have never mentioned him to us  no said don ippolito after a certain pause he began abruptly we are of the people my family and in each generation we have sought to honor our blood by devoting one of the race to the church when i was a child i used to divert myself by making little figures out of wood and pasteboard and i drew rude copies of the pictures i saw at church we lived in the house where i live now and where i was born and my mother let me play in the small chamber where i now have my forge it was anciently the oratory of the noble family that occupied the whole palace i contrived an altar at one end of it i stuck my pictures about the walls and i ranged the puppets in the order of worshippers on the floor then i played at saying mass and preached to them all day long  my mother was a widow she used to watch me with tears in her eyes at last one day she brought my uncle to see me i remember it all far better than yesterday is it not the will of god she asked my uncle called me to him and asked me whether i should like to be a priest in good earnest when i grew up shall i then be able to make as many little figures as i like and to paint pictures and carve an altar like that in your church i demanded my uncle answered that i should have real men and women to preach to as he had and would not that be much finer in my heart i did not think so for i did not care for that part of it i only liked to preach to my puppets because i had made them but said oh yes as children do i kept on contriving the toys that i played with and i grew used to hearing it told among my mates and about the neighborhood that i was to be a priest i cannot remember any other talk with my mother and i do not know how or when it was decided whenever i thought of the matter i thought that will be very well the priests have very little to do and they gain a great deal of money with their masses and i shall be able to make whatever i like i only considered the office then as a means to gratify the passion that has always filled my soul for inventions and works of mechanical skill and ingenuity my inclination was purely secular but i was as inevitably becoming a priest as if i had been born to be one  but you were not forced there was no pressure upon you  no there was merely an absence so far as they were concerned of any other idea i think they meant justly and assuredly they meant kindly by me i grew in years and the time came when i was to begin my studies it was my uncles influence that placed me in the seminary of the salute and there i repaid his care by the utmost diligence but it was not the theological studies that i loved it was the mathematics and their practical application and among the classics i loved best the poets and the historians yes i can see that i was always a mundane spirit and some of those in charge of me at once divined it i think they used to take us to walkyou have seen the little creatures in their priests gowns which they put on when they enter the school with a couple of young priests at the head of the file and once for an uncommon pleasure they took us to the arsenal and let us see the shipyards and the museum you know the wonderful things that are there the flags and the guns captured from the turks the strange weapons of all devices the famous suits of armor i came back halfcrazed i wept that i must leave the place but i set to work the best i could to carve out in wood an invention which the model of one of the antique galleys had suggested to me they found itnothing can be concealed outside of your own breast in such a schooland they carried me with my contrivance before the superior he looked kindly but gravely at me my son said he do you wish to be a priest surely reverend father i answered in alarm why not because these things are not for priests their thoughts must be upon other things consider well of it my son while there is yet time he said and he addressed me a long and serious discourse upon the life on which i was to enter he was a just and conscientious and affectionate man but every word fell like burning fire in my heart at the end he took my poor plaything and thrust it down among the coals of his scaldino it made the scaldino smoke and he bade me carry it out with me and so turned again to his book  my mother was by this time dead but i could hardly have gone to her if she had still been living these things are not for priests kept repeating itself night and day in my brain i was in despair i was in a fury to see my uncle i poured out my heart to him and tried to make him understand the illusions and vain hopes in which i had lived he received coldly my sorrow and the reproaches which i did not spare him he bade me consider my inclinations as so many temptations to be overcome for the good of my soul and the glory of god he warned me against the scandal of attempting to withdraw now from the path marked out for me i said that i never would be a priest and what will you do he asked alas what could i do i went back to my prison and in due course i became a priest  it was not without sufficient warning that i took one order after another but my uncles words what will you do made me deaf to these admonitions all that is now past i no longer resent nor hate i seem to have lost the power but those were days when my soul was filled with bitterness something of this must have showed itself to those who had me in their charge i have heard that at one time my superiors had grave doubts whether i ought to be allowed to take orders my examination in which the difficulties of the sacerdotal life were brought before me with the greatest clearness was severe i do not know how i passed it it must have been in grace to my uncle i spent the next ten days in a convent to meditate upon the step i was about to take poor helpless friendless wretch madamigella even yet i cannot see how i was to blame that i came forth and received the first of the holy orders and in their time the second and the third  i was a priest but no more a priest at heart than those venetian conscripts whom you saw carried away last week are austrian soldiers i was bound as they are bound by an inexorable and inevitable law  you have asked me why i became a priest perhaps i have not told you why but i have told you howi have given you the slight outward events not the processes of my mindand that is all that i can do if the guilt was mine i have suffered for it if it was not mine still i have suffered for it some ban seems to have rested upon whatever i have attempted my workoh i know it well enoughhas all been cursed with futility my labors are miserable failures or contemptible successes i have had my unselfish dreams of blessing mankind by some great discovery or invention but my life has been barren barren barren and save for the kindness that i have known in this house and that would not let me despair it would now be without hope  he ceased and the girl who had listened with her proud looks transfigured to an aspect of grieving pity fetched a long sigh oh i am sorry for you she said more sorry than i know how to tell but you must not lose courage you must not give up  don ippolito resumed with a melancholy smile there are doubtless temptations enough to be false under the best of conditions in this world but somethingi do not know what or whom perhaps no more my uncle or my mother than i for they were only as the past had made themcaused me to begin by living a lie do you not see  yes yes reluctantly assented the girl  perhapswho knowsthat is why no good has come of me nor can come my uncles piety and repute have always been my efficient help he is the principal priest of the church to which i am attached and he has had infinite patience with me my ambition and my attempted inventions are a scandal to him for he is a priest of those like the holy father who believe that all the wickedness of the modern world has come from the devices of science my indifference to the things of religion is a terror and a sorrow to him which he combats with prayers and penances he starves himself and goes cold and faint that god may have mercy and turn my heart to the things on which his own is fixed he loves my soul but not me and we are scarcely friends  florida continued to look at him with steadfast compassionate eyes it seems very strange almost like some dream she murmured that you should be saying all this to me don ippolito and i do not know why i should have asked you anything  the pity of this virginal heart must have been very sweet to the man on whom she looked it his eyes worshipped her as he answered her devoutly it was due to the truth in you that i should seem to you what i am  indeed you make me ashamed she cried with a blush it was selfish of me to ask you to speak and now after what you have told me i am so helpless and i know so very little that i dont understand how to comfort or encourage you but surely you can somehow help yourself are men that seem so strong and able just as powerless as women after all when it comes to real trouble is a man  i cannot answer i am only a priest said don ippolito coldly letting his eyes drop to the gown that fell about him like a womans skirt  yes but a priest should be a man and so much more a priest  don ippolito shrugged his shoulders  no no cried the girl your own schemes have all failed you say then why do you not think of becoming a priest in reality and getting the good there must be in such a calling it is singular that i should venture to say such a thing to you and it must seem presumptuous and ridiculous for me a protestantbut our ways are so different she paused coloring deeply then controlled herself and added with grave composure if you were to pray  to what madamigella asked the priest sadly  to what she echoed opening her eyes full upon him to god  don ippolito made no answer he let his head fall so low upon his breast that she could see the sacerdotal tonsure  you must excuse me she said blushing again i did not mean to wound your feelings as a catholic i have been very bold and intrusive i ought to have remembered that people of your church have different ideasthat the saints  don ippolito looked up with pensive irony  oh the poor saints  i dont understand you said florida very gravely  i mean that i believe in the saints as little as you do  but you believe in your church  i have no church  there was a silence in which don ippolito again dropped his head upon his breast florida leaned forward in her eagerness and murmured you believe in god  the priest lifted his eyes and looked at her beseechingly i do not know he whispered she met his gaze with one of dumb bewilderment at last she said sometimes you baptize little children and receive them into the church in the name of god  yes  poor creatures come to you and confess their sins and you absolve them or order them to do penances  yes  and sometimes when people are dying you must stand by their death beds and give them the last consolations of religion  it is true  oh moaned the girl and fixed on don ippolito a long look of wonder and reproach which he met with eyes of silent anguish  it is terrible madamigella he said rising i know it i would fain have lived singleheartedly for i think i was made so but now you see how black and deadly a lie my life is it is worse than you could have imagined is it not it is worse than the life of the cruelest bigot for he at least believes in himself  worse far worse  but at least dear young lady he went on piteously believe me that i have the grace to abhor myself it is not much it is very very little but it is something do not wholly condemn me  condemn oh i am sorry for you with my whole heart only why must you tell me all this no no you are not to blame i made you speak i made you put yourself to shame  not that dearest madamigella i would unsay nothing now if i could unless to take away the pain i have given you it has been more a relief than a shame to have all this known to you and even if you should despise me  i dont despise you that isnt for me but oh i wish that i could help you  don ippolito shook his head you cannot help me but i thank you for your compassion i shall never forget it he lingered irresolutely with his hat in his hand shall we go on with the reading madamigella  no we will not read any more today she answered  then i relieve you of the disturbance madamigella he said and after a moments hesitation he bowed sadly and went  she mechanically followed him to the door with some little gestures and movements of a desire to keep him from going yet let him go and so turned back and sat down with her hands resting noiseless on the keys of the piano     xi   the next morning don ippolito did not come but in the afternoon the postman brought a letter for mrs vervain couched in the priests english begging her indulgence until after the day of corpus christi up to which time he said he should be too occupied for his visits of ordinary  this letter reminded mrs vervain that they had not seen mr ferris for three days and she sent to ask him to dinner but he returned an excuse and he was not to be had to breakfast the next morning for the asking he was in open rebellion mrs vervain had herself rowed to the consular landing and sent up her gondolier with another invitation to dinner  the painter appeared on the balcony in the linen blouse which he wore at his work and looked down with a frown on the smiling face of mrs vervain for a moment without speaking then ill come he said gloomily  come with me then returned mrs vervain  i shall have to keep you waiting  i dont mind that youll be ready in five minutes  florida met the painter with such gentleness that he felt his resentment to have been a stupid caprice for which there was no ground in the world he tried to recall his fading sense of outrage but he found nothing in his mind but penitence the sort of distraught humility with which she behaved gave her a novel fascination  the dinner was good as mrs vervains dinners always were and there was a compliment to the painter in the presence of a favorite dish when he saw this well mrs vervain what is it he asked you neednt pretend that youre treating me so well for nothing you want something  we want nothing but that you should not neglect your friends we have been utterly deserted for three or four days don ippolito has not been here either but he has some excuse he has to get ready for corpus christi hes going to be in the procession  is he to appear with his flying machine or his portable diningtable or his automatic camera  for shame cried mrs vervain beaming reproach floridas face clouded and ferris made haste to say that he did not know these inventions were sacred and that he had no wish to blaspheme them  you know well enough what i meant answered mrs vervain and now we want you to get us a window to look out on the procession  oh thats what you want is it i thought you merely wanted me not to neglect my friends  well do you call that neglecting them  mrs vervain mrs vervain what a mind you have is there anything else you want me to go with you for example  we dont insist you can take us to the window and leave us if you like  this clemency is indeed unexpected replied ferris im really quite unworthy of it  he was going on with the badinage customary between mrs vervain and himself when florida protested  mother i think we abuse mr ferriss kindness  i know it my deari know it cheerfully assented mrs vervain its perfectly shocking but what are we to do we must abuse somebodys kindness  we had better stay at home id much rather not go said the girl tremulously  why miss vervain said ferris gravely im very sorry if youve misunderstood my joking ive never yet seen the procession to advantage and id like very much to look on with you  he could not tell whether she was grateful for his words or annoyed she resolutely said no more but her mother took up the strain and discoursed long upon it arranging all the particulars of their meeting and going together ferris was a little piqued and began to wonder why miss vervain did not stay at home if she did not want to go to be sure she went everywhere with her mother but it was strange with her habitual violent submissiveness that she should have said anything in opposition to her mothers wish or purpose  after dinner mrs vervain frankly withdrew for her nap and florida seemed to make a little haste to take some sewing in her hand and sat down with the air of a woman willing to detain her visitor ferris was not such a stoic as not to be dimly flattered by this but he was too much of a man to be fully aware how great an advance it might seem  i suppose we shall see most of the priests of venice and what they are like in the procession tomorrow she said do you remember speaking to me about priests the other day mr ferris  yes i remember it very well i think i overdid it and i couldnt perceive afterwards that i had shown any motive but a desire to make trouble for don ippolito  i never thought that answered florida seriously what you said was true wasnt it  yes it was and it wasnt and i dont know that it differed from anything else in the world in that respect it is true that there is a great distrust of the priests amongst the italians the young men hate themor think they door say they do most educated men in middle life are materialists and of course unfriendly to the priests there are even women who are skeptical about religion but i suspect that the largest number of all those who talk loudest against the priests are really subject to them you must consider how very intimately they are bound up with every family in the most solemn relations of life  do you think the priests are generally bad men asked the young girl shyly  i dont indeed i dont see how things could hang together if it were so there must be a great basis of sincerity and goodness in them when all is said and done it seems to me that at the worst theyre merely professional peoplepoor fellows who have gone into the church for a living you know it isnt often now that the sons of noble families take orders the priests are mostly of humble origin not that theyre necessarily the worse for that the patricians used to be just as bad in another way  i wonder said florida with her head on one side considering her seam why there is always something so dreadful to us in the idea of a priest  they do seem a kind of alien creature to us protestants i cant make out whether they seem so to catholics or not but we have a repugnance to all doomed people havent we and a priest is a man under sentence of death to the natural ties between himself and the human race he is dead to us that makes him dreadful the spectre of our dearest friend father or mother would be terrible and yet added ferris musingly a nun isnt terrible  no answered the girl thats because a womans life even in the world seems to be a constant giving up no a nun isnt unnatural but a priest is  she was silent for a time in which she sewed swiftly then she suddenly dropped her work into her lap and pressing it down with both hands she asked do you believe that priests themselves are ever skeptical about religion  i suppose it must happen now and then in the best days of the church it was a fashion to doubt you know ive often wanted to ask our friend don ippolito something about these matters but i didnt see how it could be managed ferris did not note the change that passed over floridas face and he continued our acquaintance hasnt become so intimate as i hoped it might but you only get to a certain point with italians they like to meet you on the street maybe they havent any indoors  yes it must sometimes happen as you say replied florida with a quick sigh reverting to the beginning of ferriss answer but is it any worse for a false priest than for a hypocritical minister  its bad enough for either but its worse for the priest you see miss vervain a minister doesnt set up for so much he doesnt pretend to forgive us our sins and he doesnt ask us to confess them he doesnt offer us the veritable body and blood in the sacrament and he doesnt bear allegiance to the visible and tangible vicegerent of christ upon earth a hypocritical parson may be absurd but a skeptical priest is tragical  yes oh yes i see murmured the girl with a grieving face are they always to blame for it they must be induced sometimes to enter the church before theyve seriously thought about it and then dont know how to escape from the path that has been marked out for them from their childhood should you think such a priest as that was to blame for being a skeptic she asked very earnestly  no said ferris with a smile at her seriousness i should think such a skeptic as that was to blame for being a priest  shouldnt you be very sorry for him pursued florida still more solemnly  i should indeed if i liked him if i didnt im afraid i shouldnt said ferris but he saw that his levity jarred upon her come miss vervain youre not going to look at those fat monks and sleek priests in the procession tomorrow as so many incorporate tragedies are you youll spoil my pleasure if you do i dare say theyll be all of them devout believers accepting everything down to the animalcula in the holy water  if you were that kind of a priest persisted the girl without heeding his jests what should you do  upon my word i dont know i cant imagine it why he continued think what a helpless creature a priest is in everything but his priesthoodmore helpless than a woman even the only thing he could do would be to leave the church and how could he do that hes in the world but he isnt of it and i dont see what he could do with it or it with him if an italian priest were to leave the church even the liberals who distrust him now would despise him still more do you know that they have a pleasant fashion of calling the protestant converts apostates the first thing for such a priest would be exile but im not supposably the kind of priest you mean and i dont think just such a priest supposable i dare say if a priest found himself drifting into doubt hed try to avoid the disagreeable subject and if he couldnt hed philosophize it some way and wouldnt let his skepticism worry him  then you mean that they havent consciences like us  they have consciences but not like us the italians are kinder people than we are but theyre not so just and i should say that they dont think truth the chief good of life they believe there are pleasanter and better things perhaps theyre right  no no you dont believe that you know you dont said florida anxiously and you havent answered my question  oh yes i have ive told you it wasnt a supposable case  but suppose it was  well if i must answered ferris with a laugh with my unfortunate bringing up i couldnt say less than that such a man ought to get out of his priesthood at any hazard he should cease to be a priest if it cost him kindred friends good fame country everything i dont see how there can be any living in such a lie though i know there is in all reason it ought to eat the soul out of a man and leave him helpless to do or be any sort of good but there seems to be something i dont know what it is that is above all reason of ours something that saves each of us for good in spite of the bad thats in us its very good practice for a man who wants to be modest to come and live in a latin country he learns to suspect his own topping virtues and to be lenient to the novel combinations of right and wrong that he sees but as for our insupposable priestyes i should say decidedly he ought to get out of it by all means  florida fell back in her chair with an aspect of such relief as comes to one from confirmation on an important point she passed her hand over the sewing in her lap but did not speak  ferris went on with a doubting look at her for he had been shy of introducing don ippolitos name since the day on the brenta and he did not know what effect a recurrence to him in this talk might have ive often wondered if our own clerical friend were not a little shaky in his faith i dont think nature meant him for a priest he always strikes me as an extremely secularminded person i doubt if hes ever put the question whether he is what he professes to be squarely to himselfhes such a mere dreamer  florida changed her posture slightly and looked down at her sewing she asked but shouldnt you abhor him if he were a skeptical priest  ferris shrugged his shoulders oh i dont find it such an easy matter to abhor people it would be interesting he continued musingly to have such a dreamer waked up once and suddenly confronted with what he recognized as perfect truthfulness and couldnt help contrasting himself with but it would be a little cruel  would you rather have him left as he was asked florida lifting her eyes to his  as a moralist no as a humanitarian yes miss vervain hed be much happier as he was  what time ought we to be ready for you tomorrow demanded the girl in a tone of decision  we ought to be in the piazza by nine oclock said ferris carelessly accepting the change of subject and he told her of his plan for seeing the procession from a window of the old procuratie  when he rose to go he said lightly perhaps after all we may see the type of tragical priest weve been talking about who can tell i say his nose will be red  perhaps answered florida with unheeding gravity     xii   the day was one of those which can come to the world only in early june at venice the heaven was without a cloud but a blue haze made mystery of the horizon where the lagoon and sky met unseen the breath of the sea bathed in freshness the city at whose feet her tides sparkled and slept  the great square of st mark was transformed from a mart from a salon to a temple the shops under the colonnades that inclose it upon three sides were shut the caffès before which the circles of idle coffeedrinkers and sherbeteaters ordinarily spread out into the piazza were repressed to the limits of their own doors the stands of the watervenders the baskets of those that sold oranges of palermo and black cherries of padua had vanished from the base of the church of st mark which with its dim splendor of mosaics and its carven luxury of pillar and arch and finial rose like the highaltar ineffably rich and beautiful of the vaster temple whose inclosure it completed before it stood the three great red flagstaffs like painted tapers before an altar and from them hung the austrian flags of red and white and yellow and black   in the middle of the square stood the austrian military band motionless encircling their leader with his goldheaded staff uplifted during the night a light colonnade of wood roofed with blue cloth had been put up around the inside of the piazza and under this now paused the long pomp of the ecclesiastical processionthe priests of all the venetian churches in their richest vestments followed in their order by facchini in white sandals and gay robes with caps of scarlet white green and blue who bore huge painted candles and silken banners displaying the symbol or the portrait of the titular saints of the several churches and supported the canopies under which the host of each was elevated before the clergy went a company of austrian soldiers and behind the facchini came a long array of religious societies charityschool boys in uniforms old paupers in holiday dress little naked urchins with shepherds crooks and bits of fleece about their loins like john the baptist in the wilderness little girls with angels wings and crowns the monks of the various orders and civilian penitents of all sorts in cloaks or dresscoats hooded or bareheaded and carrying each a lighted taper the corridors under the imperial palace and the new and old procuratie were packed with spectators from every window up and down the fronts of the palaces gay stuffs were flung the startled doves of st mark perched upon the cornices or fluttered uneasily to and fro above the crowd the baton of the band leader descended with a crash of martial music the priests chanted the charityboys sang shrill a vast noise of shuffling feet arose mixed with the foliagelike rustling of the sheets of tinsel attached to the banners and candles in the procession the whole strange gorgeous picture came to life  after all her plans and preparations mrs vervain had not felt well enough that morning to come to the spectacle which she had counted so much upon seeing but she had therefore insisted the more that her daughter should go and ferris now stood with florida alone at a window in the old procuratie  well what do you think miss vervain he asked when their senses had somewhat accustomed themselves to the noise of the procession do you say now that venice is too gloomy a city to have ever had any possibility of gayety in her  i never said that answered florida opening her eyes upon him  neither did i returned ferris but ive often thought it and im not sure now but im right theres something extremely melancholy to me in all this i dont care so much for what one may call the deplorable superstition expressed in the spectacle but the mere splendid sight and the music are enough to make one shed tears i dont know anything more affecting except a procession of lanternlit gondolas and barges on the grand canal its phantasmal its the spectral resurrection of the old dead forms into the present its not even the ghost its the corpse of other ages thats haunting venice the city ought to have been destroyed by napoleon when he destroyed the republic and thrown overboardst mark winged lion bucentaur and all there is no land like america for true cheerfulness and light heartedness think of our fourth of julys and our state fairs selah  ferris looked into the girls serious face with twinkling eyes he liked to embarrass her gravity with his antic speeches and enjoyed her endeavors to find an earnest meaning in them and her evident trouble when she could find none  im curious to know how our friend will look he began again as he arranged the cushion on the windowsill for floridas greater comfort in watching the spectacle but it wont be an easy matter to pick him out in this masquerade i fancy candlecarrying as well as the other acts of devotion seems rather out of character with don ippolito and i cant imagine his putting much soul into it however very few of the clergy appear to do that look at those holy men with their eyes to the wind they are wondering who is the bella bionda at the window here  florida listened to his persiflage with an air of sad distraction she was intent upon the procession as it approached from the other side of the piazza and she replied at random to his comments on the different bodies that formed it  its very hard to decide which are my favorites he continued surveying the long column through an operaglass my religious disadvantages have been such that i dont care much for priests or monks or young john the baptists or small female cherubim but i do like little charityboys with voices of pins and needles and hair cut à la deadrabbit i should like if it were consistent with the consular dignity to go down and rub their heads im fond also of old charityboys i find those paupers make one in love with destitute and dependent age by their aspect of irresponsible enjoyment see how briskly each of them topples along on the leg that he hasnt got in the grave how attractive likewise are the civilian devotees in those imperishable dresscoats of theirs observe their high collars of the era of the holy alliance they and their fathers and their grandfathers before them have worn those dresscoats in a hundred years from now their posterity will keep holiday in them i should like to know the elixir by which the dresscoats of civil employees render themselves immortal those penitents in the cloaks and cowls are not bad either miss vervain come they add a very pretty touch of mystery to this spectacle theyre the sort of thing that painters are expected to paint in venicethat people sigh over as so peculiarly venetian if youve a single sentiment about you miss vervain now is the time to produce it  but i havent im afraid i have no sentiment at all answered the girl ruefully but this makes me dreadfully sad  why thats just what i was saying a while ago excuse me miss vervain but your sadness lacks novelty its a sort of plagiarism  dont please she pleaded yet more earnestly i was just thinking i dont know why such an awful thought should come to methat it might all be a mistake after all perhaps there might not be any other world and every bit of this power and display of the churchour church as well as the restmight be only a cruel blunder a dreadful mistake perhaps there isnt even any god do you think there is  i dont think it said ferris gravely i know it but i dont wonder that this sight makes you doubt great god how far it is from christ look there at those troops who go before the followers of the lamb their trade is murder in a minute if a dozen men called out long live the king of italy it would be the duty of those soldiers to fire into the helpless crowd look at the silken and gilded pomp of the servants of the carpenters son look at those miserable monks voluntary prisoners beggars aliens to their kind look at those penitents who think that they can get forgiveness for their sins by carrying a candle round the square and it is nearly two thousand years since the world turned christian it is pretty slow but i suppose god lets men learn him from their own experience of evil i imagine the kingdom of heaven is a sort of republic and that god draws men to him only through their perfect freedom  yes yes it must be so answered florida staring down on the crowd with unseeing eyes but i cant fix my mind on it i keep thinking the whole time of what we were talking about yesterday i never could have dreamed of a priests disbelieving but now i cant dream of anything else it seems to me that none of these priests or monks can believe anything their faces look false and sly and badall of them  no no miss vervain said ferris smiling at her despair you push matters a little beyondas a woman has a right to do of course i dont think their faces are bad by any means some of them are dull and torpid and some are frivolous just like the faces of other people but ive been noticing the number of good kind friendly faces and theyre in the majority just as they are amongst other people for there are very few souls altogether out of drawing in my opinion ive even caught sight of some faces in which there was a real rapture of devotion and now and then a very innocent one here for instance is a man i should like to bet on if hed only look up  the priest whom ferris indicated was slowly advancing toward the space immediately under their window he was dressed in robes of high ceremony and in his hand he carried a lighted taper he moved with a gentle tread and the droop of his slender figure intimated a sort of despairing weariness while most of his fellows stared carelessly or curiously about them his face was downcast and averted  suddenly the procession paused and a hush fell upon the vast assembly then the silence was broken by the rustle and stir of all those thousands going down upon their knees as the cardinalpatriarch lifted his hands to bless them  the priest upon whom ferris and florida had fixed their eyes faltered a moment and before he knelt his next neighbor had to pluck him by the skirt then he too knelt hastily mechanically lifting his head and glancing along the front of the old procuratie his face had that weariness in it which his figure and movement had suggested and it was very pale but it was yet more singular for the troubled innocence which its traits expressed  there whispered ferris thats what i call an uncommonly good face  florida raised her hand to silence him and the heavy gaze of the priest rested on them coldly at first then a light of recognition shot into his eyes and a flush suffused his pallid visage which seemed to grow the more haggard and desperate his head fell again and he dropped the candle from his hand one of those beggars who went by the side of the procession to gather the drippings of the tapers restored it to him  why said ferris aloud its don ippolito did you know him at first     xiii   the ladies were sitting on the terrace when don ippolito came next morning to say that he could not read with miss vervain that day nor for several days after alleging in excuse some priestly duties proper to the time mrs vervain began to lament that she had not been able to go to the procession of the day before i meant to have kept a sharp lookout for you florida saw you and so did mr ferris but it isnt at all the same thing you know florida has no faculty for describing and now i shall probably go away from venice without seeing you in your real character once  don ippolito suffered this and more in meek silence he waited his opportunity with unfailing politeness and then with gentle punctilio took his leave  well come again as soon as your duties will let you don ippolito cried mrs vervain we shall miss you dreadfully and i begrudge every one of your readings that florida loses  the priest passed with the sliding step which his impeding drapery imposed down the garden walk and was halfway to the gate when florida who had stood watching him said to her mother i must speak to him again and lightly descended the steps and swiftly glided in pursuit  don ippolito she called  he already had his hand upon the gate but he turned and rapidly went back to meet her  she stood in the walk where she had stopped when her voice arrested him breathing quickly their eyes met a painful shadow overcast the face of the young girl who seemed to be trying in vain to speak  mrs vervain put on her glasses and peered down at the two with good natured curiosity  well madamigella said the priest at last what do you command me he gave a faint patient sigh  the tears came into her eyes oh she began vehemently i wish there was some one who had the right to speak to you  no one answered don ippolito has so much the right as you  i saw you yesterday she began again and i thought of what you had told me don ippolito  yes i thought of it too answered the priest i have thought of it ever since  but havent you thought of any hope for yourself must you still go on as before how can you go back now to those things and pretend to think them holy and all the time have no heart or faith in them its terrible  what would you madamigella demanded don ippolito with a moody shrug it is my profession my trade you know you might say to the prisoner he added bitterly it is terrible to see you chained here yes it is terrible oh i dont reject your compassion but what can i do  sit down with me here said florida in her blunt childlike way and sank upon the stone seat beside the walk she clasped her hands together in her lap with some strong bashful emotion while don ippolito obeying her command waited for her to speak her voice was scarcely more than a hoarse whisper when she began  i dont know how to begin what i want to say i am not fit to advise any one i am so young and so very ignorant of the world  i too know little of the world said the priest as much to himself as to her  it may be all wrong all wrong besides she said abruptly how do i know that you are a good man don ippolito how do i know that youve been telling me the truth it may be all a kind of trap  he looked blankly at her  this is in venice and you may be leading me on to say things to you that will make trouble for my mother and me you may be a spy  oh no no no cried the priest springing to his feet with a kind of moan and a shudder god forbid he swiftly touched her hand with the tips of his fingers and then kissed them an action of inexpressible humility madamigella i swear to you by everything you believe good that i would rather die than be false to you in a single breath or thought  oh i know it i know it she murmured i dont see how i could say such a cruel thing  not cruel no madamigella not cruel softly pleaded don ippolito  butbut is there no escape for you  they looked steadfastly at each other for a moment and then don ippolito spoke  yes he said very gravely there is one way of escape i have often thought of it and once i thought i had taken the first step towards it but it is beset with many great obstacles and to be a priest makes one timid and insecure  he lapsed into his musing melancholy with the last words but she would not suffer him to lose whatever heart he had begun to speak with thats nothing she said you must think again of that way of escape and never turn from it till you have tried it only take the first step and you can go on friends will rise up everywhere and make it easy for you come she implored him fervently you must promise  he bent his dreamy eyes upon her  if i should take this only way of escape and it seemed desperate to all others would you still be my friend  i should be your friend if the whole world turned against you  would you be my friend he asked eagerly in lower tones and with signs of an inward struggle if this way of escape were for me to be no longer a priest  oh yes yes why not cried the girl and her face glowed with heroic sympathy and defiance it is from this heavenborn ignorance in women of the insuperable difficulties of doing right that men take fire and accomplish the sublime impossibilities our sense of details our fatal habits of reasoning paralyze us we need the impulse of the pure ideal which we can get only from them these two were alike children as regarded the world but he had a mans dark prevision of the means and she a heavenly scorn of everything but the end to be achieved  he drew a long breath then it does not seem terrible to you  terrible no i dont see how you can rest till it is done  is it true then that you urge me to this step which indeed i have so long desired to take  yes it is true listen don ippolito it is the very thing that i hoped you would do but i wanted you to speak of it first you must have all the honor of it and i am glad you thought of it before you will never regret it  she smiled radiantly upon him and he kindled at her enthusiasm in another moment his face darkened again but it will cost much he murmured  no matter cried florida such a man as you ought to leave the priesthood at any risk or hazard you should cease to be a priest if it cost you kindred friends good fame country everything she blushed with irrelevant consciousness why need you be downhearted with your genius once free you can make country and fame and friends everywhere leave venice there are other places think how inventors succeed in america  in america exclaimed the priest ah how long i have desired to be there  you must go you will soon be famous and honored there and you shall not be a stranger even at the first do you know that we are going home very soon yes my mother and i have been talking of it today we are both homesick and you see that she is not well you shall come to us there and make our house your home till you have formed some plans of your own everything will be easy god is good she said in a breaking voice and you may be sure he will befriend you  some one answered don ippolito with tears in his eyes has already been very good to me i thought it was you but i will call it god  hush you mustnt say such things but you must go now take time to think but not too much time onlybe true to yourself  they rose and she laid her hand on his arm with an instinctive gesture of appeal he stood bewildered then thanks madamigella thanks he said and caught her fragrant hand to his lips he loosed it and lifted both his arms by a blind impulse in which he arrested himself with a burning blush and turned away he did not take leave of her with his wonted formalities but hurried abruptly toward the gate  a panic seemed to seize her as she saw him open it she ran after him don ippolito don ippolito she said coming up to him and stammered and faltered i dont know i am frightened you must do nothing from me i cannot let you im not fit to advise you it must be wholly from your own conscience oh no dont look so i will be your friend whatever happens but if what you think of doing has seemed so terrible to you perhaps it is more terrible than i can understand if it is the only way it is right but is there no other what i mean is have you no one to talk all this over with i mean cant you speak of it toto mr ferris he is so true and honest and just  i was going to him said don ippolito with a dim trouble in his face  oh i am so glad of that remember i dont take anything back no matter what happens i will be your friend but he will tell you just what to do  don ippolito bowed and opened the gate  florida went back to her mother who asked her what in the world have you and don ippolito been talking about so earnestly what makes you so pale and out of breath  i have been wanting to tell you mother said florida she drew her chair in front of the elder lady and sat down     xiv   don ippolito did not go directly to the painters he walked toward his house at first and then turned aside and wandered out through the noisy and populous district of canaregio to the campo di marte a squad of cavalry which had been going through some exercises there was moving off the parade ground a few infantry soldiers were strolling about under the trees don ippolito walked across the field to the border of the lagoon where he began to pace to and fro with his head sunk in deep thought he moved rapidly but sometimes he stopped and stood still in the sun whose heat he did not seem to feel though a perspiration bathed his pale face and stood in drops on his forehead under the shadow of his nicchio some little dirty children of the poor with which this region swarms looked at him from the sloping shore of the campo di giustizia where the executions used to take place and a small boy began to mock his movements and pauses but was arrested by one of the girls who shook him and gesticulated warningly  at this point the long railroad bridge which connects venice with the mainland is in full sight and now from the reverie in which he continued whether he walked or stood still don ippolito was roused by the whistle of an outward train he followed it with his eye as it streamed along over the farstretching arches and struck out into the flat salt marshes beyond when the distance hid it he put on his hat which he had unknowingly removed and turned his rapid steps toward the railroad station arrived there he lingered in the vestibule for half an hour watching the people as they bought their tickets for departure and had their baggage examined by the customs officers and weighed and registered by the railroad porters who passed it through the wicket shutting out the train while the passengers gathered up their smaller parcels and took their way to the waitingrooms he followed a group of english people some paces in this direction and then returned to the wicket through which he looked long and wistfully at the train the baggage was all passed through the doors of the waitingrooms were thrown open with harsh proclamation by the guards and the passengers flocked into the carriages whistles and bells were sounded and the train crept out of the station  a man in the companys uniform approached the unconscious priest and striking his hands softly together said with a pleasant smile your servant don ippolito are you expecting some one  ah good day answered the priest with a little start no he added i was not looking for any one  i see said the other amusing yourself as usual with the machinery excuse the freedom don ippolito but you ought to have been of our professionha ha when you have the leisure i should like to show you the drawing of an american locomotive which a friend of mine has sent me from nuova york it is very different from ours very curious but monstrous in size you know prodigious may i come with it to your house some evening  you will do me a great pleasure said don ippolito he gazed dreamily in the direction of the vanished train was that the train for milan he asked presently  exactly said the man  does it go all the way to milan  oh no it stops at peschiera where the passengers have their passports examined and then another train backs down from desenzano and takes them on to milan and after that continued the man with animation if you are on the way to england for example another train carries you to susa and there you get the diligence over the mountain to st michel where you take railroad again and so on up through paris to boulognesurmer and then by steamer to folkestone and then by railroad to london and to liverpool it is at liverpool that you go on board the steamer for america and piff in ten days you are in nuova york my friend has written me all about it  ah yes your friend does he like it there in america  passably passably the americans have no manners but they are good devils they are governed by the irish and the wine is dear but he likes america yes he likes it nuova york is a fine city but immense you know eight times as large as venice  is your friend prosperous there  ah heigh that is the prettiest part of the story he has made himself rich he is employed by a large house to make designs for mantlepieces and marble tables and tombs and he haslistensix hundred francs a month  oh per bacco cried don ippolito  honestly but you spend a great deal there still it is magnificent is it not if it were not for that blessed war there now that would be the place for you don ippolito he tells me the americans are actually mad for inventions your servant excuse the freedom you know said the man bowing and moving away  nothing dear nothing answered the priest he walked out of the station with a light step and went to his own house where he sought the room in which his inventions were stored he had not touched them for weeks they were all dusty and many were cobwebbed he blew the dust from some and bringing them to the light examined them critically finding them mostly disabled in one way or other except the models of the portable furniture which he polished with his handkerchief and set apart surveying them from a distance with a look of hope he took up the breechloading cannon and then suddenly put it down again with a little shiver and went to the threshold of the perverted oratory and glanced in at his forge veneranda had carelessly left the window open and the draught had carried the ashes about the floor on the cinderheap lay the tools which he had used in mending the broken pipe of the fountain at casa vervain and had not used since the place seemed chilly even on that summers day he stood in the doorway with clenched hands then he called veneranda chid her for leaving the window open and bade her close it and so quitted the house and left her muttering  ferris seemed surprised to see him when he appeared at the consulate near the middle of the afternoon and seated himself in the place where he was wont to pose for the painter  were you going to give me a sitting asked the latter hesitating the light is horrible just now with this glare from the canal not that i manage much better when its good i dont get on with you don ippolito there are too many of you i shouldnt have known you in the procession yesterday  don ippolito did not respond he rose and went toward his portrait on the easel and examined it long with a curious minuteness then he returned to his chair and continued to look at it i suppose that it resembles me a great deal he said and yet i do not feel like that i hardly know what is the fault it is as i should be if i were like other priests perhaps  i know its not good said the painter it is conventional in spite of everything but heres that first sketch i made of you  he took up a canvas facing the wall and set it on the easel the character in this charcoal sketch was vastly sincerer and sweeter  ah said don ippolito with a sigh and smile of relief that is immeasurably better i wish i could speak to you dear friend in a mood of yours as sympathetic as this picture records of some matters that concern me very nearly i have just come from the railroad station  seeing some friends off asked the painter indifferently hovering near the sketch with a bit of charcoal in his hand and hesitating whether to give it a certain touch he glanced with halfshut eyes at the priest  don ippolito sighed again i hardly know i was seeing off my hopes my desires my prayers that followed the train to america  the painter put down his charcoal dusted his fingers and looked at the priest without saying anything  do you remember when i first came to you asked don ippolito  certainly said ferris is it of that matter you want to speak to me im very sorry to hear it for i dont think it practical  practical practical cried the priest hotly nothing is practical till it has been tried and why should i not go to america  because you cant get your passport for one thing answered the painter dryly  i have thought of that rejoined don ippolito more patiently i can get a passport for france from the austrian authorities here and at milan there must be ways in which i could change it for one from my own kingit was by this title that patriotic venetians of those days spoke of victor emmanuelthat would carry me out of france into england  ferris pondered a moment that is quite true he said why hadnt you thought of that when you first came to me  i cannot tell i didnt know that i could even get a passport for france till the other day  both were silent while the painter filled his pipe well he said presently im very sorry im afraid youre dooming yourself to many bitter disappointments in going to america what do you expect to do there  why with my inventions  i suppose interrupted the other putting a lighted match to his pipe that a painter must be a very poor sort of american his first thought is of coming to italy so i know very little directly about the fortunes of my inventive fellowcountrymen or whether an inventor has any prospect of making a living but once when i was at washington i went into the patent office where the models of the inventions are deposited the building is about as large as the ducal palace and it is full of them the people there told me nothing was commoner than for the same invention to be repeated over and over again by different inventors some few succeed and then they have lawsuits with the infringers of their patents some sell out their inventions for a trifle to companies that have capital and that grow rich upon them the great number can never bring their ideas to the public notice at all you can judge for yourself what your chances would be you have asked me why you should not go to america well because i think you would starve there  i am used to that said don ippolito and besides until some of my inventions became known i could give lessons in italian  oh bravo said ferris you prefer instant death then  but madamigella seemed to believe that my success as an inventor would be assured there  ferris gave a very ironical laugh miss vervain must have been about twelve years old when she left america even a ladys knowledge of business at that age is limited when did you talk with her about it you had not spoken of it to me of late and i thought you were more contented than you used to be  it is true said the priest sometimes within the last two months i have almost forgotten it  and what has brought it so forcibly to your mind again  that is what i so greatly desire to tell you replied don ippolito with an appealing look at the painters face he moistened his parched lips a little waiting for further question from the painter to whom he seemed a man fevered by some strong emotion and at that moment not quite wholesome ferris did not speak and don ippolito began again even though i have not said so in words to you dear friend has it not appeared to you that i have no heart in my vocation  yes i have sometimes fancied that i had no right to ask you why  some day i will tell you when i have the courage to go all over it again it is partly my own fault but it is more my miserable fortune but wherever the wrong lies it has at last become intolerable to me i cannot endure it any longer and live i must go away i must fly from it  ferris shrank from him a little as men instinctively do from one who has set himself upon some desperate attempt do you mean don ippolito that you are going to renounce your priesthood  don ippolito opened his hands and let his priesthood drop as it were to the ground  you never spoke of this before when you talked of going to america though to be sure  yes yes replied don ippolito with vehemence but now an angel has appeared and shown me the blackness of my life  ferris began to wonder if he or don ippolito were not perhaps mad  an angel yes the priest went on rising from his chair an angel whose immaculate truth has mirrored my falsehood in all its vileness and distortionto whom if it destroys me i cannot devote less than a truthfulness like hers  hershers cried the painter with a sudden pang whose dont speak in these riddles whom do you mean  whom can i mean but only onemadamigella  miss vervain do you mean to say that miss vervain has advised you to renounce your priesthood  in as many words she has bidden me forsake it at any riskat the cost of kindred friends good fame country everything  the painter passed his hand confusedly over his face these were his own words the words he had used in speaking with florida of the supposed skeptical priest he grew very pale may i ask he demanded in a hard dry voice how she came to advise such a step  i can hardly tell something had already moved her to learn from me the story of my lifeto know that i was a man with neither faith nor hope her pure heart was torn by the thought of my wrong and of my error i had never seen myself in such deformity as she saw me even when she used me with that divine compassion i was almost glad to be what i was because of her angelic pity for me  the tears sprang to don ippolitos eyes but ferris asked in the same tone as before was it then that she bade you be no longer a priest  no not then patiently replied the other she was too greatly overwhelmed with my calamity to think of any cure for it today it was that she uttered those wordswords which i shall never forget which will support and comfort me whatever happens  the painter was biting hard upon the stem of his pipe he turned away and began ordering the colortubes and pencils on a table against the wall putting them close together in very neat straight rows presently he said perhaps miss vervain also advised you to go to america  yes answered the priest reverently she had thought of everything she has promised me a refuge under her mothers roof there until i can make my inventions known and i shall follow them at once  follow them  they are going she told me madama does not grow better they are homesick theybut you must know all this already  oh not at all not at all said the painter with a very bitter smile you are telling me news pray go on  there is no more she made me promise to come to you and listen to your advice before i took any step i must not trust to her alone she said but if i took this step then through whatever happened she would be my friend ah dear friend may i speak to you of the hope that these words gave me you have seenhave you notyou must have seen that  the priest faltered and ferris stared at him helpless when the next words came he could not find any strangeness in the fact which yet gave him so great a shock he found that to his nether consciousness it had been long familiarever since that day when he had first jestingly proposed don ippolito as miss vervains teacher grotesque tragic impossibleit had still been the undercurrent of all his reveries or so now it seemed to have been  don ippolito anxiously drew nearer to him and laid an imploring touch upon his armi love her  what gasped the painter you you i a priest  priest priest cried don ippolito violently from this day i am no longer a priest from this hour i am a man and i can offer her the honorable love of a man the truth of a most sacred marriage and fidelity to death  ferris made no answer he began to look very coldly and haughtily at don ippolito whose heat died away under his stare and who at last met it with a glance of tremulous perplexity his hand had dropped from ferriss arm and he now moved some steps from him what is it dear friend he besought him is there something that offends you i came to you for counsel and you meet me with a repulse little short of enmity i do not understand do i intend anything wrong without knowing it oh i conjure you to speak plainly  wait wait a minute said ferris waving his hand like a man tormented by a passing pain i am trying to think what you say is i cannot imagine it  not imagine it not imagine it and why is she not beautiful  yes  and good  without doubt  and young and yet wise beyond her years and true and yet angelically kind  it is all as you say god knows but a priest  oh always that accursed word and at heart what is a priest then but a mana wretched masked imprisoned banished man has he not blood and nerves like you has he not eyes to see what is fair and ears to hear what is sweet can he live near so divine a flower and not know her grace not inhale the fragrance of her soul not adore her beauty oh great god and if at last he would tear off his stifling mask escape from his prison return from his exile would you gainsay him  no said the painter with a kind of groan he sat down in a tall carven gothic chairthe furniture of one of his picturesand rested his head against its high back and looked at the priest across the room excuse me he continued with a strong effort i am ready to befriend you to the utmost of my power what was it you wanted to ask me i have told you truly what i thought of your scheme of going to america but i may very well be mistaken was it about that miss vervain desired you to consult me his voice and manner hardened again in spite of him or did she wish me to advise you about the renunciation of your priesthood you must have thought that carefully over for yourself  yes i do not think you could make me see that as a greater difficulty than it has appeared to me he paused with a confused and daunted air as if some important point had slipped his mind but i must take the step the burden of the double part i play is unendurable is it not  you know better than i  but if you were such a man as i with neither love for your vocation nor faith in it should you not cease to be a priest  if you ask me in that wayyes answered the painter but i advise you nothing i could not counsel another in such a case  but you think and feel as i do said the priest and i am right then  i do not say you are wrong  ferris was silent while don ippolito moved up and down the room with his sliding step like some tall gaunt unhappy girl neither could put an end to this interview so full of intangible inconclusive misery ferris drew a long breath and then said steadily don ippolito i suppose you did not speak idly to me of youryour feeling for miss vervain and that i may speak plainly to you in return  surely answered the priest pausing in his walk and fixing his eyes upon the painter it was to you as the friend of both that i spoke of my love and my hopewhich is oftener my despair  then you have not much reason to believe that she returns your feeling  ah how could she consciously return it i have been hitherto a priest to her and the thought of me would have been impurity but hereafter if i can prove myself a man if i can win my place in the world no even now why should she care so much for my escape from these bonds if she did not care for me more than she knew  have you ever thought of that extravagant generosity of miss vervains character  it is divine  has it seemed to you that if such a woman knew herself to have once wrongly given you pain her atonement might be as headlong and excessive as her offense that she could have no reserves in her reparation  don ippolito looked at ferris but did not interpose  miss vervain is very religious in her way and she is truth itself are you sure that it is not concern for what seems to her your terrible position that has made her show so much anxiety on your account  do i not know that well have i not felt the balm of her most heavenly pity  and may she not be only trying to appeal to something in you as high as the impulse of her own heart  as high cried don ippolito almost angrily can there be any higher thing in heaven or on earth than love for such a woman  yes both in heaven and on earth answered ferris  i do not understand you said don ippolito with a puzzled stare  ferris did not reply he fell into a dull reverie in which he seemed to forget don ippolito and the whole affair at last the priest spoke again have you nothing to say to me signore  i what is there to say returned the other blankly  do you know any reason why i should not love her save that i amhave beena priest  no i know none said the painter wearily  ah exclaimed don ippolito there is something on your mind that you will not speak i beseech you not to let me go wrong i love her so well that i would rather die than let my love offend her i am a man with the passions and hopes of a man but without a mans experience or a mans knowledge of what is just and right in these relations if you can be my friend in this so far as to advise or warn me if you can be her friend  ferris abruptly rose and went to his balcony and looked out upon the grand canal the timestained palace opposite had not changed in the last halfhour as on many another summer day he saw the black boats going by a heavy highpointed barge from the sile with the captains family at dinner in the shade of a matting on the roof moved sluggishly down the middle current a party of americans in a gondola with their operaglasses and guidebooks in their hands pointed out to each other the eagle on the consular arms they were all like sights in a mirror or things in a world turned upside down  ferris came back and looked dizzily at the priest trying to believe that this unhuman sacerdotal phantasm had been telling him that it loved a beautiful young girl of his own race faith and language  will you not answer me signore meekly demanded don ippolito  in this matter replied the painter i cannot advise or warn you the whole affair is beyond my conception i mean no unkindness but i cannot consult with you about it there are reasons why i should not the mother of miss vervain is here with her and i do not feel that her interests in such a matter are in my hands if they come to me for help that is different what do you wish you tell me that you are resolved to renounce the priesthood and go to america and i have answered you to the best of my power you tell me that you are in love with miss vervain what can i have to say about that  don ippolito stood listening with a patient and then a wounded air nothing he answered proudly i ask your pardon for troubling you with my affairs your former kindness emboldened me too much i shall not trespass again it was my ignorance which i pray you to excuse i take my leave signore  he bowed and moved out of the room and a dull remorse filled the painter as he heard the outer door close after him but he could do nothing if he had given a wound to the heart that trusted him it was in an anguish which he had not been able to master and whose causes he could not yet define it was all a shapeless torment it held him like the memory of some hideous nightmare prolonging its horror beyond sleep it seemed impossible that what had happened should have happened  it was long as he sat in the chair from which he had talked with don ippolito before he could reason about what had been said and then the worst phase presented itself first he could not help seeing that the priest might have found cause for hope in the girls behavior toward him her violent resentments and her equally violent repentances her fervent interest in his unhappy fortunes and her anxiety that he should at once forsake the priesthood her urging him to go to america and her promising him a home under her mothers roof there why might it not all be in fact a proof of her tenderness for him she might have found it necessary to be thus coarsely explicit with him for a man in don ippolitos relation to her could not otherwise have imagined her interest in him but her making use of ferris to confirm her own purposes by his words her repeating them so that they should come back to him from don ippolitos lips her letting another man go with her to look upon the procession in which her priestly lover was to appear in his sacerdotal panoply these things could cot be accounted for except by that strain of insolent passionate defiance which he had noted ill her from the beginning why should she first tell don ippolito of their going away well i wish him joy of his bargain said ferris aloud and rising shrugged his shoulders and tried to cast off all care of a matter that did not concern him but one does not so easily cast off a matter that does not concern one he found himself haunted by certain tones and looks and attitudes of the young girl wholly alien to the character he had just constructed for her they were childlike trusting unconscious far beyond anything he had yet known in women and they appealed to him now with a maddening pathos she was standing there before don ippolitos picture as on that morning when she came to ferris looking anxiously at him her innocent beauty troubled with some hidden care hallowing the place ferris thought of the young fellow who told him that he had spent three months in a dull german town because he had the room there that was once occupied by the girl who had refused him the painter remembered that the young fellow said he had just read of her marriage in an american newspaper  why did miss vervain send don ippolito to him was it some scheme of her secret love for the priest or mere coarse resentment of the cautions ferris had once hinted a piece of vulgar bravado but if she had acted throughout in pure simplicity in unwise goodness of heart if don ippolito were altogether selfdeceived and nothing but her unknowing pity had given him grounds of hope he himself had suggested this to the priest and how with a different motive he looked at it in his own behalf a great load began slowly to lift itself from ferriss heart which could ache now for this most unhappy priest but if his conjecture were just his duty would be different he must not coldly acquiesce and let things take their course he had introduced don ippolito to the vervains he was in some sort responsible for him he must save them if possible from the painful consequences of the priests hallucination but how to do this was by no means clear he blamed himself for not having been franker with don ippolito and tried to make him see that the vervains might regard his passion as a presumption upon their kindness to him an abuse of their hospitable friendship and yet how could he have done this without outrage to a sensitive and rightmeaning soul for a moment it seemed to him that he must seek don ippolito and repair his fault but they had hardly parted as friends and his action might be easily misconstrued if he shrank from the thought of speaking to him of the matter again it appeared yet more impossible to bring it before the vervains like a man of the imaginative temperament as he was he exaggerated the probable effect and pictured their dismay in colors that made his interference seem a ludicrous enormity in fact it would have been an awkward business enough for one not hampered by his intricate obligations he felt bound to the vervains the ignorant young girl and the addlepated mother but if he ought to go to them and tell them what he knew to which of them ought he to speak and how in an anguish of perplexity that made the sweat stand in drops upon his forehead he smiled to think it just possible that mrs vervain might take the matter seriously and wish to consider the propriety of floridas accepting don ippolito but if he spoke to the daughter how should he approach the subject don ippolito tells me he loves you and he goes to america with the expectation that when he has made his fortune with a patent backaction applecorer you will marry him should he say something to this purport and in heavens name what right had he ferris to say anything at all the horrible absurdity the inexorable delicacy of his position made him laugh  on the other hand besides he was bound to don ippolito who had come to him as the nearest friend of both and confided in him he remembered with a tardy poignant intelligence how in their first talk of the vervains don ippolito had taken pains to inform himself that ferris was not in love with florida could he be less manly and generous than this poor priest and violate the sanctity of his confidence ferris groaned aloud no contrive it as he would call it by what fair name he chose he could not commit this treachery it was the more impossible to him because in this agony of doubt as to what he should do he now at least read big own heart clearly and had no longer a doubt what was in it he pitied her for the pain she must suffer he saw how her simple goodness her blind sympathy with don ippolito and only this must have led the priest to the mistaken pass at which he stood but ferris felt that the whole affair had been fatally carried beyond his reach he could do nothing now but wait and endure there are cases in which a man must not protect the woman he loves this was one  the afternoon wore away in the evening he went to the piazza and drank a cup of coffee at florians then he walked to the public gardens where he watched the crowd till it thinned in the twilight and left him alone he hung upon the parapet looking off over the lagoon that at last he perceived to be flooded with moonlight he desperately called a gondola and bade the man row him to the public landing nearest the vervains and so walked up the calle and entered the palace from the campo through the court that on one side opened into the garden  mrs vervain was alone in the room where he had always been accustomed to find her daughter with her and a chill as of the impending change fell upon him he felt how pleasant it had been to find them together with a vain piercing regret he felt how much like home the place had been to him mrs vervain indeed was not changed she was even more than ever herself though all that she said imported change she seemed to observe nothing unwonted in him and she began to talk in her way of things that she could not know were so near his heart  now mr ferris i have a little surprise for you guess what it is  im not good at guessing id rather not know what it is than have to guess it said ferris trying to be light under his heavy trouble  you wont try once even well youre going to be rid of us soon i we are going away  yes i knew that said ferris quietly don ippolito told me so to day  and is that all you have to say isnt it rather sad isnt it sudden come mr ferris do be a little complimentary for once  its sudden and i can assure you its sad enough for me replied the painter in a tone which could not leave any doubt of his sincerity  well so it is for us quavered mrs vervain you have been very very good to us she went on more collectedly and we shall never forget it florida has been speaking of it too and shes extremely grateful and thinks weve quite imposed upon you  thanks  i suppose we have but as i always say youre the representative of the country here however thats neither here nor there we have no relatives on the face of the earth you know but i have a good many old friends in providence and were going back there we both think i shall be better at home for im sorry to say mr ferns that though i dont complain of veniceits really a beautiful place and all that not the least exaggeratedstill i dont think its done my health much good or at least i dont seem to gain dont you know i dont seem to gain  im very sorry to hear it mrs vervain  yes im sure you are but you see dont you that we must go we are going next week when weve once made up our minds theres no object in prolonging the agony  mrs vervain adjusted her glasses with the thumb and finger of her right hand and peered into ferriss face with a gay smile but the greatest part of the surprise is she resumed lowering her voice a little that don ippolito is going with us  ah cried ferris sharply  i knew i should surprise you laughed mrs vervain weve been having a regular confabclave i meanabout it here and hes all on fire to go to america though it must be kept a great secret on his account poor fellow hes to join us in france and then he can easily get into england with us you know hes to give up being a priest and is going to devote himself to invention when ho gets to america now what do you think of it mr ferris quite strikes you dumb doesnt it triumphed mrs vervain i suppose its what you would call a wild goose chasei used to pick up all those phrases but we shall carry it through  ferris gasped as though about to speak but said nothing  don ippolitos been here the whole afternoon continued mrs vervain or rather ever since about five oclock he took dinner with us and weve been talking it over and over hes so enthusiastic about it and yet he breaks down every little while and seems quite to despair of the undertaking but florida wont let him do that and really its funny the way he defers to her judgmentyou know i always regard florida as such a mere childand seems to take every word she says for gospel but shedding tears now its dreadful in a man isnt it i wish don ippolito wouldnt do that it makes one creep i cant feel that its manly can you  ferris found voice to say something about those things being different with the latin races  well at any rate said mrs vervain im glad that americans dont shed tears as a general rule now florida youd think she was the man all through this business shes so perfectly heroic about it that is outwardly for i can seewomen can in each other mr ferrisjust where shes on the point of breaking down all the while has she ever spoken to you about don ippolito she does think so highly of your opinion mr ferris  she does me too much honor said ferris with ghastly irony  oh i dont think so returned mrs vervain she told me this morning that shed made don ippolito promise to speak to you about it but he didnt mention having done so andi hated dont you know to ask him in fact florida had told me beforehand that i mustnt she said he must be left entirely to himself in that matter andmrs vervain looked suggestively at ferris  he spoke to me about it said ferris  then why in the world did you let me run on i suppose you advised him against it  i certainly did  well theres where i think womans intuition is better than mans reason  the painter silently bowed his head  yes im quite womans rights in that respect said mrs vervain  oh without doubt answered ferris aimlessly  im perfectly delighted she went on at the idea of don ippolitos giving up the priesthood and ive told him he must get married to some good american girl you ought to have seen how the poor fellow blushed but really you know there are lots of nice girls that would jump at himso handsome and sadlooking and a genius  ferris could only stare helplessly at mrs vervain who continued  yes i think hes a genius and im determined that he shall have a chance i suppose weve got a job on our hands but im not sorry ill introduce him into society and if he needs money he shall have it what does god give us money for mr ferris but to help our fellow creatures  so miserable as he was from head to foot that it seemed impossible he could endure more ferris could not forbear laughing at this burst of piety  what are you laughing at asked mrs vervain who had cheerfully joined him something ive been saying well you wont have me to laugh at much longer i do wonder whom youll have next  ferriss merriment died away in something like a groan and when mrs vervain again spoke it was in a tone of sudden querulousness i wish florida would come she went to bolt the landgate after don ippolitoi wanted her tobut she ought to have been back long ago its odd you didnt meet them coming in she must be in the garden somewhere i suppose shes sorry to be leaving it but i need her would you be so very kind mr ferris as to go and ask her to come to me  ferris rose heavily from the chair in which he seemed to have grown ten years older he had hardly heard anything that he did not know already but the clear vision of the affair with which he had come to the vervains was hopelessly confused and darkened he could make nothing of any phase of it he did not know whether he cared now to see florida or not he mechanically obeyed mrs vervain and stepping out upon the terrace slowly descended the stairway  the moon was shining brightly into the garden     xv   florida and don ippolito had paused in the pathway which parted at the fountain and led in one direction to the watergate and in the other out through the palacecourt into the campo  now you must not give way to despair again she said to him you will succeed i am sure for you will deserve success  it is all your goodness madamigella sighed the priest and at the bottom of my heart i am afraid that all the hope and courage i have are also yours  you shall never want for hope and courage then we believe in you and we honor your purpose and we will be your steadfast friends but now you must think only of the presentof how you are to get away from venice oh i can understand how you must hate to leave it what a beautiful night you mustnt expect such moonlight as this in america don ippolito  it is beautiful is it not said the priest kindling from her but i think we venetians are never so conscious of the beauty of venice as you strangers are  i dont know i only know that now since we tave made up our minds to go and fixed the day and hour it is more like leaving my own country than anything else ive ever felt this garden i seem to have spent my whole life in it and when we are settled in providence im going to have mother send back for some of these statues i suppose signor cavaletti wouldnt mind our robbing his place of them if he were paid enough at any rate we must have this one that belongs to the fountain you shall be the first to set the fountain playing over there don ippolito and then well sit down on this stone bench before it and imagine ourselves in the garden of casa vervain at venice  no no let me be the last to set it playing here said the priest quickly stooping to the pipe at the foot of the figure and then we will sit down here and imagine ourselves in the garden of casa vervain at providence  florida put her hand on his shoulder you mustnt do it she said simply the padrone doesnt like to waste the water  oh well pray the saints to rain it back on him some day cried don ippolito with willful levity and the stream leaped into the moonlight and seemed to hang there like a tangled skein of silver but how shall i shut it off when you are gone asked the young girl looking ruefully at the floating threads of splendor  oh i will shut it off before i go answered don ippolito let it play a moment he continued gazing rapturously upon it while the moon painted his lifted face with a pallor that his black robes heightened he fetched a long sighing breath as if he inhaled with that respiration all the rich odors of the flowers blanched like his own visage in the white lustre as if he absorbed into his heart at once the wide glory of the summer night and the beauty of the young girl at his side it seemed a supreme moment with him he looked as a man might look who has climbed out of lifelong defeat into a single instant of release and triumph  florida sank upon the bench before the fountain indulging his caprice with that sacred motherly tolerance some touch of which is in all womanly yielding to mens will and which was perhaps present in greater degree in her feeling towards a man more than ordinarily orphaned and unfriended  is providence your native city asked don ippolito abruptly after a little silence  oh no i was born at st augustine in florida  ah yes i forgot madama has told me about it providence is her city but the two are near together  no said florida compassionately they are a thousand miles apart  a thousand miles what a vast country  yes its a whole world  ah a world indeed cried the priest softly i shall never comprehend it  you never will answered the young girl gravely if you do not think about it more practically  practically practically lightly retorted the priest what a word with you americans that is the consuls word practical  then you have been to see him today asked florida with eagerness i wanted to ask you  yes i went to consult the oracle as you bade me  don ippolito  and he was averse to my going to america he said it was not practical  oh murmured the girl  i think continued the priest with vehemence that signor ferris is no longer my friend  did he treat you coldlyharshly she asked with a note of indignation in her voice did he know that ithat you came  perhaps he was right perhaps i shall indeed go to ruin there ruin ruin do i not live ruin here  what did he saywhat did he tell you  no no not now madamigella i do not want to think of that man now i want you to help me once more to realize myself in america where i shall never have been a priest where i shall at least battle even handed with the world come let us forget him the thought of him palsies all my hope he could not see me save in this robe in this figure that i abhor  oh it was strange it was not like him it was cruel what did he say  in everything but words he bade me despair he bade me look upon all that makes life dear and noble as impossible to me  oh how perhaps he did not understand you no he did not understand you what did you say to him don ippolito tell me she leaned towards him in anxious emotion as she spoke  the priest rose and stretched out his arms as if he would gather something of courage from the infinite space in his visage were the sublimity and the terror of a man who puts everything to the risk  how will it really be with me yonder he demanded as it is with other men whom their past life if it has been guiltless does not follow to that new world of freedom and justice  why should it not be so demanded florida did he say it would not  need it be known there that i have been a priest or if i tell it will it make me appear a kind of monster different from other men  no no she answered fervently your story would gain friends and honor for you everywhere in america did he  a moment a moment cried don ippolito catching his breath will it ever be possible for me to win something more than honor and friendship there  she looked up at him askingly confusedly  if i am a man and the time should ever come that a face a look a voice shall be to me what they are to other men will she remember it against me that i have been a priest when i tell hersay to her madamigellahow dear she is to me offer her my lifes devotion ask her to be my wife  florida rose from the seat and stood confronting him in a helpless silence which he seemed not to notice  suddenly he clasped his hands together and desperately stretched them towards her  oh my hope my trust my life if it were you that i loved  what shuddered the girl recoiling with almost a shriek you a priest  don ippolito gave a low cry half sob  his words his words it is true i cannot escape i am doomed i must die as i have lived  he dropped his face into his hands and stood with his head bowed before her neither spoke for a long time or moved  then florida said absently in the husky murmur to which her voice fell when she was strongly moved yes i see it all how it has been and was silent again staring as if a procession of the events and scenes of the past months were passing before her and presently she moaned to herself oh oh oh and wrung her hands the foolish fountain kept capering and babbling on all at once now as a flame flashes up and then expires it leaped and dropped extinct at the foot of the statue  its going out seemed somehow to leave them in darkness and under cover of that gloom she drew nearer the priest and by such approaches as one makes toward a fancied apparition when his fear will not let him fly but it seems better to suffer the worst from it at once than to live in terror of it ever after she lifted her hands to his and gently taking them away from his face looked into his hopeless eyes  oh don ippolito she grieved what shall i say to you what can i do for you now  but there was nothing to do the whole edifice of his dreams his wild imaginations had fallen into dust at a word no magic could rebuild it the end that never seems the end had come he let her keep his cold hands and presently he returned the entreaty of her tears with his wan patient smile  you cannot help me there is no help for an error like mine sometime if ever the thought of me is a greater pain than it is at this moment you can forgive me yes you can do that for me  but who who will ever forgive me she cried for my blindness oh you must believe that i never thought i never dreamt  i know it well it was your fatal truth that did it truth too high and fine for me to have discerned save through such agony as you too loved my soul like the rest and you would have had me no priest for the reason that they would have had me a priesti see it but you had no right to love my soul and not meyou a woman a woman must not love only the soul of a man  yes yes piteously explained the girl but you were a priest to me  that is true madamigella i was always a priest to you and now i see that i never could be otherwise ah the wrong began many years before we met i was trying to blame you a little  blame me blame me do  but there is no blame think that it was another way of asking your forgiveness o my god my god my god  he released his hands from her and uttered this cry under his breath with his face lifted towards the heavens when he looked at her again he said madamigella if my share of this misery gives me the right to ask of you  oh ask anything of me i will give everything do everything  he faltered and then you do not love me he 8aid abruptly is there some one else that you love  she did not answer  is it  he  she hid her face  i knew it groaned the priest i knew that too and he turned away  don ippolito don ippolitooh poor poor don ippolito cried the girl springing towards him is this the way you leave me where are you going what will you do now  did i not say i am going to die a priest  is there nothing that you will let me be to you hope for you  nothing said don ippolito after a moment what could you he seized the hands imploringly extended towards him and clasped them together and kissed them both adieu he whispered then he opened them and passionately kissed either palm adieu adieu  a great wave of sorrow and compassion and despair for him swept through her she flung her arms about his neck and pulled his head down upon her heart and held it tight there weeping and moaning over him as over some hapless harmless thing that she had unpurposely bruised or killed then she suddenly put her hands against his breast and thrust him away and turned and ran  ferris stepped back again into the shadow of the tree from which he had just emerged and clung to its trunk lest he should fall another seemed to creep out of the court in his person and totter across the white glare of the campo and down the blackness of the calle in the intersected spaces where the moonlight fell this alien miserable man saw the figure of a priest gliding on before him     xvi   florida swiftly me anted the terrace steps but she stopped with her hand on the door panting and turned and walked slowly away to the end of the terrace drying her eyes with dashes of her handkerchief and ordering her hair some coils of which had been loosened by her flight then she went back to the door waited and softly opened it her mother was not in the parlor where she had left her and she passed noiselessly into her own room where some trunks stood open and half packed against the wall she began to gather up the pieces of dress that lay upon the bed and chairs and to fold them with mechanical carefulness and put them in the boxes her mothers voice called from the other chamber is that you florida  yes mother answered the girl but remained kneeling before one of the boxes with that pale green robe in her hand which she had worn on the morning when ferris had first brought don ippolito to see them she smoothed its folds and looked down at it without making any motion to pack it away and so she lingered while her mother advanced with one question after another what are you doing florida where are you why didnt you come to me and finally stood in the doorway oh youre packing do you know florida im getting very impatient about going i wish we could be off at once  a tremor passed over the young girl and she started from her languid posture and laid the dress in the trunk so do i mother i would give the world if we could go tomorrow  yes but we cant you see im afraid weve undertaken a great deal my dear its quite a weight upon my mind already and i dont know what it will be if we were free now i should say go to morrow by all means but we couldnt arrange it with don ippolito on our hands  florida waited a moment before she replied then she said coldly don ippolito is not going with us mother  not going with us why  he is not going to america he will not leave venice he is to remain a priest said florida doggedly  mrs vervain sat down in the chair that stood beside the door not going to america not leave venice remain a priest florida you astonish me but i am not the least surprised not the least in the world i thought don ippolito would give out all along he is not what i should call fickle exactly but he is weak or timid rather he is a good man but he lacks courage resolution i always doubted if he would succeed in america he is too much of a dreamer but this really goes a little beyond anything i never expected this what did he say florida how did he excuse himself  i hardly know very little what was there to say  to be sure to be sure did you try to reason with him florida  no answered the girl drearily  i am glad of that i think you had said quite enough already you owed it to yourself not to do so and he might have misinterpreted it these foreigners are very different from americans no doubt we should have had a time of it if he had gone with us it must be for the best im sure it was ordered so but all that doesnt relieve don ippolito from the charge of black ingratitude and want of consideration for us hes quite made fools of us  he was not to blame it was a very great step for him and if  i know that but he ought not to have talked of it he ought to have known his own mind fully before speaking thats the only safe way well then there is nothing to prevent our going tomorrow  florida drew a long breath and rose to go on with the work of packing  have you been crying florida well of course you cant help feeling sorry for such a man theres a great deal of good in don ippolito a great deal but when you come to my age you wont cry so easily my dear its very trying said mrs vervain she sat awhile in silence before she asked will he come here tomorrow morning  her daughter looked at her with a glance of terrified inquiry  do have your wits about you my dear we cant go away without saying goodby to him and we cant go away without paying him  paying him  yes paying himpaying him for your lessons its always been very awkward he hasnt been like other teachers you know more like a guest or friend of the family he never seemed to want to take the money and of late ive been letting it run along because i hated so to offer it till now its quite a sum i suppose he needs it poor fellow and how to get it to him is the question he may not come to morrow as usual and i couldnt trust it to the padrone we might send it to him in a draft from paris but id rather pay him before we go besides it would be rather rude going away without seeing him again mrs vervain thought a moment then ill tell you she resumed if he doesnt happen to come here tomorrow morning we can stop on our way to the station and give him the money  florida did not answer  dont you think that would be a good plan  i dont know replied the girl in a dull way  why florida if you think from anything don ippolito said that he would rather not see us againthat it would be painful to himwhy we could ask mr ferris to hand him the money  oh no no no mother cried florida hiding her face that would be too horribly indelicate  well perhaps it wouldnt be quite good taste said mrs vervain perturbedly but you neednt express yourself so violently my dear its not a matter of life and death im sure i dont know what to do we must stop at don ippolitos house i suppose dont you think so  yes faintly assented the daughter  mrs vervain yawned well i cant think anything more about it to night im too stupid but thats the way we shall do will you help me to bed my dear i shall be good for nothing tomorrow  she went on talking of don ippolitos change of purpose till her head touched the pillow from which she suddenly lifted it again and called out to her daughter who had passed into the next room but mr ferriswhy didnt he come back with you  come back with me  why yes child i sent him out to call you just before you came in this don ippolito business put him quite out of my head didnt you see him  oh whats that  nothing i dropped my candle  youre sure you didnt set anything on fire  no it went dead out  light it again and do look now is everything right  yes  its queer he didnt come back to say he couldnt find you what do you suppose became of him  i dont know mother  its very perplexing i wish mr ferris were not so odd it quite borders on affectation i dont know what to make of it we must send word to him the very first thing tomorrow morning that were going and ask him to come to see us  florida made no reply she sat staring at the black space of the door way into her mothers room mrs vervain did not speak again after a while her daughter softly entered her chamber shading the candle with her hand and seeing that she slept softly withdrew closed the door and went about the work of packing again when it was all done she flung herself upon her bed and hid her face in the pillow                                       the next morning was spent in bestowing those interminable last touches which the packing of ladies baggage demands and in taking leave with largess in which mrs vervain shone of all the people in the house and out of it who had so much as touched a hat to the vervains during their sojourn the whole was not a vast sum nor did the sundry extortions of the padrone come to much though the honest man racked his brain to invent injuries to his apartments and furniture being unmurmuringly paid he gave way to his real goodwill for his tenants in many little useful offices at the end he persisted in sending them to the station in his own gondola and could with difficulty be kept from going with them  mrs vervain had early sent a message to ferris but word came back a first and a second time that he was not at home and the forenoon wore away and he had not appeared a certain indignation sustained her till the gondola pushed out into the canal and then it yielded to an intolerable regret that she should not see him  i cant go without saying goodby to mr ferris florida she said at last and its no use asking me he may have been wanting a little in politeness but hes been so good all along and we owe him too much not to make an effort to thank him before we go we really must stop a moment at his house  florida who had regarded her mothers efforts to summon ferris to them with passive coldness turned a look of agony upon her but in a moment she bade the gondolier stop at the consulate and dropping her veil over her face fell back in the shadow of the tendacurtains  mrs vervain sentimentalized their departure a little but her daughter made no comment on the scene they were leaving  the gondolier rang at ferriss door and returned with the answer that he was not at home  mrs vervain gave way to despair oh dear oh dear this is too bad what shall we do  well lose the train mother if we loiter in this way said florida  well wait i must leave a message at least how could you be away she wrote on her card when we called to say goodby weve changed our plans and were going today i shall write you a nice scolding letter from veronawere going over the brennerfor your behavior last night who will keep you straight when im gone youve been very very kind florida joins me in a thousand thanks regrets and goodbyes  there i havent said anything after all she fretted with tears in her eyes  the gondolier carried the card again to the door where ferriss servant let down a basket by a string and fished it up  if don ippolito shouldnt be in said mrs vervain as the boat moved on again i dont know what i shall do with this money it will be awkward beyond anything  the gondola slipped from the canalazzo into the network of the smaller canals where the dense shadows were as old as the palaces that cast them and stopped at the landing of a narrow quay the gondolier dismounted and rang at don ippolitos door there was no response he rang again and again at last from a window of the uppermost story the head of the priest himself peered out the gondolier touched his hat and said it is the ladies who ask for you don ippolito  it was a minute before the door opened and the priest bareheaded and blinking in the strong light came with a stupefied air across the quay to the landingsteps  well don ippolito cried mrs vervain rising and giving him her hand which she first waved at the trunks and bags piled up in the vacant space in the front of the boat what do you think of this we are really going immediately we can change our minds too and i dont think it would have been too much she added with a friendly smile if we had gone without saying goodby to you what in the world does it all mean your giving up that grand project of yours so suddenly  she sat down again that she might talk more at her ease and seemed thoroughly happy to have don ippolito before her again  it finally appeared best madama he said quietly after a quick keen glance at florida who did not lift her veil  well perhaps youre partly right but i cant help thinking that you with your talent would have succeeded in america inventors do get on there in the most surprising way theres the screw company of providence its such a simple thing and now the shares are worth eight hundred are you well today don ippolito  quite well madama  i thought you looked rather pale but i believe youre always a little pale you mustnt work too hard we shall miss you a great deal don ippolito  thanks madama  yes we shall be quite lost without you and i wanted to say this to you don ippolito that if ever you change your mind again and conclude to come to america you must write to me and let me help you just as i had intended to do  the priest shivered as if cold and gave another look at floridas veiled face  you are too good he said  yes i really think i am replied mrs vervain playfully considering that you were going to let me leave venice without even trying to say goodby to me i think im very good indeed  mrs vervains mood became overcast and her eyes filled with tears i hope youre sorry to have us going don ippolito for you know how very highly i prize your acquaintance it was rather cruel of you i think  she seemed not to remember that he could not have known of their change of plan don ippolito looked imploringly into her face and made a touching gesture of deprecation but did not speak  im really afraid youre not well and i think its too bad of us to be going resumed mrs vervain but it cant be helped now we are all packed dont you see but i want to ask one favor of you don ippolito and that is said mrs vervain covertly taking a little rouleau from her pocket that youll leave these inventions of yours for a while and give yourself a vacation you need rest of mind go into the country somewhere do thats whats preying upon you but we must really be off now shake hands with floridaim going to be the last to part with you she said with a tearful smile  don ippolito and florida extended their hands neither spoke and as she sank back upon the seat from which she had half risen she drew more closely the folds of the veil which she had not lifted from her face  mrs vervain gave a little sob as don ippolito took her hand and kissed it and she had some difficulty in leaving with him the rouleau which she tried artfully to press into his palm goodby goodby she said dont drop it and attempted to close his fingers over it  but he let it lie carelessly in his open hand as the gondola moved off and there it still lay as he stood watching the boat slip under a bridge at the next corner and disappear while he stood there gazing at the empty arch a man of a wild and savage aspect approached it was said that this mans brain had been turned by the death of his brother who was betrayed to the austrians after the revolution of 48 by his wifes confessor he advanced with swift strides and at the moment he reached don ippolitos side he suddenly turned his face upon him and cursed him through his clenched teeth dog of a priest  don ippolito as if his whole race had renounced him in the maniacs words uttered a desolate cry and hiding his face in his hands tottered into his house  the rouleau had dropped from his palm it rolled down the shelving marble of the quay and slipped into the water  the young beggar who had held mrs vervains gondola to the shore while she talked looked up and down the deserted quay and at the doors and windows then he began to take off his clothes for a bath     xvii   ferris returned at nightfall to his house where he had not been since daybreak and flung himself exhausted upon the bed his face was burnt red with the sun and his eyes were bloodshot he fell into a doze and dreamed that he was still at malamocco whither he had gone that morning in a sort of craze with some fishermen who were to cast their nets there then he was rowing back to venice across the lagoon that seemed a molten fire under the keel he woke with a heavy groan and bade marina fetch him a light  she set it on the table and handed him the card mrs vervain had left he read it and read it again and then he laid it down and putting on his hat he took his cane and went out do not wait for me marina he said i may be late go to bed  he returned at midnight and lighting his candle took up the card and read it once more he could not tell whether to be glad or sorry that he had failed to see the vervains again he took it for granted that don ippolito was to follow he would not ask himself what motive had hastened their going the reasons were all that he should never more look upon the woman so hatefully lost to him but a strong instinct of his heart struggled against them  he lay down in his clothes and began to dream almost before he began to sleep he woke early and went out to walk he did not rest all day once he came home and found a letter from mrs vervain postmarked verona reiterating her lamentations and adieux and explaining that the priest had relinquished his purpose and would not go to america at all the deeper mystery in which this news left him was not less sinister than before  in the weeks that followed ferris had no other purpose than to reduce the days to hours the hours to minutes the burden that fell upon him when he woke lay heavy on his heart till night and oppressed him far into his sleep he could not give his trouble certain shape what was mostly with him was a formless loss which he could not resolve into any definite shame or wrong at times what he had seen seemed to him some baleful trick of the imagination some lurid and foolish illusion  but he could do nothing he could not ask himself what the end was to be he kept indoors by day trying to work trying to read marveling somewhat that he did not fall sick and die at night he set out on long walks which took him he cared not where and often detained him till the gray lights of morning began to tremble through the nocturnal blue but even by night he shunned the neighborhood in which the vervains had lived their landlord sent him a package of trifles they had left behind but he refused to receive them sending back word that he did not know where the ladies were he had half expected that mrs vervain though he had not answered her last letter might write to him again from england but she did not the vervains had passed out of his world he knew that they had been in it only by the torment they had left him  he wondered in a listless way that he should see nothing of don ippolito once at midnight he fancied that the priest was coming towards him across a campo he had just entered he stopped and turned back into the calle when the priest came up to him it was not don ippolito  in these days ferris received a dispatch from the department of state informing him that his successor had been appointed and directing him to deliver up the consular flags seals archives and other property of the united states no reason for his removal was given but as there had never been any reason for his appointment he had no right to complain the balance was exactly dressed by this simple device of our civil service he determined not to wait for the coming of his successor before giving up the consular effects and he placed them at once in the keeping of the worthy shipchandler who had so often transferred them from departing to arriving consuls then being quite ready at any moment to leave venice he found himself in nowise eager to go but he began in a desultory way to pack up his sketches and studies  one morning as he sat idle in his dismantled studio marina came to tell him that an old woman waiting at the door below wished to speak with him  well let her come up said ferris wearily and presently marina returned with a very illfavored beldam who stared hard at him while he frowningly puzzled himself as to where he had seen that malign visage before  well he said harshly  i come answered the old woman on the part of don ippolito rondinelli who desires so much to see your excellency  ferris made no response while the old woman knotted the fringe of her shawl with quaking hands and presently added with a tenderness in her voice which oddly discorded with the hardness of her face he has been very sick poor thing with a fever but now he is in his senses again and the doctors say he will get well i hope so but he is still very weak he tried to write two lines to you but he had not the strength so he bade me bring you this word that he had something to say which it greatly concerned you to hear and that he prayed you to forgive his not coming to revere you for it was impossible and that you should have the goodness to do him this favor to come to find him the quickest you could  the old woman wiped her eyes with the corner of her shawl and her chin wobbled pathetically while she shot a glance of baleful dislike at ferris who answered after a long dull stare at her tell him ill come  he did not believe that don ippolito could tell him anything that greatly concerned him but he was worn out with going round in the same circle of conjecture and so far as he could be glad he was glad of this chance to face his calamity he would go but not at once he would think it over he would go tomorrow when he had got some grasp of the matter  the old woman lingered  tell him ill come repeated ferris impatiently  a thousand excuses but my poor master has been very sick the doctors say he will get well i hope so but he is very weak indeed a little shock a little disappointment is the signore very very much occupied this morning he greatly desiredhe prayed that if such a thing were possible in the goodness of your excellency  but i am offending the signore  what do you want demanded ferris  the old wretch set up a pitiful whimper and tried to possess herself of his hand she kissed his coatsleeve instead that you will return with me she besought him  oh ill go groaned the painter i might as well go first as last he added in english there stop that enough enough i tell you didnt i say i was going with you he cried to the old woman  god bless you she mumbled and set off before him down the stairs and out of the door she looked so miserably old and weary that he called a gondola to his landing and made her get into it with him  it tormented don ippolitos idle neighborhood to see veneranda arrive in such state and a passionate excitement arose at the caffè where the person of the consul was known when ferris entered the priests house with her  he had not often visited don ippolito but the quaintness of the place had been so vividly impressed upon him that he had a certain familiarity with the grapearbor of the anteroom the paintings of the parlor and the puerile arrangement of the piano and melodeon veneranda led him through these rooms to the chamber where don ippolito had first shown him his inventions they were all removed now and on a bed set against the wall opposite the door lay the priest with his hands on his breast and a faint smile on his lips so peaceful so serene that the painter stopped with a sudden awe as if he had unawares come into the presence of death  advance advance whispered the old woman  near the head of the bed sat a whitehaired priest wearing the red stockings of a canonico his face was fanatically stern but he rose and bowed courteously to ferris  the stir of his robes roused don ippolito he slowly and weakly turned his head and his eyes fell upon the painter he made a helpless gesture of salutation with his thin hand and began to excuse himself for the trouble he had given with a gentle politeness that touched the painters heart through all the complex resentments that divided them it was indeed a strange ground on which the two men met ferris could not have described don ippolito as his enemy for the priest had wittingly done him no wrong he could not have logically hated him as a rival for till it was too late he had not confessed to his own heart the love that was in it he knew no evil of don ippolito he could not accuse him of any betrayal of trust or violation of confidence he felt merely that this hapless creature lying so deathlike before him had profaned however involuntarily what was sacredest in the world to him beyond this all was chaos he had heard of the priests sickness with a fierce hardening of the heart yet as he beheld him now he began to remember things that moved him to a sort of remorse he recalled again the simple loyalty with which don ippolito had first spoken to him of miss vervain and tried to learn his own feeling toward her he thought how trustfully at their last meeting the priest had declared his love and hope and how when he had coldly received his confession don ippolito had solemnly adjured him to be frank with him and ferris could not that pity for himself as the prey of fantastically cruel chances which he had already vaguely felt began now also to include the priest ignoring all but that compassion he went up to the bed and took the weak chill nerveless hand in his own  the canonico rose and placed his chair for ferris beside the pillow on which lay a brass crucifix and then softly left the room exchanging a glance of affectionate intelligence with the sick man  i might have waited a little while said don ippolito weakly speaking in a hollow voice that was the shadow of his old deep tones but you will know how to forgive the impatience of a man not yet quite master of himself i thank you for coming i have been very sick as you see i did not think to live i did not care i am very weak now let me say to you quickly what i want to say dear friend continued don ippolito fixing his eyes upon the painters face i spoke to her that night after i had parted from you  the priests voice was now firm the painter turned his face away  i spoke without hope proceeded don ippolito and because i must i spoke in vain all was lost all was past in a moment  the coil of suspicions and misgivings and fears in which ferris had lived was suddenly without a clew he could not look upon the pallid visage of the priest lest he should now at last find there that subtle expression of deceit the whirl of his thoughts kept him silent don ippolito went on  even if i had never been a priest i would still have been impossible to her she  he stopped as if for want of strength to go on all at once he cried listen and he rapidly recounted the story of his life ending with the fatal tragedy of his love when it was told he said calmly but now everything is over with me on earth i thank the infinite compassion for the sorrows through which i have passed i also have proved the miraculous power of the church potent to save in all ages he gathered the crucifix in his spectral grasp and pressed it to his lips many merciful things have befallen me on this bed of sickness my uncle whom the long years of my darkness divided from me is once more at peace with me even that poor old woman whom i sent to call you and who had served me as i believed with hate for me as a false priest in her heart has devoted herself day and night to my helplessness she has grown decrepit with her cares and vigils yes i have had many and signal marks of the divine pity to be grateful for he paused breathing quickly and then added they tell me that the danger of this sickness is past but none the less i have died in it when i rise from this bed it shall be to take the vows of a carmelite friar  ferris made no answer and don ippolito resumed  i have told you how when i first owned to her the falsehood in which i lived she besought me to try if i might not find consolation in the holy life to which i had been devoted when you see her dear friend will you not tell her that i came to understand that this comfort this refuge awaited me in the cell of the carmelite i have brought so much trouble into her life that i would fain have her know i have found peace where she bade me seek it that i have mastered my affliction by reconciling myself to it tell her that but for her pity and fear for me i believe that i must have died in my sins  it was perhaps inevitable from ferriss protestant association of monks and convents and penances chiefly with the machinery of fiction that all this affected him as unreally as talk in a stageplay his heart was cold as he answered i am glad that your mind is at rest concerning the doubts which so long troubled you not all men are so easily pacified but as you say it is the privilege of your church to work miracles as to miss vervain i am sorry that i cannot promise to give her your message i shall never see her again excuse me he continued but your servant said there was something you wished to say that concerned me  you will never see her again cried the priest struggling to lift himself upon his elbow and falling back upon the pillow oh bereft oh deaf and blind it was you that she loved she confessed it to me that night  wait said ferris trying to steady his voice and failing i was with mrs vervain that night she sent me into the garden to call her daughter and i saw how miss vervain parted from the man she did not love i saw  it was a horrible thing to have said it he felt now that he had spoken a sense of the indelicacy the shamefulness seemed to alienate him from all high concern in the matter and to leave him a mere self convicted eavesdropper his face flamed the wavering hopes the wavering doubts alike died in his heart he had fallen below the dignity of his own trouble  you saw you saw softly repeated the priest without looking at him and without any show of emotion apparently the convalescence that had brought him perfect clearness of reason had left his sensibilities still somewhat dulled he closed his lips and lay silent at last he asked very gently and how shall i make you believe that what you saw was not a womans love but an angels heavenly pity for me does it seem hard to believe this of her  yes answered the painter doggedly it is hard  and yet it is the very truth oh you do not know her you never knew her in the same moment that she denied me her love she divined the anguish of my soul and with that embrace she sought to console me for the friendlessness of a whole life past and to come but i know that i waste my words on you he cried bitterly you never would see me as i was you would find no singleness in me and yet i had a heart as full of loyalty to you as love for her in what have i been false to you  you never were false to me answered ferris and god knows i have been true to you and at what cost we might well curse the day we met don ippolito for we have only done each other harm but i never meant you harm and now i ask you to forgive me if i cannot believe you i cannotyet i am of another race from you slow to suspect slow to trust give me a little time let me see you again i want to go away and think i dont question your truth im afraid you dont know im afraid that the same deceit has tricked us both i must come to you to morrow can i  he rose and stood beside the couch  surely surely answered the priest looking into ferriss troubled eyes with calm meekness you will do me the greatest pleasure yes come again tomorrow you know he said with a sad smile referring to his purpose of taking vows that my time in the world is short adieu to meet again  he took ferriss hand hanging weak and hot by his side and drew him gently down by it and kissed him on either bearded cheek it is our custom you know among friends farewell  the canonico in the anteroom bowed austerely to him as he passed through the old woman refused with a harsh nothing the money he offered her at the door  he bitterly upbraided himself for the doubts he could not banish and he still flushed with shame that he should have declared his knowledge of a scene which ought at its worst to have been inviolable by his speech he scarcely cared now for the woman about whom these miseries grouped themselves he realized that a fantastic remorse may be stronger than a jealous love  he longed for the morrow to come that he might confess his shame and regret but a reaction to this violent repentance came before the night fell as the sound of the priests voice and the sight of his wasted face faded from the painters sense he began to see everything in the old light again then what don ippolito had said took a character of ludicrous of insolent improbability  after dark ferris set out upon one of his long rambling walks he walked hard and fast to try if he might not still by mere fatigue of body the anguish that filled his soul but whichever way he went he came again and again to the house of don ippolito and at last he stopped there leaning against the parapet of the quay and staring at the house as though he would spell from the senseless stones the truth of the secret they sheltered far up in the chamber where he knew that the priest lay the windows were dimly lit  as he stood thus with his upturned face haggard in the moonlight the soldier commanding the austrian patrol which passed that way halted his squad and seemed about to ask him what he wanted there  ferris turned and walked swiftly homeward but he did not even lie down his misery took the shape of an intent that would not suffer him to rest he meant to go to don ippolito and tell him that his story had failed of its effect that he was not to be fooled so easily and without demanding anything further to leave him in his lie  at the earliest hour when he might hope to be admitted he went and rang the bell furiously the door opened and he confronted the priests servant i want to see don ippolito said ferris abruptly  it cannot be she began  i tell you i must cried ferris raising his voice i tell you  madman fiercely whispered the old woman shaking both her open hands in his face hes dead he died last night     xviii   the terrible stroke sobered ferris he woke from his long debauch of hate and jealousy and despair for the first time since that night in the garden he faced his fate with a clear mind death had set his seal forever to a testimony which he had been able neither to refuse nor to accept in abject sorrow and shame he thanked god that he had been kept from dealing that last cruel blow but if don ippolito had come back from the dead to repeat his witness ferris felt that the miracle could not change his own passive state there was now but one thing in the world for him to do to see florida to confront her with his knowledge of all that had been and to abide by her word whatever it was at the worst there was the war whose drums had already called to him for a refuge  he thought at first that he might perhaps overtake the vervains before they sailed for america but he remembered that they had left venice six weeks before it seemed impossible that he could wait but when he landed in new york he was tormented in his impatience by a strange reluctance and hesitation a fantastic light fell upon his plans a sense of its wildness enfeebled his purpose what was he going to do had he come four thousand miles to tell florida that don ippolito was dead or was he going to say i have heard that you love me but i dont believe it is it true  he pushed on to providence stifling these antic misgivings as he might and without allowing himself time to falter from his intent he set out to find mrs vervains house he knew the street and the number for she had often given him the address in her invitations against the time when he should return to america as he drew near the house a tender trepidation filled him and silenced all other senses in him his heart beat thickly the universe included only the fact that he was to look upon the face he loved and this fact had neither past nor future  but a terrible foreboding as of death seized him when he stood before the house and glanced up at its closeshuttered front and round upon the dusty grassplots and neglected flowerbeds of the dooryard with a cold hand he rang and rang again and no answer came at last a man lounged up to the fence from the next housedoor guess you wont make anybody hear he said casually  doesnt mrs vervain live in this house asked ferris finding a husky voice in his throat that sounded to him like some others voice lost there  she used to but she isnt at home familys in europe  they had not come back yet  thanks said ferris mechanically and he went away he laughed to himself at this keen irony of fortune he was prepared for the confirmation of his doubts he was ready for relief from them heaven knew but this blank that the turn of the wheel had brought this nothing  the vervains were as lost to him as if europe were in another planet how should he find them there besides he was poor he had no money to get back with if he had wanted to return  he took the first train to new york and hunted up a young fellow of his acquaintance who in the days of peace had been one of the governors aides he was still holding this place and was an ardent recruiter he hailed with rapture the expression of ferriss wish to go into the war look here he said after a moments thought didnt you have some rank as a consul  yes replied ferris with a dreary smile i have been equivalent to a commander in the navy and a colonel in the armyi dont mean both but either  good cried his friend we must strike high the colonelcies are rather inaccessible just at present and so are the lieutenant colonelcies but a majorship now  oh no dont pleaded ferris make me a corporalor a cook i shall not be so mischievous to our own side then and when the other fellows shoot me i shall not be so much of a loss  oh they wont shoot you expostulated his friend high heartedly he got ferris a commission as second lieutenant and lent him money to buy a uniform  ferriss regiment was sent to a part of the southwest where he saw a good deal of fighting and fever and ague at the end of two years spent alternately in the field and the hospital he was riding out near the camp one morning in unusual spirits when two men in butternut fired at him one had the mortification to miss him the bullet of the other struck him in the arm there was talk of amputation at first but the case was finally managed without in ferriss state of health it was quite the same an end of his soldiering  he came north sick and maimed and poor he smiled now to think of confronting florida in any imperative or challenging spirit but the current of his hopeless melancholy turned more and more towards her he had once at a desperate venture written to her at providence but he had got no answer he asked of a providence man among the artists in new york if he knew the vervains the providence man said that he did know them a little when he was much younger they had been abroad a great deal he believed in a dim way that they were still in europe the young one he added used to have a temper of her own  indeed said ferris stiffly  the one fast friend whom he found in new york was the governors dashing aide the enthusiasm of this recruiter of regiments had not ceased with ferriss departure for the front the number of disabled officers forbade him to lionize any one of them but he befriended ferris he made a feint of discovering the open secret of his poverty and asked how he could help him  i dont know said ferris it looks like a hopeless case to me  oh no it isnt retorted his friend as cheerfully and confidently as he had promised him that he should not be shot didnt you bring back any pictures from venice with you  i brought back a lot of sketches and studies im sorry to say that i loafed a good deal there i used to feel that i had eternity before me and i was a theorist and a purist and an idiot generally there are none of them fit to be seen  never mind lets look at them  they hunted out ferriss property from a catchall closet in the studio of a sculptor with whom he had left them and who expressed a polite pleasure in handing them over to ferris rather than to his heirs and assigns  well im not sure that i share your satisfaction old fellow said the painter ruefully but he unpacked the sketches  their inspection certainly revealed a disheartening condition of half work and i cant do anything to help the matter for the present groaned ferris stopping midway in the business and making as if to shut the case again  hold on said his friend whats this why this isnt so bad it was the study of don ippolito as a venetian priest which ferris beheld with a stupid amaze remembering that he had meant to destroy it and wondering how it had got where it was but not really caring much its worse than you can imagine said he still looking at it with this apathy  no matter i want you to sell it to me come  i cant replied ferris piteously it would be flat burglary  then put it into the exhibition  the sculptor who had gone back to scraping the chin of the famous public man on whose bust he was at work stabbed him to the heart with his modelingtool and turned to ferris and his friend he slanted his broad red beard for a sidelong look at the picture and said i know what you mean ferris its hard and its feeble in some ways and it looks a little too much like experimenting but it isnt so infernally bad  dont be fulsome responded ferris jadedly he was thinking in a thoroughly vanquished mood what a tragicocomic end of the whole business it was that poor don ippolito should come to his rescue in this fashion and as it were offer to succor him in his extremity he perceived the shamefulness of suffering such help it would be much better to starve but he felt cowed and he had not courage to take arms against this sarcastic destiny which had pursued him with a mocking smile from one lower level to another he rubbed his forehead and brooded upon the picture at least it would be some comfort to be rid of it and don ippolito was dead and to whom could it mean more than the face of it  his friend had his way about framing it and it was got into the exhibition the hangingcommittee offered it the hospitalities of an obscure corner but it was there and it stood its chance nobody seemed to know that it was there however unless confronted with it by ferriss friend and then no one seemed to care for it much less want to buy it ferris saw so many much worse pictures sold all around it that he began gloomily to respect it at first it had shocked him to see it on the academys wall but it soon came to have no other relation to him than that of creatureship like a poem in which a poet celebrates his love or laments his dead and sells for a price his pride as well as his poverty was set on having the picture sold he had nothing to do and he used to lurk about and see if it would not interest somebody at last but it remained unsold throughout may and well into june long after the crowds had ceased to frequent the exhibition and only chance visitors from the country straggled in by twos and threes  one warm dusty afternoon when he turned into the academy out of fourth avenue the empty hall echoed to no footfall but his own a group of weary women who wore that look of wanting lunch which characterizes all picturegallerygoers at home and abroad stood faint before a certain large venetian subject which ferris abhorred and the very name of which he spat out of his mouth with loathing for its unreality he passed them with a sombre glance as he took his way toward the retired spot where his own painting hung  a lady whose crapes would have betrayed to her own sex the latest touch of paris stood a little way back from it and gazed fixedly at it the pose of her head her whole attitude expressed a quiet dejection without seeing her face one could know its air of pensive wistfulness ferris resolved to indulge himself in a near approach to this unwonted spectacle of interest in his picture at the sound of his steps the lady slowly turned a face of somewhat heavily molded beauty and from lowgrowing thick pale hair and level brows stared at him with the sad eyes of florida vervain she looked fully the last two years older  as though she were listening to the sound of his steps in the dark instead of having him there visibly before her she kept her eyes upon him with a dreamy unrecognition  yes it is i said ferris as if she had spoken  she recovered herself and with a subdued sorrowful quiet in her old directness she answered i supposed you must be in new york and she indicated that she had supposed so from seeing this picture  ferris felt the blood mounting to his head do you think it is like he asked  no she said it isnt just to him it attributes things that didnt belong to him and it leaves out a great deal  i could scarcely have hoped to please you in a portrait of don ippolito ferris saw the red light break out as it used on the girls pale cheeks and her eyes dilate angrily he went on recklessly he sent for me after you went away and gave me a message for you i never promised to deliver it but i will do so now he asked me to tell you when we met that he had acted on your desire and had tried to reconcile himself to his calling and his religion he was going to enter a carmelite convent  florida made no answer but she seemed to expect him to go on and he was constrained to do so  he never carried out his purpose ferris said with a keen glance at her he died the night after i saw him  died the fan and the parasol and the two or three light packages she had been holding slid down one by one and lay at her feet thank you for bringing me his last words she said but did not ask him anything more  ferris did not offer to gather up her things he stood irresolute presently he continued with a downcast look he had had a fever but they thought he was getting well his death must have been sudden he stopped and resumed fiercely resolved to have the worst out i went to him with no goodwill toward him the next day after i saw him but i came too late that was gods mercy to me i hope you have your consolation miss vervain  it maddened him to see her so little moved and he meant to make her share his remorse  did he blame me for anything she asked  no said ferris with a bitter laugh he praised you  i am glad of that returned florida for i have thought it all over many times and i know that i was not to blame though at first i blamed myself i never intended him anything but good that is my consolation mr ferris but you she added you seem to make yourself my judge well and what do you blame me for i have a right to know what is in your mind  the thing that was in his mind had rankled there for two years in many a black reverie of those that alternated with his moods of abject self reproach and perfect trust of her he had confronted her and flung it out upon her in one stinging phrase but he was now suddenly at a loss the words would not come his torment fell dumb before her in her presence the cause was unspeakable her lips had quivered a little in making that demand and there had been a corresponding break in her voice  florida florida ferris heard himself saying i loved you all the time  oh indeed did you love me she cried indignantly while the tears shone in her eyes and was that why you left a helpless young girl to meet that trouble alone was that why you refused me your advice and turned your back on me and snubbed me oh many thanks for your love she dashed the gathered tears angrily away and went on perhaps you knew too what that poor priest was thinking of  yes said ferris stolidly i did at last he told me  oh then you acted generously and nobly to let him go on it was kind to him and very very kind to me  what could i do demanded ferris amazed and furious to find himself on the defensive his telling me put it out of my power to act  im glad that you can satisfy yourself with such a quibble but i wonder that you can tell meany woman of it  by heavens this is atrocious cried ferris do you think  look here he went on rudely ill put the case to you and you shall judge it remember that i was such a fool as to be in love with you suppose don ippolito had told me that he was going to risk everything going to give up home religion friendson the ten thousandth part of a chance that you might some day care for him i did not believe he had even so much chance as that but he had always thought me his friend and he trusted me was it a quibble that kept me from betraying him i dont know what honor is among women but no man could have done it i confess to my shame that i went to your house that night longing to betray him and then suppose your mother sent me into the garden to call you and i saw  what has made my life a hell of doubt for the last two years what  no excuse me i cant put the case to you after all  what do you mean asked florida i dont understand you  what do i mean you dont understand are you so blind as that or are you making a fool of me what could i think but that you had played with that priests heart till your own  oh cried florida with a shudder starting away from him did you think i was such a wicked girl as that  it was no defense no explanation no denial it simply left the case with ferris as before he stood looking like a man who does not know whether to bless or curse himself to laugh or blaspheme  she stooped and tried to pick up the things she had let fall upon the floor but she seemed not able to find them he bent over and gathering them together returned them to her with his left hand keeping the other in the breast of his coat  thanks she said and then after a moment have you been hurt she asked timidly  yes said ferris in a sulky way i have had my share he glanced down at his arm askance its rather conventional he added it isnt much of a hurt but then i wasnt much of a soldier  the girls eyes looked reverently at the conventional arm those were the days so long past when women worshipped men for such things but she said nothing and as ferriss eyes wandered to her he received a novel and painful impression he said hesitatingly i have not asked before but your mother miss vervaini hope she is well  she is dead answered florida with stony quiet  they were both silent for a time then ferris said i had a great affection for your mother  yes said the girl she was fond of you too but you never wrote or sent her any word it used to grieve her  her unjust reproach went to his heart so long preoccupied with its own troubles he recalled with a tender remorse the old venetian days and the kindliness of the gracious silly woman who had seemed to like him so much he remembered the charm of her perfect ladylikeness and of her winning weakheaded desire to make every one happy to whom she spoke the beauty of the goodwill the hospitable soul that in an imaginably better world than this will outvalue a merely intellectual or aesthetic life he humbled himself before her memory and as keenly reproached himself as if he could have made her hear from him at any time during the past two years he could only say i am sorry that i gave your mother pain i loved her very truly i hope that she did not suffer much before  no said florida it was a peaceful end but finally it was very sudden she had not been well for many years with that sort of decline i used sometimes to feel troubled about her before we came to venice but i was very young i never was really alarmed till that day i went to you  i remember said ferris contritely  she had fainted and i thought we ought to see a doctor but afterwards because i thought that i ought not to do so without speaking to her i did not go to the doctor and that day we made up our minds to get home as soon as we could and she seemed so much better for a while and then everything seemed to happen at once when we did start home she could not go any farther than switzerland and in the fall we went back to italy we went to sorrento where the climate seemed to do her good but she was growing frailer the whole time she died in march i found some old friends of hers in naples and came home with them  the girl hesitated a little over the words which she nevertheless uttered unbroken while the tears fell quietly down her face she seemed to have forgotten the angry words that had passed between her and ferris to remember him only as one who had known her mother while she went on to relate some little facts in the history of her mothers last days and she rose into a higher serener atmosphere inaccessible to his resentment or his regret as she spoke of her loss the simple tale of sickness and death inexpressibly belittled his passionate woes and made them look theatrical to him he hung his head as they turned at her motion and walked away from the picture of don ippolito and down the stairs toward the streetdoor the people before the other venetian picture had apparently yielded to their craving for lunch and had vanished  i have very little to tell you of my own life ferris began awkwardly i came home soon after you started and i went to providence to find you but you had not got back  florida stopped him and looked perplexedly into his face and then moved on  then i went into the army i wrote once to you  i never got your letter she said  they were now in the lower hall and near the door  florida said ferris abruptly im poor and disabled ive no more right than any sick beggar in the street to say it to you but i loved you i must always love you igoodby  she halted him again and you said she grieved that you doubted me you said that i had made your life a  yes i said that i know it answered ferris  you thought i could be such a false and cruel girl as that  yes yes i thought it all god help me  when i was only sorry for him when it was you that i  oh i know it answered ferris in a heartsick hopeless voice he knew it too he told me so the day before he died  and didnt you believe him  ferris could not answer  do you believe him now  i believe anything you tell me when i look at you i cant believe i ever doubted you  why  becausebecausei love you  oh thats no reason  i know it but im used to being without a reason  florida looked gravely at his penitent face and a brave red color mantled her own while she advanced an unanswerable argument then what are you going away for  the world seemed to melt and float away from between them it returned and solidified at the sound of the janitors steps as he came towards them on his round through the empty building ferris caught her hand she leaned heavily upon his arm as they walked out into the street it was all they could do at the moment except to look into each others faces and walk swiftly on  at last after how long a time he did not know ferris cried where are we going florida  why i dont know she replied im stopping with those friends of ours at the fifth avenue hotel we were going on to providence tomorrow we landed yesterday and we stayed to do some shopping  and may i ask why you happened to give your first moments in america to the fine arts  the fine arts oh i thought i might find something of yours there  at the hotel she presented him to her party as a friend whom her mother and she had known in italy and then went to lay aside her hat the providence people received him with the easy halfsouthern warmth of manner which seems to have floated northward as far as their city on the gulf stream bathing the rhode island shores the matron of the party had before florida came back an outline history of their acquaintance which she evolved from him with so much tact that he was not conscious of parting with information and she divined indefinitely more when she saw them together again she was charming but to ferriss thinking she had a fault she kept him too much from florida though she talked of nothing else and at the last she was discreetly merciful  do you think whispered florida very close against his face when they parted that ill have a bad temper  i hope you willor i shall be killed with kindness he replied  she stood a moment nervously buttoning his coat across his breast you mustnt let that picture be sold henry she said and by this touch alone did she express any sense if she had it of his want of feeling in proposing to sell it he winced and she added with a soft pity in her voice he did bring us together after all i wish you had believed him dear  so do i said ferris most humbly                                       people are never equal to the romance of their youth in after life except by fits and ferris especially could not keep himself at what he called the operatic pitch of their brief betrothal and the early days of their marriage with his help or even his encouragement his wife might have been able to maintain it she had a gift for idealizing him at least and as his hurt healed but slowly and it was a good while before he could paint with his wounded arm it was an easy matter for her to believe in the meanwhile that he would have been the greatest painter of his time but for his honorable disability to hear her you would suppose no one else had ever been shot in the service of his country  it was fortunate for ferris since he could not work that she had money in exalted moments he had thought this a barrier to their marriage yet he could not recall any one who had refused the hand of a beautiful girl because of the accident of her wealth and in the end he silenced his scruples it might be said that in many other ways he was not her equal but one ought to reflect how very few men are worthy of their wives in any sense after his fashion he certainly loved her alwayseven when she tried him most for it must be owned that she really had that hot temper which he had dreaded in her from the first not that her imperiousness directly affected him for a long time after their marriage she seemed to have no other desire than to lose her outwearied will in his there was something a little pathetic in this there was a kind of bewilderment in her gentleness as though the relaxed tension of her long selfdevotion to her mother left her without a full motive she apparently found it impossible to give herself with a satisfactory degree of abandon to a man who could do so many things for himself when her children came they filled this vacancy and afforded her scope for the greatest excesses of self devotion ferris laughed to find her protecting them and serving them with the same tigerish tenderness the same haughty humility as that with which she used to care for poor mrs vervain and he perceived that this was merely the direction away from herself of that intense arrogance of nature which but for her power and need of loving would have made her intolerable what she chiefly exacted from them in return for her fierce devotedness was the truth in everything she was content that they should be rather less fond of her than of their father whom indeed they found much more amusing  the ferrises went to europe some years after their marriage revisiting venice but sojourning for the most part in florence ferris had once imagined that the tragedy which had given him his wife would always invest her with the shadow of its sadness but in this he was mistaken there is nothing has really so strong a digestion as love and this is very lucky seeing what manifold experiences love has to swallow and assimilate and when they got back to venice ferris found that the customs of their joint life exorcised all the dark associations of the place these simply formed a sombre background against which their wedded happiness relieved itself they talked much of the past with free minds unashamed and unafraid if it is a little shocking it is nevertheless true and true to human nature that they spoke of don ippolito as if he were a part of their love  ferris had never ceased to wonder at what he called the unfathomable innocence of his wife and he liked to go over all the points of their former life in venice and bring home to himself the utter simplicity of her girlish ideas motives and designs which both confounded and delighted him  its amazing florida he would say its perfectly amazing that you should have been willing to undertake the job of importing into america that poor fellow with his whole stock of helplessness dreamery and unpracticality what were you about  why ive often told you henry i thought he oughtnt to continue a priest  yes yes i know then he would remain lost in thought softly whistling to himself on one of these occasions he asked do you think he was really very much troubled by his false position  i cant tell now he seemed to be so  that story he told you of his childhood and of how he became a priest didnt it strike you at the time like rather a madeup melodramatic history  no no how can you say such things henry it was too simple not to be true  well well perhaps so but he baffles me he always did for that matter  then came another pause while ferris lay back upon the gondola cushions getting the level of the lido just under his hatbrim  do you think he was very much of a skeptic after all florida  mrs ferris turned her eyes reproachfully upon her husband why henry how strange you are you said yourself once that you used to wonder if he were not a skeptic  yes i know but for a man who had lived in doubt so many years he certainly slipped back into the bosom of mother church pretty suddenly dont you think he was a person of rather light feelings  i cant talk with you my dear if you go on in that way  i dont mean any harm i can see how in many things he was the soul of truth and honor but it seems to me that even the life he lived was largely imagined i mean that he was such a dreamer that once having fancied himself afflicted at being what he was he could go on and suffer as keenly as if he really were troubled by it why mightnt it be that all his doubts came from anger and resentment towards those who made him a priest rather than from any examination of his own mind i dont say it was so but i dont believe he knew quite what he wanted he must have felt that his failure as an inventor went deeper than the failure of his particular attempts i once thought that perhaps he had a genius in that way but i question now whether he had if he had it seems to me he had opportunity to prove itcertainly as a priest he had leisure to prove it but when that sort of sub consciousness of his own inadequacy came over him it was perfectly natural for him to take refuge in the supposition that he had been baffled by circumstances  mrs ferris remained silently troubled i dont know how to answer you henry but i think that youre judging him narrowly and harshly  not harshly i feel very compassionate towards him but now even as to what one might consider the most real thing in his lifehis caring for youit seems to me there must have been a great share of imagined sentiment in it it was not a passion it was a gentle natures dream of a passion  he didnt die of a dream said the wife  no he died of a fever  he had got well of the fever  thats very true my dear and whatever his head was he had an affectionate and faithful heart i wish i had been gentler with him i must often have bruised that sensitive soul god knows im sorry for it but hes a puzzle hes a puzzle  thus lapsing more and more into a mere problem as the years have passed don ippolito has at last ceased to be even the memory of a man with a passionate love and a mortal sorrow perhaps this final effect in the mind of him who has realized the happiness of which the poor priest vainly dreamed is not the least tragic phase of the tragedy of don ippolito
