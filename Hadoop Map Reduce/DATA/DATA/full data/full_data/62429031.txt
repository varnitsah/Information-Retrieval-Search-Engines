62429031	on the study of zoology  by thomas h huxley  1   natural history is the name familiarly applied to the study of the properties of such natural bodies as minerals plants and animals the sciences which embody the knowledge man has acquired upon these subjects are commonly termed natural sciences in contradistinction to other socalled physical sciences and those who devote themselves especially to the pursuit of such sciences have been and are commonly termed naturalists  linnaeus was a naturalist in this wide sense and his systema naturae was a work upon natural history in the broadest acceptation of the term in it that great methodising spirit embodied all that was known in his time of the distinctive characters of minerals animals and plants but the enormous stimulus which linnaeus gave to the investigation of nature soon rendered it impossible that any one man should write another systema naturae and extremely difficult for any one to become even a naturalist such as linnaeus was  great as have been the advances made by all the three branches of science of old included under the title of natural history there can be no doubt that zoology and botany have grown in an enormously greater ratio than mineralogy and hence as i suppose the name of natural history has gradually become more and more definitely attached to these prominent divisions of the subject and by naturalist people have meant more and more distinctly to imply a student of the structure and function of living beings  however this may be it is certain that the advance of knowledge has gradually widened the distance between mineralogy and its old associates while it has drawn zoology and botany closer together so that of late years it has been found convenient and indeed necessary to associate the sciences which deal with vitality and all its phenomena under the common head of biology and the biologists have come to repudiate any bloodrelationship with their fosterbrothers the mineralogists  certain broad laws have a general application throughout both the animal and the vegetable worlds but the ground common to these kingdoms of nature is not of very wide extent and the multiplicity of details is so great that the student of living beings finds himself obliged to devote his attention exclusively either to the one or the other if he elects to study plants under any aspect we know at once what to call him he is a botanist and his science is botany but if the investigation of animal life be his choice the name generally applied to him will vary according to the kind of animals he studies or the particular phenomena of animal life to which he confines his attention if the study of man is his object he is called an anatomist or a physiologist or an ethnologist but if he dissects animals or examines into the mode in which their functions are performed he is a comparative anatomist or comparative physiologist if he turns his attention to fossil animals he is a palaeontologist if his mind is more particularly directed to the specific description discrimination classification and distribution of animals he is termed a zoologist  for the purpose of the present discourse however i shall recognise none of these titles save the last which i shall employ as the equivalent of botanist and i shall use the term zoology as denoting the whole doctrine of animal life in contradistinction to botany which signifies the whole doctrine of vegetable life  employed in this sense zoology like botany is divisible into three great but subordinate sciences morphology physiology and distribution each of which may to a very great extent be studied independently of the other  zoological morphology is the doctrine of animal form or structure anatomy is one of its branches development is another while classification is the expression of the relations which different animals bear to one another in respect of their anatomy and their development  zoological distribution is the study of animals in relation to the terrestrial conditions which obtain now or have obtained at any previous epoch of the earths history  zoological physiology lastly is the doctrine of the functions or actions of animals it regards animal bodies as machines impelled by certain forces and performing an amount of work which can be expressed in terms of the ordinary forces of nature the final object of physiology is to deduce the facts of morphology on the one hand and those of distribution on the other from the laws of the molecular forces of matter  such is the scope of zoology but if i were to content myself with the enunciation of these dry definitions i should ill exemplify that method of teaching this branch of physical science which it is my chief business tonight to recommend let us turn away then from abstract definitions let us take some concrete living thing some animal the commoner the better and let us see how the application of common sense and common logic to the obvious facts it presents inevitably leads us into all these branches of zoological science  i have before me a lobster when i examine it what appears to be the most striking character it presents why i observe that this part which we call the tail of the lobster is made up of six distinct hard rings and a seventh terminal piece if i separate one of the middle rings say the third i find it carries upon its under surface a pair of limbs or appendages each of which consists of a stalk and two terminal pieces so that i can represent a transverse section of the ring and its appendages upon the diagram board in this way  if i now take the fourth ring i find it has the same structure and so have the fifth and the second so that in each of these divisions of the tail i find parts which correspond with one another a ring and two appendages and in each appendage a stalk and two end pieces these corresponding parts are called in the technical language of anatomy homologous parts the ring of the third division is the homologue of the ring of the fifth the appendage of the former is the homologue of the appendage of the latter and as each division exhibits corresponding parts in corresponding places we say that all the divisions are constructed upon the same plan but now let us consider the sixth division it is similar to and yet different from the others the ring is essentially the same as in the other divisions but the appendages look at first as if they were very different and yet when we regard them closely what do we find a stalk and two terminal divisions exactly as in the others but the stalk is very short and very thick the terminal divisions are very broad and flat and one of them is divided into two pieces  i may say therefore that the sixth segment is like the others in plan but that it is modified in its details  the first segment is like the others so far as its ring is concerned and though its appendages differ from any of those yet examined in the simplicity of their structure parts corresponding with the stem and one of the divisions of the appendages of the other segments can be readily discerned in them  thus it appears that the lobsters tail is composed of a series of segments which are fundamentally similar though each presents peculiar modifications of the plan common to all but when i turn to the forepart of the body i see at first nothing but a great shieldlike shell called technically the carapace ending in front in a sharp spine on either side of which are the curious compound eyes set upon the ends of stout movable stalks behind these on the under side of the body are two pairs of long feelers or antennae followed by six pairs of jaws folded against one another over the mouth and five pairs of legs the foremost of these being the great pinchers or claws of the lobster  it looks at first a little hopeless to attempt to find in this complex mass a series of rings each with its pair of appendages such as i have shown you in the abdomen and yet it is not difficult to demonstrate their existence strip off the legs and you will find that each pair is attached to a very definite segment of the under wall of the body but these segments instead of being the lower parts of free rings as in the tail are such parts of rings which are all solidly united and bound together and the like is true of the jaws the feelers and the eyestalks every pair of which is borne upon its own special segment thus the conclusion is gradually forced upon us that the body of the lobster is composed of as many rings as there are pairs of appendages namely twenty in all but that the six hindmost rings remain free and movable while the fourteen front rings become firmly soldered together their backs forming one continuous shieldthe carapace  unity of plan diversity in execution is the lesson taught by the study of the rings of the body and the same instruction is given still more emphatically by the appendages if i examine the outermost jaw i find it consists of three distinct portions an inner a middle and an outer mounted upon a common stem and if i compare this jaw with the legs behind it or the jaws in front of it i find it quite easy to see that in the legs it is the part of the appendage which corresponds with the inner division which becomes modified into what we know familiarly as the leg while the middle division disappears and the outer division is hidden under the carapace nor is it more difficult to discern that in the appendages of the tail the middle division appears again and the outer vanishes while on the other hand in the foremost jaw the socalled mandible the inner division only is left and in the same way the parts of the feelers and of the eyestalks can be identified with those of the legs and jaws  but whither does all this tend to the very remarkable conclusion that a unity of plan of the same kind as that discoverable in the tail or abdomen of the lobster pervades the whole organization of its skeleton so that i can return to the diagram representing any one of the rings of the tail which i drew upon the board and by adding a third division to each appendage i can use it as a sort of scheme or plan of any ring of the body i can give names to all the parts of that figure and then if i take any segment of the body of the lobster i can point out to you exactly what modification the general plan has undergone in that particular segment what part has remained movable and what has become fixed to another what has been excessively developed and metamorphosed and what has been suppressed  but i imagine i hear the question how is all this to be tested no doubt it is a pretty and ingenious way of looking at the structure of any animal but is it anything more does nature acknowledge in any deeper way this unity of plan we seem to trace  the objection suggested by these questions is a very valid and important one and morphology was in an unsound state so long as it rested upon the mere perception of the analogies which obtain between fully formed parts the unchecked ingenuity of speculative anatomists proved itself fully competent to spin any number of contradictory hypotheses out of the same facts and endless morphological dreams threatened to supplant scientific theory  happily however there is a criterion of morphological truth and a sure test of all homologies our lobster has not always been what we see it it was once an egg a semifluid mass of yolk not so big as a pins head contained in a transparent membrane and exhibiting not the least trace of any one of those organs whose multiplicity and complexity in the adult are so surprising after a time a delicate patch of cellular membrane appeared upon one face of this yolk and that patch was the foundation of the whole creature the clay out of which it would be moulded gradually investing the yolk it became subdivided by transverse constrictions into segments the forerunners of the rings of the body upon the ventral surface of each of the rings thus sketched out a pair of budlike prominences made their appearancethe rudiments of the appendages of the ring at first all the appendages were alike but as they grew most of them became distinguished into a stem and two terminal divisions to which in the middle part of the body was added a third outer division and it was only at a later period that by the modification or absorption of certain of these primitive constituents the limbs acquired their perfect form  thus the study of development proves that the doctrine of unity of plan is not merely a fancy that it is not merely one way of looking at the matter but that it is the expression of deepseated natural facts the legs and jaws of the lobster may not merely be regarded as modifications of a common typein fact and in nature they are sothe leg and the jaw of the young animal being at first indistinguishable  these are wonderful truths the more so because the zoologist finds them to be of universal application the investigation of a polype of a snail of a fish of a horse or of a man would have led us though by a less easy path perhaps to exactly the same point unity of plan everywhere lies hidden under the mask of diversity of structurethe complex is everywhere evolved out of the simple every animal has at first the form of an egg and every animal and every organic part in reaching its adult state passes through conditions common to other animals and other adult parts and this leads me to another point i have hitherto spoken as if the lobster were alone in the world but as i need hardly remind you there are myriads of other animal organisms of these some such as men horses birds fishes snails slugs oysters corals and sponges are not in the least like the lobster but other animals though they may differ a good deal from the lobster are yet either very like it or are like something that is like it the cray fish the rock lobster and the prawn and the shrimp for example however different are yet so like lobsters that a child would group them as of the lobster kind in contradistinction to snails and slugs and these last again would form a kind by themselves in contradistinction to cows horses and sheep the cattle kind  but this spontaneous grouping into kinds is the first essay of the human mind at classification or the calling by a common name of those things that are alike and the arranging them in such a manner as best to suggest the sum of their likenesses and unlikenesses to other things  those kinds which include no other subdivisions than the sexes or various breeds are called in technical language species the english lobster is a species our cray fish is another our prawn is another in other countries however there are lobsters cray fish and prawns very like ours and yet presenting sufficient differences to deserve distinction naturalists therefore express this resemblance and this diversity by grouping them as distinct species of the same genus but the lobster and the cray fish though belonging to distinct genera have many features in common and hence are grouped together in an assemblage which is called a family more distant resemblances connect the lobster with the prawn and the crab which are expressed by putting all these into the same order again more remote but still very definite resemblances unite the lobster with the woodlouse the king crab the water flea and the barnacle and separate them from all other animals whence they collectively constitute the larger group or class crustacea but the crustacea exhibit many peculiar features in common with insects spiders and centipedes so that these are grouped into the still larger assemblage or province articulata and finally the relations which these have to worms and other lower animals are expressed by combining the whole vast aggregate into the subkingdom of annulosa  if i had worked my way from a sponge instead of a lobster i should have found it associated by like ties with a great number of other animals into the subkingdom protozoa if i had selected a freshwater polype or a coral the members of what naturalists term the subkingdom coelenterata would have grouped themselves around my type had a snail been chosen the inhabitants of all univalve and bivalve land and water shells the lamp shells the squids and the seamat would have gradually linked themselves on to it as members of the same subkingdom of mollusca and finally starting from man i should have been compelled to admit first the ape the rat the horse the dog into the same class and then the bird the crocodile the turtle the frog and the fish into the same subkingdom of vertebrata  and if i had followed out all these various lines of classification fully i should discover in the end that there was no animal either recent or fossil which did not at once fall into one or other of these subkingdoms in other words every animal is organized upon one or other of the five or more plans whose existence renders our classification possible and so definitely and precisely marked is the structure of each animal that in the present state of our knowledge there is not the least evidence to prove that a form in the slightest degree transitional between any of the two groups vertebrata annulosa mollusca and coelenterata either exists or has existed during that period of the earths history which is recorded by the geologist nevertheless you must not for a moment suppose because no such transitional forms are known that the members of the subkingdoms are disconnected from or independent of one another on the contrary in their earliest condition they are all alike and the primordial germs of a man a dog a bird a fish a beetle a snail and a polype are in no essential structural respects distinguishable  in this broad sense it may with truth be said that all living animals and all those dead creations which geology reveals are bound together by an allpervading unity of organization of the same character though not equal in degree to that which enables us to discern one and the same plan amidst the twenty different segments of a lobsters body truly it has been said that to a clear eye the smallest fact is a window through which the infinite may be seen  turning from these purely morphological considerations let us now examine into the manner in which the attentive study of the lobster impels us into other lines of research  lobsters are found in all the european seas but on the opposite shores of the atlantic and in the seas of the southern hemisphere they do not exist they are however represented in these regions by very closely allied but distinct formsthe homarus americanus and the homarus capensis so that we may say that the european has one species of homarus the american another the african another and thus the remarkable facts of geographical distribution begin to dawn upon us  again if we examine the contents of the earths crust we shall find in the latter of those deposits which have served as the great burying grounds of past ages numberless lobsterlike animals but none so similar to our living lobster as to make zoologists sure that they belonged even to the same genus if we go still further back in time we discover in the oldest rocks of all the remains of animals constructed on the same general plan as the lobster and belonging to the same great group of crustacea but for the most part totally different from the lobster and indeed from any other living form of crustacean and thus we gain a notion of that successive change of the animal population of the globe in past ages which is the most striking fact revealed by geology  consider now where our inquiries have led us we studied our type morphologically when we determined its anatomy and its development and when comparing it in these respects with other animals we made out its place in a system of classification if we were to examine every animal in a similar manner we should establish a complete body of zoological morphology  again we investigated the distribution of our type in space and in time and if the like had been done with every animal the sciences of geographical and geological distribution would have attained their limit  but you will observe one remarkable circumstance that up to this point the question of the life of these organisms has not come under consideration morphology and distribution might be studied almost as well if animals and plants were a peculiar kind of crystals and possessed none of those functions which distinguish living beings so remarkably but the facts of morphology and distribution have to be accounted for and the science whose aim it is to account for them is physiology  let us return to our lobster once more if we watched the creature in its native element we should see it climbing actively the submerged rocks among which it delights to live by means of its strong legs or swimming by powerful strokes of its great tail the appendages of whose sixth joint are spread out into a broad fanlike propeller seize it and it will show you that its great claws are no mean weapons of offence suspend a piece of carrion among its haunts and it will greedily devour it tearing and crushing the flesh by means of its multitudinous jaws  suppose that we had known nothing of the lobster but as an inert mass an organic crystal if i may use the phrase and that we could suddenly see it exerting all these powers what wonderful new ideas and new questions would arise in our minds the great new question would be how does all this take place the chief new idea would be the idea of adaptation to purposethe notion that the constituents of animal bodies are not mere unconnected parts but organs working together to an end let us consider the tail of the lobster again from this point of view morphology has taught us that it is a series of segments composed of homologous parts which undergo various modificationsbeneath and through which a common plan of formation is discernible but if i look at the same part physiologically i see that it is a most beautifully constructed organ of locomotion by means of which the animal can swiftly propel itself either backwards or forwards  but how is this remarkable propulsive machine made to perform its functions if i were suddenly to kill one of these animals and to take out all the soft parts i should find the shell to be perfectly inert to have no more power of moving itself than is possessed by the machinery of a mill when disconnected from its steamengine or waterwheel but if i were to open it and take out the viscera only leaving the white flesh i should perceive that the lobster could bend and extend its tail as well as before if i were to cut off the tail i should cease to find any spontaneous motion in it but on pinching any portion of the flesh i should observe that it underwent a very curious changeeach fibre becoming shorter and thicker by this act of contraction as it is termed the parts to which the ends of the fibre are attached are of course approximated and according to the relations of their points of attachment to the centres of motions of the different rings the bending or the extension of the tail results close observation of the newlyopened lobster would soon show that all its movements are due to the same causethe shortening and thickening of these fleshy fibres which are technically called muscles  here then is a capital fact the movements of the lobster are due to muscular contractility but why does a muscle contract at one time and not at another why does one whole group of muscles contract when the lobster wishes to extend his tail and another group when he desires to bend it what is it originates directs and controls the motive power  experiment the great instrument for the ascertainment of truth in physical science answers this question for us in the head of the lobster there lies a small mass of that peculiar tissue which is known as nervous substance cords of similar matter connect this brain of the lobster directly or indirectly with the muscles now if these communicating cords are cut the brain remaining entire the power of exerting what we call voluntary motion in the parts below the section is destroyed and on the other hand if the cords remaining entire the brain mass be destroyed the same voluntary mobility is equally lost whence the inevitable conclusion is that the power of originating these motions resides in the brain and is propagated along the nervous cords  in the higher animals the phenomena which attend this transmission have been investigated and the exertion of the peculiar energy which resides in the nerves has been found to be accompanied by a disturbance of the electrical state of their molecules  if we could exactly estimate the signification of this disturbance if we could obtain the value of a given exertion of nerve force by determining the quantity of electricity or of heat of which it is the equivalent if we could ascertain upon what arrangement or other condition of the molecules of matter the manifestation of the nervous and muscular energies depends and doubtless science will some day or other ascertain these points physiologists would have attained their ultimate goal in this direction they would have determined the relation of the motive force of animals to the other forms of force found in nature and if the same process had been successfully performed for all the operations which are carried on in and by the animal frame physiology would be perfect and the facts of morphology and distribution would be deducible from the laws which physiologists had established combined with those determining the condition of the surrounding universe  there is not a fragment of the organism of this humble animal whose study would not lead us into regions of thought as large as those which i have briefly opened up to you but what i have been saying i trust has not only enabled you to form a conception of the scope and purport of zoology but has given you an imperfect example of the manner in which in my opinion that science or indeed any physical science may be best taught the great matter is to make teaching real and practical by fixing the attention of the student on particular facts but at the same time it should be rendered broad and comprehensive by constant reference to the generalizations of which all particular facts are illustrations the lobster has served as a type of the whole animal kingdom and its anatomy and physiology have illustrated for us some of the greatest truths of biology the student who has once seen for himself the facts which i have described has had their relations explained to him and has clearly comprehended them has so far a knowledge of zoology which is real and genuine however limited it may be and which is worth more than all the mere reading knowledge of the science he could ever acquire his zoological information is so far knowledge and not mere hearsay  and if it were my business to fit you for the certificate in zoological science granted by this department i should pursue a course precisely similar in principle to that which i have taken tonight i should select a freshwater sponge a freshwater polype or a cyanaea a freshwater mussel a lobster a fowl as types of the five primary divisions of the animal kingdom i should explain their structure very fully and show how each illustrated the great principles of zoology having gone very carefully and fully over this ground i should feel that you had a safe foundation and i should then take you in the same way but less minutely over similarly selected illustrative types of the classes and then i should direct your attention to the special forms enumerated under the head of types in this syllabus and to the other facts there mentioned  that would speaking generally be my plan but i have undertaken to explain to you the best mode of acquiring and communicating a knowledge of zoology and you may therefore fairly ask me for a more detailed and precise account of the manner in which i should propose to furnish you with the information i refer to  my own impression is that the best model for all kinds of training in physical science is that afforded by the method of teaching anatomy in use in the medical schools this method consists of three elementslectures demonstrations and examinations  the object of lectures is in the first place to awaken the attention and excite the enthusiasm of the student and this i am sure may be effected to a far greater extent by the oral discourse and by the personal influence of a respected teacher than in any other way secondly lectures have the double use of guiding the student to the salient points of a subject and at the same time forcing him to attend to the whole of it and not merely to that part which takes his fancy and lastly lectures afford the student the opportunity of seeking explanations of those difficulties which will and indeed ought to arise in the course of his studies  but for a student to derive the utmost possible value from lectures several precautions are needful  i have a strong impression that the better a discourse is as an oration the worse it is as a lecture the flow of the discourse carries you on without proper attention to its sense you drop a word or a phrase you lose the exact meaning for a moment and while you strive to recover yourself the speaker has passed on to something else  the practice i have adopted of late years in lecturing to students is to condense the substance of the hours discourse into a few dry propositions which are read slowly and taken down from dictation the reading of each being followed by a free commentary expanding and illustrating the proposition explaining terms and removing any difficulties that may be attackable in that way by diagrams made roughly and seen to grow under the lecturers hand in this manner you at any rate insure the cooperation of the student to a certain extent he cannot leave the lectureroom entirely empty if the taking of notes is enforced and a student must be preternaturally dull and mechanical if he can take notes and hear them properly explained and yet learn nothing  what books shall i read is a question constantly put by the student to the teacher my reply usually is none write your notes out carefully and fully strive to understand them thoroughly come to me for the explanation of anything you cannot understand and i would rather you did not distract your mind by reading a properly composed course of lectures ought to contain fully as much matter as a student can assimilate in the time occupied by its delivery and the teacher should always recollect that his business is to feed and not to cram the intellect indeed i believe that a student who gains from a course of lectures the simple habit of concentrating his attention upon a definitely limited series of facts until they are thoroughly mastered has made a step of immeasurable importance  but however good lectures may be and however extensive the course of reading by which they are followed up they are but accessories to the great instrument of scientific teachingdemonstration if i insist unweariedly nay fanatically upon the importance of physical science as an educational agent it is because the study of any branch of science if properly conducted appears to me to fill up a void left by all other means of education i have the greatest respect and love for literature nothing would grieve me more than to see literary training other than a very prominent branch of education indeed i wish that real literary discipline were far more attended to than it is but i cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there is a vast difference between men who have had a purely literary and those who have had a sound scientific training  seeking for the cause of this difference i imagine i can find it in the fact that in the world of letters learning and knowledge are one and books are the source of both whereas in science as in life learning and knowledge are distinct and the study of things and not of books is the source of the latter  all that literature has to bestow may be obtained by reading and by practical exercise in writing and in speaking but i do not exaggerate when i say that none of the best gifts of science are to be won by these means on the contrary the great benefit which a scientific education bestows whether as training or as knowledge is dependent upon the extent to which the mind of the student is brought into immediate contact with factsupon the degree to which he learns the habit of appealing directly to nature and of acquiring through his senses concrete images of those properties of things which are and always will be but approximatively expressed in human language our way of looking at nature and of speaking about her varies from year to year but a fact once seen a relation of cause and effect once demonstratively apprehended are possessions which neither change nor pass away but on the contrary form fixed centres about which other truths aggregate by natural affinity  therefore the great business of the scientific teacher is to imprint the fundamental irrefragable facts of his science not only by words upon the mind but by sensible impressions upon the eye and ear and touch of the student in so complete a manner that every term used or law enunciated should afterwards call up vivid images of the particular structural or other facts which furnished the demonstration of the law or the illustration of the term  now this important operation can only be achieved by constant demonstration which may take place to a certain imperfect extent during a lecture but which ought also to be carried on independently and which should be addressed to each individual student the teacher endeavouring not so much to show a thing to the learner as to make him see it for himself  i am well aware that there are great practical difficulties in the way of effectual zoological demonstrations the dissection of animals is not altogether pleasant and requires much time nor is it easy to secure an adequate supply of the needful specimens the botanist has here a great advantage his specimens are easily obtained are clean and wholesome and can be dissected in a private house as well as anywhere else and hence i believe the fact that botany is so much more readily and better taught than its sister science but be it difficult or be it easy if zoological science is to be properly studied demonstration and consequently dissection must be had without it no man can have a really sound knowledge of animal organization  a good deal may be done however without actual dissection on the students part by demonstration upon specimens and preparations and in all probability it would not be very difficult were the demand sufficient to organize collections of such objects sufficient for all the purposes of elementary teaching at a comparatively cheap rate even without these much might be effected if the zoological collections which are open to the public were arranged according to what has been termed the typical principle that is to say if the specimens exposed to public view were so selected that the public could learn something from them instead of being as at present merely confused by their multiplicity for example the grand ornithological gallery at the british museum contains between two and three thousand species of birds and sometimes five or six specimens of a species they are very pretty to look at and some of the cases are indeed splendid but i will undertake to say that no man but a professed ornithologist has ever gathered much information from the collection certainly no one of the tens of thousands of the general public who have walked through that gallery ever knew more about the essential peculiarities of birds when he left the gallery than when he entered it but if somewhere in that vast hall there were a few preparations exemplifying the leading structural peculiarities and the mode of development of a common fowl if the types of the genera the leading modifications in the skeleton in the plumage at various ages in the mode of nidification and the like among birds were displayed and if the other specimens were put away in a place where the men of science to whom they are alone useful could have free access to them i can conceive that this collection might become a great instrument of scientific education  the last implement of the teacher to which i have adverted is examinationa means of education now so thoroughly understood that i need hardly enlarge upon it i hold that both written and oral examinations are indispensable and by requiring the description of specimens they may be made to supplement demonstration  such is the fullest reply the time at my disposal will allow me to give to the questionhow may a knowledge of zoology be best acquired and communicated  but there is a previous question which may be moved and which in fact i know many are inclined to move it is the question why should training masters be encouraged to acquire a knowledge of this or any other branch of physical science what is the use it is said of attempting to make physical science a branch of primary education is it not probable that teachers in pursuing such studies will be led astray from the acquirement of more important but less attractive knowledge and even if they can learn something of science without prejudice to their usefulness what is the good of their attempting to instil that knowledge into boys whose real business is the acquisition of reading writing and arithmetic  these questions are and will be very commonly asked for they arise from that profound ignorance of the value and true position of physical science which infests the minds of the most highly educated and intelligent classes of the community but if i did not feel well assured that they are capable of being easily and satisfactorily answered that they have been answered over and over again and that the time will come when men of liberal education will blush to raise such questionsi should be ashamed of my position here tonight without doubt it is your great and very important function to carry out elementary education without question anything that should interfere with the faithful fulfilment of that duty on your part would be a great evil and if i thought that your acquirement of the elements of physical science and your communication of those elements to your pupils involved any sort of interference with your proper duties i should be the first person to protest against your being encouraged to do anything of the kind  but is it true that the acquisition of such a knowledge of science as is proposed and the communication of that knowledge are calculated to weaken your usefulness or may i not rather ask is it possible for you to discharge your functions properly without these aids  what is the purpose of primary intellectual education i apprehend that its first object is to train the young in the use of those tools wherewith men extract knowledge from the evershifting succession of phenomena which pass before their eyes and that its second object is to inform them of the fundamental laws which have been found by experience to govern the course of things so that they may not be turned out into the world naked defenceless and a prey to the events they might control  a boy is taught to read his own and other languages in order that he may have access to infinitely wider stores of knowledge than could ever be opened to him by oral intercourse with his fellow men he learns to write that his means of communication with the rest of mankind may be indefinitely enlarged and that he may record and store up the knowledge he acquires he is taught elementary mathematics that he may understand all those relations of number and form upon which the transactions of men associated in complicated societies are built and that he may have some practice in deductive reasoning  all these operations of reading writing and ciphering are intellectual tools whose use should before all things be learned and learned thoroughly so that the youth may be enabled to make his life that which it ought to be a continual progress in learning and in wisdom  but in addition primary education endeavours to fit a boy out with a certain equipment of positive knowledge he is taught the great laws of morality the religion of his sect so much history and geography as will tell him where the great countries of the world are what they are and how they have become what they are  without doubt all these are most fitting and excellent things to teach a boy i should be very sorry to omit any of them from any scheme of primary intellectual education the system is excellent so far as it goes  but if i regard it closely a curious reflection arises i suppose that fifteen hundred years ago the child of any welltodo roman citizen was taught just these same things reading and writing in his own and perhaps the greek tongue the elements of mathematics and the religion morality history and geography current in his time furthermore i do not think i err in affirming that if such a christian roman boy who had finished his education could be transplanted into one of our public schools and pass through its course of instruction he would not meet with a single unfamiliar line of thought amidst all the new facts he would have to learn not one would suggest a different mode of regarding the universe from that current in his own time  and yet surely there is some great difference between the civilization of the fourth century and that of the nineteenth and still more between the intellectual habits and tone of thought of that day and this  and what has made this difference i answer fearlesslythe prodigious development of physical science within the last two centuries  modern civilization rests upon physical science take away her gifts to our own country and our position among the leading nations of the world is gone tomorrow for it is physical science only that makes intelligence and moral energy stronger than brute force  the whole of modern thought is steeped in science it has made its way into the works of our best poets and even the mere man of letters who affects to ignore and despise science is unconsciously impregnated with her spirit and indebted for his best products to her methods i believe that the greatest intellectual revolution mankind has yet seen is now slowly taking place by her agency she is teaching the world that the ultimate court of appeal is observation and experiment and not authority she is teaching it to estimate the value of evidence she is creating a firm and living faith in the existence of immutable moral and physical laws perfect obedience to which is the highest possible aim of an intelligent being  but of all this your old stereotyped system of education takes no note physical science its methods its problems and its difficulties will meet the poorest boy at every turn and yet we educate him in such a manner that he shall enter the world as ignorant of the existence of the methods and facts of science as the day he was born the modern world is full of artillery and we turn out our children to do battle in it equipped with the shield and sword of an ancient gladiator  posterity will cry shame on us if we do not remedy this deplorable state of things nay if we live twenty years longer our own consciences will cry shame on us  it is my firm conviction that the only way to remedy it is to make the elements of physical science an integral part of primary education i have endeavoured to show you how that may be done for that branch of science which it is my business to pursue and i can but add that i should look upon the day when every schoolmaster throughout this land was a centre of genuine however rudimentary scientific knowledge as an epoch in the history of the country  but let me entreat you to remember my last words addressing myself to you as teachers i would say mere book learning in physical science is a sham and a delusionwhat you teach unless you wish to be impostors that you must first know and real knowledge in science means personal acquaintance with the facts be they few or many 2    footnote 1 a lecture delivered at the south kensington museum in 1861  footnote 2 it has been suggested to me that these words may be taken to imply a discouragement on my part of any sort of scientific instruction which does not give an acquaintance with the facts at first hand but this is not my meaning the ideal of scientific teaching is no doubt a system by which the scholar sees every fact for himself and the teacher supplies only the explanations circumstances however do not often allow of the attainment of that ideal and we must put up with the next best systemone in which the scholar takes a good deal on trust from a teacher who knowing the facts by his own knowledge can describe them with so much vividness as to enable his audience to form competent ideas concerning them the system which i repudiate is that which allows teachers who have not come into direct contact with the leading facts of a science to pass their secondhand information on the scientific virus like vaccine lymph if passed through too long a succession of organisms will lose all its effect in protecting the young against the intellectual epidemics to which they are exposed
