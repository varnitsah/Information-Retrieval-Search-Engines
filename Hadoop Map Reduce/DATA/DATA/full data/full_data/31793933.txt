women and a few from dramatic lyrics as first printed include some of brownings finest and most characteristic work in several of them the poet displays his familiarity with the life and spirit of the renaissancea period portrayed by him with a fidelity more real than historyfor he enters into the feelings that give rise to action while the historian is busied only with the results growing out of the moving force of feeling  the egotism of the ferrara husband outraged at the gentle wife because she is as gracious toward those who rendered her small courtesies and seemed as thankful to them as she was to him for his gift of a ninehundredyearsold name opens up for inspection the heart of a husband at a time when men exercised complete control over their wives and could satisfy their jealous selfish instincts by any cruel methods they chose to adopt with no one to say them nay the highly developed artistic sense shown by this husband is not incompatible with his consummate selfishness and cruelty as many tales of that time might be brought forward to illustrate the husband in the statue and the bust belongs to the same type and the situation there is the inevitable outcome of a civilization in which women were not consulted as to whom they would marry and naturally often fell a prey to love if it should come to them afterwards weakness of will in the case of the lovers in this poem wrecked their lives for they were not strong enough to follow either duty or love another glimpse is caught of this period when husbands and brothers and fathers meted out what they considered justice to the women in in a gondola the grammarians funeral gives also an aspect of renaissance lifethe fervor for learning characteristic of the earlier days of the renaissance when devoted pedants as arthur symons says in referring to this poem broke ground in the restoration to the modern world of the civilization and learning of ancient greece and rome again the heretics tragedy and holycross day picture most vividly the methods resorted to by the dying church in its attempts to keep control of the souls of a humanity seething toward religious tolerance  with only a small space at command it is difficult to decide on the poems to be touched upon especially where there is not one but would repay prolonged attention due no less to the romantic interest of the stories the marvellous penetration into human motives the grasp of historical atmospheres than to the originality and perfection of their artistry  a word must be said of the flight of the duchess and childe roland to the dark tower came both poems which have been productive of many commentaries and both holding their own amid the bray sic of critics as unique and beautiful specimens of poetic art certainly no two poems could be chosen to show wider diversity in the poets genius than these  the story told by the huntsman in the flight of the duchess is interesting enough simply as a story but the telling of it is inimitable one can see before him the devoted kindly man somewhat clumsy of speech as indicated by the rough rhymes and characteristically drawing his illustrations from the calling he follows keen in his critical observation of the duke and other members of the household he nevertheless has a tender appreciation of the difficulties of the young duchess in this unloving artificial environment  when the gypsy queen sings her song through his memory of it the rhymes and rhythm take on a befitting harmoniousness and smoothness contrasting finely with the remainder of the poem  by means of this song moreover the horizon is enlarged beyond the immediate ken of the huntsman the raceinstinct which has so strong a hold upon the gypsies is exalted into a wondrous sort of love which carries everything before it this loving reality is also set over against the unloving artificiality of the first part of the poem the temptation is too strong for the lovestarved little duchess and even the huntsman and jacinth come under her hypnotic spell  very different in effect is childe roland to the dark tower came the one rich in this lay of human emotion couched in the simple language of reality the other a symbolic picture of the struggle and aspiration of the soul interpreters have tried to pin this latter poem down to the limits of an allegory and find a specific meaning for every phrase and picture but it has too much the quality of the modern symbolistic writing to admit of any treatment so prosaic in this respect it resembles music each mind will draw from it an interpretation suited to its own attitude and experiences reduced to the simplest possible lines of interpretation it symbolizes the inevitable fate which drives a truthseeking soul to see the falsity of ideals once thought absolute yet in the face of the ruin of those ideals courage toward the continuance of aspiration is never for a moment lost  as a bit of art it is strikingly imaginative and suggests the picturequality of the tapestried horse which browning himself says was the chief inspiration of the poem it is a fine example of the way in which the strange and winged fancy of the poet may take its flight from so simple an object as this tapestried horse evidently a sorry beast too in its needled presentment or the poetic impulse would not have expressed itself in the vindictive i never saw a horse sic i hated so     incident of the french camp     i     you know we french stormed ratisbon            a mile or so away    on a little mound napoleon

seeming intention    of honoring her her faith that the trial by combat    between gauthier and gismond must end in gismonds    victory and her vindication reflects most truly as arthur    symons has

saw characteristic differences between these two poets of    the time are brought out the genuineness of courtly love    and chivalry is tested and to the original story of the glove    is added a new view of the ladys character a sketch of    her humbler and truer lover and their happiness and a    pendent scene showing the courtier de lorges having    won a beauty for his wife in the ignominious position of    assisting the king to enjoy her favors and of submitting to    pleasantries upon his discomfiture  the original story as    told by poullain de st croix in his essais historiques sur    paris ran thus one day whilst francis i amused himself    with looking at a combat between his lions a lady    having let her glove drop said to de lorges if you    would have me believe that you love me as much as you    swear you do go and bring back my glove  de lorges    went down picked up the glove from amidst the ferocious    beasts returned and threw it in the ladys face and in    spite of all her advances and cajoleries would never look    at her again  schiller running across this anecdote of    st croix in 1797 as he writes goethe wrote a poem    on it which adds nothing to the story leigh hunts    the glove and the lions adds some traits  it characterizes    the lady as shallow and vain with smiles and    eyes which always seemd the same  she calculates    since king ladies lovers all look on that the occasion    is divine to drop her glove and prove his love    then look at him and smile and after de lorges has    returned and thrown the glove but not with love right    in the ladys face hunt makes the king rise and swear    rightly done  no love quoth he but vanity sets love    a task like that this is the material browning worked    on he makes use of this speech of the kings but remodels    the ladys character wholly and gives her an appreciative    lover and also a keeneyed young poet to tell her    story afresh and to reveal through his criticism the narrowness    of the court and the court poets     12  naso  ovid  love of the classics and curiosity as    to human nature were both characteristic of peter ronsard    15241585 at one time page to

turned to him who spoke                             210    you saw waring truth or joke    in landtravel or seafaring     ii     we were sailing by triest    where a day or two we harboured    a sunset was in the west    when looking over the vessels side    one of our company espied    a sudden speck to larboard    and as a seaduck flies and swims    at once so came the light craft up                          220    with its sole lateen sail that trims    and turns the water round its rims    dancing as round a sinking cup    and by us like a fish it curled    and drew itself up close beside    its great sail on the instant furled    and oer its thwarts a shrill voice cried    a neck as bronzed as a lascars    buy wine of us you english brig    or fruit tobacco and cigars                                 230    a pilot for you to triest    without one look you neer so big    theyll never let you up the bay    we natives should know best    i turned and just those fellows way    our captain said the longshore thieves    are laughing at us in their sleeves     iii     in truth the boy leaned laughing back    and one halfhidden by his side    under the furled sail soon i spied                          240    with great grass hat and kerchief black    who looked up with his kingly throat    said somewhat while the other shook    his hair back from his eyes to look    their longest at us then the boat    i know not how turned sharply round    laying her whole side on the sea    as a leaping fish does from the lee    into the weather cut somehow    her sparkling path beneath our bow                            250    and so went off as with a bound    into the rosy and golden half    o the sky to overtake the sun    and reach the shore like the seacalf    its singing cave yet i caught one    glance ere away the boat quite passed    and neither time nor toil could mar    those features so i saw the last    of waringyou  oh never star    was lost here but it

friends of a man proud and sensitive who with    fine powers of intellect yet incurred somewhat of disdain    because of his failure to accomplish anything permanent    expression is given to the deep regret experienced by his    friends now that he has left them his absence having    brought them to a truer realization of his worth  if only    waring would come back the speaker at least would    give him the sympathy and encouragement he craved    instead of playing with his sensibilities as he had done    conjectures are indulged in as to warings whereabouts    the speaker prefers to think of him as back in london    preparing to astonish the world with some great masterpiece    in art music or literature   another speaker surprises all    by telling how he had seen the last of waring in a    momentary meeting at trieste but the first speaker is    certain that the star of waring is destined to rise again    above their horizon     1  waring  alfred domett born at camberwell    grove surrey may 20 1811 a friend of brownings    distinguished as a poet and as a colonial statesman and    ruler his first volume of poems was published in 1832    some verses of his in blackwoods 1837 attracted much    attention to him as a rising young poet  in 1841 he    was called to the bar and in 1841 went out to new    zealand among the earliest settlers  there he lived for    thirty years filling several important official positions    his unceremonious departure for new zealand with no    leavetakings was the occasion of brownings poem which    is said by mrs orr to give a lifelike sketch of dometts    character  his star did however rise again for his    english friends for he returned to london in 1871  the    year following saw the publication of his ranolf and    amohia a new zealand poem in the course of which    he characterizes browning as subtlest asserter of the    soul in song  he met browning again in london and    was one of the vicepresidents of the london browning    society  died nov12 1877     15  i left his arm that night myself  george w cooke    points out that in his living authors of england    thomas powell describes this incident the young author    mentioned being himself we have a vivid    recollection of the last time we saw him  it was at    an evening party a few days before he sailed from    england his intimate friend mr

  well any how here the story stays       so far at least as i understand    and robert browning you writer of plays       heres a subject made to your hand     notes      a light woman is the story of a dramatic situation brought      about by the speakers intermeddling to save his less      sophisticated friend from a light womans toils  he      deflects her interest and wins her heart and this is the      ironical outcome  his friendly dispassionate act makes him      seem to his friend a disloyal passions slave his scorn of      the light woman teaches him her genuineness and proves      himself lighter than she his futile assumption of the god      manoeuvring souls makes the whole story dramatically imply      in a way dear to brownings heart the sacredness and worth      of each individuality       i cannot agree with porter and clarkes estimate of the      speakers act as friendly dispassionate   they fail to      take into account his supercilious attitude toward the man      he calls his friend and he proves to be more selfserving      and more selfdeceivingthan they are willing to admit      that is why it is a subject made to brownings hand      transcriber of the pg

never spied            but when begins my ditty    almost five hundred years ago    to see the townsfolk suffer so            from vermin was a pity     ii             rats                                                  10    they fought the dogs and killed the cats            and bit the babies in the cradles    and ate the cheeses out of the vats            and licked the soup from the cooks own ladles    split open the kegs of salted sprats    made nests inside mens sunday hats    and even spoiled the womens chats            by drowning their speaking            with shrieking and squeaking    in fifty different sharps and flats                           20     iii     at last the people in a body            to the town hall came flocking    tis clear cried they our mayors a noddy            and as for our corporationshocking    to think we buy gowns lined with ermine    for dolts that cant or wont determine    whats best to rid us of our vermin    you hope because youre

at this the mayor and corporation    quaked with a mighty consternation     iv     an hour they sat in council            at length the mayor broke silence    for a guilder id my ermine gown sell            i wish i were a mile hence    its easy to bid one rack ones brain    im sure my poor head aches again                             40    ive scratched it so and all in vain    oh for a trap a trap a trap    just as he said this what should hap    at the chamber door but a gentle tap    bless us cried the mayor whats that    with the corporation as he sat    looking little though wondrous fat    nor brighter was his eye nor moister    than a toolongopened oyster    save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous                     50    for a plate of turtle green and glutinous    only a scraping of shoes on the mat    anything like the sound of a rat    makes my heart go pitapat     v     come in the mayor cried looking bigger    and in did come the strangest figure    his queer long coat from heel to head    was half of yellow and half of red    and he himself was tall and thin    with sharp blue eyes each like a pin                         60    and light loose hair yet swarthy skin    no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin    but lips where smiles went out and in    there was no guessing his kith and kin    and nobody could enough admire    the tall man and his quaint attire    quoth one its as my greatgrandsire    starting up at the trump of dooms tone    had walked this way from his painted tombstone     vi     he advanced to the counciltable                               70    and please your honours said he im able    by means of a secret charm to draw    all creatures living beneath the sun    that creep or swim or fly or run    after me so as you never saw    and i chiefly use my charm    on creatures that do people harm    the mole and toad and newt and viper    and people call me the pied piper    and here they noticed round his neck                          80            a scarf of red and yellow stripe    to match with his coat of the selfsame cheque            and at the scarfs end hung a pipe    and his fingers they noticed were ever straying    as if impatient to be playing    upon this pipe as low it dangled    over his vesture so oldfangled    yet said he poor piper as i am    in tartary i freed the cham            last june from his huge swarms of gnats              90    i eased in asia the nizam            of a monstrous brood of vampyrebats    and as for what your brain bewilders            if i can rid your town of rats    will you give me a thousand guilders    one fifty thousandwas the exclamation    of the astonished mayor and corporation     vii     into the street the piper stept            smiling first a little smile    as if he knew what magic slept                                100            in his quiet pipe the while    then like a musical adept    to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled    and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled    like a candleflame where salt is sprinkled    and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered    you heard as if an army muttered    and the muttering grew to a grumbling    and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling    and out of the houses the rats came tumbling                 110    great rats small rats lean rats brawny rats    brown rats black rats grey rats tawny rats    grave old plodders gay young friskers            fathers mothers uncles cousins    cocking tails and pricking whiskers            families by tens and dozens    brothers sisters husbands wives    followed the piper for their lives    from street to street he piped advancing    and step for step they followed dancing                      120    until they came to the river weser            wherein all plunged and perished    save one who stout as julius caesar    swam across and lived to carry            as he the manuscript he cherished    to ratland home his commentary    which was at the first shrill notes of the pipe    i heard a sound as of scraping tripe    and putting apples wondrous ripe    into a ciderpresss gripe                                   130    and a moving away of pickletubboards    and a leaving ajar of conservecupboards    and a drawing the corks of trainoilflasks    and a breaking the hoops of buttercasks    and it seemed as if a voice            sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery    is breathed called out oh rats rejoice            the world is grown to one vast drysaltery    so munch on crunch on take your nuncheon    breakfast supper dinner luncheon                         140    and just as a bulky sugarpuncheon    all ready staved like a great sun shone    glorious scarce an inch before me    just as methought it said come bore me    i found the weser roiling oer me     viii     you should have heard the hamelin people    ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple    go cried the mayor and get long poles    poke out the nests and block up the holes    consult with carpenters and builders                         150    and leave in our town not even a trace    of the ratswhen suddenly up the face    of the piper perked in the marketplace    with a first if you please my thousand guilders     ix     a thousand guilders the mayor looked blue    so did the corporation too    for council dinners made rare havoc    with claret moselle vindegrave hock    and half the money would replenish    their cellars biggest butt with rhenish                     160    this sum to a wandering fellow    with a gipsy coat of red and yellow    beside quoth the mayor with a knowing wink    our business was done at the rivers brink    we saw with our eyes the vermin sink    and whats dead cant come to life i think    so friend were not the folks to shrink    from the duty of giving you something for drink    and a matter of money to put in your poke    but as for the guilders what we spoke                        170    of them as you very well know was in joke    beside our losses have made us thrifty    a thousand guilders come take fifty     x     the pipers face fell and he cried    no trifling i cant wait beside    ive promised to visit by dinner time    bagdat and accept the prime    of the headcooks pottage all hes rich in    for having left in the caliphs kitchen    of a nest of scorpions no survivor                           180    with him i proved no bargaindriver    with you dont think ill bate a stiver    and folks who put me in a passion    may find me pipe after another fashion     xi     how cried the mayor dye think i brook    being worse treated than a cook    insulted by a lazy ribald    with idle pipe and vesture piebald    you threaten us fellow do your worst    blow your pipe there till you burst                         190     xii     once more he stept into the street            and to his lips again            laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane    and ere he blew three notes such sweet    soft notes as yet musicians cunning            never gave the enraptured air    there was a rustling that seemed like a bustling    of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling    small feet were pattering wooden shoes clattering    little hands clapping and little tongues chattering          200    and like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering    out came the children running    all the little boys and girls    with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls    and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls    tripping and skipping ran merrily after    the wonderful music with shouting and laughter     xiii     the mayor was dumb and the council stood    as if they were changed into blocks of wood    unable to move a step or cry                                 210    to the children merrily skipping by    could only follow with the eye    that joyous crowd at the pipers back    but how the mayor was on the rack    and the wretched councils bosoms beat    as the piper turned from the high street    to where the weser rolled its waters    right in the way of their sons and daughters    however he turned from south to west    and to koppelberg hill his steps addressed                   220    and after him the children pressed    great was the joy in every breast    he never can cross that mighty top    hes forced to let the piping drop    and we shall see our children stop    when lo as they reached the mountainside    a wondrous portal opened wide    as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed    and the piper advanced and the children followed    and when all were in to the very last                        230    the door in the mountainside shut fast    did i say all no one was lame            and could not dance the whole of the way    and in after years if you would blame            his sadness he was used to say    its dull in our town since my playmates left    i cant forget that im bereft    of all the pleasant sights they see    which the piper also promised me    for he led us he said to a joyous land                     240    joining the town and just at hand    where waters gushed and fruittrees grew    and flowers put forth a fairer hue    and everything was strange and new    the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here    and their dogs outran our fallow deer    and honeybees had lost their stings    and horses were born with eagles wings    and just as i became assured    my lame foot would be speedily cured                         250    the music stopped and i stood still    and found myself outside the hill    left alone against my will    to go now limping as before    and never hear of that country more     xiv     alas alas for hamelin            there came into many a burghers pate            a text which says that heavens gate            opes to the rich at as easy rate    as the needles eye takes a camel in                         260    the mayor sent east west north and south    to offer the piper by word of mouth            wherever it was mens lot to find him    silver and gold to his hearts content    if hed only return the way he went            and bring the children behind him    but when they saw twas a lost endeavour    and piper and dancers were gone for ever    they made a decree that lawyers never            should think their records dated duly                 270    if after the day of the month and year    these words did not as well appear    and so long after what happened here            on the twentysecond of july    thirteenhundred and seventysix    and the better in memory to fix    the place of the childrens last retreat    they called it the pied pipers street    where any one playing on pipe or tabor    was sure for the future to lose his labour                   280    nor suffered they hostelry or tavern            to shock with mirth a street so solemn    but opposite the place of the cavern            they wrote the story on a column    and on the great churchwindow painted    the same to make the world acquainted    how their children were stolen away    and there it stands to this very day    and i must not omit to say    that in transylvania theres a tribe                          290    of alien people who ascribe    the outlandish ways and dress    on which their neighbours lay such stress    to their fathers and mothers

aught let us keep our promise     notes    the pied piper of hamelin  this clever versification of    a wellknown tale was written for the little son of the    actor william macready  according to dr furnivall    the version used directly by browning is from the    wonders of the little world or a general history of    man by nathaniel wanley published in 1578  there    are however more incidents in common between the    poem and the version given by verstigan in his restitution    of decayed intelligence 1605  there are many    other sources for the story and it is not improbable that    browning knew more than one version  tales similar to    it occur also in persia and china  for its kinship to    myths of the wind as a musician and as a psychopomp or    leader of souls see

duchess     i     youre my friend            i was the man the duke spoke to            i helped the duchess to cast off his yoke too    so heres the tale from beginning to end    my friend     ii     ours is a great wild country            if you climb to our castles top            i dont see where your eye can stop    for when youve passed the cornfield country    where vineyards leave off flocks are packed                  10    and sheeprange leads to cattletract    and cattletract to openchase    and openchase to the very base    of the mountain where at a funeral pace    round about solemn and slow    one by one row after row    up and up the pinetrees go    so like black priests up and so    down the other side again            to another greater wilder country                    20    thats one vast red drear burntup plain    branched through and through with many a vein    whence irons dug and coppers dealt            look right look left look straight before    beneath they mine above they smelt            copperore and ironore    and forge and furnace mould and melt            and so on more and ever more    till at the last for a bounding belt            comes the salt sand hoar of the great sea shore        30    and the whole is our dukes country     iii     i was born the day this present duke was            and o says the song ere i was old    in the castle where the other duke was            when i was happy and young not old    i in the kennel he in the bower    we are of like age to an hour    my father was huntsman in that day    who has not heard my father say    that when a boar was brought to bay                          40    three times four times out of five    with his huntspear hed contrive    to get the killingplace transfixed    and pin him true both eyes betwixt    and thats why the old duke would rather    he lost a saltpit than my father    and loved to have him ever in call    thats why my father stood in the hall    when the old duke brought his infant out            to show the people and while they passed              50    the wondrous bantling round about            was first to start at the outside blast    as the kaisers courier blew his horn    just a month after the babe was born    and quoth the kaisers courier since    the duke has got an heir our prince            needs the dukes self at his side    the duke looked down and seemed to wince            but he thought of wars oer the world wide    castles afire men on their march                            60    the toppling tower the crashing arch            and up he looked and awhile he eyed    the row of crests and shields and banners    of all achievements after all manners            and ay said the duke with a surly pride            the more was his comfort when he died    at next years end in a velvet suit    with a gilt glove on his hand his foot    in a silken shoe for a leather boot    petticoated like a herald                                     70            in a chamber next to an anteroom            where he breathed the breath of page and groom            what he called stink and they perfume    they should have set him on red berold    mad with pride like fire to manage    they should have got his cheek fresh tannage    such a day as today in the merry sunshine    had they stuck on his fist a roughfoot merlin    hark the winds on the heath at its game    oh for a noble falconlanner                                   80    to flap each broad wing like a banner    and turn in the wind and dance like flame    had they broached a whitebeer cask from berlin    or if you incline to prescribe mere wine    put to his lips when they saw him pine    a cup of our own moldavia fine    cotnar for instance green as may sorrel    and ropy with sweetwe shall not quarrel     iv     so at home the sick tall yellow duchess    was left with the infant in her clutches                      90    she being the daughter of god knows who            and now was the time to revisit her tribe    abroad and afar they went the two            and let our people rail and gibe    at the empty hall and extinguished fire            as loud as we liked but ever in vain    till after long years we had our desire            and back came the duke and his mother again     v     and he came back the pertest little ape    that ever affronted human shape                              100    full of his travel struck at himself            youd say he despised our bluff old ways    not he for in paris they told the elf            our rough north land was the land of lays            the one good thing left in evil days    since the midage was the heroic time            and only in wild nooks like ours    could you taste of it yet as in its prime            and see true castles with proper towers    younghearted women oldminded men                          110    and manners now as manners were then    so all that the old dukes had been without knowing it    this duke would fain know he was without being it    twas not for the joys self but the joy of his showing it    nor for the prides self but the pride of our seeing it    he revived all usages thoroughly wornout    the souls of them fumedforth the hearts of them tornout    and chief in the chase his neck he perilled    on a lathy horse all legs and length    with blood for bone all speed no strength                  120    they should have set him on red berold    with the red eye slow consuming in fire    and the thin stiff ear like an abbeyspire     vi     well such as he was he must marry we heard    and out of a convent at the word    came the lady in time of spring    oh old thoughts they cling they cling    that day i know with a dozen oaths    i clad myself in thick huntingclothes    fit for the chase of urochs or buffle                         130    in wintertime when you need to muffle    but the duke had a mind we should cut a figure            and so we saw the lady arrive    my friend i have seen a white crane bigger            she was the smallest lady alive    made in a piece of natures madness    too small almost for the life and gladness            that overfilled her as some hive    out of the bears reach on the high trees    is crowded with its safe merry bees                          140    in truth she was not hard to please    up she looked down she looked round at the mead    straight at the castle thats best indeed    to look at from outside the walls    as for us styled the serfs and thralls    she as much thanked me as if she had said it            with her eyes do you understand    because i patted her horse while i led it            and max who rode on her other hand    said no bird flew past but she inquired                      150    what its true name was nor ever seemed tired    if that was an eagle she saw hover    and the green and grey bird on the field was the plover    when suddenly appeared the duke            and as down she sprung the small foot pointed    on to my handas with a rebuke            and as if his backbone were not jointed    the duke stepped rather aside than forward            and welcomed her with his grandest smile            and mind you his mother all the while               160    chilled in the rear like a wind to norward    and up like a weary yawn with its pullies    went in a shriek the rusty portcullis    and like a glad sky the northwind sullies    the ladys face stopped its play    as if her first hair had grown grey    for such things must begin some one day     vii     in a day or two she was well again    as who should say you labour in vain    this is all a jest against god who meant                     170    i should ever be as i am content    and glad in his sight therefore glad i will be    so smiling as at first went she     viii     she was active stirring all fire    could not rest could not tire    to a stone she might have given life            i myself loved once in my day    for a shepherds miners huntsmans wife            i had a wife i know what i say    never in all the world such an one                           180    and here was plenty to be done    and she that could do it great or small    she was to do nothing at all    there was already this man in his post            this in his station and that in his office    and the dukes plan admitted a wife at most            to meet his eye with the other trophies    now outside the hall now in it            to sit thus stand thus see and be seen    at the proper place in the proper minute                     190            and die away the life between    and it was amusing enough each infraction            of rulebut for aftersadness that came    to hear the consummate selfsatisfaction            with which the young duke and the old dame    would let her advise and criticise    and being a fool instruct the wise            and childlike parcel out praise or blame    they bore it all in complacent guise    as though an artificer after contriving                      200    a wheelwork image as if it were living    should find with delight it could motion to strike him    so found the duke and his mother like him    the lady hardly got a rebuff    that had not been contemptuous enough    with his cursed smirk as he nodded applause    and kept off the old mothercats claws     ix     so the little lady grew silent and thin            paling and ever paling    as the way is with a hid chagrin                             210            and the duke perceived that she was ailing    and said in his heart tis done to spite me    but i shall find in my power to right me    dont swear friend the old one many a year    is in hell and the dukes self you shall hear     x     well early in autumn at first winterwarning    when the stag had to break with his foot of a morning    a drinkinghole out of the fresh tender ice    that covered the pond till the sun in a trice    loosening it let out a ripple of gold                       220            and another and another and faster and faster    till dimpling to blindness the wide water rolled            then it so chanced that the duke our master    asked himself what were the pleasures in season            and found since the calendar bade him be hearty    he should do the middle age no treason            in resolving on a huntingparty    always provided old books showed the way of it            what meant old poets by their strictures    and when old poets had said their say of it                  230            how taught old painters in their pictures    we must revert to the proper channels    workings in tapestry paintings on panels    and gather up woodcrafts authentic traditions    here was food for our various ambitions    as on each case exactly stated            to encourage your dog now the properest chirrup            or best prayer to saint hubert on mounting your stirrup    we of the household took thought and debated    blessed was he whose back ached with the jerkin               240    his sire was wont to do forestwork in    blesseder he who nobly sunk ohs    and ahs while he tugged on his grandsires trunkhose    what signified hats if they had no rims on            each slouching before and behind like the scallop            and able to serve at sea for a shallop    loaded with lacquer and looped with crimson    so that the deer now to make a short rhyme ont            what with our venerers prickers and verderers       250            might hope for real hunters at length and not murderers    and oh the dukes tailor he had a hot time ont     xi     now you must know that when the first dizziness            of flaphats and buffcoats and jackboots subsided            the duke put this question the dukes part provided    had not the duchess some share in the business    for out of the mouth of two or three witnesses    did he establish all fitorunfitnesses    and after much laying of heads together    somebodys cap got a notable feather    by the announcement with proper unction                       260    that he had discovered the ladys function    since ancient authors gave this tenet            when horns wind a mort and the deer is at siege    let the dame of the castle prick forth on her jennet            and with water to wash the hands of her liege    in a clean ewer with a fair toweling    let her preside at the disemboweling    now my friend if you had so little religion            as to catch a hawk some falconlanner            and thrust her broad wings like a banner              270    into a coop for a vulgar pigeon    and if day by day and week by week            you cut her claws and sealed her eyes    and clipped her wings and tied her beak            would it cause you any great surprise    if when you decided to give her an airing    you found she needed a little preparing    i say should you be such a curmudgeon    if she clung to the perch as to take it in dudgeon    yet when the duke to his lady signified                      280    just a day before as he judged most dignified    in what a pleasure she was to participate            and instead of leaping wide in flashes            her eyes just lifted their long lashes    as if pressed by fatigue even he could not dissipate    and duly acknowledged the dukes forethought    but spoke of her health if her health were worth aught    of the weight by day and the watch by night    and much wrong now that used to be right    so thanking him declined the hunting                      290    was conduct ever more affronting    with all the ceremony settled            with the towel ready and the sewer            polishing up his oldest ewer            and the jennet pitched upon a piebald            blackbarred creamcoated and pink eyeballed    no wonder if the duke was nettled    and when she persisted nevertheless    well i suppose heres the time to confess    that there ran half round our ladys chamber                  300    a balcony none of the hardest to clamber    and that jacynth the tirewoman ready in waiting     stayed in call outside what need of relating    and since jacynth was like a june rose why a fervent    adorer of jacynth of course was your servant    and if she had the habit to peep through the casement            how could i keep at any vast distance            and so as i say on the ladys persistence    the duke dumbstricken with amazement    stood for a while in a sultry smother                        310            and then with a smile that partook of the awful    turned her over to his yellow mother            to learn what was held decorous and lawful    and the mother smelt blood with a catlike instinct    as her cheek quick whitened thro all its quincetinct    oh but the lady heard the whole truth at once    what meant shewho was sheher duty and station    the wisdom of age and the folly of youth at once            its decent regard and its fitting relation    in brief my friend set all the devils in hell free          320    and turn them out to carouse in a belfry    and treat the priests to a fiftypart canon    and then you may guess how that tongue of hers ran on    well somehow or other it ended at last    and licking her whiskers out she passed    and after hermaking he hoped a face            like emperor nero or sultan saladin    stalked the dukes self with the austere grace            of ancient hero or modern paladin    from door to staircaseoh such a solemn                      330    unbending of the vertebral column     xii     however at sunrise our company mustered            and here was the huntsman bidding unkennel    and there neath his bonnet the pricker blustered            with feather dank as a bough of wet fennel    for the courtyard walls were filled with fog    you might have cut as an axe chops a log    like so much wool for colour and bulkiness    and out rode the duke in a perfect sulkiness    since before breakfast a man feels but queasily             340            and a sinking at the lower abdomen            begins the day with indifferent omen    and lo as he looked around uneasily    the sun ploughed the fog up and drove it asunder    this way and that from the valley under            and looking through the courtyard arch    down in the valley what should meet him            but a troop of gipsies on their march    no doubt with the annual gifts to greet him     xiii     now in your land gipsies reach you only                    350            after reaching all lands beside    north they go south they go trooping or lonely            and still as they travel far and wide    catch they and keep now a trace here a trace there    that puts you in mind of a place here a place there    but with us i believe they rise out of the ground    and nowhere else i take it are found    with the earthtint yet so freshly embrowned    born no doubt like insects which breed on    the very fruit they are meant to feed on                     360    for the earthnot a use to which they dont turn it            the ore that grows in the mountains womb            or the sand in the pits like a honeycomb    they sift and soften it bake it and burn it    whether they weld you for instance a snaffle    with sidebars never a brute can baffle    or a lock thats a puzzle of wards within wards    or if your colts forefoot inclines to curve inwards    horseshoes they hammer which turn on a swivel    and wont allow the hoof to shrivel                          370    then they cast bells like the shell of the winkle    that keep a stout heart in the ram with their tinkle    but the sandthey pinch and pound it like otters    commend me to gipsy glassmakers and potters    glasses theyll blow you crystalclear    where just a faint cloud of rose shall appear    as if in pure water you dropped and let die    a bruised blackblooded mulberry    and that other sort their crowning pride    with long white threads distinct inside                      380    like the lakeflowers fibrous roots which dangle    loose such a length and never tangle    where the bold swordlily cuts the clear waters    and the cuplily couches with all the white daughters    such are the works they put their hand to    the uses they turn and twist iron and sand to    and these made the troop which our duke saw sally    toward his castle from out of the valley    men and women like newhatched spiders    come out with the morning to greet our riders                390    and up they wound till they reached the ditch    whereat all stopped save one a witch    that i knew as she hobbled from the group    by her gait directly and her stoop    i whom jacynth was used to importune    to let that same witch tell us our fortune    the oldest gipsy then above ground    and sure as the autumn season came round    she paid us a visit for profit or pastime    and every time as she swore for the last time              400     and presently she was seen to sidle    up to the duke till she touched his bridle    so that the horse of a sudden reared up    as under its nose the old witch peered up    with her wornout eyes or rather eyeholes            of no use now but to gather brine            and began a kind of level whine    such as they used to sing to their viols    when their ditties they go grinding    up and down with nobody minding                               410    and then as of old at the end of the humming    her usual presents were forthcoming    a dogwhistle blowing the fiercest of trebles    just a seashore stone holding a dozen fine pebbles    or a porcelain mouthpiece to screw on a pipeend    and so she awaited her annual stipend    but this time the duke would scarcely vouchsafe            a word in reply and in vain she felt            with twitching fingers at her belt            for the purse of sleek pinemartin pelt              420    ready to put what he gave in her pouch safe    till either to quicken his apprehension    or possibly with an afterintention    she was come she said to pay her duty    to the new duchess the youthful beauty    no sooner had she named his lady    than a shine lit up the face so shady    and its smirk returned with a novel meaning    for it struck him the babe just wanted weaning    if one gave her a taste of what life was and sorrow          430    she foolish today would be wiser tomorrow    and who so fit a teacher of trouble    as this sordid crone bent wellnigh double    so glancing at her wolfskin vesture            if such it was for they grow so hirsute            that their own fleece serves for natural fursuit    he was contrasting twas plain from his gesture    the life of the lady so flowerlike and delicate    with the loathsome squalor of this helicat    i in brief was the man the duke beckoned                    440            from out of the throng and while i drew near    he told the croneas i since have reckoned            by the way he bent and spoke into her ear    with circumspection and mystery    the main of the ladys history    her frowardness and ingratitude    and for all the crones submissive attitude    i could see round her mouth the loose plaits tightening    and her brow with assenting intelligence brightening            as though she engaged with hearty goodwill            450            whatever he now might enjoin to fulfil    and promised the lady a thorough frightening     and so just giving her a glimpse    of a purse with the air of a man who imps    the wing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw            he bade me take the gipsy mother            and set her telling some story or other    of hill or dale oakwood or fernshaw    to wile away a weary hour    for the lady left alone in her bower                         460    whose mind and body craved exertion    and yet shrank from all better diversion     xiv     then clapping heel to his horse the mere curveter            out rode the duke and after his hollo    horses and hounds swept huntsman and servitor            and back i turned and bade the crone follow    and what makes me confident whats to be told you            had all along been of this crones devising    is that on looking round sharply behold you            there was a novelty quick as surprising              470    for first she had shot up a full head in stature            and her step kept pace with mine nor faltered    as if age had foregone its usurpature            and the ignoble mien was wholly altered    and the face looked quite of another nature    and the change reached too whatever the change meant    her shaggy wolfskin cloaks arrangement    for where its tatters hung loose like sedges    gold coins were glittering on the edges    like the bandroll strung with tomans                         480    which proves the veil a persian womans    and under her brow like a snails horns newly            come out as after the rain he paces    two unmistakeable eyepoints duly            live and aware looked out of their places    so we went and found jacynth at the entry    of the ladys chamber standing sentry    i told the command and produced my companion    and jacynth rejoiced to admit any one    for since last night by the same token                      490    not a single word had the lady spoken    they went in both to the presence together    while i in the balcony watched the weather     xv     and now what took place at the very first of all    i cannot tell as i never could learn it    jacynth constantly wished a curse to fall    on that little head of hers and burn it    if she knew how she came to drop so soundly            asleep of a sudden and there continue    the whole time sleeping as profoundly                         500            as one of the boars my father would pin you    twixt the eyes where life holds garrison    jacynth forgive me the comparison    but where i begin my own narration    is a little after i took my station    to breathe the fresh air from the balcony    and having in those days a falcon eye    to follow the hunt thro the open country            from where the bushes thinlier crested    the hillocks to a plain wheres not one tree                510            when in a moment my ear was arrested    bywas it singing or was it saying    or a strange musical instrument playing    in the chamberand to be certain    i pushed the lattice pulled the curtain    and there lay jacynth asleep    yet as if a watch she tried to keep    in a rosy sleep along the floor    with her head against the door    while in the midst on the seat of state                     520    was a queenthe gipsy woman late    with head and face downbent    on the ladys head and face intent    for coiled at her feet like a child at ease    the lady sat between her knees    and oer them the ladys clasped hands met    and on those hands her chin was set    and her upturned face met the face of the crone    wherein the eyes had grown and grown    as if she could double and quadruple                          530    at pleasure the play of either pupil            very like by her hands slow fanning    as up and down like a gorcrows flappers    they moved to measure or bellclappers            i said is it blessing is it banning    do they applaud you or burlesque you            those hands and fingers with no flesh on    but just as i thought to spring in to the rescue            at once i was stopped by the ladys expression    for it was life her eyes were drinking                        540    from the crones wide pair above unwinking    lifes pure fire received without shrinking    into the heart and breast whose heaving    told you no single drop they were leaving    life that filling her passed redundant    into her very hair back swerving    over each shoulder loose and abundant            as her head thrown back showed the white throat curving    and the very tresses shared in the pleasure    moving to the mystic measure                                 550    bounding as the bosom bounded    i stopped short more and more confounded    as still her cheeks burned and eyes glistened    as she listened and she listened    when all at once a hand detained me    the selfsame contagion gained me    and i kept time to the wondrous chime    making out words and prose and rhyme    till it seemed that the music furled            its wings like a task fulfilled and dropped          560            from under the words it first had propped    and left them midway in the world    word took word as hand takes hand    i could hear at last and understand    and when i held the unbroken thread    the gipsy said    and so at last we find my tribe            and so i set thee in the midst    and to one and all of them describe            what thou saidst and what thou didst                 570    our long and terrible journey through    and all thou art ready to say and do    in the trials that remain    i trace them the vein and the other vein    that meet on thy brow and part again    making our rapid mystic mark            and i bid my people prove and probe            each eyes profound and glorious globe    till they detect the kindred spark    in those depths so dear and dark                             580    like the spots that snap and burst and flee    circling over the midnight sea    and on that round young cheek of thine            i make them recognize the tinge    as when of the costly scarlet wine            they drip so much as will impinge    and spread in a thinnest scale afloat    one thick gold drop from the olives coat    over a silver plate whose sheen    still thro the mixture shall be seen                        590    for so i prove thee to one and all            fit when my people ope their breast    to see the sign and hear the call            and take the vow and stand the test            which adds one more child to the rest    when the breast is bare and the arms are wide    and the world is left outside     for there is probation to decree    and many and long must the trials be    thou shalt victoriously endure                               600    if that brow is true and those eyes are sure    like a jewelfinders fierce assay            of the prize he dug from its mountain tomb    let once the vindicating ray            leap out amid the anxious gloom    and steel and fire have done their part    and the prize falls on its finders heart    so trial after trial past    wilt thou fall at the very last    breathless half in trance                                    610    with the thrill of the great deliverance            into our arms for evermore    and thou shalt know those arms once curled            about thee what we knew before    how love is the only good in the world    henceforth be loved as heart can love    or brain devise or hand approve    stand up look below    it is our life at thy feet we throw    to step with into light and joy                              620    not a power of life but we employ    to satisfy thy natures want    art thou the tree that props the plant    or the climbing plant that seeks the tree    canst thou help us must we help thee    if any two creatures grew into one    they would do more than the world has done    though each apart were never so weak    ye vainly through the world should seek    for the knowledge and the might                               630    which in such union grew their right    so to approach at least that end    and blendas much as may be blend    thee with us or us with thee    as climbing plant or propping tree    shall some one deck thee over and down            up and about with blossoms and leaves    fix his hearts fruit for thy garlandcrown            cling with his soul as the gourdvine cleaves    die on thy boughs and disappear                               640    while not a leaf of thine is sere    or is the other fate in store    and art thou fitted to adore    to give thy wondrous self away    and take a stronger natures sway    i foresee and could foretell    thy future

where the haters meet    in the crowded citys horrible street    or thou step alone through the morass    where never sound yet was    save the dry quick clap of the storks bill    for the air is still and the water still    when the blue breast of the dipping coot    dives under and all is mute    so at the last shall come old age    decrepit as befits that stage                                670    how else wouldst thou retire apart    with the hoarded memories of thy heart    and gather all to the very least    of the fragments of lifes earlier feast    let fall through eagerness to find    the crowning dainties yet behind    ponder on the entire past    laid together thus at last    when the twilight helps to fuse    the first fresh with the faded hues                          680    and the outline of the whole    as round eves shades their framework roll    grandly fronts for once thy soul    and then as mid the dark a gleam            of yet another morning breaks    and like the hand which ends a dream    death with the might of his sunbeam            touches the flesh and the soul awakes    then                    ay then indeed something would happen            but what for here her voice changed like a birds   690            there grew more of the music and less of the words    had jacynth only been by me to clap pen    to paper and put you down every syllable            with those clever clerkly fingers            all ive forgotten as well as what lingers    in this old brain of mine thats but ill able    to give you even this poor version            of the speech i spoil as it were with stammering            more fault of those who had the hammering            of prosody into me and syntax                         700            and did it not with hobnails but tintacks     but to return from this excursion    just do you mark when the song was sweetest    the peace most deep and the charm completest    there came shall i say a snap            and the charm vanished            and my sense returned so strangely banished    and starting as from a nap    i knew the crone was bewitching my lady    with jacynth asleep and but one spring made i                710    down from the casement round to the portal            another minute and i had entered    when the door opened and more than mortal            stood with a face where to my mind centred    all beauties i ever saw or shall see    the duchess i stopped as if struck by palsy    she was so different happy and beautiful            i felt at once that all was best            and that i had nothing to do for the rest    but wait her commands obey and be dutiful                   720    not that in fact there was any commanding            i saw the glory of her eye    and the brows height and the breasts expanding            and i was hers to live or to die    as for finding what she wanted    you know god almighty granted    such little signs should serve wild creatures            to tell one another all their desires            so that each knows what his friend requires    and does its bidding without teachers                        730    i preceded her the crone    followed silent and alone    i spoke to her but she merely jabbered            in the old style both her eyes had slunk            back to their pits her stature shrunk            in short the soul in its body sunk    like a blade sent home to its scabbard    we descended i preceding    crossed the court with nobody heeding    all the world was at the chase                               740    the courtyard like a desertplace    the stable emptied of its small fry    i saddled myself the very palfrey    i remember patting while it carried her    the day she arrived and the duke married her    and do you know though its easy deceiving    oneself in such matters i cant help believing    the lady had not forgotten it either    and knew the poor devil so much beneath her    would have been only too glad for her service                 750    to dance on hot ploughshares like a turk dervise    but unable to pay proper duty where owing    was reduced to that pitiful method of showing it    for though the moment i began setting    his saddle on my own nag of berolds begetting    not that i meant to be obtrusive            she stopped me while his rug was shifting            by a single rapid fingers lifting    and with a gesture kind but conclusive    and a little shake of the head refused me                  760    i say although she never used me    yet when she was mounted the gipsy behind her    and i ventured to remind her    i suppose with a voice of less steadiness            than usual for my feeling exceeded me    something to the effect that i was in readiness            whenever god should please she needed me    then do you know her face looked down on me    with a look that placed a crown on me    and she felt in her bosommark her bosom                  770    and as a flowertree drops its blossom    dropped me ah had it been a purse    of silver my friend or gold thats worse    why you see as soon as i found myself            so understoodthat a true heart so may gain            such a rewardi should have gone home again    kissed jacynth and soberly drowned myself    it was a little plait of hair            such as friends in a convent make            to wear each for the others sake                  780    this see which at my breast i wear    ever did rather to jacynths grudgment    and ever shall till the day of judgment    and thenand thento cut shortthis is idle            these are feelings it is not good to foster    i pushed the gate wide she shook the bridle            and the palfrey boundedand so we lost her     xvi     when the liquors out why clink the cannikin    i did think to describe you the panic in    the redoubtable breast of our master the mannikin            790    and what was the pitch of his mothers yellowness            how she turned as a shark to snap the sparerib            clean off sailors say from a pearldiving carib    when she heard what she called the flight of the feloness    but it seems such childs play    what they said and did with the lady away    and to dance on when weve lost the music    always made meand no doubt makes yousick    nay to my mind the worlds face looked so stern    as that sweet form disappeared through the postern           800    she that kept it in constant good humour    it ought to have stopped there seemed nothing to do more    but the world thought otherwise and went on    and my heads one that its spite was spent on    thirty years are fled since that morning    and with them all my heads adorning    nor did the old duchess die outright    as you expect of suppressed spite    the natural end of every adder    not suffered to empty its poisonbladder                     810    but she and her son agreed i take it    that no one should touch on the story to wake it    for the wound in the dukes pride rankled fiery    so they made no search and small inquiry    and when fresh gipsies have paid us a visit ive    notice the couple were never inquisitive    but told them theyre folks the duke dont want here    and bade them make haste and cross the frontier    brief the duchess was gone and the duke was glad of it            and the old one was in the young ones stead         820            and took in her place the households head    and a blessed time the household had of it    and were i not as a man may say cautious    how i trench more than needs on the nauseous    i could favour you with sundry touches    of the paintsmutches with which the duchess    heightened the mellowness of her cheeks yellowness    to get on faster until at last her    cheek grew to be one masterplaster    of mucus and fucus from mere use of ceruse                   830    in short she grew from scalp to udder    just the object to make you shudder     xvii     youre my friend    what a thing friendship is world without end    how it gives the heart and soul a stirup            as if somebody broached you a glorious runlet            and poured out all lovelily sparklingly sunlit    our green moldavia the streaky syrup    cotnar as old as the time of the druids    friendship may match with that monarch of fluids             840    each supples a dry brain fills you its insandouts    gives your lifes hourglass a shake when the thin sand doubts    whether to run on or stop short and guarantees    age is not all made of stark sloth and arrant ease    i have seen my little lady once more            jacynth the gipsy berold and the rest of it    for to me spoke the duke as i told you before            i always wanted to make a clean breast of it    and now it is madewhy my hearts blood that went trickle            trickle but anon in such muddy driblets            850    is pumped up brisk now through the main ventricle            and genially floats me about the giblets     ill tell you what i intend to do    i must see this fellow his sad life through    he is our duke after all    and i as he says but a serf and thrall    my father was born here and i inherit            his fame a chain he bound his son with    could i pay in a lump i should prefer it            but theres no mine to blow up and get done with     860    so i must stay till the end of the chapter    for as to our middleagemannersadapter    be it a thing to be glad on or sorry on    some day or other his head in a morion    and breast in a hauberk his heels hell kick up    slain by an onslaught fierce of hiccup    and then when red doth the sword of our duke rust    and its leathern sheath lie oergrown with a blue crust    then i shall scrape together my earnings            for you see in the churchyard jacynth reposes      870            and our children all went the way of the roses    its a long lane that knows no turnings    one needs but little tackle to travel in            so just one stout cloak shall i indue    and for a staff what beats the javelin            with which his boars my father pinned you    and then for a purpose you shall hear presently            taking some cotnar a tight plump skinful    i shall go journeying who but i pleasantly            sorrow is vain and despondency sinful                880    whats a mans age he must hurry more thats all            cram in a day what his youth took a year to hold            when we mind labour then only were too old    what age had methusalem when he begat saul    and at last as its haven some buffeted ship sees         come all the way from the northparts with sperm oil            i hope to get safely out of the turmoil    and arrive one day at the land of the gipsies    and find my lady or hear the last news of her    from some old thief and son of lucifer                       890    his forehead chapleted green with wreathy hop    sunburned all over like an aethiop    and when my cotnar begins to operate    and the tongue of the rogue to run at a proper rate    and our wineskin tight once shows each flaccid dent    i shall drop in withas if by accident    you never knew then how it all ended    what fortune good or bad attended    the little lady your queen befriended    and when thats told me whats remaining                  900    this worlds too hard for my explaining    the same wise judge of matters equine            who still preferred some slim fouryearold            to the bigboned stock of mighty berold    and for strong cotnar drank french weak wine    he also must be such a ladys scorner            smooth jacob still robs homely esau            now up now down the worlds one seesaw    so i shall find out some snug corner    under a hedge like orson the woodknight                    910    turn myself round and bid the world good night    and sleep a sound sleep till the trumpet blowing

triumph of a    free and loving life over a cold and conventional one    the dukes huntsman frees his mind to his friend as to his    part in the escape of the gladsome ardent young duchess    from the blighting yoke of a husband whose life consisted    in imitating defunct mediaeval customs  an old gipsy is    the agency that awakens her to the joy and freedom of    love  her mystic chant and charm claim the duchess as    the true heir of gipsy blood thrill her with life halfhypnotize    the huntsman too and seem to transform the gipsy    crone herself into an eastern queen  he helps them off    and looks for no better future when the dukes death releases    him than to travel to the land of the gipsies and hear the last    news of his lady             the poem grew from the fancies

gregory xvi abolished this bad business of the sermon    r b      notes    holycross day reflects the attitude of the corrupt mediaeval    christians and jews toward each other  the prose    preceding the poem gives the point of view of an imaginary    bishops secretary who congratulates himself upon    the good work the church is doing in forcing its doctrine    on the jews in the holycross day sermon and effecting    many conversions  the poem shows that the jews regard    this solicitude on the part of the christians with hatred    and scorn and that their conversions are in derision of    their wouldbe converters the sarcasm of the speaker    reaches a pinnacle of bitterness when he accuses the    christian bishops of being men he had helped to their sins    and who now help him to their god from scorn toward    such followers of christ he passes in the contemplation    of rabbi ben ezras death song to a defence of christ    against these followers who profess but do not act his    precepts and a hope that if the jews were mistaken in    not accepting christ the tortures they now suffer will be    received as expiation for their sin             holycross day is september 14

him as one who awakes    the past was a sleep and her life began                      30     now love so ordered for both their sakes    a feast was held that selfsame night    in the pile which the

bridal pair     face to face the lovers stood    a single minute and no more    while the bridegroom bent as a man subdued     bowed till his bonnet brushed the floor    for the duke on the lady a kiss conferred    as the courtly custom was of yore     in a minute can lovers exchange a word    if a word did pass which i do not think                      50    only one out of the thousand heard     that was the bridegroom  at days brink    he and his bride were alone at last    in a bedchamber by a tapers blink     calmly he said that her lot was cast    that the door she had passed was shut on her    till the final catafalk repassed     the world meanwhile its noise and stir    through a certain window facing the east    she could watch like a convents chronicler                   60

lady ages ago     that night the duke said dear or cheap    as the cost of this cup of bliss may prove    to body or soul i will drain it deep     and on the morrow bold with love    he beckoned the bridegroom close on call    as his duty bade by the dukes alcove                        90     and smiled twas a very funeral    your lady will think this feast of ours    a shame to efface whateer

creates the characters and the    situation and dramatically represents a story which is based    on a florentine tradition that duke ferdinand i placed    his equestrian statue in the piazza dell annunziata so that    he might gaze forever towards the old riccardi palace    where a lady he loved was imprisoned by her jealous husband    the bride and her ducal lover are seen exchanging    their first looks through which they perceive the genuineness    of their love and the temporizing of each is presented    through which for the sake of petty conveniences    they submit to be thwarted by the wary husband and to    have the end they count supreme delayed until love and    youth have gone and the best left them is the artificial    gaze interchanged by a bronze statue in the square and
